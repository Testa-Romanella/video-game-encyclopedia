The gameplay closely resembles the same of Quake with minor differences in weaponry. For instance, the iconic Half-Life crowbar is used instead of Quake&#39;s axe.</p>\n<p>Deathmatch Classic physics is similar to Quake and allows the players to traverse at high speeds using bunnyhopping because of game engines similarities. However, the game speed in Deathmatch Classic is slower than in Quake. </p>\n<p>There is no loadout system in the game, so the players have to pick up weapons that are scattered across the map and vary from the default shotgun to a rocket launcher, a taser, and a powerful beam weaponry. </p>\n<p>There are also three kinds of bonuses in the game which grant players special abilities such as invincibility, invisibility or quad damage for a short amount of time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2001-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T21:07:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b04/b042f8a7d3d9f8fe61d5af5d47ab6088.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.75, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 206, "owned": 3825, "beaten": 53, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 130, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 248, "suggestions_count": 212, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 249, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Valve Software"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Valve"], "esrb_rating": null}
