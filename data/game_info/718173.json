It's your job to use element based attacks to defeat enemies as they try to drain the world of its color. Your abilities aren't only used for defeating enemies, you can also use them to solve puzzles and help you restore the color back in the world. You must seek out the mushrooms of life and restore their color thus restoring the color to that area.  Can you locate all of the mushrooms and save the world from becoming colorless?<h3>WHAT'S THE BACKGROUND?</h3>Gaia, the soul of the world, rises from below the ground. Throughout time she has always taken on vastly different forms,  sometimes it was a destructive hurricane or beautiful rainbow after a gentle rainstorm. However, Gaia\u2019s world is in danger and almost devoid of color. So she decided to take on the form of a brushling, which is a powerful fairy. As she lies there after rising up from the ground she sees a single clumping of flowers starting to lose color and reaches for them to bring them back to life. The ground itself seems to remain unchanged for now, but the life from it has become colorless, despite the moon being changed to an eerie blue color. <br/><br/><br/>As the once grey and beautiful moon moves over the landscape the evil Mageling uses it as a conduit to take the color out of the plants and objects. With Gaias uncanny ability to color the world around her, time is of the essence and the plants must be restored back to their original color before the moon does one full rotation. By restoring the color the real reason for the lack of color is revealed; The Shapelings are taking over, fueled by the Magelings colorless curse. Shapelings take on any form in their environment; they can hide in plain sight and are fierce, strong enemies, Gaia must traverse the landscape finding ways to change the colorless plants and objects back to their original color and defeat the Mageling and his minions before the moon's final rotation.<h3>CONTROL THE ELEMENTS</h3>As you restore color to the world throughout your journey you'll unlock abilities that coordinate with the terrain you're in.
