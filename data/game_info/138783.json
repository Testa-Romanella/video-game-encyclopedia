This job is easy and high-paying.\r\n</p>\n<p>I hope you will be able to work within three days. If you cannot work for some reason, please contact us as soon as possible and explain the situation.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Want to convey</strong></p>\n<p>Maybe work, so boring, like my life.</p>\n<p>This game is not a game. Initially, the idea about it came from my favorite game : The Stanley Parable.\r\n</p>\n<p>In The Stanley Parable, Stanley is employee 427.</p>\n<p>In the game, when they described Stanley's work, they said:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nStanley works for a company in a building. He is employee 427.\r\nThe work of employee 427 was simple: Sitting at the desk and pressing the button on the keyboard.\r\nThe display will tell him the instructions: what button to press, how long to press, in what order.\r\nThis is the day-to-day, year-on-year work of employee 427, although others think this work is boring.\r\nBut Stanley enjoys the timing of each command, as if he were born for this work.\r\nStanley is happy.\r\n\n<p>I would love to know if a person's job is to press a specific key on the keyboard, How long can he persist? Will he be happy, or will he be mad, still thinking, or just looking at the screen?\r\n</p>\n<p>Then the work of employee 427 was born!\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>At present, the game is still under development. There is a preliminary demo that you can try.\r\n</p>\n<p>In this preliminary little demo, I tried hard to shape the process of employee No. 427's entry to work.\r\n</p>\n<p>It took me a long time to implement it. Although this experience is very short, I think it is worth it.\r\n</p>\n<p>Welcome to play~ Also look forward to your feedback~\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Supports English language and Chinese language.<br/></p>\n<p>(AND: My English is very poor, so if you can't read it, please let me know. thank you very much!)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c0/2c07db800e83ca89063b9fc3185c5a71.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xujiang"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
