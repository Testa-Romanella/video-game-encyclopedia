Test your skill by how many sectors can you clear in a row.</p>\r\nThe Controls\r\n<p>Navigate the menus using you arrow keys. X or Z confirms your selection.</p>\n<p>While in game, use the arrow keys to fire your thrusters (until you run out of fuel). X brings up the map, which shows you the planet you need to make your way to, as well as where you are in relation to it.</p>\n<p>The game plays fine with gamepads. It will not play very well on phones as there are some sound issues.\u00a0</p>\r\nThe Jam\r\n<p>This game was\u00a0made for Cartridge Jam 3, Hosted by\u00a0Dallas Society Of Play. The beautiful\u00a0cartridge art that inspired this game was made by Ben Hopkins.</p>\n<p>This was my first ever game jam as well as the first game I've ever made. If you enjoyed it or have some feedback, please don't hesitate to post your thoughts below.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T07:14:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f58/f582bc182b84a7e623bd8bfc1fede3de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["PoodlePilot"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
