The Inca road is a 1st person road building action game in which the goal is to connect it all with the great road. You are but a mere worker in the midst of it all, fending off the most dangerous of wildlife: The Alpaca.</p>\n<p>Find the Idols and let them work for your resources, or make them fend off the forces of Alpacan evil\u00a0while you make your way to connect all of the villages. You must manage all and command them like a true architect.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The world is one influenced by the Inca civilization, esploring everything and everywhere, from the Mountain to the Amazon, maybe even encountering the new People's from a whole different land on the way. Only one thing is sure though, that is that all roads must lead to Cuzco<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T07:12:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/495/4958ddcef3110fc4f195516c9eb307c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gonzaloarts"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
