The bandits will randomly attack (listen for the music cue) and its up to you to save your animals and crops.</p>\n<p>We ended up treating the whole thing like a compo in a few ways which I always find is the better way to go about a LD! That is, we made everything you see in the game over the 72 hours - no foundation code or previously designed assets at all - even all of the music was made over the weekend!</p>\n<p>Main Game Development by: Alex Delderfield (ADEdge) &amp; Joel Harvey</p>\n<p>Music by Christiaan Bakker Sheep model by Aimee Corriea And Ryan Darkstar did some writing for us!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T07:12:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/688/68840b8a485ac5c2b02bf8d70bd8d2c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alex_ADEdge"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
