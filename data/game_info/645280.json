My first favorite game I think would be the Hobbit Lego Ps4 game, I mean, it combined my two favorite things, building legos and the hobbit franchise, how could I not love it? I am half black and half Chinese, so I really try to implement diversity into the games I make, it always saddens me when I see games that I love not have characters who I can identify with, or portray them in humiliating ways. I started programming in 4th grade, and have loved it ever since! I hope to be able to push for equity and inclusion in the game industry when I am older and I cannot wait to see more girls in STEM quite literally changing the game.\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T06:12:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62c/62c31a364844a23deee17c1f2ebb2de0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Girls Make Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
