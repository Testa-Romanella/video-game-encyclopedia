Each round, the players are given a real headline with a missing part they need to fill using randomly selected phrases taken from other headlines. The resulting Fake News are then shown to everyone along with the real headline mixed in and players vote on which is the real one. You get points for voting correctly, but you get more points for fooling others with your headline! Your vote is shown in real time to other players so there is\u00a0 some room for mind games...</p>\n<p><strong>Installation Instructions:</strong> This is a Discord Bot so you cannot simply download and play it.
