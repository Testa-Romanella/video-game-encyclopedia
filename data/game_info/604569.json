{"id": 604569, "slug": "camp-delta", "name": "Camp Delta", "name_original": "Camp Delta", "description": "<p>Camp Delta is an action adventure game set in a future where Human Civilization has moved beyond Earth, and have set up colonies far beyond the reaches of the Solar System. The game revolves around the central mystery of a loss of communication from several research camps from one of the planets Humans have been investigating, and you have been sent as a recon unit to figure out the cause of the lapse in communication. What you uncover, is a plan decades in the making, and it will change the Human Civilization for years to come. <br/></p>\n\n<p>This game is part of a project being developed under a course offered by MSU. For the purposes of the project, I am listing some of the features that I custom built for this project below:</p>\n<ol><li><strong>Creative Changes:\u00a0</strong><ol><li>Wrote, created and   implemented the entire narrative for the game. This includes the custom   storyboards that the player will find as he/she progresses through the  game and scrip.</li><li>Created an entire dialogue system from scratch, which is capable of displaying relevant dialogues at necessary points in the game. The dialogues are displayed as part of the UI, thus maintaining immersion. I also wrote all the dialogues.</li><li>Wrote an entire system to aid in creating scripted set pieces, thus enabling a more diverse gameplay experience. </li><li>Created a cinematic for the Main Menu page which plays in the background.</li></ol>\n</li><li><strong>Gameplay Changes:</strong><ol><li>Created several new environment prefabs to bring diversity to the game's aesthetic:\u00a0<ol><li>Research Stations\u00a0</li><li>Field Research Unit </li><li>Signposts</li><li>Arch Gateways</li><li>Central Hub (main room + destroyed hallways + modified floor and roof lighting and custom tables as props)</li><li>Broken Outer Walls </li><li>Energy Walls</li><li>Level 2 Platform</li><li>A tall version of the cactus plant</li></ol></li><li>Created Destructible Environments which change dynamically on being shot at.\u00a0</li><li>Created a custom Audio triggering system, to play different music in different parts of a level. </li><li>Created damaging environmental hazards like the Energy Wall, which deal damage to the player on contact.</li></ol>\n</li><li><strong>UI Changes:</strong>\u00a0<ol><li>Reworked all the menus, changed the font and the general aesthetic of the menus.</li><li>Created a \"Retry Level\" Button on all levels.\u00a0 \r\n</li><li>Updated the UI on all levels to now display the objective on the top right of the screen. This\u00a0is\u00a0dynamically\u00a0updated\u00a0as\u00a0the\u00a0player\u00a0progresses through\u00a0a\u00a0level.</li><li>\u00a0Added a dialogue section to the in-game UI, which dynamically updates the dialogues at the bottom of the page.</li><li>Main Menu UI has been completely overhauled, including a cinematic that now plays in the background with custom audio instead of a still image.</li></ol></li></ol>\n\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Game designed and developed by: <strong>Janmejay Chakravarty<br/></strong></li><li>Custom Audio courtesy of <strong>Future Ramen</strong>, who put up these amazing soundtracks on the Unity Asset Store for free, so do go and check it out. His tracks are also available on Spotify, so definitely go support his work if you like the soundtracks.\u00a0</li><li>Custom Skyboxes thanks to <strong>Avionix</strong>, who had an amazing Skybox pack on the Unity Asset store. Really breathed new life into the project.</li><li>Standard Environment assets provided by<strong> MSU<br/></strong></li><li>Special thanks to <strong>Brackeys</strong> and <strong>GMTK</strong>, they are amazing channels on YouTube and definitely worth subscribing if you're into game dev. </li></ul>\n\n<p>This game started off as a simple course project, but evolved into something so much more, allowing me to explore Game development in a way I haven't before. Unfortunately, because of certain unforeseen pandemic related issues in the family, I could not give the project the time it deserved, and thus I'm releasing only this beta version as of now. The full game will be released, sometime near mid-July, allowing me to fix the bugs I'm aware of, complete the story properly, and make sure that the game provides an exciting gaming experience.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Having said this, I am aware that this game is not a finished product, and while it doesn't have any game breaking bugs(it does have bugs, you'll get the pun when you play), it does still have issues. So to anyone who plays, if you find any bug that I haven't listed here, please let me know by commenting down below, or reaching out to me. It will help me improve the final experience for you. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Currently known bugs:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<ol><li>Lighting can be a bit wonky in some areas, I'm working on it</li><li>Level 2 has a dialogue appear multiple times in some cases</li><li>The custom background music can overlap, thus providing a jarring switch from one track to another sometimes</li><li>If you decide to jump over the high mountains in the game, the game will break, taking you through an interesting journey of falling into vast, empty space. You'll have to restart the level by exiting to the Main Menu if this happens, but I can assure you that unless you set out to do it, I've made sure this will never happen. Not much of a fix, I know, and I'll come up with a solution.\u00a0</li><li>There's a section in Level 2 where you have to climb the central platform. Since there's no real climbing mechanic in the game, the pillars are designed such that you can jump onto them and climb to platform by repeatedly jumping. Not the most creative of solutions, and I'll fix the environment to make it possible to avoid this jumping jack solution to climbing. </li></ol>\n<p>And with the longest game description you would've ever read done, I lastly, but most importantly thank you, the player, for playing the game, as that is what game dev is all about, The Player.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enjoy the game, stay safe, and have a great day.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T06:15:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dcd/dcde032574b78c530c9054588152eb22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Janmejay Chakravarty"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
