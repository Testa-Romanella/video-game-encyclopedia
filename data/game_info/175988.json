The idea was that you'd be able to arrange a couple of dolls from your doll collection on the little stage, together with one or more props, and say NOW in order to see a short scene involving those characters and scenes. Props would specify themes and subject matter for the scene.</p><p>I gave up when other projects consumed my attention, and when I realized that I was going to require an almost unfathomable amount of content to build this the way I wanted to. If I were going to try again now, I would manage it very differently, using more advanced procedural generation techniques to combine elements. And some of these notions have since been done much better (not to mention actually *finished*) in Aaron Reed and Jacob Garbe's Ice-Bound Concordance.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["emshort"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
