Many social bridge players are new to the game or are more casual about their bridge than club players.<br/>In social bridge, many of the contracts reached may be trivial or impossible, reducing the enjoyment of playing. Bridge Bid Assist helps ensure that social players reach better contracts. <br/>Bridge Bid Assist is used at the table during the first few rounds of bidding and  makes it possible to have fun playing bridge with complete beginners, casual players and older children.<br/>Bridge Bid Assist includes a tutorial, quiz and solo bidding practice system to help you hone your bidding skills whenever you have a few minutes to spare.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:32:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/674/674ba79f59554baaf3a2917a688e68c9.jpg", "website": "http://jakad.net", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Jakad"], "genres": ["Card"], "publishers": ["Jakad"], "esrb_rating": null}
