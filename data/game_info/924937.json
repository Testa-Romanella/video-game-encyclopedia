Part of tree planting is kicking the spot,, digging, and planting the tree - all\u00a0phases we represent as\u00a0little mini games. <br/><br/>You start at the work truck, and about\u00a020 or so trees away, there another work truck (the finish line). You need to get there quickly or the bear will get you!</p>\n<p>You get 15 points for hitting the 'perfect' (green) middle spot and 5 points for the two 'good' zones. As you hit 'perfect' or 'good', you build up a Combo.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once you get to the end, or click outside the 'perfect'/'good' zones, your score will tally based on Combo/Points.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Try to click (mouse-click/tap) when the need is in the\u00a0the Green or Blue Zones.\u00a0</li><li>If you click in the\u00a0Red zone your combo will end, but you can try again.</li><li>If the bear catches you, you lose.</li><li>If you get to the Tree\u00a0Truck at the far right zone, you win.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>First time doing all of our own coding, music, art, and sound.</li><li>Stoked that we kept the scope tight, still work we could have added more polish.</li><li>This is me and my friends second game jam, and stoked to do more.</li><li>Open to feedback, and screenshots of high scores!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T18:46:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/801/801d1fc2aace45460015600b4bf29c42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Quoclon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
