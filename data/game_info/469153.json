But the signal you send is constantly getting lost and distorted, so the robot is getting out of control with every key you press.<br/></p>\n<p>Here's a couple of <strong>SPOILERS</strong> in case my teach-through-level-design attempt failed:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you press a key, it stays pressed forever. You can press multiple keys to move diagonally (e.g. right and up). Opposite keys cancel each other (e.g. if both left and right are pressed, the robot won't move horizontally).<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Albert L Chang - sounds and music</li><li>Muzammil syed - levels</li><li>RedTeapot (me) - idea, code, graphics, levels</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T03:04:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96a/96a526949ded173ee65d208ee75e1186.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RedTeapot"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
