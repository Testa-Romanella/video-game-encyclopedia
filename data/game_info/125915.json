{"id": 125915, "slug": "doggo-kyle-gordon", "name": "Doggo (Kyle Gordon)", "name_original": "Doggo (Kyle Gordon)", "description": "<p>Doggo is a game inspired by my own experiences having a young and destructive dog. It features a main menu and 4 levels, each more difficult than the last. You play as Doggo,  a black Labrador Pup, whose only purpose in life is to scoot around on the floor and destroy all of the socks he can find. </p>\n<p>Each level is setup the same way, It was my initial intention to have 4 distinctly different rooms each representing a different part of a house, but I felt like it would be a better idea to develop the gameplay a bit more instead. Anyway, each Room/Level features one or more human that will patrol around the room randomly. The player must avoid the humans sight when holding onto a sock otherwise they will chase after them to try and put them outside. socks are scattered across the floor in set positions for each stage and so to complete a stage each one must be destroyed. </p>\n<p>I really enjoyed making this game, right from the beginning I knew this would be a very fun and interesting project. I managed to redeem myself over the last few projects by making something that I actually am proud of. It has working 3D model Animations, a good soundtrack(Credit goes to Kevin MacLeod), more than one level, a main menu and an actual Lose/win state. </p>\n<p>If I was to do any more I would create more assets and possibly add more sound effects, right now it is really bland and repetitive. If I was able to I would make additional items like a towel or a shoe with different durability and maybe a more in-depth scoring system that includes losing points every time you are captured. But overall I'm very happy with what I was able to produce in only a few weeks.</p>\n<p>thanks for reading</p>\n<p><strong>Odyssey Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</strong><br/><strong>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</strong><br/><strong>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a26/a26b86779ad8060bf3dc49e7d694369d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kyle Gordon"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
