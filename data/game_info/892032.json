I am not affiliated with the Denver Museum of Nature and Science in any way and this project is completely unofficial.<br/></p>\n<p>How to use:</p>\n<p>1. Download the APK file.</p>\n<p>2. Install the APK (Allowing unknown sources if applicable)</p>\n<p>3. Download either the PDF or the JPG of the map, they are the same.</p>\n<p>4. Print out the map or bring it up on another device.<br/></p>\n<p>5. Open the app.<br/></p>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<p>This was tested on a Samsung Galaxy S10+ so it may have performance issues on phones with lesser power<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T08:39:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/567/567dd7d03a502565dfb655675129e12b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Radio Sparks"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
