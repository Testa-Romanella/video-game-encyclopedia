{"id": 732836, "slug": "open-pixel-puzzles", "name": "Open Pixel Puzzles", "name_original": "Open Pixel Puzzles", "description": "<p><em>Open Pixel Puzzles</em> is a free pixel art jigsaw puzzle game. Whether you're a fan of pixel art looking for an excuse to examine pieces up close or a jigsaw puzzle fan looking for a digital option, <em>Open Pixel Puzzles</em> aims to please.</p>\n<p><strong>The game is still in an early WIP state, with only 1 puzzle available. The demo is still fully-playable and well polished though, give it a shot!</strong></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Currently this game can only be operated with the mouse:</p>\n<ul><li>Left Click &amp; Drag: Pick up a piece or group of connected pieces, release to drop</li><li>Right Click &amp; Drag: Pick up a single piece (breaking any connections it has), release to drop</li><li>Scroll Wheel: Zoom in / out</li></ul>\n<p>When the puzzle area is larger than the window, you can also pan the view by clicking and dragging the middle mouse button.<br/></p>\n<p>More control options will be added in future releases.</p>\r\nLong-Term Goals\r\n<p>Since this game is still WIP, there's a lot that I'd like to add to it. I can make no guarantees, but here are some of the things I'd currently like to add in future releases:</p>\n<ul><li>Many more puzzles (of course)</li><li>Support for more advanced puzzle types. Circular puzzles, shaped puzzles, funky piece shapes, compound puzzles, animated puzzles...</li><li>Piece organization tools</li><li>Autosave</li><li>A built-in puzzle creator allowing players to create and share their own puzzles</li><li>Support for UI skins / resource packs</li><li>Keyboard and gamepad controls</li><li>Mobile / tablet support</li></ul>\r\nHow Free Is This Game?\r\n<p>These days, it's common to see \"Free\" games that are making money through ads, data collection, micro-transactions, etc. <em>Open Pixel Puzzles</em> is not one of those games. This game is a labor of love, created purely for others to enjoy. There is no revenue model at all, just fun to be had.</p>\n<p>Moreover, <em>Open Pixel Puzzles</em> isn't just free to download and play--this game's code and assets are available for use under open licenses, making it a piece of <em>free culture</em>. You are encouraged to share this game, mod it, or use any piece of it you need elsewhere... The project can be found at https://gitlab.com/Df458/open-pixel-puzzles, along with more detailed licenses for each of its component parts. You don't have to, but I'd love to hear from you if you use this in your own project!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T04:05:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f4/7f4b94b00a3ff81f3f0ae8aaaa88c531.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Hugues Ross"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
