{"id": 756247, "slug": "the-spirit-itch-dark-faction-games", "name": "The Spirit (itch) (Dark Faction Games)", "name_original": "The Spirit (itch) (Dark Faction Games)", "description": "<p>One thing that I tried to focus on was to have NPC characters explain or tell little bits of the story. So, even though it is not necessary always for completing a level, the players might find it useful and hopefully interesting to chat to the NPC characters!</p>\n<p>Some NPC characters will be able to join you and help you fight your way through hoards of enemies. It will be your task to help heal them. Use TAB to check health and descriptions of enemies. The game features branching dialogue, so if an NPC offers to help you, it is possible to decline his offer.</p>\n<p><strong>Environments:</strong></p>\n<p>Environments range from mystical forests, dark dungeons, villages, caves and citadels. The goal was to create \"pretty\", yet dark and gloomy environments for players to explore. There is even a haunted cemetery with massive hoards of enemies to slash down.</p>\n<p><strong>Items:</strong></p>\n<p>There are many items in the game that players can collect in various ways. Find useful items in loot chests or crates throughout the levels. Players can also buy from items from merchants. Some items can be used as powerups when equipped in the character inventory. There are also many weapons to find in the game, however, the player can only have 1 weapon at a time.</p>\n<p><strong>Crafting:</strong></p>\n<p>Along with many items available within the game for players to find in loot chests or crates, there will be items that will be useful in other ways. These seemingly useless items can be taken to a Crafting Altar. Players can then summon potions, weapons or useful items in a random fashion.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T10:52:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e73/e731d4f80e5e4f2ca1515f1b0de355f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 401, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dark Faction Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
