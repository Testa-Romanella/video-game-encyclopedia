Become a Bee Leader and help the bees fill their hives with honey.</p>\n<p>Fly around the world and hover over flowers to collect nectar. Look out for enemies and bad weather! Collect as much nectar as you can before the sun sets. The faster you get nectar back to your hive the more honey you'll make! Pick up plenty of bonuses along the way - nectar, honey, time, and bee buddies. The more bee buddies you find, the more nectar you'll collect. More nectar means more honey - sweet!</p>\n<p>To climb up the Bee Leader ranks fly through different worlds making honey - Just Desert, Country Life, City Heights, Island Time, London Fun and Climate Change. Each world has different obstacles, enemies, flowers, bonuses to break open and other fun interactive goodies. Some worlds are small, others are big, and there's a few surprises along the way.</p>\n<p>Control your bee using your preferred method: keyboard, mouse, touch or gamepad.</p>\n<p>Get busy!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Official Trailer</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay Trailer</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong><br/>- available for Mac, iOS &amp; Android<br/>- beautiful design &amp; illustration<br/>- high-resolution textures on supported Macs<br/>- 19 levels over 6 different worlds<br/>- cool flight model &amp; fun physics<br/>- great interactive sound<br/>- supports keyboard, mouse or touch controls<br/>- supports PS3 Wireless controllers via Bluetooth<br/>- supports some gamepads, wired XBox controllers<br/>- pesky hornets</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Music</strong><br/>After extremely limited popular demand, you can download the Bee Leader soundtrack free for personal use.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/>Bee Leader<br/>A Flightless Production<br/>by Greg Harding, John O'Reilly and Ali Teo.<br/></p>\n<p>http://beeleader.com<br/>http://twitter.com/flightlessnz<br/>http://www.flightless.co.nz</p>\n<p>Made using Cocos2d/Box2d/ObjectAL/Freesound.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee8/ee8aab078e54705145086d985978d922.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Flightless"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
