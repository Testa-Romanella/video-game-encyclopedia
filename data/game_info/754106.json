Fly corvette class warships, customize your load-outs, and do battle against opposing forces where ship positioning matters.</p>\n<p><em>A-Spec First Assault is in an open playtest.\u00a0Join the community on Discord\u00a0</em><em>with like-minded players and share feedback with the Dev.</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Keep your enemy against your strongest side while you attack their weakest.</strong><br/>All warships use a quadrant damage model covering the front, right, rear, left sides. Positioning your ship is just as important to protect yourself as it is in attacking your target's weak sides.<br/><br/><strong>Familiar present-day weaponry</strong><br/>The majority of weaponry available will be familiar to present-day and mountable on turrets with limited firing arcs.<br/><br/><strong>Prestige</strong><br/>Prestige Points are the main currency used to purchase new ships, weapons, and modules upgrades. Earn Prestige by completing mission objectives, taking down opponents, and avoiding damage to your ship's hull.<br/><br/><strong>Warship Customization</strong><br/>Customize your ship's weaponry with a range of projectile and missile turrets. Turrets slots have a maximum supported size and fitting the biggest guns in each slot is not an option.<br/><br/>Enhance the abilities of your warship by fitting modules. Modules will have an impact on offensive and defensive ship systems and are crucial for gaining an advantage during a fight.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T14:14:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/437/437c9269bd27671d913f256fbc2a8c04.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["centaurianmudpig"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
