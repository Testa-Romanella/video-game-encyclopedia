The theme of the contest was to create an homage to a member of the OHRRPGCE community. I chose Charbile, who's been a great inspiration to me when it comes to putting heart and love into games. If this game and its content makes no sense to you, this is why.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>This game is a top down hack-n-slash. Use your abilities wisely to avoid the mass of bullets that enemies spew all over the screen.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>You have melee attacks!\u00a0(Z) These don't deal much damage but are useful while your ranged ammo is reloading.\u00a0</li><li>You have ranged attacks! (X) They deal more damage than melee attacks, but after you use up your ammo, it takes some time to reload. (When using a controller, you can hold L2 to hold still and aim without moving.)</li><li>You can dash! (LShift) You move twice as fast, and take no damage while dashing. You only have 2 charges that each take a moment to recover, so don't overuse it!</li><li>You can cry! (C) This move is actually pretty useless. While crying, you take no damage, but you also can't move.</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>You can upgrade various stats by defeating enemies, and this can increase your damage, movement speed, or recharge/reload rate.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Note:\u00a0The game has only been thoroughly tested with a PlayStation 5 controller. Other gamepads should work, but may have mapping issues.\u00a0</em><br/></p>\nThe Code is Free to Steal!\r\n<p>That's right! You can go ahead on over to the GitHub repository and clone it to your heart's content. Here's the catch, though:\u00a0This game was made using the OHRRPGCE and programmed in its scripting language, hspeak. Also, I\u00a0wrote most of it in a fugue state while trying to come up with new puns on the name Charbile, so good luck finding any of it useful!\r\n</p>\n<p>https://github.com/knemeth/CharbHatAdventure\r\n</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T20:58:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d87/d8776e664a0d43c1083b01add01f7333.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["onehundredthousand"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
