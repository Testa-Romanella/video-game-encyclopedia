Each turn you are either able to move some troops (never leaving less than one in a planet) or pass your turn.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The planet information is shown on the left pane and includes info like maximum population capacity, growth and defense.</p>\n<p>I was able to create 2 levels into the game, so when you beat the first one your are propped to the second. When you beat the second one you go back to the first (Maybe to replay it?!)</p>\n\n<p>Game was created using Game\u00a0Maker 1.4 and all assets, excluding the background/SFX music, were created by myself.</p>\n<p>Background music is by:\u00a0http://www.johnleonardfrench.co.uk/</p>\n<p>SFX come from a\u00a0Universal Sound FX bundle that I\u00a0bought some time ago.</p>\n<p>With the rest of my free time I\u00a0make videos teaching how to make similar games @Youtube, check my channel out:</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjUT5k8man6zvIM6NXBxo_g</p>\n<p>I\u00a0truly hope you have fun playing it!
