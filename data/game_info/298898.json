The theme was 'Cycles', which inspired me to build a world where everything cycles around you!<br/></p>\n<br/>Goal of the game:\r\n<p>- Beat a level by reaching the center of the circle.</p>\n<p>- Avoid the red lines: they will kill you.</p>\n<p>- Beat the game by completing 20 levels. Upload your best time! Best developer time: 01:40.47, try to beat it ;-)<br/></p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Spacebar - Launch the player forward</p>\n<p>Esc - Back to menu</p>\n<p>R - Restart the game</p>\n\r\nDisclaimer/warning:\r\n<p>This game contains a lot of flashing lights, and fast movement.
