The box can be used both as a platform for you to jump off of, as well as a shield to protect you from enemies. The game requires skill and precision. However, most of the levels have multiple solutions and the game always lets you take a step back to figure out the most optimal path.<h3>Features </h3><ul><li> Over 50 unique and challenging levels.<br/></li><li> 6 different areas, each with their own soundtrack.<br/></li><li> Blue blobs.<br/></li><li> Red blobs.<br/></li><li> A boy.<br/></li><li> A box.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T16:42:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/464/464ef6d39ec9cb407248f02bf573e2cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 1, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Gustav Almstr\u00f6m"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Gustav Almstr\u00f6m"], "esrb_rating": null}
