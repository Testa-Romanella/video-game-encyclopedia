You play as a wizard who is delving into ancient dungeons to find relics of the past to add to his collection.</p>\n<p>It was made by me and two fellow students as part of our System Design exam in our second year of Game Design studies.\u00a0My main focus was on the dungeon generation itself, while the others worked on the attack system and the spell combination system.</p>\n<p>The project wouldn't be done in time if not for the efforts of\u00a0https://twitter.com/sharafaldin_, who persevered side-by-side with me as the deadline approached.</p>\n<p><strong>How much content is there?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>There are three floors with different enemies and items to find.\u00a0The goal of the game is to acquire all the items in the game, through exploring, killing bosses and combining items in the inventory.</p>\n<p><strong>Is it a finished game?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>It's more a 'rough prototype', put together over many sleepless nights before our deadline. As a result, the game may be unstable or bugged at times. If you experience a bug that's game-breaking, feel free to alert me.</p>\n<p>That being said, it's something we're happy we were able to put together, and hope others enjoy playing it :)</p>\n<p><strong>Extra credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>The music that plays when\u00a0you defeat the last boss was made by Alexandr Zhelanov\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/open-the-gate</li><li>The combat music is from the pack Action Music Mega Pack\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/music/action-music-mega-pack-98319</li><li>The music that plays when you die is by Christopher Baklid\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/christopherbaklid/cold-kings-1?in=christopherbaklid/sets/emotional-themes-pack-1-for-the-unity-asset-store</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6f/c6f63dc7c86e3ffc0ae9840e05403ad6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VoicesFromTheDark"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
