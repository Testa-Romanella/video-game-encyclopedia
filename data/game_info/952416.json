My goal is to create the ultimate fangame/engine for Plants VZ Zombies that combines the first 2 games and adds new content. It has a 24 sun meta, plants from both games and Different worlds. I\u00a0also added new worlds, plants and zombies. The game is still in develepment and Feedback is the best way of helping speed things up. Not only does it give me information, but it is the biggest thing that motivates me. I\u00a0will be occasionally updating this with a devlog about new features.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T08:03:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d5/6d54246cbd4b9e6fd9a0c9598cda30cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MarioMan98"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
