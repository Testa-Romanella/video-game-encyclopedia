It's a platformer, but you rotate the whole map to move. Hence the name, \"Right Round\".<br/>Like, you know. The song.\u00a0 But, the good one.</p>\n<p>Kinda sad that the idea wasn't as original as I thought, but I had fun making it so\u00a0meh<br/>whatever</p>\n<p>You can expect minimalism, dogs, red spinny things and a world that kinda looks like a weird platforming version of Plato's Cave.<br/></p>\n<p>All I know is that to me,\u00a0this game looks like (maybe?) lots of fun.
