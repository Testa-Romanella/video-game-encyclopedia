I saw that #loadingjam was going on and decided to create a new menu and loading screen for a project I recently made. </p><p>The main premise is that you are a knight and you want to rescue people and things (usually princes and princesses) that have been captured and imprisoned in these towers. I'm going to keep updating it in the future, and there's not much to the game as of yet, since Ive just been working on systems, but let me know what you guys think of the loading screen and the game itself!</p><p>Music was done by Chris Walasek</p><p>Art and Programming done by me, Edil Ostolaza</p><p>Concepts and Ideas from Trace Gordon and Gannon Jaspering</p><p>You can follow me on twitter or visit my website for more info:</p><p>https://twitter.com/Edmang_Legends<br/>www.edilostolaza.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e3/6e3eee0f0a599a2811c706f6cf3e5fef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 221, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Edmang"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
