Get the perfect combination of heroes and lead them in the battlefield to defeat every enemies, including the bosses!<br/></p>\r\nStory\r\n<p>Some army is trying to conquer the kingdom! You must protect it from the outside, or else all is lost. You have been just appointed the new\u00a0commander and your job is to lead your army. Learn your army and their army as well and strategize every move they make! As the game goes, you learn new things about the enemy's army. Are they just an army? Or is there something special about them?</p>\r\nHeroes\r\n\n<ul><li>Defend your kingdom using heroes! They are the ones that you will lead.</li><li>Not all heroes kill enemies. Some have other uses like the Fairy (see above), in which their goal is to generate life that will be used to spawn heroes.</li><li>Choose heroes wisely because you can only hold a maximum of 8 per level.</li><li>Place your heroes wisely as well, the ones who do not kill should be placed far from the enemies as they are the ones with\u00a0low health.</li><li>You can learn the abilities, uses and types\u00a0of every\u00a0hero in the Almanac!</li></ul>\r\nEnemies\r\n\r\n<ul><li>There are different types of enemies but they only have one goal: To get inside of the kingdom.</li><li>Some enemies don't attack but only run. Some enemies are really slow and some enemies are really fast.</li><li>Some enemies attack only when they are attacked while some purposely try to kill all of the heroes before trying to get inside of the castle.</li><li>Every enemy have unique abilities and uses as well. You can learn them in the Almanac. Note that an enemy will only unlock in the Almanac if you encountered it before.</li></ul>\r\nBosses\r\n\n<ul><li>Bosses are the strongest enemies and they're usually bigger in size as well.</li><li>They only show up on the last level of every stage and usually, they are alone.</li><li>They have more abilities than the enemies that\u00a0can damage or kill\u00a0multiple heroes at once, so lead your heroes wisely.</li><li>All bosses are entirely\u00a0different from each other so don't expect that they will have similar abilities. All bosses kill but they kill in different ways.\u00a0Always expect the unexpected.</li></ul>\r\nMechanics\r\n<br/>\n\n<ul><li>As you can see, there are 8 slots and each\u00a0contains a hero that you will use in the game. By default, you can only use 4.</li><li>To spawn a\u00a0hero, you need <strong>Life</strong>. Life is shown in the yellow bar above.\u00a0\u00a0To generate life, you need fairy. At the start of every level, the life cost\u00a0of a fairy is 0 and it increases every time you spawn it. (It doesn't decrease when a fairy dies.)</li><li>There is only a limit of how many you can spawn a hero in the battlefield. It is called the\u00a0<strong>Hero Limit</strong>. You can see the hero limit at the left of the life bar, it has a face beside it. As you can see, it increases when you spawn a hero and decreases when a hero dies.</li><li>The hero slots, life, and hero limit can be upgraded in the <strong>Shop</strong>.</li><li>The display below the life bar is the stage and level that you are currently playing. Using the example above, it is playing\u00a0<strong>Stage 1</strong> and\u00a0<strong>Level 9</strong>.</li><li>You can pause the game anytime by clicking the pause button at the right of the life bar.</li><li>You can fast forward the game to 2x by clicking the fast forward button at the right of the pause button. To bring it back to 1x, just click it again.</li></ul>\n\n<p>I hope you have fun playing this game and any feedback is appreciated! The game is not done yet but I'm actively developing it.
