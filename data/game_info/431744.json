{"id": 431744, "slug": "small-town-magic", "name": "Small Town Magic", "name_original": "Small Town Magic", "description": "<p>A very relaxed city builder about everyday magic and the magic of everyday life in a small idyllic town, filled with things that make us happy: parks, ice cream, friends and an easy to manage economy. We aim to create your own little world and chill there for a while.<br/><br/><em>Developer Notes:<br/>Small Town Magic is played by dropping roads which enable you to put houses and attractions around them. You have to balance out the aim of having a high population, which acts as score while not going into disrepair and loosing the game if the funds are in negative for too long.<br/><br/>The game features a Tetris like functionality where buildings come in a queue and the player is only aware of the current option and the next one. This was done to try and give an element of creativity through the limitation of not knowing what comes next and emphasizing the idea of not sprawling with a plan.</em></p>\n<p><em>There are two types of buildings :<br/></em></p>\n<ol><li><em>Houses , which give population give money</em></li><li><em>Attraction , which add multipliers to the buildings around them based on their type.</em></li></ol>\n<p><em>The current budget changes every 10 seconds and the days increment every 30. You loose the game if you stay in minus with your budget for over 3 ingame days.</em></p>\n<p><em><br/>There are quite a few bugs at the moment, such as sounds not playing at the right time, sometimes a building cannot be placed next to a road, if that happens, put a road there, and use the area next to it to build.<br/><br/>There are also quite a few features still missing, such as online scoreboard, more advanced story lines and a day/night system, which we will be working on in the following days.</em></p>\n\n<p>Programming: Theodor F.
