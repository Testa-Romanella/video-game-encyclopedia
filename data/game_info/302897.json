{"id": 302897, "slug": "hotel-tutwin", "name": "Hotel Tutwin", "name_original": "Hotel Tutwin", "description": "Hotel Tutwin is an interactive visual novel of the horror/romance genre, for casual gamers who appreciate female leads and supernatural characters.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou play as Penni, who is compelled to enter a mysterious hotel with her childhood friend. From outside, Hotel Tutwin seems abandoned and empty, but wait... It's up and running? The characters you will meet are a quirky bunch, but don't let them fool you. The world at Hotel Tutwin is a balanced ecosystem that has yet to be disrupted.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPenni can choose between three male love interests, all of which have stories hidden in branches other than their main one. This means you can\u2019t learn everything about one character by only playing the path leading to their happy ending. And it\u2019s not like the story is made of happy endings either. In fact, only about one third of the endings are good. So if you\u2019re looking for an easy love story without death or hardship, don\u2019t look here!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:47:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f57/f5746a872bdf4cb9e4b4f5b927f2ac51.jpg", "website": "https://roxiano.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 387, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Roxiano Creations"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Roxiano Creations"], "esrb_rating": null}
