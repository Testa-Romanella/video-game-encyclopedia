My goal was to experiment with dialogue systems and find a way to allow players to have more initiative in a conversation. The project was made only by myself, with the help of some free 3D assets I found online (that are explicitly credited in the project's credits)</p>\n<p>There is no real goal to the game, other than to explore the scene and talk to all of the NPCs and solve some quests given by them. The game still contains some bugs, but nothing that I\u00a0will fix anytime soon. This prototype is meant to show the idea of a new experimental dialogue system and is NOT a fully-released, polished game with lots of content.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I am considering using the system for a real, smaller game in the future though, which might include role-playing aspects, but that will still take some time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T06:06:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83c/83ce98c11ece5d8167c2a4909c4814e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tranquilmage"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
