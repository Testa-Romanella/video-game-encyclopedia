The game was available on two popular gaming consoles at this time, the Atari 2600 and the Intellivison. The gameplay was pretty much the same on both machines, you flew the snowspeeder\u00a0around on the planet of Hoth and fought huge AT-ATs. The Parker Brothers did create a game for the C-64 in 1983, but it was more similar to the vector game you could play on the arcades, and it did not have the name \"Empire Strikes Back\" in the title.\u00a0 In 1988 the C64 game distributor Domark did release a game called \"Empire Strikes Back\", programmed by the developers in Vektor Grafix.\u00a0 This version was also based on the Arcade version.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>40 years later...\u00a0</strong><br/>40 years after the Atari and Intellivision games were released, Megastyle is now proud to present to you:\u00a0The\u00a0Commodore 64 fan version of the original Parker Brothers game \"Empire Strikes Back\". We have tried to remake the Atari 2600 version into a Commodore 64 version, but also added our own touch to the game.\u00a0In this version you have to\u00a0protect the rebels power generators from the walkers - just like in the original Parker Brothers game. But on a the\u00a0Commodore 64 you will have to survive 8 levels and face new enemies not seen in the Atari version.\u00a0We have added cut scenes between each level, and if you are good enough you will reach the\u00a0end sequence!\u00a0\u00a0<br/><strong><br/>The download we share with you contains:<br/></strong>A digital Cassette version of the game (TAP format)<br/>A digital Disk version of the game (D64 format)\u00a0<br/>An executable program file of the game (PRG format)<br/>Digital instructions on disk (D64) or as a seperate executable file (PRG).</p>\n<p><strong>We hope you enjoy this free C64 game just as much as we enjoyed making it!\u00a0</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T23:20:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5a/a5aa26e5abb1462b2f17a8cf8ac879c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Megastyle"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
