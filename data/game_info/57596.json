{"id": 57596, "slug": "medievil", "name": "MediEvil I", "name_original": "MediEvil I", "description": "<p>MediEvil is an action-adventure hack and slash video game developed by SCE Cambridge Studio and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation. The game is set in the medieval Kingdom of Gallowmere and centres around the charlatan protagonist, Sir Daniel Fortesque, as he makes an attempt to stop antagonist Zarok&#39;s invasion of the kingdom whilst simultaneously redeeming himself.<br />\nDevelopment began in 1995 at Millenium Interactive in Cambridge under the working title of Dead Man Dan. The visuals are heavily influenced by Tim Burton&#39;s The Nightmare Before Christmas. Originally conceived as an arcade-style shooter for platforms such as Windows and the Sega Saturn, Sony&#39;s purchase of SCE Cambridge Studio evolved the game into a PlayStation title. The game received mostly positive praise from critics upon release, with praise including its blend of Halloween themed visuals, but was criticised for its controls and cumbersome camera work.<br />\nIt was released in Europe and North America in 1998, and in Japan in 1999. It was also re-released on the PlayStation Network in 2007. It was followed by a sequel, MediEvil 2, in 2000, and a PlayStation Portable remake in 2005 titled MediEvil: Resurrection. At PlayStation Experience 2017, a remaster for PlayStation 4 was announced.</p>", "metacritic": 67, "released": "1998-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-17T20:30:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a8/1a870c422546de20efd4b0477aed1846.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.98, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 42, "owned": 833, "beaten": 98, "toplay": 16, "dropped": 77, "playing": 7}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 63, "ratings_count": 154, "suggestions_count": 433, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 155, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": ["SCE Cambridge Studio", "Guerrilla Cambridge"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
