We'd like to thank Faiface, the creator of the Pixel game engine, for creating an engine that allows for great freedom of creativity in making games in Go.</p>\n<p>The source code and assets are\u00a0freely available in this Github repository.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy our game - it's our first ever gaming project (we usually work on web and desktop applications) so this has been a great learning experience for us both.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If voting please note that the music has not been created by us, or specifically for this project! A huge thanks to Kevin MacLeod for creating such amazing open source music.\u00a0It is credited below.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>WASD - Movement</li><li>Left Click - Fire Phaser</li><li>Right Click - Dodge</li><li>Enter - Reset/Restart</li></ul>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Head outside to start the game, try to survive for as long as possible whilst keeping the reapers at bay! Firing your phaser in time to the beat will increase your damage and score multiplier (careful though, missing the beat will decrease your multiplier), getting hit by a reaper will decrease your multiplier and eventually make you lose your boogie! (you'll die).</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Game Design, Programming - Callum Jones, Henry Spencer<br/>Art - Henry Spencer</p>\r\n\r\n\"Acid Jazz\"\r\nKevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\r\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0\r\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\r\n\"Backed Vibes\"\r\nKevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\r\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0\r\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\r\n\"Night on the Docks\"\r\nKevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\r\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0\r\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\r\nPlayer model heavily inspired by\r\n\"Spike Spiegel\"\r\nMatt Frith\r\nhttp://www.mattfrith.com/post/59535644276/spike-spiegel-i-am-not-a-massive-anime-fan\r\nReaper model inspired by\r\n\"Reaper Of The Cards\"\r\nYu-Gi-Oh!, Konami\r\nhttps://www.yugioh.com/cards/reaper-of-the-cards", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9dc/9dc753762b46c5ceea334c32587d4191.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Hecrer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
