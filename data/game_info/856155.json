I'VE MADE A MISTAKE IN THE IN-GAME CONTROLS AND FOR CLARITY.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A blizzard has blown through and the only shelter for miles is an abandoned warehouse. You take shelter and use an old wood furnace to keep warm. Navigating in the dark is hard. Lucky for you, you always keep a lighter on hand. Use it to brighten your surroundings or lights the wood you find for a temporary torch. Find wood to keep the fire going and try not to die of frostbite. However, the light likes to attract unwanted guests. You must survive until the morning when the storm passes.</p>\n<p>This is my survival horror submission for the VimJam3 Game Jam</p>\n<p>There is a lack of horror in the game since due to time constraint. I had to cut the jump scares and death screens. So upon losing you just restart the game immediately.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>Controls</strong>\r\nWASD /<br/>Arrow KeysMove PlayerLeft ClickTurn on and off your lighter.<br/>Throw Torch (If you have one lit) to distract the creature if chasing you.Right ClickPick Up sticks on ground if player is above them.<br/>Fuel furnace with sticks your carrying.<br/>Light a stick you're carrying into a torch.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T19:04:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/847/8476c0c6a7045ccf5e1dbb5ffb540d5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Travesty"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
