Escape can be used to pause.</p>\n\r\nForeword<p>1. Before you walk off thinking that this is just another Baldi clone, listen to what I have to say in the description.</p>\n\r\nDescription\r\n<p>Give this game a chance at least. Yes, the gameplay is very similar to Baldi's Basics: Collecting notebooks, defending yourself from crazy teachers with the help of sodas, no running in the corridors during the lesson, SWEEP SWEEP SWEEP. But if you're still a fan of Baldi-like games and love horror and challenges, this game is just the right thing for you! The game will be a lot of fun, if you take your time to understand everything and don't give up on it just because you died a few times. The game is still under development, so stay tuned for updates!</p>\r\nHave fun and leave some feedback\r\n\r\nTools used\r\n<ol><li>Unity</li><li>Audacity</li><li>Blender</li><li>Photoshop</li><li>Microsoft Visual 2018</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T06:41:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f52/f52483b63e790499c6663761a22c6ff4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["crayontronic10"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
