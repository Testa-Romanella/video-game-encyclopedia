Your job is to make sure the bonfire doesn't burn out by finding logs to fuel it. You can venture away from the bonfire using your torch, but be careful. Your torch can not burn forever, so you must not venture too far out, and get lost. You have to find the orbs scattered around in the forest. The orbs, when collected, will activate the gate, that will allow the character to escape, and free the curse that lies upon the forest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You pick up lumber, and fuel the fire using the 'F' key,\u00a0 and move using WASD. You fuel the torch by getting close to the bonfire.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T05:15:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48c/48c2a203fd0fe01a2cdc64321d775e3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DADIUteam4"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
