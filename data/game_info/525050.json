Heavily inspired by TrackMania, your objective is to reach the finish line as fast as possible. Just beat time medals to unlock new tracks!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Featuring:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>20 tracks to challenge yourself! Will you get all of the medals?</li><li>An auto-save system! Leave the game &amp; come back later, your records and your medals will still be there!</li><li>Awesome controls!</li><li>Awesome soundtrack!</li><li>A multiplayer mode inspired by Micromachines, to challenge your friends! This is an incoming work, it will be available later... I hope so!</li></ul>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Left arrow to rotate to the\u00a0left, right arrow to rotate to the\u00a0right, up arrow to move forward.</p>\n<p>Well, it seems that I broke the controller, so now the car is moving forward all along, and you can only rotate to the right... I guess you will manage, right?</p>\r\nMusic credits:\r\n<ul><li>Breeze - Mitch Murder</li><li>Late Night - ODESZA</li><li>Lyra - Julian Wassermann</li><li>Flea - Herb Alpert &amp; The Tijuana Brass</li><li>Stadium Theme 1 (Trackmania Wii) - Nadeo</li></ul>\r\nTimes for the medals (in seconds)\r\n<p><strong>Spoiler!
