The first person to reach the checkpoint wins. As you go past checkpoints you unlock them as new places to spawn, though the direct path on the map\u00a0may not always be the fastest route as there are many shortcuts.</p>\n\n\n<p>This game is recommended to be played with an Xbox controller. It is possible with KBM but the controls are unfinished.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also only designed for 16:9 displays (UI might not appear else)</p>\n<p><strong><em>CONTROLS</em></strong></p>\n<p>Move around : LS / AD</p>\n<p>Boost : A Button / LShift</p>\n<p>Brake : LT / S</p>\n<p>Accellerate : RT / W</p>\n<p>Menu : Menu Button /\u00a0\u00a0Hold Esc\u00a0</p>\n<p>Map :\u00a0 Hold B / M</p>\n<p>Enter Chairlift : A Button / LShift</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T09:48:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d30/d3038184e7a55b7b319e8b566a77a1f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ed"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
