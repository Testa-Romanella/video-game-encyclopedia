This was submitted to the Farewell North Jam and\u00a0is my first Jam, so don't be too harsh. the code is messier than my room and I'm sure it's got bugs(Just checked... wow I'm sorry guys). It's very basic and lacks some QOL features but here's how it works. When you press start, be prepared to hustle. There is currently no wait from loading to the game being active. The goal of the game is to keep at least one light on for as long as possible until you fail or get hit. So far, only the bullets work. Again, it's no AAA but I'm rather proud of the thing considering most of my time was spend debugging code and Unity. Enjoy! Also, I have a video devlog coming soon. It will show most of my code and I would wholeheartedly welcome feedback!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T05:49:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75f/75fcc7fcb42a0bf3fa75d54988406e33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jmoot"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
