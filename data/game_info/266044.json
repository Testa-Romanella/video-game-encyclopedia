I interpreted the theme as directional momentum, and turned it into a free-running game.</p>\n<p>There's only one level but it shows off the climbing mechanic and how it can be used for multiple different purposes. I would have implemented more mechanics but ran out of time, the same with the short level design. There may be some underlying bugs which i didnt find but nothing should break game that much.</p>\n<p>My record for beating it is about 56 seconds so good luck with speedruns.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Space - Jump (Duh)<br/>WASD - Move<br/>Shift - Sprint<br/>E - Climb walls (Doesn't work for everything)<br/>I - Swap to Inverted Camera<br/>Escape - Return to Main Menu<br/><br/>Please feel free to be critical in the comments</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/741/741e4e6cc91c9168ed30598d9450b1b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheTacBanana"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
