You\u2019ve been evacuated alongside countless others, and have spent the past four years traveling through space. Your destination: the planet Ovo, where you\u2019ll begin a new life. Ovo is home to many strange and wonderful plants and animals, as well as hundreds of humans who made the journey before you. Tyto Academy, the most prestigious school in the galaxy, has accepted you as a student. Spend your days exploring and performing experiments in the Ovonian jungle, and decorating your very own, private apartment. Care for the last of Earth\u2019s native plants and animals in the biodome facility. Quest by yourself or with friends online, and learn real scientific concepts as you play. Who knows? Perhaps your collective efforts may one day restore the Earth!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:12:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d9/8d9a0e21b98ec07528ee58ae841afd14.jpg", "website": "http://www.tytoonline.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 353, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Immersed Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Casual", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Immersed Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
