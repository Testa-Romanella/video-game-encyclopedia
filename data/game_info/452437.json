Coronavirus infections are rising and\u00a0markets are falling.\u00a0You look weak and you're starting to doubt yourself, but there's no time for that, you're on the news! You have to give a speech before the stock markets close in order\u00a0boost confidence in yourself and the markets, and, sure, maybe bring down the projected rate of infection.</p>\n<p>In\u00a0<em>Impress Conference</em> you\u00a0 deliver a Covid-19 update speech: sentence by sentence, phrase by phrase.\u00a0In order to utter those phrases, you perform the physical equivalent of Donald Trump's mental process and mash the keys on your keyboard.\u00a0What you say matters, to yourself and the outside world.</p>\n<p>With any given phrase you can praise yourself, attack your enemies, promote businesses, or implement and support public health measures.\u00a0Your choice of words affects\u00a0President\u00a0Trump's ego (as represented by the size of his hands),\u00a0the stock market, and the projected rate of infection for the virus.\u00a0You will need to keep all of these in check (or the first two anyway)\u00a0if you're to make it to the closing of the markets.</p>\n<p>With four possible endings and an endless number of speech combinations,\u00a0<em>Impress Conference</em> makes President\u00a0Trump's public appearances\u00a0even less necessary.<br/></p>\n\n<strong>A Note on the Black\u00a0Lives Matter Protests</strong>\n\n<p><em>Impress Conference </em>was conceived in the first week of the Coronavirus lockdown, when President\u00a0Trump's press briefings were a daily occurrence, and it\u00a0is about that particular, political, moment in time. That moment has passed. The protests that have broken out\u00a0in response to the killing of George Floyd have highlighted the systemic racism of our country and its police forces, and also the racist words and deeds\u00a0of\u00a0President Trump himself. Those subjects are\u00a0unfortunately beyond the scope of\u00a0<em>Impress Conference</em>, but in the interest of supporting those fighting for justice,\u00a0I encourage people to donate to and buy from Black organizations and support the protesters.
