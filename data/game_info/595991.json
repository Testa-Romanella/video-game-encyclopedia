You can't add roots here yourself.</p>\n<p>2) Place one root (drawn as lines) <strong>on each tile</strong>. Roots can either be straight or a 90 degree turn. All roots must connect to the tree. (Three- or four-way crossings are not allowed.)</p>\n<p>3) All roots must finish with a dead end: they cannot connect to other roots. (Sometimes, roots may already placed.)</p>\n<p>4) Rows or columns with a number must contain exactly that amount of 90 degree turns, marked with the red dots. (The tree also counts as a dot.)</p>\n<p>Game by Tom Hermans for Ludum Dare 48. The Kitchen Sink font is by Retroshark and Polyducks.
