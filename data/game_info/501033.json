In each level, the player must kill all the enemies without dying. The player dies if the player is shot to death (HP reaches 0) or if the player collides with a wall or enemy. The player can kill an enemy by shooting the enemy three times. Bullets can harm both the player and enemies. Bullets are destroyed if they collide with a wall, the player, another bullet, or an enemy. In each level, the player is stuck in a loop where their actions are controlled except for brief moments of player control. The enemies are also stuck in a looped AI behavior.</p>\n<p>View the download links for instructions on how to play the game as well as the source code for the project.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T03:42:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b8/4b81d4fe0e08006c22a1b0a2a4a153ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["D-Studios"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
