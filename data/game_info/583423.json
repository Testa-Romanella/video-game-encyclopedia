While the environments and core mechanics are all complete (with the occasional bug), we did not have time to thread the puzzles and mechanics throughout or world - making normal progression impossible.</p>\n<p>To counter this we have left a secret room in the first area - \"The Manor\". If you can find the secret room - it will provide access to all of the levels of the game!</p>\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<ul><li>Gameplay &amp; Direction: Adam Bourke</li><li>Artwork: Leo Crampton Dazzara</li><li>Original Music: Charlotte McMillan</li><li>Voice Actors (though Fiverr.com):<ul><li>Sararose Willey (SararoseVA)</li><li>Sam Cole (SamColeOfficial)</li><li>Austin K.J.
