With a click of a button, propel yourself through time, or freeze time completely and watch as bullets hover mid-air! But whatever you do, don\u2019t stand still. You might have all the time in the world, but so do your enemies!<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Time Travel</strong><br/>Use time travel to flank enemies, dodge bullets or manipulate the world around you.<br/>The world was destroyed and lies in ruins, walls are missing, roofs have fallen out, and devices are on fire. Use this to your advantage. Time travel to the future, where a once solid wall now has a gaping hole. Use the ruins to your advantage to prevent the destruction. Be careful though! Your enemies have sent their own Cyclic Warriors back in time to stop you!<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Advanced Movement</strong><br/>Wall-run, slide, bunny hop and kick off walls to build up incredible speed. Source style air-strafe to change directions mid-air! The game is focused on allowing players to chain movement mechanics. The speed limit is your skill.<br/><br/><strong>Multiplayer</strong><br/>Hop into intense multiplayer PVP battles, or play with bots of your skill level! The game is FREE, so there are no official servers, instead any player can host their own game. Anyone in your country can join your game, or you can just play with friends!<br/>Cyclic Warriors Early Access is a very casual experience, currently with no competitive game modes, just to have some quick fun!<br/><br/><strong>Inspiration</strong><br/>The game is inspired by my favorite FPS mission of all time, Effect and Cause, as well as quite a few different arena shooters.
