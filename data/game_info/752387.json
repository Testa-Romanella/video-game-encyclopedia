UTAU is voice synthesizing software. It is essentially a plug and play  collection of voice recordings that can be tuned and edited down into a  virtual voice that sings, if you don't have a singer for your music!\r\n  </p>\n<p>The software comes in a variety of styles and Languages. The  easiest to use for beginners is \"CV JAPANESE\". The following bank, and  character is Lance Lazor's ENGLISH CV VOICEBANK Lance Lazor also has a more  nasal/kunnie sounding bank titled</p>\n<p>\"ENGLISH CV GLOW\" Which can be found here<br/></p>\n<p>Each Voicebank has a character associated with it, which is what  Lance Lazor is. Lance Lazor can be used commercially with the purchasing  of a license. For full terms as to her commercial use please see this page on her website.\r\n  </p>\n<p>CV English may sound robotic to the untrained ear. This is because  this software is not a natural human singing but rather a compilation of  sounds made to sound like someone singing. This natural or uncanny  effect will go away rather quickly with repeated listening to UTAUloids  which are what the characters/voices for this software are called.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00bb\u00bb\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u3000\u2654\u3000\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u00ab\u00ab\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Bank</strong>: CV ENGLISH <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Oto'r: </strong>Reson Lore</p>\n<p><strong>Vocier:</strong> Compulsive Ink/Adam Noizic      </p>\n<p><strong>Reclist Credi</strong><strong>t</strong>:\u00a0Restune-P/Rel\u00a0English\r\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Artist:\u00a0PinksSquirelGames/TheMysticaShell/OSHWA</strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Designer: </strong>Adam Snowflake      </p>\n<p><strong>Gender:</strong> Genderfluid      </p>\n<p><strong>Pronouns</strong>: He/They/She (in any order)      </p>\n<p><strong>Language</strong>: AMERICAN ENGLISH\r\n    </p>\n<p><strong>WikiPage</strong> </p>\n<p><strong>VOCAL RANGE</strong>: <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Era: </strong>5.0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>18+ Use allowed:\u00a0</strong>Yes permission not required but please age him up if you use him this way\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Commercial use allowed:</strong>\u00a0With purchasing of license\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00bb\u00bb\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u3000\u2654\u3000\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u00ab\u00ab\r\n  </p>\n<p>\r\nINSERT VIDEO OF HER SINGING HERE\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00bb\u00bb\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u3000\u2654\u3000\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u00ab\u00ab \r\n  </p>\n<p>Lance has merch such as Shirts and Posters that you can buy here</p>\n<p>Wallpapers here</p>\n<p>A Patreon Here\r\n  </p>\n<p>and lastly LINE Stickers here\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00bb\u00bb\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u3000\u2654\u3000\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u00ab\u00ab   </p>\n<p>Lastly Lance's CV English bank is fairly beginner friendly, and for more resources or information on how to use this software go here!<br/></p>\n<p>\u00bb\u00bb\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u3000\u2654\u3000\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u00ab\u00ab <br/></p>\n<p>Please credit the artists somewhere in your videos/covers if you use the art!</p>\n<p>\u00bb\u00bb\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u3000\u2654\u3000\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u00ab\u00ab<br/></p>\n<p>Terms of service for lance can be found here!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T06:48:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/601/601a9b57e394c79257e2be4d56552ba2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Oron Snowflake"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
