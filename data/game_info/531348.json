We\u00a0offer a complement to the existing but very dense maps (because of the size of the campus), the name of the building where you are in the simulation is displayed along with the number referenced on the map, so you can easily understand and learn where it's placed\u00a0in\u00a0the area.<br/></p>\n<p>You can find the original map here:<br/>\u00a0http://newcms.kmu.ac.kr/ekmugs/25603/subview.do\u00a0<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Our main difficulty was time management, we couldn't make all the buildings and it's a very time consumming process, that's why some of the buildings are less detailed.<br/>We would have needed at least two more month (with all our other classes)\u00a0to make the other areas of the campus, but in the end we chose to stick with the ones we encountered and were the most familiar with.</p>\n<p>Made by: Alexandre Dao, Elie Fourreau-Hardy and Maxime Vollat</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T05:47:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f72/f727eec17834ddd0b8d93a4aefb4185c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Maxmagix"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
