Playing solo is also possible. Placed in a fantasy world with a vintage style. This game is a fusion of adventure and action.<br/>The entire game is made by one person.<br/> <br/>Game story:<br/>One experiment goes wrong and the undetected virus spread across the area. Some peoples get infected, some back from the dead, and new creatures are born. When people have no idea how to turn this back, the Doctor in his laboratory discovers a special weapon to fight with these different opponents... a laser! He connects himself with his best friend and also the most effective hunter in the village to start the adventure together.<br/><br/><br/>The main mechanic is both players are connected and need to cooperate closely playing on one keyboard. Nowadays those types of games are less popular than a few years ago, but I have a fondness for times when with family and friends we played together on one computer on one keyboard. It was awesome, fun and we can spend some time with each other. One of the main goals of this indie game is to remind you of these times.<br/><br/><strong>So invite your partner and play! <br/><br/><br/><br/>By buying my game you are supporting my adventure as a solo game developer.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed playing Inseparable share it with your friends &amp; family and follow me on Instagram.<br/><br/><br/>Stay connected.</strong><br/><br/>I will be really glad to see your reactions and get the feedback.
