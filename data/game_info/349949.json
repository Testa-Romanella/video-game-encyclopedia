Where will the frog jump?<br/>\r\nDon't give up and make sure to send the frog home.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n* Rainy ground is very slippery.<br/>\r\n* Bugs are the food of frogs. The frog that ate the worm can jump once more.<br/>\r\n* Clouds are more elastic than they look.<br/>\r\n* If you can't find your destination, take a break and look around.<br/>\r\n* It has nothing to do with individual desire to achieve. Please send the poor frog home.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5df/5df44db566da126380e76d5e131df0bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hobby.st Game"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hobby.st Game"], "esrb_rating": null}
