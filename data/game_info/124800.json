You don\u2019t know why but you are urged to code something. You must develop weird and incoherent game features to get ahead and make something before time is up.</p>\n<p>First, click on your dev guy to show HUD. you can use it to develop some features. Once you can walk or move the camera, use keyboard arrows or joypad if connected (sorry if that\u2019s weird) to do so. Keep on coding features with mouse+hud.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is not so worth it, but i tried something different, with management and mini adventure \u2026 Still making the same mistakes, rushing everything at the end when fatigue is overcoming everything. That\u2019s (once again) what it\u2019s all about : don\u2019t expect pure gaming/fun, it\u2019s raw and unfinished, but i hope you\u2019ll like it :]</p>\n<p>Cheers</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf1/cf1a3074a6c3da0e8a0c688fab61b6c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kNARF"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
