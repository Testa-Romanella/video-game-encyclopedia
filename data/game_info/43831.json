{"id": 43831, "slug": "radianvr", "name": "RadianVR", "name_original": "RadianVR", "description": "RadianVR is a new vision for an old-school arcade-style puzzle game. Unlike conventional color-matching puzzle games, in RadianVR you manipulate rings of blocks made of realistic materials such at metals, fabrics, and tiles, in a puzzle that floats in front of you. The end result, especially when playing with dual inputs such as Oculus Touch, is one of feeling immersed in a real world while playing with a physical puzzle.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWith a wide range of special effects\u2014such as locking, rainbow blocks and automatic flipping\u2014the depth and difficulty increase as you play. It includes an arcade mode, a more relaxing \"infinite\" mode, and a puzzle mode with 100 hand-crafted boards to solve in as few moves are possible.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt will ship for Oculus and PlayStationVR, and at some point for Vive.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:06:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38f/38fcff9bb56e0e59ca1c599c7917a19f.jpg", "website": "http://playradian.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Grand Unified"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Grand Unified"], "esrb_rating": null}
