Combine runes to create dynamic abilities, and put a stop to the evil Arch-Mage.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nThe genre of the game is best described as a deck builder roguelike. The archmage is the main antagonist and summons characters from the books around. RuneSmith takes inspiration from dominos. Other games were used as inspiration such as Slay the Spire, Scrabble, and Words Can Kill. Words Can Kill is a similar concept barring the treasures giving individual letters instead of whole words.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T07:03:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/143/14378554b885349efecc60883a721b2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Adam Zaffram"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
