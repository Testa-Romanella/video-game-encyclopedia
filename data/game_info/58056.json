{"id": 58056, "slug": "rescue-at-rigel", "name": "Rescue at Rigel", "name_original": "Rescue at Rigel", "description": "<p>Rescue at Rigel is a 1980 science fiction computer role-playing game written and published by Automated Simulations (later known as Epyx). It is based on a modified version of their Temple of Apshai game engine, which was part of most of their releases in this era. The game was released for the Apple II, IBM PC (PC Booter), TRS-80, VIC-20, and Atari 8-bit family.</p>\n<p>The game requires the player to search out a space fortress looking for ten hostages. Presented in a top-down view, the player can only see the area immediately around them, so the entire base has to be searched room by room. There is a 60 minute time limit on the mission.</p>\n<p>Rescue at Rigel was soon followed by Star Warrior, and the two rebranded to be part of their \"Starquest\" series, although Star Warrior used a more heavily modified game engine than Rigel.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1980-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:52:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/576/576fd3ebd6e89dfcbd4748cd66a601ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 5, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC", "Atari 8-bit", "Apple II", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Epyx"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Epyx"], "esrb_rating": null}
