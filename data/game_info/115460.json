Made for Ludum Dare 40<br/></p>\n<p>You are the police chief looking over a map of the city. You are paid periodically by the government but it's not enough. To earn money you'll have to strike up deals with the mob, but will it be worth the extra crime in the area?</p>\n<p>Your goal is to keep the city safe for as long as you can.<br/><br/><br/><strong>How to play?</strong></p>\n<p>Each turn crime rises in the sectors, you also get payed. You can look at the sector info by clicking on or near the dot in the middle. From there you can see all the sector's information, you can also choose which actions to perform in each sector.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Do nothing: This costs you nothing but leaves a chance for the crime rates to increase in the sector</li><li>Cut a deal: Government funding is slim, so instead you can make a deal with the mob in that area for some money. This will get you a moderate sum of extra cash but will also increase crime.</li><li>Fight crime: You can spend some money to lower the crime levels in the sector and maybe even the crime rate.</li><li>Increase Police Presence: The only hope you have of successfully eradicating crime are with more police. The more police you have in a sector the more effectively you can fight crime. Be careful though this costs a good chunk of money.</li></ul>\n<p>Each turn you may perform an action in each sector so long as you have the resources to do so. Once you're happy with your selected actions you can end the turn and everything will be applied.</p>\n<p>If your public approval or money hit 0 then you have one turn to fix it before you lose.</p>\n<p><strong>Want more?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I had realized that I wanted to completely remake this game just a few hours before the compo ended. Of course even if I had decided to try and redo it for the compo I wouldn\u2019t have finished it in time.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re one of the people who did want to see this further developed feel free to follow me, as I\u2019m going to completely remake the game using all the feedback I\u2019ve gotten and what I learned while making the original. I hope to have updates available soon. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll have a playable build out, hopefully in a week or two.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the page for the remake.\u00a0I'll be posting devlogs here for those who are interested. I'd considered doing it on the ld40 version's itch page but I figured I'd just make a new one now.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/026/026e4055d6380c84d8e97dd5b7c6c9ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["minimurgle"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
