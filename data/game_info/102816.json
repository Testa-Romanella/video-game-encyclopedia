You take control of a nameless character and your only objective is to find the 8 pages scattered around house 03 and escape. To make your way through the environments you will also need to search for keys to open locked doors blocking your way. Realistic shadows, creepy atmosphere, big map to explore with indoor and outdoor environments, original game soundtrack, a story and two different endings are some of the features available in the game.<br/></p>\n<p>This game is available free of charge. If you wish to support us, you can pay any amount you wish - all of these will go towards future projects! You can also buy the official soundtrack here at itch.io or at Bandcamp:</p>\n<p>Soundtrack @ itch.io (60% discount until November 1st!)<br/>Soundtrack @ Bandcamp</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e8/5e894e18ec7c5e1c216cad474faf1e8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Indemonai Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
