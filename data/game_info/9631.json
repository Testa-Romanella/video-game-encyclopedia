It is also a strategy set in space with the science-fiction lore.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The point of the game is to conquer as many planets as possible using the given resources. The protagonist can be chosen out of three races: industrials, aliens and psychics each with unique special abilities.<br />\nThe gameplay process occurs exclusively in online mode, but single battles and succeeds against enemy AI is possible too. However, the campaign as a whole cannot be played offline. </p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>As in usual RTS, the gameplay is centered around resource management \u2014 the title&#39;s economy consists of prices on Metal, Credits, and Crystal \u2014 each with the individual gain conditions. So it would be impossible for instance to sell all of your metal to the friendly guild \u2014 after the wholesale, stock prices decrease and economy shifts towards them like real-life one.<br />\nWhile exploring the world, the player may stumble across habitable planets and anomalies which prevent the player from getting to the goal. Anomalies include asteroids, hostile environment, and ice fields.</p>\n<h3>Rebellion DLC</h3>\n<p>The expansion adds two new units into the gams: Loyalist and Rebel \u2014 delegates of any races can choose between them.
