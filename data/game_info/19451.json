It is the fifth installment in the series and is the first 3D and real-time combat game in it.</p>\n<p>The game takes place in the year 2277 - 200 years after the nuclear Great War. You play as a vault dweller and set out on a quest to find your father that left the vault.</p>\n<p>Fallout 3 offers the player immense freedom: create your own character with a particular set of skills using the role-playing S.P.E.C.I.A.L system and explore Washington, D.C., which has turned into a wasteland over the years without even following the main quest or complete every side quest you come across in the game.</p>\n<p>One of the main features of the game is the V.A.T.S system, that allows the players to target specific body parts of the enemy. For example, if you target the enemies hand, they could drop their weapon.</p>\n<p>GOTY edition features all the DLCs that were released: Operation: Anchorage, The Pitt, Broken Steel, Point Lookout and Mothership Zeta.</p>", "metacritic": 91, "released": "2009-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-19T07:13:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/e53/e5372e767149bc88106e1da0ae7e9104.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.13, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 222, "owned": 3483, "beaten": 959, "toplay": 67, "dropped": 233, "playing": 41}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 908, "suggestions_count": 639, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 912, "platforms": ["Xbox 360", "PlayStation 3", "PC"], "developers": ["Bethesda Game Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Bethesda Softworks"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
