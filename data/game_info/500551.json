That attempt was not successful to say the least. I dropped the project and went on to other things. Fast foreword to now. I have had time to practice pixel art. I switched development to RPG Maker 2003, and things have been much smoother.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Most of the music is done by The Lovely Abyss. (https://lovelyabyss.bandcamp.com/) All sprite work done by me, StudyMan99. <em>(it looks pretty bad right now but I'll fix it in post)\u00a0 ((tho there is a RTP song in one of the worlds))</em></p>\n<p><strong>WARNING:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This game has blood and gore and unfinished animations\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Version 0.01</strong>\u00a0: this version\u00a0has a bunch of bug fixes.
