Where Cookies are Always Exciting!<br/><br/>Help out the lovely owner Chip in whipping up some batches of cookies at your own pace and then see how well you stuck to the recipe!</p>\n<p>---</p>\r\nNotes:\r\n<ul><li>If you're playing on the web version, just hit play and it throws you back into baking without the tutorial! Realized I didn't have a way to view the credits again without quitting/restarting the whole game and ran out of time to add a back to menu button sorry for the confusion!</li><li>The recipe is actually different each time you play! So you can't just memorize it if you play again Chippany will catch you trying to be sneaky</li><li>You need to use the measuring cup for any items that you need a \"cup\" of. Wanted to make that a little more clear sorry about that!</li></ul>\n<p>---</p>\r\nMade for the Extra Credits Game Jam #6\r\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Art and Programming:<br/> Raespark</p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0<br/> Bossa Antigua by Kevin Macleod\u00a0<br/> from Icompetech.com</p>\n<p>Sound Effects:<br/> ZapSplat.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T07:28:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b48/b4844357bc8bd07fd084dc174afccce5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["raespark"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
