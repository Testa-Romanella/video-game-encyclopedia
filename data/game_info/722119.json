Like a tabletop game, it's best played with another person.</p>\n<p>Finagle is a game about balancing defense with offense and thinking more than one turn in advance. Each player has an arsenal of 16 pieces to capture the opponent's heart. Each turn gives you a large array of options, with the ability to place or move two times each turn. Will you place carefully and deliberately to increase your sector's defenses or will you lash out your pieces and charge the heart?\r\n</p><p>Originally released on March 11, 2015</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T08:38:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b79/b79f10494b27972886f56373149228f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ben Allen"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
