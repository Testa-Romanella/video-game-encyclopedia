Be careful though, the level is falling apart! Everywhere you roll the ground will crumble away, so you can never retrace your steps and you can never stop rolling!</p>\n<p>There are 3 coins to collect in each level, but you might have to take a more dangerous path to get them. Are you willing to risk it?</p>\n<p>Play through the game's 4 levels and find out your total score!</p>\n\n<p>This game was created in one weekend for the gm(48) game jam. The theme of the jam was \"Falling Apart\"</p>\n<p><strong>Source Code</strong></p>\n<p>I have open-sourced the repository for Face The Wind. It was created in Game Maker Studio 2, and I hope the project can help other people learn something about how the game was built!
