(bug is even if you shoot the target it wont end the level.)</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Play as a hitman, but instead of killing targets, you \"shoot\" them.</p>\n<p>Made for the second Mashup Game Jam.</p>\n<p>Theme : Unconventional Means</p>\n\n<p>- How to play -</p>\n<p>Use WASD - Arrow Keys to move, mouse to aim, left click to shoot, right click to zoom. WIth zoom you have larger range.</p>\n\n<p>The point of the game is to \"shoot\" the target shown in the top right corner. Your camera has a range.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>- Notes -</p>\n<p>I'm finally done, I'm not the most proud of the game because theres only small amount of levels, didnt even put a tutorial, but i don't think its the worst. But it was very fun and tought me a lot so it was worth it.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T10:36:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55e/55ea2bdd02a21ebc213dc7388bbf91ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Quacked Up"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
