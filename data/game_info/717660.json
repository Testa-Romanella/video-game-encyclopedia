To be honest, it wasn't a good idea, but I've already finished the game.</p>\r\nCLARIFICATION\r\n<p>You play against a bot or another person. it is not an online game so you can't play with someone far away, but you may try multiplayer streaming software such as Parsec.</p>\r\nGAMEPLAY\r\n<p>There's 5 game modes to choose. They are all based on the same mechanics: you rotate a paddle left or right. When you hit the ball, it will turn into your color, and if it goes out of the ring, you will score. You can also hit ball as many times as you want.</p>\n<p>Gamemodes are:</p>\r\nCLASSIC\r\n<p>score 8 to win.</p>\n\r\n60\r\n<p>each hit adds 1 to a counter. Whoever scores gets all the points from it. The first one to score 60 or more wins</p>\n\r\nTIMER\r\n<p>there's a 75 seconds countdown. Whoever scores the most wins.</p>\n\r\nDROPLETS\r\n<p>similar to classic mode, but random droplets will appear on the field. They will divert your ball on hit.</p>\n\r\nSINGLE\r\n<p>A singleplayer mode where you try to hit the ball as many times as possible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-03T04:56:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1cc/1cc35cb5fe5b679ee9ad442baba021a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["s4nt"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
