Once you have everything, carry them to your boat. That\u2019s your goal. You have to look after your oxygen reserves. Oxygen diminishes if you touch seaweeds or fancy underwater animals. And just underwater diminishing it as well, but happily at a much slower pace.\r\n</p>\n<p>To recover it you whether go to the surface to breathe or find bubbles. Each bubble grants you a \u201clife\u201d, this is 100 extra oxygen units. You start the game with just 100 units and no extra \u201clives\u201d. So you know you have to look for oxygen! You can shoot harpoons that will paralyze your enemies momentarily. They are quite limited. Recovering artifacts give you a few extra harpoons as well. Save them, they can be quite necessary.\r\n</p>\n<p>Inside the ship, you\u2019ll find levers that can be activated to make some gates inside the ship open.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T08:17:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a48/a48d8e7063de63554998082640b41a86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Relevo"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
