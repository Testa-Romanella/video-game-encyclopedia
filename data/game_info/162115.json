Just like I always seem to do.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless I think it's pretty good. You play as a bear who's just woken up from hibernation to a snowy landscape with no grass! Have to clear that up so grass can grow and spring can really begin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There's no real fail state in this game, but it happens in moves - you'll continue in a straight line as long as you're moving over unbroken snow. But it's fun to try and complete levels in the shortest time possible. To be fair, I wasn't able to create as many or as clever levels as I had hoped, but if you're interested you should be able to add some easily by editing the file. If not, just enjoy the 7 levels already there!</p>\n<p>Lexaloffle BBS thread:\u00a0here.</p>\n<p>#1GAM February 2018</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a8/8a888a92a47ac234d99b8c0559fd0c0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["PROGRAM_IX"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
