Archeo: Shinar, because that's the full title, is a turn-based strategy video game focused on people &amp; resources management.<br/><br/>It's not like other games about archeologists doing astonishing stuff in ancient tombs or something like that. No. In this game you will be the man behind the desk. Or a woman. We are talking about the lifestyle of the real archeologists, the true horror of dealing with traumas and phobias. Not yours! You won't risk your own health, we have employees to do that. The true horror of dealing with their traumas and phobias. Do you see where I'm going with it? Imagine the bills from doctors, the health compensations and the press. \"Press? Why the press?\" you ask. Yes, the press. Because you know the press. They are just waiting there for the unsatisfied explorer who would like to tell them how the \"archeology\" truly works. And we do not speak about how it truly works. They can't know the ugly truth. Never!  <br/><br/>That's a lot of stress, right? Don't worry, as we already know, there is no better medicine for that than a cup of tea. Or a glass of gin. Your call.<br/><br/>Let's agree this is enough knowledge for now. More information could cause an Epistemophobia, and we don't want that, do we? Please, enjoy the view from your train's window and look forward to our next meeting.<br/><br/>.-. -.. -... .--. -.. ... / -.... -... --. -... ...-- .. ..-. .---- -....- ..... -... / .-. -.. -... .--. -.. ...<br/><br/>Signed<br/>Your Cuppy<br/><br/>Archeo: Shinar is an economic turn-based strategy set in the world of archeology.
