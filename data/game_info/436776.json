It\u00a0takes you through the motions of Sam to highlight the chaotic stresses in everyday life. All while avoiding filling up the meter at the top of the screen. If the meter is maxed out, <em>you will die of anxiety</em>.</p>\n<p>The gallery space display is intended to utilize a controller and school\u00a0desk setup, but you can play the game at home using the keyboard. You can use the controls chart for reference. The files can be downloaded separately, or you can download them all in a ZIP folder for the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-27T04:18:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c5/4c5e993be479e04e0ec67428331e815c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ryan Silberman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
