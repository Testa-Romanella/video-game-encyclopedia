Thatcher\u2019s neoliberal programme in politics was reinforced by a transnational restructuring of the capitalist economy. The shift into so-called Post-Fordism \u2013 with globalization, ubiquitous computerization and the casualisation of labour \u2013 resulted in a complete transformation in the way that work and leisure were organised. In the last ten to fifteen years, meanwhile, the internet and mobile telecommunications technology have altered the texture of everyday experience beyond all recognition. Yet, perhaps because of all this, there\u2019s an increasing sense that culture has lost the ability to grasp and articulate the present.
