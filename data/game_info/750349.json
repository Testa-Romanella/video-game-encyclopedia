Long have they dwelled in peace, but now they are under assault from a horde of goblins, and there are whispers of a far more foul foe leading the goblins.</p>\n<p>The game concentrates more on thinking than fighting enemies \u2014 boss fights are often a matter of logically deducing a foe&#39;s weakness. Later levels emphasize trap-dodging, and all levels contain secret passages and hidden items. It&#39;s an RPG of sorts, but not in the traditional sense, in as much as the player fights arcade-style and gains power by finding magical crystals.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-05T23:14:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65e/65ea22c7b75c36ea419c5609cfa9bf58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 188, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ambrosia Software"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": ["Ambrosia Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
