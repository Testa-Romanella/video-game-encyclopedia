Now the Tacosians, who claim the hamburger is an overrated form of fast food, are seeking to destroy your hamburgers for good! Will you, a mere janitor, set down the mop of floor cleansing and pick up the... mop?.. of JUSTICE?! Of course you will! After all, it's in your contract...</em><br/><br/>Asteroid Burger is wacky arcade-style action game where you must thwart aliens from stealing your hamburgers!<br/><br/>- 4 unique and satisfying weapons, that each serve a purpose and can be combo'd together for explosive results!</p>\n\n<p>- Feed customers with the food cannon while keeping enemies at bay. Sometimes the risky shots are just the break you need to pull ahead!</p>\n<p>- Enjoyable skill curve!
