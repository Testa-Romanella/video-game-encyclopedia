Simply\u00a0 modify the height/width of the file (in the same directory as above) titled \"AspectModifier.png\". Note: it's a percentage based aspect modifier, so if you scale it 50% on one dimension, the screen will be 50% shorter on that dimension. The axis of the image are labeled on what they effect, as the screen texture is rotated 90 degrees on playback.<br/><br/>Recommended Retroarch Cores<br/><br/>More cores may work, but these have been tested to be the most functional so far<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sega Genesis/Megadrive: Blastem (blastem libretro)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NES: Quicknes (quicknes_libretro)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SNES: Snes9X (snes9x_libretro)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gameboy advance: virtual boy advance - next (vba_next_libretro)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gameboy/Color: Gearboy (gearboy_libretro)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Atari 2600: Stella (stella2014_libretro)<br/><br/>Want to contribute to the development?
