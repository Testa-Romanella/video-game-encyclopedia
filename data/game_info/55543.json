It was originally released for the Amiga in 1988, and was ported for the Atari ST, Commodore 64, and MS-DOS in 1989. The game is set on the planet of Draconia, where players are tasked with destroying the planet's defence mechanisms in order to kill the harmful creatures.</p>\n<p>The game was designed by David Jones, and was the first game developed by his company DMA Design. First developed in his bedroom at his parents' house, Jones began seeking an official development studio and publisher when the game was nearing completion. He eventually settled upon a publishing deal with Psygnosis, who first published the game in 1988 to positive reviews; praise was given to the game's graphics, sound and gameplay, while criticism was directed at its ports to inferior hardware. The game was commercially successful, selling over 20,000 copies.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1988-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:50:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8a/e8a41b636c4132a0d54d79b7cf578022.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 4, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 228, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "Atari ST", "PC"], "developers": ["Rockstar North", "DMA Design"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": ["Psygnosis", "SCE Studio Liverpool"], "esrb_rating": null}
