The aim of the project was to design a prototype that contained puzzles and levels that would help practice and reinforce arithmetic for those playing. It is a simple game where you interact with gems or other things that would affect the total gem value of the player in some way (adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing). The goal of the game is to have the exact total gem value by the end of the level.<br/></p>\n\r\nCREDITS:\r\n<p><strong>PROGRAMMERS:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>https://kiwigamedev.itch.io/<br/></p>\n<p>https://applejacks.itch.io/<br/></p>\n<p>https://jasosantiago.itch.io/</p>\n<p><strong>ARTISTS:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Gonzales, Jono<br/></p>\n<p>San Juan, Jan Carlo<br/></p>\n<p><strong>DESIGNERS:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>https://applejacks.itch.io/<br/></p>\n<p>https://kiwigamedev.itch.io/</p>\n\r\nNOTE:\r\n<p><strong>The game was designed to be played on PC.
