I made this visual novel in a 2D javascript game engine called Ct.js! There is still some story and UI polish I'd love to do in the future, so stay tuned!</p>\n<p>Please note: The audio isn't working properly. I have to convert some files to a different format\u00a0soon! The audio doesn't affect gameplay though.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T16:54:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/283/283fa4c358b6d0a97ddfd76ef2b35dc6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bardic Blaze"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
