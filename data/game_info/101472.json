It's an experimental game set in a very strange environment, which may OR MAY NOT BE all that it seems\" -</em><em>Tom Sykes in PC-Gamer Free games of the week.</em></p><p>On December 2015 the Equilaterus Team participated on the UE4 Game Jam and created The Patashnik Parable in less than 72 hours. Today we are releasing a new version of the original project that puts a little of love to the parts of the game that we couldn't polish, because of the lack of time. <br/><br/>This is a short experimental game that we are proud of. Its unique intension is to bring you a couple of minutes of strange scenarios, hilaryous dialogs and psycodelic travels inside of an arcade machine.</p><p>Play the game for free!
