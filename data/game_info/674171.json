On this particular odd day the player is alone in a park, with a burning hot sun that causes the player to have a heatstroke and as the severity gets higher, he starts to see demons. Thus he must hide in the shadows of trees and the like, but the spring season has just started and the trees have yet to regrow their leaves, providing minimal shade. The player must maneuver around the park while trying to keep their heat stroke at a minimum to avoid summoning additional demons, whilst running away from the (at minimum), initial demon that follows the player closely, and try to escape to a place unknown.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T11:04:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d9/9d99fbf148cf53892e7a1a1887e8b817.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AlModem"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
