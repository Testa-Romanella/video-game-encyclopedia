Since this wish is a big one, Belle Nagareboshi took a while to make it come true, leaving everyone with constantly changing gender while she was working on it. Toyosatomimi no Miko is displeased about this, because the entire reason she became a taoist was to become a shikaisen, and finally have a body that matched their gender. So she, and their partner, Byakuren Hijiri, rush to find who's causing this incident, and make everything return to normal.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Zino - Programmer, Leader, Artist</p>\n<p>Slowbro - Composer</p>\n<p>Taizen - Artist, Composer</p>\n<p>Van - Writer</p>\n<p>Badz - QA</p>\n<p>Ryann1908 - UI Design</p>\n<p>Luminous - Spriter</p>\n<p>Rakaasac - Coder Bird</p>\n<p>Ammy - Lesbiab</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T07:48:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f45/f455cc58f38dfe2f36ffde72e1751452.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zino"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
