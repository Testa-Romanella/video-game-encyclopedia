It was made with Unreal Engine 5.</p>\n<p>The development timeframe was one week.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Pitch</strong></p>\n<p>Play as a seagull, hunt fish and collect toys for your babies.\u00a0<br/>You need to take care of three seagull nests with 12 baby chicks in total.<br/>They're very hungry! If you don't feed them they will DIE! If all chicks are dead, the game is over!<br/>So fly to the ocean and hunt for fish by \"Nosediving\" right when you are on top of them. Make use of your \"Focus View\" to find fish!<br/>Bring fish regularly to every nest.</p>\n<p>Every nest generates points for your personal\u00a0seagull parenting score. The longer you keep the nests alive, the more points you will get.<br/></p>\n<p>Collect toys that are hidden in the world and bring them to a nest to increase its point generation multiplier. Don't forget to bring your chicks food while searching for toys!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Used Assets</strong></p>\n<ul><li>I\u00a0used a Rock that I sculpted two weeks ago for a personal art project.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<ul><li>I\u00a0used a cliff ZBrush source file from <strong>Quixel Megascans</strong>\u00a0as a sculpting base to create my own version of a cliff.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>For all the foliage, except for the grass, I\u00a0used <strong>Quixel Megascans</strong> atlases as a texture base. I changed those textures in Photoshop, made my own foliage models in Blender and also my own foliage materials.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>I\u00a0used the <strong>Oceanology Marketplace Plugin</strong> for the ocean and the background ship.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>I used the <strong>Birds Marketplace Asset</strong> for the Seagull skeletal mesh and the animations. The animation blueprint I built from scratch though.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>I\u00a0used the <strong>Plane and Spaceship Controller Marketplace Asset</strong> as the foundation for the flying movement. I heavily modified it though and extended it with the nosedive feature.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>All the music and all the sound effects in the game are from <strong>Dynamedion (weloveindies.com)\u00a0</strong></li></ul>\n<ul><li>The toy static mesh (locomotive)\u00a0is from the <strong>Toys for Kids Marketplace Asset</strong></li></ul>\n<ul><li>The blood VFX are from the <strong>FXVille Blood Marketplace Asset</strong></li></ul>\n<ul><li>The water splash VFX is from the\u00a0<strong>Niagara_WaterFoam_Splash_Pack Marketplace Asset</strong></li></ul>\n<ul><li>The nest 3D model is an asset I\u00a0bought from<strong> Turbosquid (alexkovalev)</strong></li></ul>\n<ul><li>The fish model is from the <strong>Beefy Bass Marketplace Asset</strong></li></ul>\n<ul><li>And the settings menu is from the<strong> Blueprint Settings Menu Marketplace Asset by Kekdot</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Everything else was made from scratch!</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Thanks for checking out Moewenpick :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T10:22:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc7/fc7bbd37417a86ebc62bd615553319d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 228, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["swagentrotz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
