To your horror you find it infested by skittering... crawling... <strong><em>SPIDERS!!!</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>\u26a0\u00a0<strong>ARACHNOPHOBIA WARNING\u00a0</strong>\u26a0</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>How To Play:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Move vertically:</strong> A &amp; D / Left &amp; right arrow keys</p>\n<p><strong>Move down:</strong> S / Down arrow key</p>\n<p>To play the game you must descend through as many floors as possibly. The level is infinite and the only way to stop is to be consumed by spiders.\u00a0 Spiders will move erratically and not-very-intelligently but once they see you they will charge at you with ferocious speeds! Another lethal and scary thing is the mounds of sharp spikes littered around the level. One touch of the spike and... <strong>GAME OVER</strong>. There is one more variant of spider, the spider that sits upon a web will not attack but instead will shoot cobwebs at you to slow you down and make it easier for its fellow arachnids to find there lunch. The last thing is the spider eggs, these will spawn 10 spiders then disappear, you can also walk into them to destroy the nest so make sure it doesn't get out of hand!</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>LRD - the game!<br/></p>\n<p>KPD - assisting and bug fixing!
