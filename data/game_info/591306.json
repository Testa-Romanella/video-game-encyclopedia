So in Drilly Billy, you control both a platformer character called Billy, who is trying to get to the bottom of an out of control drill to turn it off, and control the drill itself affectionately called Drilly, dodging obstacles like rocks and fossils which slowly start appearing more often. As billy you will face platforming and out of control robots which you can kill by jumping on their heads when they are not electrified. You lose if Drilly gets hit 10 times, and you win when you get billy to the big red button at the bottom of the level.\r\n</p>\n<p>You use WASD to control Billy and the arrow keys to control Drilly. Escape on the game screen quits the application.\r\n</p>\n<p>Note for the source code/files, it was made in Unity 2019.4.20f1\r\n</p>\n<p>Robb.\r\n</p><p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T04:43:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/429/4294e400f4f6203cbedea124bef7cdaf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Urban_Elf"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
