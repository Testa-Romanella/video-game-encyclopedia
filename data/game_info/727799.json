You have finished all your studies, passed all your exams and turned in all your projects. The horror of a disgruntled professor telling you that he disagrees with your modern approach - threatening you with a failing grade - is thankfully a chapter you can close.</p>\n<p>Although, as you're lamenting about the suffrage you had to endure you receive an email from Sharon - the senior secretary of the dean's office. To your powerless lack of surprise, she had misplaced a few of your study credits and \"doesn't have the time to handle student affairs for them\". The years of experience with the Kafkaesque system that is the university administration tell you one thing. It's now or never, act quickly lest you will be doomed to be a student forever.</p>\n<p>You quickly end the second shift of your 9-9\u00a0\u00a0job and hurry to campus grounds. As you enter the University building you see that everyone had already left for their academic holidays. Your trusty calculator in hand, you should be in and out before you succumb to the cursed halls. Yet, as you collect your credits you cannot shake the feeling that you are not really alone...</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>We recommend playing this in a dark, quiet room with a set of headphones on.</p>\r\nControlActionLeft mouse buttonOpen\u00a0doors by holding and dragging them open (much like in real life)CBring up your trusty calculator, a wise friend who will always point in the right directionFToggle your handy flashlightWASDMovement keysLeft shiftSprint while moving (careful, all that beer\u00a0did not do your stamina well)EscUnlock the cursor from the game\r\nAbout the game\r\n<p>Inspired by the theme \"Horror games of 2015\", a team of two traumatized graduates (Kornelos &amp; julian's)\u00a0would like to share their story on their academic experiences.
