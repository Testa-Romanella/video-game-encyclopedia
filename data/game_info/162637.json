Appreciate strange beauty.</p>\n\n<p><em>Time Tunnel</em> is mostly a visual prototype. The actual game mechanics are lackluster, but I\u00a0spent a lot of time tinkering with visual elements, most notably, the drip.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Class:\u00a0Pixel Prototype</p>\n<p>Prompt:\u00a0Blue</p>\n<p>Postmortem: I think the game looks really cool, especially in the pico-8 client. The way most of the visuals are done involves never really clearing the screen and then continuing to read off of the pixel buffer. This allows me to create a sense of duration and change over time. Ultimately, I want the gameplay to have some aspect that encourages initially covering the screen in colors, but then staying away from certain parts in order to give the drip more time to work.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d55/d55ec46749a3c29f63ad66943fb15991.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JoshMelnick"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
