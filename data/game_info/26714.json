Possessing incredible combat skills, you must use her \n      abilities to find survivors before nightfall. Other objectives include \n      setting traps, collecting items and using various weapons to defeat \n      unknown creatures. The more you battle, the more skills you gain. The \n      danger level increases at nighttime, so you will need the help of \n      survivors in the camp to protect it for a course of seven days. While \n      you wait for the rescue team to arrive, you must fight off vicious \n      creatures that are starving for their next meal.\n    </p><p>\n      (Content available in English only.)\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3d/a3def9d5592322188cf2da123c4991a0.jpg", "website": "http://www.cir-ent.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 232, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["CIRCLE Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
