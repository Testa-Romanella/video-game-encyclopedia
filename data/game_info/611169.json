Each player has an identical but symmetrical course that they must traverse and find their way to the end before their opponent. The twist is that each player has control of the obstacles and weapons on their opponent's side to prevent them from doing so. Standing on or touching objects with the same color as a trap will trigger the trap. <br/></p>\n<p>Keyboard Controls:<br/> <strong>Player 1</strong><br/> 'A' and 'D' = left and right<br/> 'space' = jump<br/> <strong>Player 2<br/> </strong> 'left' and 'right' = left and right<br/> 'up' = jump</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T07:31:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/383/383ec34d4bcf2fd0e19e1abbef0df0ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Isolation Interactive"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
