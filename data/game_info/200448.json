The game is called Meme Simulator because I changed a bunch of textures to memes. I made the game with this tutorial by Brackeys.\u00a0 <br/><br/><strong>Controls: </strong>Use 'A' to move left and 'B' to move right.<br/></p>\n<p>The ground is not supposed to fade to the colour of the sky so if you know why it is happening could you please tell me in a comment below. It does not happen when I run it as an exe on my PC or in Unity. <br/></p>\n<p>The \"Quit\" button at the end is a remnant from when it was an exe. It does nothing. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d7/0d7a766cb18a7847c98382d288e6b431.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FlyingTurtle"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
