Unfortunately, being a snowflake, you don't have a whole lot of control over where you go, and you'll melt if you stay off the snow or in the sun for too long. To get to the finish line, you have to race to the top of the mountain before you melt. Good luck!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Made from TheFAV: Falcoris, Ali (earth418), &amp; Vinikholas</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T05:12:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84a/84a5de90afa3f61d59d9911710380019.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vinikholas"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
