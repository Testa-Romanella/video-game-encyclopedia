In this game the fish moves automatically with the controls of space to jump. You must collect water drops in order to refuel your water bar. You loose water over time along with running into cacti, snakes, and vultures. Your goal is to reach the oasis in order to survive. The only thing standing in your way is the horrors of the desert. Good Luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T06:50:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/337/337af6158c3ca4a0618ec8e66161b317.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bp026"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
