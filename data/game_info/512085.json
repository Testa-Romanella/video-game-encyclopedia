But your fragile, cardboard-box body filled with packing peanuts doesn't last very long without tape! Be careful!</p>\r\nHOW TO PLAY\r\n<p>Press the \"SOLO\" button on the main menu. Use WSAD to move, and your mouse pointer to aim and punch. On mobile (Coming Soon), you can hold down on the screen to move, and tap to punch.\u00a0In the bottom-right you can see your score, and in the bottom-left, you see a self-portrait that indicates your health (You will appear more damaged). Use tape to heal yourself as it randomly appears on the playing field. Pick up BOOMBOXES and throw them at enemies to wipe out hordes of them!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T04:15:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39a/39a80b3c520ad69ea7b5e463d5e811bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LikWid-Official"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
