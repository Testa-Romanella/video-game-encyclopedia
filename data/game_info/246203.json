I\u00a0have been working on it since October 2016, so it will mark 2 years soon(not counting time spent on other projects...) but this game has a lot of features implemented. It is super stable and already supports 4 players locally (but online character systems will be implemented further down the line once all character features &amp; abilities are operational). Working with Unreal Engine, everything is easy, but it takes a lot of time, and I am just one person. I\u00a0plan on releasing this for 20$ once v1.0 is live so get it while its free and help me with feedback and bug reports.</p>\n<p>follow\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/RuleTheWorldGame/</p>\n<p>https://www.facebook.com/ImagineGamesOrlando/<br/></p>\n<p>Story:</p>\n<p>The background of the game is set a couple of years in the future, but the exact story is yet to be revealed... Mutant soldiers / some super powered and others barely, and animals have been infected as well. Everything is hostile, and you are our last hope, as usual in games. The character will be betrayed, discover love, friendship, and over come the evil powers that try to destroy this planet. Or something. Play it now!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/500/5008cdc8e5732f30fe259526a2a95678.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 236, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ImagineGames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
