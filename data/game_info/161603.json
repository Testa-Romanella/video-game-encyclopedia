{"id": 161603, "slug": "walk-sim", "name": "Walk Sim", "name_original": "Walk Sim", "description": "<p>Walk Sim is a game that takes the idea of a \"walking simulator\" game, and multiplys it by 100,000,000. You have to pay $1.00 (or more if you want) for early access. I'm going to update this game every once in a while, so keep your eyes peeled. Soon I'm going to make a kickstarter page for this game, and when I have I'll put a link on this page. Anyway, I hope you enjoy if you buy the game, and if you don't buy the game, then have fun playing other games. Either way, have a nice day!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/369/3693fea52100652c587001d4575e5a77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GamingNinja"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
