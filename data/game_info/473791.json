The theme of this jam was \"Cafe\".</p>\n<p>The Grind is a frantic arcade-styled game inspired by classics such as Tapper and Burger Time; with more modern 3D\u00a0graphics and post processing effects.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is a Top-Down score-attack game set in \"The Grind\"\u00a0Cafe. You play as a single Barista who is in charge of not only making Coffees, Teas, and cakes, but must also wait the tables where impatient customers sit and wait.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Take orders and bring them to customers in time to score points. But beware that customers will grow impatient and leave in annoyance if you fail to bring them their order in time. Losing 5 customers will result in a Game Over...</p>\n<p>Aim for a high score and be quick on your toes to master this fun little game!</p>\n<p>I really hope you all enjoy this small-scale project.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>This project was built in Unreal Engine 4.23</p>\n<p>Modelling and UV Unwrapping was completed using Blender.</p>\n<p>Textures were painted in Medibang Paint Pro.
