The scene is explorable from a first person perspective, with an expansive map that allows for some scenic viewpoints and hidden areas.<br/></p>\n<p>This game has an important focus on atmospheric exploration and immersion. Use the game menus to customize the scene's lighting and switch between your choice of soundtrack. Dim the lights in your room, turn up the volume and explore the scene at your own pace. This game can be fully explored in about 15 minutes or more.<br/></p>\n<p>- Overcast/Rainy Weather alternate map ($2) -<br/>Donating $2 or more will give you access to a rebuilt version of the scene in wet weather, allowing a different feel/atmosphere. I created this after the full version of the game was built, and was surprised at how well the lighting/rain work with all the elements in the scene. I'd almost consider this the definitive way to experience the game, thanks in advance if you choose to try this out!</p>\n<p>Thanks so much for playing/downloading!<br/>I made this entire project on my own in unreal engine 4\u00a0with borrowed assets from various sources, including the Unreal Marketplace and Quixel Megascans.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you can't donate, checking out my socials helps just as much. also it'd be great to hear feedback if you have any!<br/>follow me\u00a0@cavesrd\u00a0on instagram for info about new scenes<br/>scene showcases and music on\u00a0youtube\u00a0<br/>contact info and everything else on my website</p>\n<p>check out my previous explorable scene!<br/>cavesrd.itch.io/forestvalley</p>\n<p>I built this scene on a mid range pc and achieve around 30fps.<br/>My specs:<br/>2GB AMD Graphics<br/>Intel i5 3.2GHz<br/>8GB RAM<br/>Windows 10 64bit</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c6/6c6e2bf20526448d66fc57ebb893f3cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 304, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["caves rd"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
