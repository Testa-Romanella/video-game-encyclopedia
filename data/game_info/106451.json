We call it a \u201cphysics-based dating sim.\u201d It was important to me that we toss the idea of what\u2019s typically considered a \u201cdating sim\u201d by the wayside; I didn\u2019t want a lot of text with multiple endings and torrid affairs. I wanted to make something that accurately portrayed the feeling of dating\u2014 the frustration of trying to find someone who fits with you, the twitchy anticipation of trying to read social cues on a first date when you don\u2019t even know what to look for, the process of finding out how you and your partner are both different people than you assumed. I hope that comes across.\u00a0Rock Paper Shotgun thought it did:</p><p><em>While a lot of the entries I tried out ended up being \u2013 at least, to some extent \u2013 fairly literal, How To Be Happy dove headfirst into the bracing waters of gleeful abstraction. It is, however, quite excellent for it. Admittedly, it\u2019s not the hardest metaphor to crack (over the course of history, relationships have been equated to puzzles nearly as often as they\u2019ve been tied to teenage vampire drama), but the various stages of this one are what make it. Gentle sound effects, nerve-wracking uncertainty, frantically mashing your mouse to hold it all together. In some ways, How To Be Happy nails the feeling of dating/being in a relationship better than any dating sim. Which, I suppose, is why it\u2019s often unfair.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a5/6a56b7e7f1313c826400fee656390c50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Elizabeth Sampat"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
