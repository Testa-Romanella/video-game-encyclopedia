Seems easy enough, right?<br/><br/>Well ... try to get the world's highest score and we'll talk again, okay?<h3>Features</h3><br/><ul><li> Super simple \"just one more try\" gameplay<br/></li><li> Play with keyboard or gamepad<br/></li><li> Steam Leaderboards <br/></li><li> 12 Steam achievement<br/></li><li> dreamy licensed music by Imphenzia</li></ul><br/>Liner Notes:<br/><br/>Yes, this is an obvious knockoff of Dodge by serial asset flippers INFINITY BRIDGE ... err, INFINITE BRIDGE. I was bored one day and wanted to do some coding so I remade that game - only without using an asset kit and with full Steam implementation. And for free because that's all this game is worth. I had a Steam Direct slot gathering dust anyway so why not?<br/><br/>Speaking of asset flips, I'm trying to fight them via my Steam group, Asset Flip Reviews. Join if you like and if you want to support the cause maybe buy the completely optional (and useless) DLC for this game? All revenue goes towards writing more reviews to help other gamers avoid paying money for games they shouldn't have paid money for in the first place. Unfortunately you can't review games without actually buying them so yeah ... it would be greatly appreciated.
