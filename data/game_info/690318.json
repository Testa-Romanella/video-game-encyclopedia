Here we see an apple tree, as you press play a chain reaction occurs of apples falling out of the tree, triggering the next apple and so on.

The game gives the player the feeling that someone has created the system to collect food.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T11:12:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/940/94096a1005e67cabbe66a45b4c25f91e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nicola.carsley"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
