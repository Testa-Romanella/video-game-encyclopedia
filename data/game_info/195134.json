Very simple platformer game that was made for LudumDare 40. My first game development project that I have ever submitted anywhere. I used Corgi Engine 2D as a framework and stripped out most of its original components to create \"mostly\" original art and animations. Only utilized a few of their actual assets because of time constraints for the LudumDare.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/582/582d7f1e117840f89aa0aee3edc52890.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Whitestrife"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
