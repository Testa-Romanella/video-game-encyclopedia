Playing as a bomb sent to destroy a nest of alien insects, fight off the hordes until you can detonate! But beware, getting hit by the electromagnetic pulses of the aliens will set back your fuse, causing you to need to wait longer for detonation. <br/><br/>Controls:<br/>WASD - Movement<br/>R/Right Click - Reload</p>\n<p>Escape - Pause</p>\n<p>The project has around 2,000 lines of code and about 10 days of work put into it. All art and code is original, despite some being inspired. Credits of all musicians and audio providers utilized are ingame, as well as being linked at the bottom of this page.</p>\n<p>I may work on this further in the future, under a different project name. This project taught me a lot about vector math, artificial intelligence, and level design, and I'm pretty proud of what I cranked out.</p>\n<p>There are some known collision issues, but they weren't able to be removed by the deadline. It is unlikely they will affect gameplay, but you never know. Consider this a warning. Additionally, the game does *not* like using the 'Back to Menu' button. Try using that button then reloading the page.<br/></p>\n<p>My goal for this was to not get last place as I did last jam I participated in, lmao. I worked a lot on the gunplay and movement, to provide good feedback and smooth control for a good outline. <br/></p>\n<p>Thank you for checking out my game!<br/></p>\n<p>Audio:<br/>https://pixabay.com/music/synthwave-sunset-rider-112776/</p>\n<p>https://pixabay.com/music/synthwave-sunset-drive-dreamwave-118479/</p>\n<p>https://kronbits.itch.io/freesfx</p>\n<p>https://f8studios.itch.io/snakes-authentic-gun-sounds</p>\n<p>https://f8studios.itch.io/snakes-second-authentic-gun-sounds-pack<br/></p>\n<p>Tileset inspired by:</p>\n<p>https://trevor-pupkin.itch.io/tech-dungeon-roguelite<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T22:21:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ef/9ef91c21f82d62f8a92b0c0ee96b6be0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Carnoraptor"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
