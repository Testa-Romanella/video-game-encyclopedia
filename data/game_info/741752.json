In that level it has several enemies.</p>Enemy List\r\n<ul><li><strong>Turrets </strong>- Most Common Enemies, they don't move and shoot you.\u00a0 They typically block your paths in parkour sections of the map. Drops health pickups around half the time.</li><li><strong>Gunners </strong>- Only a few within the game, these look exactly the the same as the turrets but they will run toward you shooting at you.\u00a0 They hit harder and tank more hits than the Turrets.</li><li>Eye Suckers - The weakest enemy of the game, but the fastest.\u00a0 They will fly toward you and suck the life force out of you.\u00a0 They only take 1 hp at a time but travel in packs most of the time or follow the Grell.</li><li>Grell - The toughest and hardest hitting enemies of the game, they like to hide in dank, dark caves.\u00a0 They normally are followed by a series of Eye Suckers.</li></ul>\r\nWeapon List<ol><li>Knife - A quick melee weapon to switch to for close combat</li><li>Pistol - A basic firearm, and the main weapon you will use.</li><li>Still not found. - Can you find it? ; )</li></ol><p>The game didn't follow the theme to much, but I think it captured the limitation pretty well.\u00a0 Most of the game you are in bullet hell, bullets are flying from almost everywhere.</p>\n\r\nThis Game is in an incomplete state, but this is as far as I plan to take this project.\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Pawel \"Nmn\" Zarczynski - Various Enemy Assets</p>\n<p>LittleMartian - First Tileset</p><p>Jesten\u00a0- Main Tileset<br/></p>\n<p>N3B - Grunt Sound</p>\n<p>Michel Baradari - Monster Noises (Grell's Sound)</p>\n\n\n<p>My Main Project!\u00a0\u00a0Within 3d - RetroFPS</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T04:14:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f8/0f89aca709225c8f9064bc14abdf1b19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SourlessCream"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
