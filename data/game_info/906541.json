Each level can be solved using logical reasoning and basic math operations. The levels get progressively more challenging and there is a total of 20 levels for now.</p>\n<p>How to play:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Each level is consisted of rows and columns of square. Every row and column of adjacent squares\u00a0is a mathematical sequence. Some of these tiles are left blank,\u00a0the objective is to fill them properly. To do so you must detect the sequence of each row or column considering the visible numbers.</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Click on the square you want to edit and type the number you think is correct using either your computer\u00a0keyboard or the built in controller. When you fill out all empty squares click \"check\" to see if you completed the level. If not you can receive a hint by clicking the lightbulb button on the top right corner .</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T10:18:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/103/1038a8042f3aec4a41e0e4f0c969e4de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AwesomePapa31"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
