In <strong>Face It</strong>, abstract concepts are shaped into gameplay. Darker emotions like fear and depression are monsters and traps, while brighter concepts like <strong>HOPE</strong>, <strong>VISION</strong> and <strong>LOVE</strong> are the powers you need to beat the levels.<br/><br/><strong>Go</strong> on a metaphorical journey of self-discovery. <br/><strong>Defeat</strong> Ghosts with the power of your inner light.<br/><strong>Avoid</strong>  dangerous traps.<br/><strong>Find</strong> your way through mazes and puzzles. <br/><strong>Discover</strong> Some of the many true meanings of magic.<br/><br/>The levels represents dark aspects of human consciousness, like Fear or Attachment. By beating a level, you shall find brighter states of mind, like Love or Truth.<br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/>As you might pass through the levels, you may unlock the magical sigils and symbols that represent those new brighter states of mind. <br/><br/>The sigils are symbolic representations of the magician's desired outcome. They are symbols created to cut through the walls of the conscious thought and affect directly the unconscious mind. It's at some extent, similar to subliminal messages.<br/><br/><br/><br/>One of the techniques we use to create sigils is a Sigilization method created by Austin Osman Spare, who was a magician, as well as a painter and graphical artist. The technique consists in writing spells with your intents, and agglutinate the letters to reduce the written statements in abstract symbols. The conscious mind may not remember the meaning of the symbols, but the subconscious keeps the memories about the symbol being made. This way, the symbols and their intents charge each other, exponentially increasing their influence on the mind.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-29T09:44:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/952/952f2ba2f3aad29e3030886f49ab1860.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 1.56, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 8, "owned": 446, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 6}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 16, "ratings_count": 18, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 18, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["4EversGames", "Tl\u00f6n Studios", "Athanor Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["4EversGames", "Gamestorming"], "esrb_rating": null}
