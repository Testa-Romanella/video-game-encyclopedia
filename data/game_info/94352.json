By hot air balloon, of course. You will have to master navigating the airways, and explore the world to find the means to venture ever further.</p>\n<p>The Aurora Wager was originally created for the 7DRL Jam in 2013. We're really busy working on <em>Volo </em>at the moment, but someday we hope to give this game the love it deserves.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Martijn Zandvliet @m_zandvliet - Design, Programming, Terrain</li><li>Robin Vink @no_twitter - Design, 3D Art</li><li>Michael Manning @mikmanner - Sound Effects, Music</li></ul>\n\n<p>Do you dream of flying?
