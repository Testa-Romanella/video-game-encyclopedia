This game has an emphasis on playability in a small, limited mobility space while still giving the player a sense of speed and maneuverability. With a board at their feet and two grapple hands at their disposal, players zip down sandy slopes, jump off planks, rocks, and boosts, and use their grapples to propel themselves forward and upward.</p>\r\nDevelopment\r\n<p>This was a university project\u00a0developed over the course of four months in Unreal Engine 4 with an Oculus Quest 2 headset. I made 3D assets in Blender, textures in Gimp, and sound effects and music in Logic Pro (mostly with\u00a0Massive). <em>Sandboard</em> draws inspiration from sand surfing in games like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Journey</em> as well as grappling in VR games such as <em>Swarm</em> and <em>Spider-Man: Far From Home Virtual Reality.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T19:01:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25d/25d6071977f6bdb42c4a4154a10ecc71.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Elliot George Mann"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
