He let his imagination run wild long before modern escapist outlets. This game is designed to honor him, his ideas and his legacy. \u00a0So this is definitely not one of those serious games where you learn a lot. This is just fun. Oh, and a lot of reading, more than is common in such a short game. The game consists of only three levels, but I think they can provide some entertainment for some time. <br/></p>\n<p>Please note that I designed the game for a 1920x1080 resolution. \u00a0I have not tried other resolutions, so please keep that in mind if things look weirder than probably planned.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, I would love to know if this game works on Apple systems. If somebody could give me feedback about that, I'd be grateful.</p>\n<p>Most important of all, enjoy the game! I hope you'll have as much fun playing as I had coding/planning/staying up far too long ...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-30T03:14:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d91/d91d98e39c56af879097593c1ed84ab1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vh-games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
