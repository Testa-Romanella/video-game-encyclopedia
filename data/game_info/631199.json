I may come back to it down the line, but no guarantees.</p>\n<p>This project was severely overscoped by me among other detrimental factors. I have decided to publish it anyway in case somebody wishes to see it. I consider it a learning experience as I move forward with other projects. I only ask that you please keep this stuff in mind. <strong>This is not in any way a finished project</strong>. It is a demonstration of a concept and the theory-crafting of a story.</p>\n<p>Should you download this, you should note that there is no music or sound effects save for the default spell effects Danmakufu comes packaged with. There are also various bugs regarding the text and the occasional erroneous bullet-spawning.</p>\n<p>All assets used are either in the public domain, created by me, or are part of the Danmakufu default package.</p>\n<p>I'd also like to take the opportunity to thank Sparen, without whose tutorials I wouldn't have even gotten this far.\u00a0If you look through the files, you may see occasional assets used from Sparen's tutorials, though I believe I cleared most of them out of the playable product.</p>\n<p>The replay screen does not work. If you click it, simply press 'X' to go back out.</p>\n<p>The debug options are enabled, and the player is given 98 lives so that if you decide to take a look, you can at least see the full extent of what was done.</p>\n<p>Controls are as follows:</p>\n<ul><li>Z to shoot/select option</li><li>X to bomb/go back</li><li>Arrow keys to move</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T04:55:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5cb/5cbd48d009d4afa7cae912fda9b42b0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cyvo Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
