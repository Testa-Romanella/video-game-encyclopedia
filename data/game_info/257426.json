As the killer, your mission is simple: kill all the survivors before they escape. To do so, you have various special skills and power-ups to help you hunt down and kill each of your victims.<br/><br/>Playing as the survivors, on the other hand, is much more complicated, because there's nothing to help you except your ability to hide. You'll have to work as a team if you want to get out alive, escaping in one of four ways: calling the police, fixing a broken car, killing the killer, or opening the door of the room where you're trapped. To unlock each of these options, you'll have to complete a series of tasks in the right order.<br/><br/>Every time you win, you earn coins that you can invest in unlocking new skins for both the survivors and the killers.<br/><br/>At the moment, there aren't too many players on the servers, so you'll need to get a group of friends together if you want to really enjoy Friday Night Multiplayer and everything it has to offer.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-09T04:20:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/482/482c4046804d45f69f875f14821f6f25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Bachir Terdjat"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Bachir Terdjat"], "esrb_rating": null}
