Not cool bro. Its time to get up and work those legs as you demolish those zombies with your massive arms. No one disturbs the pump ever again.</p>\n\n<p>This game didn't really get far enough to include everything I wanted, or really the story that was going to go along with the theme; but hey, its a game! Maybe not the best one, but I'm not too disappointed for only having a week and staying up until 6 am.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once the game jams over I plan to add all of the stuff that didn't make it into the game, but for now I appreciate any feedback and let me know whether you thought it was ok or a garbage fire.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Cody Taylor - All coding, modeling, and designing.</p>\n<p>Kai Ford - All of the super sick music and sound effects.</p>\n<p>Melanie Najera - The super cool thumbnail and for putting up with my shit.</p>\n\n<p>This game was made in under a week for the Brackeys Game Jam 2022.1.
