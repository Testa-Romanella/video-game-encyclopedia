Collect light orbs, find weapons, dodge enemies... stay alive until the dark night is over.</p>\n<p>--------------</p>\r\nPLEASE NOTE! You can run the game directly in the browser, but I strongly recommend that you download the native Win/Mac version (download links towards the bottom of the page).\r\n<p>--------------</p>\n<p>This game was creating during the month of September, 2021, as an entry for One Game A Month #4. The theme of the game jam was <em>Going Dark</em>. I took a very literal approach to it, and filled it with blood thirsty skeletons.</p>\n<p>I will probably continue working on this a bit longer, as I totally ran out of time for this jam. I'd like to add a few different weapons and enemies, some powerups, a <em>menu</em>... But no promises. :)</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>A,W,S,D to move</li><li>Mouse to aim</li><li>Left click to shoot</li><li>Space to jump</li><li>Left shift to sprint</li></ul>\r\nQuality settings\r\n<p>You can choose different quality settings if the game doesn't run smoothly enough. I will ad a proper menu soon, but for now:</p>\n<ul><li>Right Shift + 1: Low quality</li><li>Right Shift + 2: Medium quality<br/>\n</li><li>Right Shift + 3: High quality</li><li>Right Shift + P: Toggle post-processing</li></ul>\n<p>If you're having performance issues, make sure post-processing is off (i.e. no glow in orbs and weapons), and choose low or medium quality.</p>\n<p>You can also lower the screen resolution, but you'll have to do that in your operating system, there's no in-game option for that.</p>\r\nDevelopment team\r\n<ul><li>Gonzalo Perez de la Ossa: game design, programming, level design<br/>\n</li><li>Sarah\u00a0Strachan: music\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>This is the second collaboration with Sarah (see also One Shot Ball). I wanted to give the game an old-school FPS feel, sort of a tribute to the original Doom. Sarah's music totally fits this intention. :)</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>All models, SFX and VFX are free resources found online. This game would not exist without the generosity of the authors.
