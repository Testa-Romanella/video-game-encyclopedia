You have to follow the targets as they move around. The range within which you can hear them is narrowed down gradually, complicating your task. The whole place is patrolled by guards who can detect you as you run from one hiding spot to another.\r\n  </p>\n<p>I was curious about how this mechanics from a 3D world could work in a zero-dimensional world of a text game.\r\n  </p>\n<p>In <em>Keeping Up with the Buzzards</em>, you are a present-day assassin eavesdropping on two executives of Bizarre, a large gaming company. You shift between hiding places on their way by solving math puzzles within the given time frame. If you type in the correct response, your character reaches another hiding spot and continues to eavesdrop; otherwise they get exposed and fail the task. \r\n  </p>\n<p>Can you hear the whole talk? It will help much to have a calculator ready at hand!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T04:40:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95d/95d6bc177370740590c2dc35ea53ef8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["wolfgames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
