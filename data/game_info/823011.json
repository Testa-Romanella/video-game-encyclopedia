You guide a cute companion out of a dungeon, grabbing random upgrades as you go. Just one little dungeon level with two types of enemies and a boss. My entry for the GMTK 2022 Jam. <br/></p>\n<p>A lot of the art was already made by my friend Olivia, and she pitched the idea of a long escort mission with some sickeningly cute thing through hell. That evolved into this roguelike! I'm planning on putting it on Steam depending on how well development goes, but I'm pretty excited. The title is because, in the demo, you play as a catboy skeleton! In the future, this might be an unlockable or late game thing. For now, enjoy this cute short game where you escort a cute companion through this hell dungeon. There's several upgrades to be found, 2 additional defensive abilities (one that ricochets enemy projectiles and a dash that destroys them), 2 additional attack abilities (a line of ice shards and an upgrade to your basic attack), and 2 additional utility abilities (passive regen as well as a heal that speeds you up for a short time). And several smaller upgrades along the way, like passive health, damage, or speed increases. All 3 rolled at random, by the dice :P</p>\n<p>When you start your run, you will randomly be assigned a companion: an egg, a cute cat, a cute hellhound, or a cute Mimic treasure chest! Each one will allow you to enable an optional challenge mode in the starting room, not for the faint of heart!</p>\n<p>The Egg will unlock the Challenge of the Shell, sacrificing health for attack damage.</p>\n<p>The Cat will unlock the Challenge of the Claw, sacrificing damage for speed.</p>\n<p>The Hellhound will unlock the Challenge of the Howl, sacrificing speed for health.</p>\n<p>The Mimic will unlock the Challenge of Greed, sacrificing your health, damage, and speed, but increasing the rate at which you gain gold.</p>\n\n<p>Be careful! Your companions have a hitbox as well, and if they're hit by an attack, you'll lose health!</p>\n\n<p>Also, don't dawdle in the dungeon. Monsters will grow in power every couple minutes!<br/></p>\n\n<p>All programming and design done by yours truly, all 2D art done by my friend Olivia Katz, all particle effects developed by Synty Studios, all 3D models done by Runemark Studio, the sound effects were done by Dark Fantasy Studio, the background ambience was done by Alec Weesner, and the skill icons were made by Poneti on the Unity Asset Store. <br/></p>\n<p>CONTROLS:<br/>WASD to move</p><p>Aim with Mouse<br/></p>\n<p>Left Click to shoot</p>\n<p>E to interact with objects</p>\n<p>Mouse 1 (Right Click) to fire shards of ice (when unlocked)</p>\n<p>F to shield bash (when unlocked)</p>\n<p>1 to ricochet nearby projectiles for a brief time (when unlocked)</p>\n<p>2 to heal/speed up for a short time (when unlocked<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T20:11:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/957/957c370127b2776584a45639015dfb84.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Megalandrys"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
