New rooms are procedurally generated every time you play, meaning you'll have to be on your guard for every randomly-placed enemy, elite, boss, and treasure chest you'll come across.<br/><br/>Each room gets progressively bigger, harder, and more rewarding the further you go.<br/><br/><strong>The concept is simple yet hard to master:</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>Raise your shield to block enemy attacks.<br/></li><li>Lower your shield and strike your foes when the timing is right.<br/></li><li>Jump or move to avoid traps, or use your shield to reduce damage taken.<br/></li><li>Find the key to advance to the next room.<br/></li><li>Collect weapons, outfits, headgear, and shields of various rarities to aid your journey.<br/></li><li>Turn in souls from slain enemies to increase your base stats and passive abilities.<br/></li><li>Stay alive as long as you can!</li></ul><br/>Brace yourself as you learn the quirks of each foe, trap, and room type so you can strive for that \"one more run\" high-score victory! Each dungeon is infinite in length so it's up to you to push your limits; local scoreboards and online leaderboards let you track your greatest efforts.<br/><br/>Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
