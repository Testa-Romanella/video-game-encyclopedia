But she will be! At least that is what she set out for when one fateful night she snuck past the frightful (but currently dozing) Librarian into the Forbidden section of the Library.   The lingering magic seethed in the very dust hanging in the air gave an eerie glow to the place. She tiptoed her way towards the thick Great Book of Forbidden Spells, almost twitching from the anticipation. But as soon as she opened the Book, it blasted from her grasp, since the book was finally free! Unravelling from their physical bindings, the spells of pure magic flew in every direction of the Library. Now she was in trouble! If she couldn't find all the pages before the Librarian woke up, she'd be scolded until her ears went red. And if the Principal heard of this... They might expel her! Or worse, use sarcasm!</p>\n\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Guide Aava through the Library maze, whack enemies with your Broom and find the Exit.<br/></p>\n<p>This is an early demo of the game, made during the Global Game Jam 2021.\u00a0</p>\r\nGame Controls\r\n<p>Game is intended to be played with a controller (in-game instructions use PlayStation controller format).<br/></p>\n<p>You can also play with keyboard and mouse using\u00a0WASD to move and\u00a0click with mouse to attack.</p>\r\nDownload and Install\r\n<p>Download and extract the zip file, then run \"Lost In Tome and Space.exe\".</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Made by:\u00a0Sampsa Kaskela,\u00a0Matti M\u00e4nty,\u00a0Sade Sir\u00e9n,\u00a0Joonas T\u00f6rm\u00e4nen</p>\n<p>Music by: Janay Maisano</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T05:28:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/644/644ad199942ded1dc4385cce5bc0aca4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vainary"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
