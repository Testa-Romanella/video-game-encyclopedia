Instead of space char (' ') please enter %ss% (whole list of special characters on the right side of menu)</strong><br/><br/>Have you ever wondered why your keys on keyboard are constantly being blocked? No? Don't worry, you will get your answer anyway!<br/><br/>Every roach knows that the most important thing is to find a safe place to live. Your roach-friends told you to first consider well-hidden locations. Unfortunately, it turns out that keyboard is not the best home in the world. Still, you have to survive in this harsh environment when key-ceiling is constantly trying to crush you.<br/><br/>In the game, you control such a roach and try to survive. Block keys by collecting and throwing fragments of food and ultimately render keyboard useless. Your roach-friends will try to help you but beware - their throwns will stun you if you get hit by accident.<br/><br/>- Control THE ROACH (' ')<br/>- Block keys<br/>- Avoid falling \"ceiling\"<br/>- Collect food fragments and get points<br/><br/>- Get one more friend and play 2-player mode when you will fight for points with each other!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b8/3b864c03bd3aaba5a49ba64d74a37259.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Thirrash"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
