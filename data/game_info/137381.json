X to start the game.</p><p>Blast enemy eyeball ships over the open ocean in glorious monochrome! Featuring a variety of shooting patterns and an unforgiving 15 levels that are not for the faint of heart. Made for #gbjam 4.</p><p>Eyes Over Ocean is a game based in the bullet hell genre. Destroy the enemy boss to defeat each level. Enemy ships can only be damaged by shooting their eye centers, and will die once they have been hit enough times. Keeping with the earth-based theme, most enemy fire is affected by gravity, and thus will arc as it flies through the air. Keeping track of everything going on is quite complex and very difficult. You only have 3 lives to get you through all 15 levels, so make them count!</p><p>Good luck, and thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2e/d2ec3838a10bcce5b8aab23ddfa0eae3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BlueCandleGames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
