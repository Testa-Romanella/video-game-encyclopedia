Different doors are blocking the way, that need to be unlocked to proceed as fast as possible. Each door will give a different benefit, and a combination of them is the key to succeed .. or fail.<br/><br/>To open a door, a puzzle is presented, where pieces of a key have to be rotated and merged together to open the door. The further you run, the more difficult the key puzzles become.<br/><br/>There are three different modes:<br/><br/><ul><li> Normal Mode: Score is increasing the more you survive. It decreases the more you stay idle in a room without picking a door. There's a set amount of rooms to complete before reaching the end.<br/></li><li> Endless Mode: Score increases with each room that is completed. There is no end to the amount of rooms presented.<br/></li><li> Random Mode: Each door has a specific score as a reward when opened. Rooms and their rewards spawn at random.</li></ul><br/>The available benefits from the doors are:<br/><br/><ul><li> Green doors: Increase running speed.<br/></li><li> Purple doors: Increase lock-picking skills, which makes opening new doors easier.<br/></li><li> Blue doors: Gives extra chances before losing.<br/></li><li> Brown doors provide no direct benefit, apart from helping complete more rooms.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T02:31:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd0/fd017a3a72ac9cdbd46d67c3432f6c3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Dark Dimension"], "genres": ["Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Dark Dimension"], "esrb_rating": null}
