This game is currently under development, but you will find a first release to try, which is 90% assembly and 10% basic, functional but without sound. I am gradually finishing the conversion to obtain a 100% assembly game. Please be indulgent, three months ago I had never coded a single line of Z80 assembly, and I did not even know about the existence of the Mattel Aquarius :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T14:42:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d3/4d3b0fb88225c982aee36f352f647ba0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["skeletozaure"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
