Using your Impulse beam you can push objects in your universe, but if you apply any force on an object in a different universe to which you are in, the force and its proportions will be inverted. When pushing objects with the Impulse Beam, it is more effective the closer you are. When pulling objects in the opposite universe, it is more effective the further away you are. Make sure to turn your audio down a bit or it may be too loud.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T14:20:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/279/279237f8ca96948cb7ccc2356d574392.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chewy27"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
