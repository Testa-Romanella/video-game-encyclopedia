Welcome customers with their questions into your tent, and choose a fitting answer to send them on their way. Earn coins and go to bed with a smile and the thought you helped the peasants towards a (better?) future.</p>\n<p>The Fortune Telling Puss is a Card Game, where the player has to give a fortune telling answer to the customer. Choose out of three randomly chosen Tarot cards, for which there are three possible answers (Funny, Depressing, Uncertain). Will you give the best fitting answer before you send the peasant back on their way?</p>\n<p>Gameplay note: in the options menu you can choose how many (1 to 3) answers you want to give per question. Default is 1.</p>\n\n<p>Team Floofie &amp; Sons:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Art Masters:\u00a0</strong>Alina Anikina, Emile van der Waaij\r\n</li><li><strong>Programming Lords:\u00a0</strong>Roderick Griffioen, Thijs Waalen\r\n</li><li><strong>Cult Leader:\u00a0</strong>Bram Janssen\r\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>Card flip sounds adapted from f4ngy:<br/>https://freesound.org/people/f4ngy/sounds/240776/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T09:47:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a36/a36292be239f2b7f10d95bed38b9bd6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Brum_nl"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
