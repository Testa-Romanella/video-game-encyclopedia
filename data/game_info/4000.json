Nilin, the heroine, can penetrate into the memory of people, she changes the past on which people base their actions in the present. Once she is subjected to a complete erasure of memory. She has to start a battle for herself - for the self that she does not even remember.<br />\nSetting, plot, design and lighting immediately evokes a masterpiece of cyberpunk - \u00abBlade Runner\u00bb. But the game is noticeably superior to the movie regarding \u00abvolume\u00bb of space, the sensation of \u00abair\u00bb and \u00abpresence\u00bb in the game. There is an impression that you see the world of the game 360 \u200b\u200bdegrees around you. Mimicry and plastic of characters are directed in each detail, undoubtedly dramatic, give a full impression of a play of live actors. It seems that even the movements of inanimate objects are filled with the same expressiveness - for example, the trajectories of a thrown pistol or splinters ... High level of directing and corresponding levels of design and graphics. A mass of significant finds, filling every frame with emotion and senses.</p>", "metacritic": 65, "released": "2013-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T12:10:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/569/569ea25d2b56bd05c7fa309ddabe81ff.jpg", "website": "http://www.remembermegame.com", "rating": 3.66, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 272, "owned": 3409, "beaten": 766, "toplay": 151, "dropped": 332, "playing": 22}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 132, "ratings_count": 921, "suggestions_count": 591, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 934, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "PC"], "developers": ["Capcom U.S.A", "DONTNOD Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Capcom"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
