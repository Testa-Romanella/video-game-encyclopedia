Featuring real facts about leaves, evocative public domain art, and unprovable speculations about trees. <br/></p>\n<p>Length: ~2000 words (ca. 10 minutes)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game was conceived, written and programmed in the span of 11 days by myself, and is the second game I've made in Unity, as a way to force myself to learn Unity 2D and Inkle's Ink language for interactive fiction. Hopefully laying the way for future projects to be more about learning the intricacies of interactive fiction, rather than figuring out how buttons work. <br/></p>\n<p>Still, while I made it for me and my learning, I hope there is something there for you to enjoy. If not, well there is always the next project. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T03:32:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d9/2d9d70c9b5bd56e667beb168abdbd2fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alexandre"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
