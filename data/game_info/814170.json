This is a sideways 2D game where some enemies appear and you have to shoot them to kill them. You have to be careful because bombs also fall from the sky. You also have some bottles that give you life. Once you reach the end and kill the boss you will have won.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T09:45:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f2/1f2d0d20eacd0b681951c0c797b98ecf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jhonny6"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
