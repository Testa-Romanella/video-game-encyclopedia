Funded by the CKC community, our plan is to release 2-3 new games each year, showcasing features &amp; characters selected by our fans!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOur first release: \"Kaijuland Battles\" features 4 cartoony kaiju from the (now sadly defunct) Kaijuland game. This is our \"bare bones\" release - we'll iterate to really tune our core combat mechanics &amp; controls during Early Access.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOur next CKC game (The Fall of Nemesis) launches next year with 9 original characters designed &amp; voted on by our fans, and 2 special boss characters designed by guest contributors Jeremy Robinson &amp; Monster Attack Team.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCKC features 1-4 players, online or off. Gamepad control only - YOU MUST HAVE A GAMEPAD TO PLAY!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTo submit your own character for a future title, or just to join in our lively kaiju discussion, visit our forums!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:07:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/298/29826ebd80e43bb61ceff91a8389ed25.jpg", "website": "http://sunstone.co", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 37}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 1, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 276, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sunstone Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Sunstone Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
