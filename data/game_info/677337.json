Bear", "description": "<p>Left-click to shoot red fish</p>\n<p>Right-click to shoot blue fish</p>\n<p>Aim with mouse</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Herbert P. Bear is a game I made back in 2018 back when\u00a0I still didn't know how to make games, and this is the original version, bugs and all. So, why am I posting it here? For two reasons.</p>\n<p>One is to act as a\u00a0portfolio piece. I think it's good to show where you started and how much you've grown.</p>\n<p>Another is that I have a sort of affinity for this game. Despite being super simple, it might be one of my favorite games conceptually. Maybe I'll remake it one day.</p>\n<p>If you're wondering why Herbert P. Bear from Club Penguin is shooting condiment bottles full of fish at elderly faces on a lonely iceberg, too bad.</p>\n<p>Just kidding I'll tell you.</p>\n<p>If you Google Herbert P. Bear, go to the images tab, and scroll down long enough you will find a very out-of-place image of this elderly man amongst the many, true, Herbert P. Bears (Apparently, it's from a Drawception game where someone forgot who Herbert P. Bear was. I know, how could they). There can only be one real Herbert P. Bear, so they must fight to the death.\u00a0 As for the fish, I don't know. Use your imagination.</p>\n<p>I am not affiliated with Club Penguin or Disney, this is just a fun little fangame.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-11T03:41:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a2/9a2451269f0d88fbb3b2f150ad2ee0ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Superpig5246"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
