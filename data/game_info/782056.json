Getting close to them would also result in losing Health. The Robot will shoot at wherever the cursor is, and as fast as you can click (there's no limit on the rate of shooting).\u00a0</p>\n<p>The waves get harder and harder as time goes on. And if you haven't played action games before it might be difficult for you since this game requires hand-eye coordination.</p>\n<p>I wish thee best of luck.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T22:54:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e5/9e53923b78700d92769d277fe3e057d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Dhruv Ahlawat"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
