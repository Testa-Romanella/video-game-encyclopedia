In Transcripted players take control of the Nano Probe, a microscopic apparatus used to combat disease. With the aid of a skill tree that improves ship equipment, health, shields and the Nano Probe\u2019s arsenal of upgradeable weapons, players must successfully navigate through hordes of deadly pathogens to destroy the disease\u2019s pseudo-DNA as it twines perilously on its endless path to infection. Along the way players must defeat gigantic boss colonies the pathogen has evolved with the sole purpose of stopping the Nano Probe from completing its mission. Difficulty levels of both puzzle and shooting segments can be adjusted independently to suit every play style, making Transcripted an amazingly replayable experience.Key Features:Twin stick shooter meets \u201cmatch three\u201d puzzles for addictive, tactical and fast-paced action<br />\nMany weapon and ship upgrades allow players almost limitless customization options for their Nano Probe<br />\nBeautifully rendered microscopic environments with animated backgrounds showing various areas of the body as the infection spreads<br />\nDifficulty levels of both puzzle and shooting aspects of the game can be adjusted independently<br />\n25 core campaign missions, and 5 Challenge levels for scoring competition<br />\nPlayers are rewarded for skill shots and huge combos with experience points that can then be used to purchase weapon and ship upgrades<br />\nMemorable, ambient score</p>", "metacritic": 78, "released": "2017-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-01T15:26:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/0ac/0acc2194d48eb43a286d510f0b087c27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.0, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 105, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 35, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 338, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC", "macOS", "Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Plug In Digital", "Alkemi"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Plug In Digital", "Alkemi"], "esrb_rating": null}
