The original purpose of making this game is to provide offline experience with VR. Therefore, the decryption time of the game has a limit of 30 minutes. However, personally, a 30-minute experience is not enough to complete all decryption, maybe you need a second, third or more ; The game also provides a random password function, which is the player's password and even the placement of items in the secret room after the player re-enters the game. It will be different from the previous game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe mission key uses a more realistic environment, including art processing at each location, physical property settings, etc., almost every object you see can be crawled and interacted, and the player can even open the sofa very laboriously and pushed it to the shelf.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb9/bb9df690e25cc27ce4c481ba5a11d885.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 3, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 347, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vanl"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Vanl"], "esrb_rating": null}
