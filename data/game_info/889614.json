As the only person who seems to pay attention to these kinds of things you took it upon yourself to delay the inevitable by appeasing these intruders with offerings and sacrifices.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But for how long can you keep it up?</strong></p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<strong>WASD</strong>Move<strong>SPACEBAR</strong>Interact<strong>ESCAPE\u00a0(ESC)</strong>Open Pause Menu<br/>\n\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>In Culto your goal is to manage your cult's resources in order to be able to fulfill each day's Ritual's requirements.</p>\n<p>At the start of each day\u00a0a new <strong>Ritual</strong> is chosen. Your objective is to gather the necessary requirements throughout the day in order to be able to perform the ritual and to stave off the Eldritch beasts trying to breach into your reality.<br/></p>\n<p>In order to gather resources you can command your Cultists to perform tasks.</p>\n<p>Each task takes a certain amount of <strong>Time</strong> and offers different <strong>Rewards</strong> upon completion.</p>\n<p>Each day unfolds throughout the course of 5 minutes. For how many days can you keep this up?<br/></p>\r\nResources\r\n<ul><li><strong>Money</strong> - The most basic of resources. Can be gathered by sending cultists to\u00a0<strong>Work</strong> or <strong>Rob a Bank</strong>. Can be used to purchase <strong>Food</strong> or reduce <strong>Suspicion</strong>.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Food</strong> - At midday every Cultist will consume <strong>1 Food</strong>.

Can be bought with <strong>Money</strong> by sending cultists to go <strong>Shop</strong>.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Prisoners</strong> - Worthy sacrifices. Can be acquired\u00a0by sending your cultists to\u00a0<strong>Kidnap</strong>, but this will raise your <strong>Suspicion</strong>. A Cultist can also be <strong>Emprisoned</strong>, making them a <strong>Prisoner</strong>.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Cultists</strong> - Your followers. Cultists can be sent to perform tasks and gather resources. Cultists can recruit new followers through <strong>Preaching</strong> but this will raise your\u00a0<strong>Suspicion</strong>.
