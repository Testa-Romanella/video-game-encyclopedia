GitHub\u00a0CoPilot is a software that uses AI to assist programmers.\u00a0I wondered how much it can really do. I decided to put it to the test and forced it to make Flappy Bird, a simple yet somewhat enjoyable game. Needless to say,\u00a0I was shocked, it did exactly that.</p>\n<p>The actual code isn't perfect by all means. When I looked at\u00a095% of the code generated by the AI I thought to myself, \"There are way better and more optimized ways to do this.\" Despite this I let the AI do what it wanted to do.</p>\n<p>The steps to get the AI to generate code are fairly easy. I would comment out lines and explain what I was trying to do in detail. The AI would read that and generate the code it think I want to do.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T18:16:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/609/609f9ac4bbf6e76bb0f3d3bb20d1f0e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nex"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
