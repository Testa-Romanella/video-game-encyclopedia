A point-and-click puzzler for the artistically inclined.</p>\n<p>In this point-and-click puzzle game, players scour a locked room for material clues and hidden notes pointing towards the location of a missing historical canvas.\u00a0The quest is based on an actual\u00a0pair of paintings\u00a0by Venetian Renaissance artist Vittore Carpaccio,\u00a0<em>Hunting on The Lagoon</em>\u00a0(recto) and\u00a0<em>Letter Rack</em>\u00a0(verso). Over the ages, parts of the two-sided piece have been lost and rediscovered, lending it a rich and unique history. At its core,\u00a0<em>Locked In The Letter Rack</em>\u00a0is an exploration of the mutually enriching relationship between between games and art.</p>\n<p><em>Locked In The Letter Rack\u00a0</em>was developed in\u00a0<strong>February 2016</strong>\u00a0during a game jam hosted by the Getty Museum of Art, Los Angeles.</p><p>You can read the <strong>press release</strong> here:\u00a0http://blogs.getty.edu/iris/a-night-at-the-museum-the-2016-gettyusc-game-jam/</p>\n<p>I took on the role of lead programmer on this project, and was primarily responsible for designing the inventory and navigation systems.\u00a0<em>Locked In The Letter Rack</em>\u00a0was developed in Unity 5 and programmed in C#.</p>\n<p>Developed by: AB Biswas, Caroline Chiou, Justin Camden, Maria Ferreri, Maureen Wang</p>\n<p><strong>Licensing</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Locked In The Letter Rack</p>\n\n<p>Background audio - <em>Journey</em>, <em>Windmill</em> courtesy of Plasterbrain [Soundcloud].</p>\n<p>https://soundcloud.com/plasterbrain</p>\n<p>All other creative assets are the sole intellectual property of the creators.</p>\n<p>This work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.</p>\n<p>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/013/013de17157396e2c03936660ce507e88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Arya Biswas"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
