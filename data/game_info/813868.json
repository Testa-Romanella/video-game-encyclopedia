He's going to use it to overwhelm all the people of the kingdom and become its sole ruler. Ryan and Julia are the strongest warriors, the only ones that courageously decided to oppose the dark plans of the enemy. The mighty swordsman warrior and the invincible Amazon with the whip are already on the trail of Darkor, ready to eradicate his army of monstrous creatures and bring the Black Jewel back to the temple.</p>\n\n<p>The game is a classic side-scrolling hack and slash. You can play both alone and together with your friend, with each of you controlling the barbarian Ryan or the Amazon Julia. The gameplay is about fighting your way through intense battles with many enemies. Each character has three normal attacks, a jump attack, as well as a special attack that charged slowly when you kill enemies. If you find yourself in a desperate situation, you can call upon your god to help you, who will destroy everything on the screen.</p>\n\r\nKickStarter\r\n\r\nOur shop\r\n<p>\u0412 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435          </p>\n<p><strong>YouTube</strong>\u00a0          </p>\n<p>Facebook\u00a0          </p>\n<p>Twitter<br/></p>\n<p>Game page  Black Jewel Reborn</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T07:43:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abb/abb05945d16c94e6d832d022353a4385.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 362, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PSCDGames"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
