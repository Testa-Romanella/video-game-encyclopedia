Come in and explore!</p>\n\r\nSynopsis\r\n<p>Come Here is a game about moving into a new home, still fully furnished with the vestiges of the previous owners. But, the further you move in and the more you explore, the more you realize\u2026 something\u2019s wrong. Something\u2019s unsettling about this new house, about\u2026 you.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nSpoilers ahead:\u00a0\r\nUnlock spoilers at your own risk!<p>Come Here may seem like a typical horror game, but it\u2019s really about the truth of the stories and games we create. Once we build these worlds and these characters, what happens to those characters when they\u2019re out of sight? When they learn that their every move is predetermined by a faceless god, puppeteering them via video game controllers and keyboards? Will they try to take revenge against their God - you - and will they try to change their fate?</p>\n\r\nCredits (alphabetical by\u00a0First Name):\r\n<p>Anri French - Lead Artist, Concept Art</p>\n<p>Ramy Zhang - Lead Audio Production, Programmer</p>\n<p>Tina Zhang - Lead Level Design, Lead Artist, Programmer</p>\n<p>Pia Fermin - Lead Storywriter, Concept\u00a0Art</p>\n<p>Yixing Xu - Lead Programmer, Level Design</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T15:57:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04a/04a4d6d3dc3a6cd52d93018db8b37f2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["starrylady"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
