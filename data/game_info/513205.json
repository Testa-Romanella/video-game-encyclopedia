{"id": 513205, "slug": "one-last-adventure", "name": "One Last Adventure", "name_original": "One Last Adventure", "description": "<p>\"One Last Adventure\"\u00a0 is a casual platformer in which\u00a0you experience locations and relationships important to the main character, who is\u00a0 in the last moments of their life. It is your job as the player to guide the character through the levels of their life, collecting important heirlooms, and saying one last goodbye to those they loved.</p>\n\n<p>This is a vertical slice of a longer game. In the vertical slice, you play the first level of the game. Set in the garden of the character's childhood home, you traverse through tall grass and old toys to make it to the end of the level. You also meet Kyba, the character's childhood canine best friend.</p>\n\n<p>This assignment was part of a Games Design module where we were tasked with creating a game that would invoke an emotional response in the player. I tried to convey\u00a0 Joy and Nostalgia through shared experience, and\u00a0make it so the character in the game would have universal experiences that everyone playing could relate to. The idea of death, and that the player is on their final journey is also something I have used to convey \u00a0Sadness and Empathy.\u00a0\u00a0I felt these pair of emotions were effective as the player could find joy in the nostalgia and shared experiences, as well as sadness i looking through the eyes of the main character.</p>\n\n<p>Character - Base character sprites and poses.
