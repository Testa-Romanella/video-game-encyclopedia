More directly, there appears to be a relationship between [BINKY] virtual worlds and the [DRACULA] outside world. \r\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD / Arrows - Move</p>\n<p>Esc - Quit</p>\n\n<p>Image Credits:</p>\n<p>Photos taken by fotocopiadora</p>\n<p>Photos taken by thecakeflavor</p>\n<p>Dizzy 4</p>\n<p>Donkey Kong Reloaded</p>\n<p>Egghead 3</p>\n<p>Last Vampire</p>\n<p>Metal Man Reloaded</p>\n<p>Monty Auf</p>\n<p>Ruff</p>\n<p>Simpsons</p>\n<p>Soft and Cuddly</p>\n\n<p>Music Credits: </p>\n<p>Handel - Concerto for Organ and Orchestra Op7 no1 mvt2 performed by Advent Chamber Orchestra</p>\n<p>https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Advent_Chamber_Orchestra/Selections_from_the_...</p>\n<p>Hall of Mirrors from Shadowgate</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T04:00:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b8/8b8df07134c64dde22c8d5eb09959745.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["gisbrecht"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
