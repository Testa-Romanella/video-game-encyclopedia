Er... this is the first game i've ever made with Pico-8, so please forgive all the bugs you'll find in this little game.</p>\n<p>This is my little homage to one of the games I used to play in my arcades back in the early eighties when I was a kid... a game with a trackball, many missiles and the almost impossible task to avoid a thermonuclear world war for as long as possible.</p>\n<p>Yes, I know... that's not exactly a very cheerful theme, but it's also not worse than your average \"zombie apocalypse\" theme that you can find in many games today ;-)</p>\r\nTHE STORY\r\n<p>In this game the final war that will annihilate the human race has just started. Your name is Dave Theurer, and unfortunately you're not a superhero. You can't stop all the missiles and you can't keep your loved ones and your city safe forever; but if you're brave and lucky enough you might be able to allow your fellow citizens to see the lights of another day.\r\nTill the next night of bombings.</p>\r\nMOVEMENTS\r\n<p>Use your mouse or the directional keys to move the gun target. Push the Z button or click the left mouse button to shoot a single rocket, Keep pressed the X button or keep clicking the right mouse button for rapid fire.\r\nShoot the enemy missiles and avoid them falling on the buildings. When your last building falls, it's game over.</p>\r\nLOOKING FOR THE SOURCE CODE ?\r\n<p>Have a look at this thread on Lexaloffle forum: https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=30214</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/114/1145f88af5007626b47714d209d579e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cesco"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
