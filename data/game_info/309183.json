Since the rabbit was not on his planet, he walked only back and forth on a flat platform. You can click on the block to change the walking area to help him get to the carrot. Touching the rabbit itself can also change its direction. But remember: if a carrot or a rabbit falls out of the screen, you lose the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/298/29815e7555498e16a9ba6d15b41fd346.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["B-RABBIT"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["B-RABBIT"], "esrb_rating": null}
