Featuring a faster and smoother user interface along with more refined gameplay, the 2018 edition celebrates 15 years of ZingMagic bringing you the best in board, card and puzzle games.<br/><br/>Mahjongg is a single player game that probably originated in Asia. Whilst simple in concept a good deal of strategy is required to complete the layouts.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to remove all the tiles from a layout in the least possible time. Layouts can vary in pattern, size and shape. Tiles are removed in pairs and may only be removed if they are both free and match one another. Free tiles are ones that have no other piece touching the left, right or both sides and no tiles on top.<br/><br/>Whilst all deals generated by Mahjongg are solvable you will need to remove pairs of tiles carefully to ensure you don\u2019t stop the removal of remaining pairs. <br/><br/>Mahjongg contains over 50 layouts to provide endless hours of entertainment. All layouts are specially designed for use on mobile devices and range from easy to difficult.<br/><br/>Privacy info:<br/>Please note that this game ad-funded.
