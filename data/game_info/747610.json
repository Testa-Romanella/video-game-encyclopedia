Character will speed up as game progresses, get as far as you can!</p>\n<p>My original idea was to have red riding hood\u00a0being chased by a wolf. However, because of time constraints I've settled on using placeholder assets to create a simple first prototype. Looking forward to continue working on this in the future so feedback would be much appreciated.\u00a0Hope you enjoy :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T12:39:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee5/ee5e426d8030753981ffe960cde537e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ashley_cho"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
