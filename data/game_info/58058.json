{"id": 58058, "slug": "fonz", "name": "Fonz", "name_original": "Fonz", "description": "<p>Fonz is a 1976 arcade racing video game developed by Sega and published by Sega-Gremlin. The game was based on the hit TV show Happy Days and the slogan was \"TV's hottest name, Your hottest game.\" The game itself was simply a rebranded variant of Sega's earlier 1976 game Moto-Cross, also known as Man T.T. (released August 1976), in a customized arcade cabinet. In turn, Moto-Cross and Man T.T. were motorbike variants of Road Race, a car driving game released in February 1976. Sega was allowed to rebrand their game as Fonz because its American branch at the time was owned by Charles Bluhdorn's Gulf+Western Company and thus had access to Paramount Television's intellectual property.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1976-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-24T10:57:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b89/b898745f51736d4104137b39ed772208.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": [], "developers": ["SEGA"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["Gremlin Industries", "Sega-Gremlin"], "esrb_rating": null}
