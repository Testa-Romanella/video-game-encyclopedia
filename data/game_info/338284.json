{"id": 338284, "slug": "voxel-tycoon-pre-alpha", "name": "Voxel Tycoon Pre-Alpha", "name_original": "Voxel Tycoon Pre-Alpha", "description": "<p>Welcome to\u00a0<strong>Voxel Tycoon</strong>\u00a0- a strategy game about transportation, factories, and mining in infinite voxel landscapes.</p>\n\n<strong>WHAT IS PRE-ALPHA?</strong>\n<p>In Voxel Tycoon terminology, \"Alpha\" is the upcoming Early Access version on Steam. Not all planned features for that release are completed yet, so we're calling the current version \"<strong>Pre</strong>-Alpha\". Don't get us wrong, however; the game is largely stable and playable, it just requires a few content updates.</p>\n\n<p>Providing you access to the game at the current stage gives us several development opportunities, like large-scale public testing, gathering community feedback, and improving gameplay further, before moving onto our full Early Access release.</p>\n<p>By participating, you not only help to make the game better, but also:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Receive a Steam k</strong><strong>ey\u00a0\u00a0</strong>after the game reaches Early Access</li><li>Chance to be featured in the credits by actively participating in testing</li></ul>\n\r\nPRE-ALPHA FEATURES\r\n\n<p>The game has more than 50 vehicles representing eras from steam to electric, among which are locomotives, railcars, trucks (including semi-trailers!) and more.</p>\n<p>Every vehicle has its own unique properties that you should take into account when buying and building consists with them. Thanks to our physics simulation, vehicles will behave differently based on their weight, the type and amount of cargo they're carrying, motive power and grades.</p>\n<p>Flexible scheduling allows, among other things, to select exact tracks where trains should arrive at stations, or choose what specific railcars should load or unload at any given stop. You can give mass orders using Routes, or setup individual tasks for each vehicle on your roster.</p>\n<p>Bridging and tunneling, along with a full signaling system (you don't want your trains to crash into each other, do you?), allow you complete freedom to build and expand your network.</p>\n\n<p>Organize mining with mine shafts, then process the raw materials using crushers, furnaces, refineries and other machinery.</p>\n<p>Complex production chains require complex logistics! Design unique factories of your very own by connecting machinery, buildings and storage facilities with conveyor belts.</p>\n<p>Fund and supply research of new technologies, unlocking new buildings, production chains, and vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>Every city has its own needs, which you can fulfill to kick-start growth. The bigger a city gets, the more consumers move in, meaning more potential profit! Growth of a city doesn't simply increase the quantity of goods required - higher stages of development will move away from the basics, requiring more complex and expensive products.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that the values of goods are not constant and depend heavily on your actions as the supplier. Higher demand leads to higher prices! As a last resort, you can always help cities and business solve their financial problems directly by investing funds in their development.</p>\n\n<p>Explore an unlimited, procedurally-generated world filled with unique biomes, from deserts to arctic tundra. Unlock new regions to find rare resources and new development opportunities. The world is endless, so you\u2019ll never run out of space.</p>\n<p>For the most successful tycoons, we include full-featured terraforming: turn the world into exactly what you want, all according to your perfect plan! Keep in mind, however, it might cost you a fortune.</p>\n<p>The world is not limited to the classic top-down Tycoon view - Free Camera mode allows you to immerse yourself directly into the action. Fly around in first person for gorgeous views, get a closer detailed look at production chains, and even ride around on your trains while they do their job.</p>\n\n<p>Almost all the basic content of the game can be customized and changed to suit your needs. In addition, you can add new vehicles, buildings, resources, production technologies, research, and any other supported content. The game is bundled with the always up-to-date modding tools.</p>\n\r\nWHAT'S NEXT\r\n<p>Our plans for the next few months include:</p>\n<ul><li>Passenger transportation</li><li>Electric grids and power plants</li><li>Liquid cargoes and tanks</li><li>Extending existing features with new content</li><li>Further performance optimizations</li><li>Improving game balance</li><li>Extending modding capabilities, including C# API</li></ul>\n<p>Of course, our players (you) are the primary source of feedback, so we'll prioritize things based on anything we hear from you.</p>\n<p>Also, if you'd like to help us translate the game to your native language, now is a great time to pitch in!<br/></p>\n<p>We try to deliver new updates several times a week. You can always check all the update history in our public changelog.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Keep in mind that, while Pre-Alpha is a fully playable version, the game is not yet complete. If:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You want to play with content that is not in the game yet, like pipelines and liquid cargo, electricity, or passengers</li><li>You want to play multiplayer</li><li>You are not ready for your saves to occasionally be wiped with updates</li><li>You're not ready to play without tutorials</li>\n<li>You don't understand the concept of testing of an unfinished product</li></ul>\n<p>we recommend waiting for Early Access on Steam to get the full Voxel Tycoon experience.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>For press:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>There are no restrictions on showing or streaming Pre-Alpha, but keep in mind that many things will be changed during this phase.
