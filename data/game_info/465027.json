Fortunately you still have a peculiar magic die that can influence what happens. Play, battle, get cards, roll dice, succeed - or not. You decide. (Actually you don't.)</p>\n\n<p>Thanks a bunch if you play it!</p>\n<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>\n<p>Apologies I ran into some major bugs during build testing which left me no time to pop in a main menu, pause or an ending screen. But if you can't go any further - you're done.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you're on a windows build you'll have to force close the app - I am dreadfully sorry about this!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>\n<p>Game is played with the mouse. Select your chosen die value, and play the card or move that many spaces. Tiles are activated when you land on them (snakes &amp; ladders).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T07:18:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8a/e8a7c63821d649743671752d0bc3c646.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Haustgeirr"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
