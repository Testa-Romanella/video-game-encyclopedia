Don't let any shells lose power or their precious contents will expire and you'll have to scrape out the remains and start again!</p>\n<p>pssst - if you want to see more of the game in a shorter space of time, you can press backspace then type in 31031989 to enable cheat mode!

You've just received an immortal!\r\n\r\n\r\nThen just click on the full-charged shell to insert it\r\n\r\n\r\nFind and build and fill all 10 shells to win\r\n\r\n\r\nYour filled shells will slowly consume energy so make sure you keep them topped up\r\n\r\n\r\nWatch out!
