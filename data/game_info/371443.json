The only catch, well, there are lots of catches. This game will attempt in every way possible to lie to you and mislead you into losing. As a 14 year old game dev, this is my first game jam and although you may not find the game itself all that great, I had a blast making it and hope to do more fun projects such as this in the future. Anyway hope you enjoy!!</p>\n<p>CONTROLS :</p>\n<p>MOUSE - Selection of most objects and main controller</p>\n<p>*Only Applies for Final Level*:</p>\n<p>SCROLL/MOUSE - Flip Pages</p>\n<p>KEYBOARD NUMBERS - For numbers on keypad</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T09:46:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fad/fad3c118c840a4bab3dae45c8f2604ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SwordSkills749"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
