It was created by Rich Carlson, Iikka Ker\u00e4nen and Bill Sears--aka, <em>Digital Eel\u00a0</em>(but you knew that).<br/><br/>SAIS generates a different interstellar\u00a0region every time the game\u00a0is played. Stars, planets, black holes, nebula mass, alien patrols, items, lifeforms and other encounters are randomized for each new Strange Adventure.<br/><br/>\u00a0 Playing time: 5-20 minutes<br/>\u00a0 Number of players: solo<br/>\u00a0 Difficulty: variable<br/>\u00a0 Replayability: infinite<br/><br/>SAIS features:<br/><br/>\u00a0 + 21 different ship types<br/>\u00a0 + 69 different weapons, drives, shields, gadgets and artifacts<br/>\u00a0 + 18 alien lifeforms<br/>\u00a0 + 17 different planet and star types<br/>\u00a0 + 7 unique alien races<br/><br/>SAIS was\u00a0the first science fiction/space roguelike (or <em>roguelite</em>) and the second roguelike (at least, on this continent)\u00a0to be set in a realm other than Tolkienesque fantasy (the first was Jeffrey R. Olson's \u00a0post-apocalyptic roguelike, <em>Alphaman</em>, released in 1995).<br/><br/>SAIS was innovative in many ways. One example is how it handles game failure. Instead of being many hours in length as typical roguelikes are, SAIS plays to its conclusion in less time than it takes to eat lunch. (Hence the game's tag line, <em>Explore the Galaxy...in Twenty Minutes or Less!</em>) This\u00a0eases the frustration of permadeath (and, in fact, evokes a \"just one more potato chip\" response), yet sustains the tension and \"every step counts\" aspect that we all like about it.<br/><br/>Many thanks to Chris Collins for creating the new SAIS builds. In fact, let's all give him a big hand right now, okay? (This is labor-of-love stuff, folks.)<br/><br/>Strange Adventures is free, DRM-free and ready to be shared, so everyone can play it. Don't let its \"size\" fool you. SAIS is a subtle and challenging roguelike that game guru Ernest Adams called <em>a perfect short game</em>.<br/><br/>Experience the little game that <em>did</em>. The game that opened the door just a crack, yet wide enough to allow a new roguelike subgenre to emerge. One which would eventually\u00a0give us classics like <em>FTL</em>.<br/><br/>Note: this special release includes most if not all of the mods created by the SAIS community\u00a0for the game. Check out\u00a0<em>The Urluquai Crusade\u00a0</em>and\u00a0<em>Even Stranger Adventures in Infinite Space</em>, and more.<br/><br/>Also note: this version runs (mostly) uniformly on Windows, macOS and Linux from the same codebase.<br/><br/>The original Strange Adventures in Infinite Space webpage is still available here, though much of its content is dated and many of its links are now\u00a0irrelevant or defunct. The original versions of SAIS can be found here, and the original SAIS source code, here.\u00a0 Also see the SAIS\u00a0Galactic Guidebook for gameplay help and other nifty details.<br/><br/>Lastly, two sequels were created by Digital Eel based on Strange Adventures--<em>Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space</em> (2005) and <em>Infinite Space III: Sea of Stars</em> (2015). Both games improved aesthetic aspects of the series and\u00a0built on what came before, but the essential gameplay remained unchanged.<br/><br/>Get <strong>Weird Worlds</strong> from Steam or itch.<br/>Get <strong>Sea of Stars</strong> from Steam or itch.<br/><br/>Visit Digital Eel<br/>Visit Digital Eel on Facebook<br/>Visit Sea of Stars on Facebook<br/>Visit Weird Worlds on Facebook</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2002-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-11T13:32:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65e/65eeccadf9b2f59059549e26239c1dde.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 438, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Digital Eel"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Cheapass Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
