No rollback, skip, save or load.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>It is supposed to be read in one sitting, then... never read again.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>May you be entertained for a quarter of an hour or so.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Electrical Faerie was originally conceived as a submission for the O2A2 2022 - Visual Novel Jam. When it became clear the jam rules would not allow the kinetic novel to be made as envisioned, it was decided to expand and release it outside the jam.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Thank you to Smoke Mirros Studios for their help with editing.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T15:48:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a32/a325cea4cbc7a09dd59fb9b21961e629.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Edsan Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
