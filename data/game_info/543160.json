It is not perfect, but I'm very proud of it! It is (depending on your playthrough speed) anywhere from 23-45'ish minute long! Descent into Madness\u00a0is a short, narrative driven horror game with a first person perspective and some elements of exploration and survival. It also has an ending, unlike my first horror game... You can play it for free, but if you enjoy your experience and think it worth something, please consider a donation &lt;3! I\u00a0don't expect to make much off this, but<strong> anything I\u00a0do make from this\u00a0will go towards college</strong>. College transcripts are 10 dollars each, maybe I can cover a few of those\u00a0with this game haha.</p><p>Inspired by Brain on Fire, by Susannah Cahalan<br/></p>\n<p>** READ THIS PLEASE**<br/></p>\n<p>As I am still learning, I\u00a0have a few things to mention!</p>\n<p>* I\u00a0don't know how to use\u00a0inventory entirely yet, so you can't keep your flashlight between levels; however, you'll always find a flashlight on the ground beneath you, glowing yellow! (Same with keys)</p>\n<p>*If the game seems to have frozen, it is just loading between levels :)!</p>\n<p>*\u00a0The mouse bugs out in the credit scene,\u00a0so to close the game you have to currently alt-tab and manually close it, will fix that the moment I know how haha.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T05:10:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/869/8691b965c3e1ef71c6d0005e04e8eeb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["A Good Potato"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
