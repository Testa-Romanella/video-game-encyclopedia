Enemy monsters will come every wave. Clearing all the waves is your victory.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Defense is done using units. Units include warriors, archers, magic soldiers, catapults, and healers. As you progress through the story, you will have more friends. Not all units can be put into battle. So you need your strategic brain.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The unit uses points to sortie. Points can be earned over time (you can also earn points by defeating enemies).<br/><br/>The Hero of the game has various abilities. He can wield a sword, shoot a bow, and use magic. It's a valuable character, so try to move it in a way that suits your strategy.<br/>When the unit is defeated, it will retreat from the battlefield. However, the hero is resurrected many times and tries to start the battle again. It will take some time to revive.<br/><br/>The enemy has weaknesses. As you progress through the story, you may find enemies that you can't beat. In such a case, let's start by knowing the weaknesses of enemy monsters. If you can make good weaknesses, you may be able to proceed with the battle easily.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If you win the battle, you can get experience points. You can strengthen your unit as well as experience points. You can make your favorite unit stronger, or you can make it stronger overall.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>\u00b7story</strong><br/>The Hero is a man who lives in a small village.
