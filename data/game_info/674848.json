As you go, parts will get deactivated, so the tides of battle can turn quickly when one of you the hits you take forces you to choose between your reactor, your engine, or your armament systems. Will you have to finish the fight relying on your chassis internal, basic weapons, or on its lackluster built-in engines?</p>\n<p>The game might be updated over time. Plans include playtest-informed\u00a0balance changes, rules changes\u00a0and\u00a0updates to existing part; as well as art, more flavor, and more parts and element cards. (But not too many more to keep the game kinda light.)</p>\n<p>Made in three days for the mechjam2.
