We often dare not take the leap of faith and often remain hanging and clinging to our old truth. We try to break away by forcefully hammering but instead reinforce our old belief system that keeps us imprisoned.<br/></p>\n<p>Virtual Reality art is still in it's infancy and more in experimentation phase. Therefore expect surprising unique experiences from each art work that will be published here regularly.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T06:36:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c50/c501309bce38f290f3dfb7f2aa7e521c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DanadDMer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
