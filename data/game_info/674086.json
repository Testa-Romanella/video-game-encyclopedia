Browsing the room and see what you can use. Do not bump into the giants in\u00a0the bed, they will catch you back to the cage.</p>\n<p>The game is made up of a 3-step simple puzzle. The object is to practice setting up 3D scenes that can create a certain mood with selective assets, lightings, and music. Moreover, I was trying to create the pickup functions for players to\u00a0hold certain items and use them in other places in-game.</p>\n<p>**If WebGL is not working properly, please download the PC build:\u00a0https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f-hQY1OXr0W84b5iLxiETiLUH_qgGF-v/view?usp=sharing</p>\n\n<p>**Get Stucked?
