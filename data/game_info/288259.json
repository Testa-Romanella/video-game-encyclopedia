When they held hands with the gloves, it expanded the light around each pup so they can see.<br/><br/> - You can hold spacebar to do the same, but it isn't nearly as fun. Sorry :(<br/><br/>- Find each other in the maze before time runs out to win! <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Team Credits</strong><br/>Blake BS<br/>Gil Chen<br/>Tamir Chen<br/>Ryan Giglio<br/>W.V.
