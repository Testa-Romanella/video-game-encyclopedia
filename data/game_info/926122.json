I started learning Nim today, and made this the same day. Bugs include:</p>\n<ul><li>Answer is always 88 (rand() function messing up, will look into this) - Still no idea how to make is actually random. Now it's always 3?!\r\n</li><li>Scrolling scrolls the whole window contents instead of submitted answers. There is no documentation of NiGui yet so I have no idea how to change this.\r\n</li><li>No replay button. As far as I know, NiGui doesn't support clearing containers' children, so if I were to make a replay button it would just restart the program. - Made a quit button after winning, as I still cannot find a way to clear children of containers.\r\n</li><li>Error when entering non-numbers into entry box. - Fixed for the most part (can't detect when a non-number is used with a number, only when there isn't a number present).\r\n</li><li>Please report any more bugs!\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Source code - https://github.com/ostanton/NimSimpleGuessingGame\r\n</p>\n<p>As of version 0.1.2, the console no longer opens with the program. It's its own little thing :)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T11:17:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/452/452b111540e7c4f8dd958b119bbc467e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ostanton"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
