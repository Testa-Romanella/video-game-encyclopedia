It has only 5 levels so it won't take long to beat.<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy it and feel free to follow me for more exciting games that will be coming soon :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T11:42:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9a/b9ae428152783d3a0b772df51e96c9fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nineis"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
