Category: \"Compo\"). Had a lot of fun learning about B-Splines and trying to design a game around them! Wish I had more time to think about level design and fix/polish a few things (noticing that the audio is pretty repetitive among other things (my first time trying it lol)). But hey, I'm still super happy that I was able to whip up something playable in 48 hours!</p>\n<p>Hope you all enjoy!</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Click and Drag control points to adjust the loop!</p>\n<p>(Esc to exit the application)</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Tools Used:</p>\n<p>- Unity (Shapes, ScriptableObjectArchitecture, DOTween)<br/>- Reaper (Synth1, Stock Plugins)</p>\n<p>Extra shoutouts to the Shapes Unity asset.
