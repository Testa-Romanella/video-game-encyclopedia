After each round of play, Hp will be auto reset.<br/>You don't have to save all of the same kind in the \"escape\" game, and of course it will lose some \"energy\".<br/><br/>Each kind of turret has its own unique effect, through the collocation of various turrets to get the best defense.<br/>Each kind of monster has its own unique attributes, using the properties of the turret to combat monsters.<br/><br/>The core of the game is \"energy absorption\". (similar to \"thieves\", \"plunder\"). That is, the attack of the defense tower will draw energy from the monster, and accumulating energy can build more defense towers.<br/>(it's hard to defend if you have not enough energy.)<br/><br/><strong> Features: </strong><br/><ul><li> You don't want this games is so hard?
