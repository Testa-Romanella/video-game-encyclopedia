You will play through 29 regular levels before encountering a boss enemy in Level 30. After a short ending, you will then enter a endless game where levels will be picked at random out of 10 extra hard levels. This is where you keep playing for highscore.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/><br/>Keyboard: \"z\" to fire, directional buttons to move left or right<br/><br/>Mouse: left mousebutton down to fire, right mousebutton down to make<br/>your spaceship follow your mousepointer to the left or right - it's best to keep your right mousebutton pressed so you can drag your spaceship around<br/><br/>Gamepad: \"a\",\"b\",\"x\" or \"y\" to fire, Dpad to move left or right (There may be gamepads that are not supported, although the game should work for most gamepads)</p>\n<p>There is also a cheat available to let you start the game right in the random levels. Here is how to start the game with the random level cheat:<br/><br/>Keyboard: Start the game by pressing \"c\" instead of fire<br/><br/>Mouse: Start the game by pressing the middle mousebutton (or by pressing<br/>down the mousewheel) instead of pressing fire<br/><br/>Gamepad: Start the game by pressing a shoulderbutton instead of fire</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T06:34:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ba/2ba3d31ea205b79943b05621bdbdd479.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rastashmup"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
