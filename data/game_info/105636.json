I wanted to capture that feeling and I also wanted to program a fairly realistic car. </p><p>The music is all carefully crafted and then run through a physical tape player to produce audio artifacts for a more authentic sound.</p><p>All in all, I'm really happy with how it turned out. I hope everyone has a good time with it ^_^</p><p>Also check out the site for more info: justdrivegame.tumblr.com</p><p>Escape key opens the in-game menu.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5de/5def2fe83035fd7de8e09f222aa13297.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Cbear Wallis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
