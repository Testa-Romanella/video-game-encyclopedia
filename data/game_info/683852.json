If the monsters reach you they will do a trick or treat.\u00a0If you got no treats to give... Well, nothing else but trick is left!</p>\n<p>Move the character with\u00a0A and D, or Arrow Keys.\u00a0Jump with space.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Traps will kill you instantly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Right now there's two similar levels that spawn on random, which makes it sort of endless.
