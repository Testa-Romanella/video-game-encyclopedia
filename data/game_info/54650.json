The arcade version is notable both for its excessive scores (scores in the quintillions are not unheard of), and for using a horizontally aligned monitor (much like Treasure Co. Ltd&#39;s Radiant Silvergun), something that is considered rare for a vertical shooter.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2001-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-15T12:12:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/446/446231f283f7a4d6abf906404fd87734.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 291, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["Dreamcast"], "developers": ["Takumi"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Capcom"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
