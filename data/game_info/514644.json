It was a tiny cool project to keep learning about game developement, experiment mechanics, and finishing a full game (\u00a0even if it's short\u00a0). Most part of the 3D models and sound FX were from asset libraries bought from bundles. The music is original tho!</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy this tiny game and... happy halloween!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T08:18:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab4/ab4cdd67e04bf46ede83c3ad18d0c2ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AwitaGames", "merk_cat"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
