During a past paranormal physics experiment, she once brutally tormented an organism from another realm (one which humans could not interact with), and now that no foreign organisms will approach her as a result, she\u2019s referred to as the \u201cstrongest barrier\u201d of this world.<br/>Sotae has a diligent personality, although she can be a bit passive as well, so she rarely initiates things herself.<br/>She\u2019s logical and a realist, which means she regrets having entered the academy, where she must now study otherworldly subjects.<br/>Unlike Fukuna, she dislikes household chores.<br/><br/>Tesatani Fukuna, 19 years old, blood type B, born on August 6th.<br/><br/>A first year at Kigikawa Academy college. Sotae\u2019s older sister.<br/>She is a curious person, though also selfish and heavy-handed. She tends to try to work everything out by going with the flow. Sometimes she doesn\u2019t announce her research results when she\u2019s supposed to, and things of that sort, and so she appears to be treated like a problem student at the academy.<br/>Fukuna is good at household chores, unlike Sotae, but for some reason, she can\u2019t make coffee.<br/>Her special research subject is the use of nonexistent energy.<br/>The most extreme finding in her research was her accomplishment in erasing the energy (turning it into nonexistent energy) that made her age.<br/>She was able to achieve the widely-desired state of immortality, where time seemed to stand still as days passed without her aging at all, which would have made her research the most important finding in the history of the academy\u2026 However, she never publicly announced the results. <br/>Though she was immortal, she was still able to set her lifespan back to a normal length...but certain aspects were more convenient that way (such as never getting old), so she decided to stay immortal until she feels like turning back again.<br/><br/>She currently has special permission to work as a carpenter to study the practical uses of nonexistent energy.<br/>However, she doesn\u2019t actually work very often. It\u2019s also unknown why she chose carpentry.<br/><br/><br/>Bomanita, ? years old, blood type ?, born ?? BCE.<br/><br/>A clever organism from another realm discovered by the Tesatani sisters on their overseas trip. A work client. Self-proclaimed \u201ceternal middle management.\u201d<br/>She even serves as a midway source of authority between realms, due to her strong ability to interfere with them.<br/>Organisms who cannot interfere in each other\u2019s realms are able to interfere (see each other, hear each other, and talk to each other) within the academy itself.<br/>For that purpose, the academy allows transfer students to come from other realms.<br/>Bomanita lost contact with her younger sister, who had transferred to Kigikawa Academy, so she is now searching fearlessly for her.<br/>She generally likes to abide by rules and order, but due to her masochistic personality, she\u2019s unable to disobey Fukuna or anyone who ranks higher than her.<br/><br/>You\u2019re welcome to use this product for videos and livestreams!!<br/>(Though I\u2019m sorry to ask it, please do so responsibly.)", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T03:37:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79c/79c9b4639d1353adb161d135e0d9b68d.jpg", "website": "http://storongturee.zouri.jp/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u30b9\u30c8\u30ed\u30f3\u30b0\u30c4\u30ea\u30fc(HusHucHu\u30e9\u30a4\u30b9)", "Storongturee(HusHucHuRaice)"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["\u30b9\u30c8\u30ed\u30f3\u30b0\u30c4\u30ea\u30fc(HusHucHu\u30e9\u30a4\u30b9)", "Storongturee(HusHucHuRaice)"], "esrb_rating": null}
