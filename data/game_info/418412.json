All actions in the game will cost you HP, and you can regain HP by fighting the monsters. You can only defeat the monsters by using the calculator to create a result that matches the number on the monster. Getting the result with certain operators will give you a larger health boost!</p>\n\n<p>Developed for the 7DRL Challenge 2020.</p>\n<p>Sound effects by Richard Devine.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T04:45:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/507/507b20df099c9fe5265204d514f61e1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gamepopper"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
