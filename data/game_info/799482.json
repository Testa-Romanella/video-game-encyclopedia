{"id": 799482, "slug": "the-zebra-man-2", "name": "The Zebra Man", "name_original": "The Zebra Man", "description": "<p>It's the early 70's, and some mad scientists have been doing nasty stuff to you for quite long. Somehow, a random cosplay guy with a gas mask gets into the lab you're being kept, and offers himself to help you out.</p>\n<p>After many traumas and engrams triggered by the experiments that took place on your body, getting rid of your humanity and sticking to your spirit animal may be your only way out. When a light ray is born in the darkness of despair, it's kill or be killed</p>\n\n<p>In this messed up game there will be three main controllable characters, and you better get along with them:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0<strong>THE ZEBRA-MAN.</strong>\u00a0You'll be spending most of gameplay time with him. Until you reach his killing machine, you'll depend entirely on his fists... and your mouse aim. Not only you'll see his evolution as a character, but you will be part of it. Depending on your decisions, different events will take place. Try not to get yourself killed on the first run...\r\n</li><li>\u00a0<strong>ALEXANDER COOPER.</strong>\u00a0Britain's Steve Urkel. He's a lover, not a fighter, so you'll be able to chill a bit each time you're in control of his classy bow tie. Although... you're going to need patience with him. His OCD drives nuts even the developer.\r\n</li><li>\u00a0<strong>RACCOON.</strong>\u00a0Jacket's #1 fan. Only Jacket fans will know who Jacket is. He's distinguished by fast movement, multiple combat styles and two magnificent magnums. He claims to have the power for \"breaking the fourth wall\", although nobody knows what that means.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>These three gentlemen are the main characters of the game, but others will be controllable as well. Who, you ask? Come on, spoilers!\r\n</p>\n\n<p><em>'THE ZEBRA-MAN'</em>\u00a0is an experimental action-puzzles game developed entirely by Thunder Zebra's founder, Rub\u00e9n Carrascal, with some help of good friends and very patient geeks in forums all around the Internet. It features harmony in the pixel art of every level, as well as a non-chronological narrative, cool VHS effects, and connection with already published movies and short films in\u00a0Thunder Zebra's YouTube Channel.\r\n</p>\n<p>It's undeniable that the game's main reference point is\u00a0<em>'Hotline Miami'</em>, and some have favorably compared it with\u00a0<em>'Darkwood'</em>\u00a0as well. After playing the demo, general feedback has been very positive: The Zebra-Man's testers have praised its visual style, crazy secrets, and unexpected twists when messing around a bit instead of straight following each level's target.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> As for now our team doesn't exactly have enough money for proper licensing so some people might experience difficulties when installing the game. We are hoping to solve all the problems in future updates.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T06:20:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43d/43d8d9debd17b6315e249b0a9f0a73f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ThunderZebra"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
