Each object adds 5 points to your score but also will affect the playground in a different way.<br/></p>\n\n<p>The first two objects will change the distance between the platforms. Make sure that the platforms are not too far neither too close, or else the container will end up falling or destroyed.<br/></p>\n<p>The last two objects will rotate the playground clockwise or counter clockwise. The higher the rotation speed in a certain direction is, the harder it gets to control the container.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/829/829a4d6e2720c893079cd14f634cbbb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["AyoubKhammassi"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
