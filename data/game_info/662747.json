Why do i do this? Well i am gonna optimize this even MORE cuz on the github page is kinda laggy (not that much but my phone is a potato so i had to optimize it) btw, enjoy!</p>\n<p>Things before playing: if you want HITBOX controls instead of RIGHT controls, go to options on controls setting, you should see 2 arrows on top and press the arrows until you find HITBOX, then press on exit and save, this works for CHROMEBOOKS too, but you NEED a touchscreen one since you CANT change the controls from touchscreen to keyboard (i tried it) and also, why does the hitbox look so different than the luckydog's hitbox textures? Because i wanted to make the hitbox easier to detect on how to use it (for new players) so yeah... BTW, im gonna start porting mods on THIS version of fnf mobile, dont worry, i am gonna make chromebook only ports also with kade engine 1.3, meaning that if for example you wanna play D SIDES on mobile, you head to the one in fnf mobile PLUS, if you wanna play it on chromebook you gotta go to games with NO touchscreen section.</p>\n<p>v0.0.1: mobile PLUS release!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T04:51:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/387/387798b2c714a3d6efc8e64bafe9c036.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["chromebook_gamerwastaken"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
