Includes conditionally displayed trees, and a dialogue choice with accompanying differing text.</p>\n<p>Characters in the game are various real people (and me) from the Twine Discord server. The game itself mainly consists of jokes and references about these people.

There's truly no harm done between them.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-24T06:19:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/604/604c4bfe20011ee2c1986213068db22b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ghostchibi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
