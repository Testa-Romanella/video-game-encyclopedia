{"id": 64799, "slug": "howdy-the-western-game", "name": "Howdy! The Western Game", "name_original": "Howdy! The Western Game", "description": "Let yourself get in the most addictive plot in action games this decade. Explore the mind of westman on his road to revenge as he shoots down the foes and tries to find relief after the loss of his daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nControl his rampage against \"banditos\" and those, who deny his right to avenge what was taken away from him. Destroy the Wild West world as much us you want, but remember to keep something behind, so you can hide from the bullets or use it to your advantage in any creative way you can think of. Out of ammo in saloon? Use the furniture or bottles to fight your way out (or in).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe story is focused on the mental condition of the hero and it will engage you like no game did before. Breathtaking music made by Essex won't let you sleep until you find out what fate you deserved through the game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIsometric view will help you plan the fight, but don't think you will catch enemies off guard every time. Some of them might be more intelligent. Or just TOUGH. Or they might turn out as bosses, but we will get to that later.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:55:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/923/923e29e3b86fdd6a832a3f8b38d1e2a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 207, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Epic Lore"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ultimate Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
