Our main objective is to connect as many friends or strangers online to work together and discover the garden metaverse. A realistic, hyper-stylized land powered by Unreal Engine 5.<br/><br/>Upon entering the world and sharing your name, you will have access to a number of features for your character. Throw on a fresh shirt or some kicks that best fit your style in the wardrobe room.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Share your artistic creations or personal tag with others worldwide using the built-in network paint mechanics. Discover hidden realms by solving a range of puzzles. Activate cooperative side quests to uncover rare items, achievements, and story experiences. Or simply kick it with your friends and enjoy a virtual show at the central performance stage. The possibilities here are truly endless.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Steven Rea is the creator of the BRAiN VOMiT IP; a creative brand and personal endeavor to \"vomit\" whatever is in his brain, out onto the canvas. Steven is a skilled classical artist, specializing in oil painting, digital drawing, and streetwear. A year ago he joined forces with lead developer G. John Turnbull to create a popular art series known as, \"BRAiN VOMiTS GARDEN,\" a collection of flower portraits with personality and messages from the soul. Something people could see a reflection of themselves in. From the splash they created with this art, in addition to the various streetwear collaborations it inspired (The Hundreds, Carrots by Anwar Carrots)  the metaverse WAS BORN. The team was inspired to take all of this art they were creating and find a place where they could not only put it up for display, but create story-rich experiences, interconnectedness, and missions that fans and newcomers alike can have fun with together-- a BRAiN VOMiT UNIVERSE. One we hope to continue to expand past the limits of our imaginations.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T09:09:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35d/35d75dfd3e90924ffacf627eb4cdec1f.jpg", "website": "https://www.bvgarden.io/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 8, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 322, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["G.
