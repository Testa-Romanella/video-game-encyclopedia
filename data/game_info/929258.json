But there's a catch: your soul has been deemed unworthy of both heaven and hell, leaving you trapped in the in-between realm known as Limbo. Now, in order to escape, you must not only crack the case, but also unintentionally alter the past to prevent the murders from ever happening in the first place. Can you navigate this shadowy world and find your way out of Limbo?</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Escape: Pause menu\r\n</li><li>W, A, S, D: Movement\r\n</li><li>Left mouse: Interact\r\n</li><li>Right mouse: Zoom\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Behind the scenes: This was the first game jam project for most of our team, and we managed to complete it in just 2 weeks. Although Gagarin created an enemy ghost, it didn't make it into the final game. Baribob was responsible for designing and creating all the puzzles. As the project leader with no prior experience, I (Kiti) am proud of my team's progress and contribution to the project. We're excited to continue making more games in the future and share our love for the gaming community.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Ashley Grove (Kiti) - Director, Programmer, 3D artist &amp; Environment artist.</li><li>(Baribob) - Gameplay designer &amp; Senior programmer\u00a0.</li><li>(PunkGagarin) - Junior Programmer.\r\n</li><li>Lorenzo Thomas (Jairientrouve) - Junior 3D modeler.\r\n</li><li>Alessandro Sicardi (AleKape) - Audio designer &amp;\u00a0Senior composer.<br/>\n</li><li>Luca Gentilforti - Junior composer.</li><li>Joby Tanseco (Joby) - Audio designer.\r\n</li><li>Suetin Mikhail Ilyich (The_Elementus) - Audio designer.\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T08:42:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9d/f9d6c777be269de5353d5fbf1950eb9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LucaGentilforti", "Alessandro Sicardi", "KitiDev"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
