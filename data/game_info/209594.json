{"id": 209594, "slug": "angle-smash", "name": "Angle Smash", "name_original": "Angle Smash", "description": "<p>Project for Game Studio I class, Fall 2016.</p>\n<p>This game is a minimalist adaptation of the mechanics of the Super Smash Bros Series. Rather than having many different attacks and abilities, players knock their opponent back and build up damage by hitting them with the colored wedge on their body. The opponent will get knocked back at the angle that the attacker's wedge is facing when they are hit. Damage is represented by the increasingly red shade of the player's body. The player's wedge will rotate automatically as they move around, but they can hold a button to fix their rotation to its current angle. Players can also initiate a dash by double tapping a horizontal direction - this may be done on the ground, or once in the air before landing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a1/2a1417ac0d33e2b18c61c77bbd8a12f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ben Costrell"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
