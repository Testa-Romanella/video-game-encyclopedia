Also decided that this time I would create something with my 7 year old Nephew. So he came up with the idea and story. I did the art and tried to bring it all together.\u00a0 Also made for Portrait mode on mobile cause he wanted to play it on that.</p>\n<p>It's an unfinished mess but he had a great time making it, so it was my funnest time doing one of these.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is a choose your own adventure in a haunted house where the more options you have the worse the game is.</p>\n<p><strong>Updated</strong> with a mute button to stop all sounds and music. Just press <strong>M</strong>.</p><p><strong>Updated</strong> with an alternate Windows version cause I've heard from someone that the Windows version just shows a white screen for them. Hopefully this version works instead.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/963/96391470c721b216fa6738e66a486c64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Franklin's Ghost"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
