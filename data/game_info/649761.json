From there they are given free reign over their character inside of a large restaurant kitchen. The player is to follow the recipe, correcting gathering and preparing ingredients to make the dish as perfect as possible. The kitchen has multiple stations such as a cutting board, stove, oven, etc. When the player brings ingredients to these stations to cut, bake, or mix them, the camera briefly switches to a first-person perspective where an animation of the player preparing the food is played. The player wins the game when they successfully complete the meal, which then shows a small victory animation. Should the player not prepare the food in time or fail to follow the recipe, they will fail and the game will play a losing animation.\r\n</p>\r\nKnown Issue\r\n<p>The camera\u00a0 may break, when it breaks, press ALT</p>\r\nReference\r\nStory\r\n<p>https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/oh-youre-approaching-me-jojo-approach\r\n</p>\r\nImage\r\nCoffee shop background by 66rpg\r\n<p>https://www.66rpg.com/monthly/beijingxiandai\r\n</p>\r\nCity Background\r\n<p>https://unsplash.com/photos/6hDFASGm9Aw\r\n</p>\r\nBush Background\r\n<p>https://unsplash.com/photos/L2oedF1AsH8\r\n</p>\r\nStar icon by Robert Brooks\r\n<p>https://www.gamedeveloperstudio.com/graphics/viewgraphic.php?item=1v494v189m6p6x256v\r\n</p>\r\nSound\r\nBGM_FirstMeeting_LudumDare28Track5\r\n<p>https://tallbeard.itch.io/music-loop-bundle\r\n</p>\r\nBGM_Cooking_ShakeNBake\r\nBGM_Title_CuriosityShop1\r\n<p>https://freemusicbyjames.itch.io/songsloops\r\n</p>\r\nSFX_Botton_Hover_Replace Lid on Ceramic Cookie Jar\r\nSFX_Button_Active_Remove Lid off Ceramic Cookie Jar\r\nEnter Time on Microwave, Cook Food, and Finish with Beeps\r\nFood Sizzling in Skillet Freesfx\r\n<p>https://www.freesfx.co.uk/sfx/cook\r\n</p>\r\nFrying_Food-J_Bravo-1591470421\r\n<p>http://soundbible.com/2031-Frying-Food.html\r\n</p>\r\nA bunch of SFX is from Yan\u2019s pack\r\n<p>https://yaen-games.itch.io/yns-gdc-relief-pack\r\n</p>\r\nCredit\r\nBerke Boz\r\n<p>Developing, Game Design\r\n</p>\r\nChell\r\n<p>Game Design Direction, UI &amp; UX, Script, Audio\r\n</p>\r\nConstantine Tsertos\r\n<p>Animation, Posing &amp; Rigging, Modeling\r\n</p>\r\nMahima Agrawal\r\n<p>Modelling\r\n</p>\r\nTracy Chen\r\n<p>Texturing, Art Direction, Illustration\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T06:14:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0db/0db59644ecef408a6b510f7d8ecb2199.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["uucky"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
