From 1881 to 1883 he travelled along the northwestern coasts of the Americas. Commissioned by a support comitee, he purchased and catalogued an immense number of artefacts and objects from local tribes for the German Humboldt Foundation. Totem's Sound is based on his personal accounts. </em></p>\n<p><em>Well, almost!</em></p>\n<p><em>Enjoy a day of Johan's journey, featuring great outdoor activities such as canoe races, collecting clams, not getting eaten by a giant grizzley and of course fish oil binge drinking. Get in contact with the local tribes, that are struggling to preserve their ways of life and their cultures in a rapidly changing world.</em></p>\n<p>\r\n\tTotem's Sound was conceived and produced by gold extra with the support of Causa Creations in the framework of the Humboldt Lab Dahlem, a project by the Kulturstiftung des Bundes in collaboration with the Foundation Preu\u00dfischer Kulturbesitz Berlin.
