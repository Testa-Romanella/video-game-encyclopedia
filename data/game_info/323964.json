Thanks for checking out my game. :) In case you're wondering about the title: I drew inspiration from https://libraryofbabel.info and wanted to add a \"parallel world\" that represented the forest from which the books were made. But a week and a half is not enough time for me to get much done, unfortunately.<br/></p>\n<p>Anyway, I hope you enjoy! I recommend using Chrome to play this game. It does run in Firefox, but at least on my machine, Chrome is much faster. Also, here's the source code if you're interested: https://github.com/samestep/babel-forest</p>\n<p>Description:</p>\n<p>\"In Babel Forest, you play as an octopus trying to escape an infinite library. Legend tells of a parallel world containing the forest from which those books were made... but that forest is not to be found in this game. Crawl and jump around to your heart's content, and peruse the eccentric collection of books to be found.\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-31T06:39:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f0/1f050b285be71cb63d51e21a860976ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["samestep"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
