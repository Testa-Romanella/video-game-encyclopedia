Experience your first day at \"Vive La University\" as you navigate the ins-and-outs of the schools prominent \"Political Society Club\". Will the president of the club, Max, catch your eye? Or maybe the young playwright, Oly? The choice is yours in this work of historical fiction and romance. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nDuring the beginning of the pandemic I was reading a book titled \"Twelve Who Ruled\" by RR Palmer. The book is about the Committee of Public Safety and it's members during the period known as the \"Year of Terror\" in France. It's a great book, very informative. I highly recommend it if you're into that period of history. But there was something I just couldn't shake... <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThese men were all so interesting with such strong personalities and crazy drama, so why... <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHad no one put them in a visual novel dating sim yet? <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is how Love and Guillotines was born. A visual novel video game which allows you to woo the most powerful figures of the French Revolution. Be careful to stay on everyone's good side, or you might just lose your head.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nScript: Ellen Noel <br/>\r\nProgramming: Chilliac<br/>\r\nCharacter Art: Emily Horn <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAdditional Resources: <br/>\r\nFlorassence <br/>\r\nCreaPracticus<br/>\r\nPatat0Master", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-28T02:48:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02a/02acb019565be92ff12ffbeaa7e1cb67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 206, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Chilliac", "Ellen Noel", "Emily Horn"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Ellen Noel"], "esrb_rating": null}
