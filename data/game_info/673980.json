When the player hits a coin, the score goes up one. Then the player hits cube, the remaining time reduces by five seconds.\u00a0When the time runs out, the game would restart. <br/><br/></p><p>The game was built using the 3D game starter template, so the player would move with W/A/S/D(up/left/down/right) keys and jump with escape key. The player can go up the stairs and plane. Something can be improve is to make the bumper cube be a trigger as well\u00a0to restart the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T10:13:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20f/20f4807f6fb272db64f85a2fa301f982.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LujieZ"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
