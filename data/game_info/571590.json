The only salvation left for humanity lies in the mysterious Tower of Oblivion. Discover the secrets stored within, and restore peace to the world.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Developer's Notes</strong></p>\n<p>This is an rpg maker game I made 5 years ago with the rpg maker vx ace engine. I never got to upload it because there was a pretty nasty bug that happens early on that I couldn't fix. It happens at the start, so an easy workaround is to simply restart the game. Please take note of this bug before you download and donate!
