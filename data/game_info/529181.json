Novice players can have fun and enjoy the variety of unique minigames while more experienced players can test their skill by achieving the longest win streak. Players will be tested on their reflexes as well as their ability to adapt to different situations within these minigames. These minigames are randomized so each play through will feel different. Each of these events have their own gameplay mechanics and artwork which makes each of them challenging and unique. You can compete and outsprint your opponent in a race, make clutch plays in soccer, shoot targets in the blink of an eye and more! Additionally, these minigames start off relatively easy and simple. However, as the player progresses, the difficulty of these minigames are also increased to make the game more challenging. Players will have to think quickly in order to achieve a high score. \u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T05:23:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa4/aa4032d269bc9281477e3be6697dc720.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Amateur_Hour1"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
