{"id": 61273, "slug": "groundless", "name": "Groundless", "name_original": "Groundless", "description": "Groundless is a 2v2 arena game where we took the ground out, and put it in the hands of the players.<br/><br/><br/><strong>In Groundless\u2026</strong><br/>You and your friends play as competing tribes who alter the ground by building and destroying it to collect offerings for your guardian spirit.<br/><br/><strong>Indirect Interaction</strong><br/>Players interact indirectly through the ground. It\u2019s how every player moves. Built ground helps you, but also your enemies. Likewise, destroyed ground hurts movement for both you and your enemies as well.<br/><br/><strong>Building &amp; Destroying Ground</strong><br/>Every player has the ability to build ground they\u2019ll be able to walk on. Enemies can walk on this ground as well. Built ground stays around until destroyed or until it decays over time.<br/>Every player can also destroy ground, even from beneath other players. If you don\u2019t have ground beneath you, you fall to your death.<br/><br/><strong>Play with friends, or against them!</strong><br/>Groundless has 3 game modes. Ritual is a team-based 2v2 mode where players must work together collecting offerings to gain points. Control is a free-for-all mode where players keep a central offering away from the other competitors. Lastly, Sacrifice is a free-for-all mode pitting players against one another with a limited stock of lives.<br/>All of these modes make for more ways to play Groundless!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T17:04:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9e/d9e55177bd372691929ce4f853503edd.jpg", "website": "http://root121games.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 214, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Root121 Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Root121 Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
