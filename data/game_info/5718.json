{"id": 5718, "slug": "starpoint-gemini-2", "name": "Starpoint Gemini 2", "name_original": "Starpoint Gemini 2", "description": "<p>In Starpoint Gemini 2, you assume the role of a starship captain in the distant future. Set in the open world of Gemini system, the game continues the original Starpoint Gemini. The player controls a single vessel that can be used not only for battle but also for many other missions. There are many occupations in the game, and the player can trade, mine resources, explore new planets, enter wars, rescue other ships in distress, hunt for space pirates, or even become a pirate. In the freeroam mode, your missions are randomly generated, while in the campaign mode, there are also scripted quests that form the game\u2019s plot. It offers you a role of a young space cadet who seeks revenge for his dead father. The plot is not binding, however, and the game is more oriented towards free exploration.<br />\nThere\u2019s a roster of more than sixty ships to choose from, and three classes to which your captain character can belong: Gunner, Commander, or Engineer. Each of them has special perks. The ship can be upgraded with new weapons, defenses, and engines. As your influence and wealth grow, you can buy more ships and expand your fleet. You will still only control one ship at a time, while the others may serve as wingmen.</p>", "metacritic": 70, "released": "2014-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:39:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95a/95a33413f84e474ada45f4c9ff2d5766.jpg", "website": "http://www.starpointgemini.com", "rating": 2.26, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 96, "owned": 1764, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 43, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 78, "ratings_count": 101, "suggestions_count": 436, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 102, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["Little Green Men Games"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Iceberg Interactive", "Little Green Men Games - Intercorona"], "esrb_rating": null}
