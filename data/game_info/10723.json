Maya LT lets you model, texture, light, and animate 3D characters and environments for your game. It\u2019s based on industry-standard 3D tools used by game developers worldwide and refined continuously based on community feedback. Maya LT puts pro-level tools in the hands of indie game makers, empowering artists to realize the full creative potential of their game design.<br/><br/><strong>Stingray</strong> is a 3D game engine built on a powerful, data-driven core architecture. It features a physically-based renderer that can produce visually stunning games and VR experiences. Stingray features an unprecedented level of connectivity to Autodesk 3D tools like Maya LT. Working with a game engine that is directly connected to your 3D tool simplifies every part of the game-making process.What versions of Maya LT and Stingray are on Steam?<ul><li>Maya LT 2017 Update 3 - released February  22, 2017.
