Once you&#39;ve captured a Rat Girl, you may sell it for money so you can create more traps to capture more rat girls. While some levels either require you to build a number of cages or kill a number of Rat Girls, there are levels where you&#39;re goal is to Slay the Rat Queen using your Poison Cheese.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-16T10:13:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71a/71a89900d90c576ee5e419b5b8cb82dd.jpg", "website": "https://katwhorm.itch.io/ratqueen", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "Android", "PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
