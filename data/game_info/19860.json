It began as a global idea of saving mankind from hunger and lack of resources, and ended as a brutal and merciless war in space far from Earth. The target was a group of planetary systems in the constellation Draco, and what was found there changed everything ...<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game is not a classic real-time strategy (RTS) - we changed the basic principles of resource harvesting, units control and implemented a number of interesting ideas(unusual for RTS). We expect that this will give players a new gaming experience and bring a lot of fun.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe main goal of the player - the organization of an effective system of extraction and processing of resources to get the maximum benefits in the construction and research, capture control points on the map and the complete destruction of the enemy. Style of gameplay can be different, depending on the conditions of victory.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game has a built-in wiki, which will be expanded with the development of the project and will help players to understand the intricacies of the gameplay.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T11:49:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbf/bbfc25c4ba6c377fb736009cdcfa4333.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 78}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 519, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Casualogic"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Casualogic"], "esrb_rating": null}
