As generations mastered this newfound energy, they discovered many ways through which Taika could\u00a0grace all life with advancements in a variety of fields, grant longer lives, and push one and all to pursue\u00a0masterful self-expression...</em></p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n<p>Only a few weeks have passed since the sudden appearance of the phantasm wisps - strange, colorful beings of light, made of the divine energy Taika.</p>\n<p>Their source, determined to be somewhere on the Island of Fairies, has started leaking a wild, chaotic Taika. The Fairy Kingdom tried their best to contain the Taika, but ultimately failed. Now, the chaotic Taika takes form in phantasm wisps, and terrorizes those unlucky enough to stumble upon them.</p>\n<p>House Vermillion is the head of a kingdom of Hybrids-a mix of man and fairy-and the Fairy Kingdom's closest ally. Now, with the Fairy Kingdom on lockdown,\u00a0even they find themselves in the dark. King August Vermillion grows uneasy regarding the state of affairs within the Fairy Kingdom, and his son, Nieo, takes notice.</p>\n<p>As the eldest of August's children still living on the royal grounds, Prince Nieo August Vermillion, along with his two fairy retainers, Lucia Lavie and Huey Aldenne, set out on their own to the Island of Fairies, in search of the truth!</p>\n<p>_____________________________________________________</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong></p>\n<p>In this game, you play as Nieo August Vermillion, Lucia Lavie, and Huey Aldenne, making their way towards the Fairy Kingdom's capital city.

Alt+Tab serves as a quick temporary fix, but I'm determined to find the root of this prior to the full release. If anyone knows what could be causing this (could be NVIDIA drivers) and how to remedy it, please let me know in the discussion boards! Otherwise, have fun!!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T08:24:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c61/c61403906362f536ec130d9cbf10e1c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 251, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Temajin"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
