Or as you start to clear rows, repair blocks from the cleared rows. And during the game of Tetris you and your companion switches whom is playing and whom is building, quite exciting! The difference from normal Tetris is that you don't lose when you reach the ceiling (only) but when you run out of blocks to build with. You have to constantly clear rows and repair blocks so you can continue to play!\u00a0<br/><br/></p><p>The game of course closes with alt+f4</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T05:25:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/387/387ffda5356c776971a67c13e7d079ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jojoje"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
