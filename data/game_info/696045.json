Or something like that anyway. To take advantage of the 4 element idol system, match up against the enemies weak to your style!<br/></p>\n<p>==========</p>\n<p>Cultured type units are the ones that will give you that wink, wink, nudge, nudge. While not openly un-seiso, they know what you're talkin 'bout if you know what i mean. They deal Bonk damage which is strong against \"Sinful\" type units who are too salty, too horny, or too icky for their own good.<br/></p>\n<p>Sinful units have a very recognizable vice, and typically \"lack a filter\". Their fans love them all the more for it though! They deal Unconventional damage which is good for breaking through \"Serious\" type units' defenses.</p>\n<p>Serious type units are hard workers and always try to keep up a good image. Of course, sometimes that image cracks in the face of horror games, inadvertent innuendos, or worse! This \"Gap-Moe\" damage is very effective against Cute type units who are easily entertained.</p>\n<p>Cute type units are just sunshine and rainbows! They're exuberence and energy gets them many admirers, but also tends to get them into trouble... especially if they end up letting out a little bit of their sociopathic side... but everyone can forgive them because they are cute! Their Sunshine damage is extra effective against Cultured types who typically like to remain indoors and away from crowds.</p>\n<p>==========</p>\n<p>Original goal was a free, but complete game in a 30 day time frame. While mostly successful, it did fall short in several ways:</p>\n<p>-uncommon AI pathfinding bug that teleports enemies to spaces they normally couldn't reach (cause identified as open node that cannot be reached due to impassable objects)</p>\n<p>-rare crashes immediately after room changes</p>\n<p>-no sound or music implemented</p>\n<p>-not fully playtested to completion</p>\n<p>Game Successes:</p>\n<p>Multiple characters and enemies that can fight, level up, and travel to between maps using a grid-based, turn-based system. A complete campaign with\u00a07 levels, Title, and End Game screens. Individual character abilities and a combat circle for advantages and disadvantages between different units.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>I do hope to continue work on the game engine at least, if not necessarily the setting. Having a\u00a0setting I didn't have to think too much about though\u00a0did help keep me on track to actually see the project through to the end. On the other hand, I'd also like to take the knowledge gained in this project and switch to a newer engine that can export to HTML5 for online play if possible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T05:41:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a50/a50bb09196bf74efd613f723c5cd06d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["delta_angelfire"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
