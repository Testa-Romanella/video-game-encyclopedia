Use the frozen fairies for cover, or launch them towards your enemies to rack up points by killing several fairies in one shot. The score is multiplied by the combo count. Aim your shots well and more fairy maids will dare to go out.</p>\n<p>Inspired by Space Invaders.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li> 'z' to shoot</li><li>\u00a0'left' and 'right' to move</li><li>\u00a0'esc' to skip the intro and pause</li></ul>\n\n<p>Game by create2019 (https://create2019.itch.io), mojo (https://twitter.com/mozzydippers) and illusorybread (https://illusorybread.itch.io).\u00a0\r\n    </p>\n<p>Made as a submission to the Touhou Game Jam 10 (https://itch.io/jam/touhou-jam-10).\r\n</p>\r\nTouhou Project original concept, characters, and other elements are the property of ZUN and Team Shanghai Alice.
