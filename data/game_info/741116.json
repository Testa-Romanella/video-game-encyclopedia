It started off as an idea that didn't seem obtainable for a Game Design class but with the hard work from Chase, who found all the music and other resources we may need, the game seemed doable. Addison Garlove came up with the idea first and\u00a0was the scribe that put all of the code into the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Special thanks to:</p>\n<p>Micheal Kiang-Helping us whenever we got stuck\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aspen Caudill-Grammar and Storyboard</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T10:34:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/287/287bfcb8c1e2f8358c34a2eed9cd96b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["addgar22"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
