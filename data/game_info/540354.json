You\u2019re fresh out of high school, but can not afford to pursue post-secondary education, which is a bit of a problem for you considering the career field you want to go into. You apply for several jobs at investigation bureaus from several different places and all of them reject you except for one: A small no-name company called\u00a0 the YDIB. You move to the small town it\u2019s located in soon, and begin your job not too long later. Your first day is spent unpacking and acquainting yourself with the locals. Turns out the \u201cinvestigation bureau\u201d you\u2019ve been accepted to is a two-man organization. A very small company that hasn\u2019t had a case in months. You begin to lose hope, when suddenly, a high-profile case presents itself before you. One night when you browse the news mindlessly, you come across an interesting article just as you\u2019re about to fall asleep. A most wanted phantom thief is rumoured to have touched down in your small town recently and has made an announcement that he will be stealing your town\u2019s only treasure. And there is a bounty worth a million on his head.\u00a0Filled with\u00a0 ambition, you\u00a0tell the YDIB about this and your bureau takes on the case. However, the chances of apprehending the thief are slim- after all, three investigators from a tiny company from a quaint little town? Catching an infamous criminal mastermind who always gets what he wants? Crazy, but you\u2019re just the girl for the job. Along with your two coworkers, you will crack down on the elusive criminal. Will you successfully apprehend him? Or will your efforts be in vain? And will you find love on the way?</p>\r\n\r\nLove Interests\r\n<p>Yuusuke Yasui, the hardworking lawyer. Work-focused with little time to spare, he is the epitome of efficiency, though sometimes you catch a hint of exhaustion in his expression. Can you show him that there may be more to life than just his occupation?</p>\n<p>Theodore Doleman, the zany inventor. Some say he has a screw loose, but he calls it \"being inspired at inopportune times\". Does his passion burn only for his research, or will he decide to share some of it with you?</p>\n<p>Vincent Li, the gruff criminal investigator. Despite his standoffish demeanor and blunt personality, the two of you seem to have a lot in common. Will his heart remain locked away, or will you be the one to unlock his true feelings?</p>\n<p>Lyden Axel, the enigmatic phantom thief. The charming magician of the night seems to know something that you don't.\u00a0 Will you be able to catch him first, before he steals both the treasure and\u00a0your heart?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T04:13:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/613/61353210a9cdbaa433d3b9d42a7aeb6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 208, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mallowbird"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
