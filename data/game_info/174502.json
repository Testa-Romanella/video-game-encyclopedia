The word entered will determine an item to be generated, immediately, for the player.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tWhile traversing many rooms and defeating different kinds of enemies, including a boss at the end of each level, players will discover which items they enjoy the most through experimentation. Each play is a chance to try new equipment or reuse favorites.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tWe are currently in the alpha stage of development. Word Lab: Letter Arsenal is a working title and may change in the future.
