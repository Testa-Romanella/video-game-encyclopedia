The player takes on the role of COOL GUY, a loser living with their mom, as they experience \"the greatest night of their life,\" in a quest to prove mom wrong-- twin-sized mattresses do, in fact, constitute adequate decorations. Recruit friends, solve mysteries, and enjoy delicious food as you travel the tri-state area in search of the Legendary Mattress Stores. <br/></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It features a mostly silly tone, but has some heart to it. Not counting optional content, the game runs about 2 hours long.</p>\n<p> Corn Sausage was developed as an exercise in kicking myself out of the nest, so-to-speak. With 3000 hours and 2 private projects under my belt, I was ready to make something grand to release to the public. Before I could do that, however, I forced myself to spend 2 months and no more on a project (thus the Pokemon artstyle) that I would have no choice but to show to the public.</p>\n\n<p>Ver. 1.2.0 (6 November 2022)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T16:53:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/500/5005c3810032ccfb86b47049008882be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["adam v"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
