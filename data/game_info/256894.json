You jump with 'spacebar', you aim with your mouse. There are items laying and floating about, they can either be good for you, or, instead, harmful. You can shoot FlashdriveRockets(R) with the left mouse button or try to catch items using the GrapplingMouse(tm) with the right mouse button.</p>\n<p>It may seem pretty difficult at first, but if you time your jumps right and be very careful about what you destroy and what you pick up, with just a very little bit of luck you'll suceed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50e/50ec83d7aa859ec21e2423e341a6aa0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daromaru"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
