An interactive environment where the player is a scientist in a containment facility, containing and interacting with various anomalous entities.</p>\n<p><strong>My Features/Goals I wanted to include:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Entity Containment<ul><li>Each entity has its own behavior, giving a challenge to the player to interact with each in a different way</li><li>Entities can break out, eventually being \"retreived\" and reappearing in their rooms.</li></ul></li><li>Confusing Level Layout and Geometry<ul><li>Explore NonEuclidean Level Design and how to create it\u00a0</li><li>Create it in a seamless fashion so that the viewer doesn't realize it\u2019s happening</li></ul></li><li>Polished Game Mechanics</li><ul><li>Make a game that is easily convertible into vr, without any camera-locked ui. All interaction is in the 3d space.</li><li>Make it into an environment that feels good and polished. Something that would be fun to mess around in, and discover things about the world.</li></ul></ul>\n<p>I guess you can decide for yourself whether I successfully achieved all of these. Hope you enjoy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I would love any feedback on the game. Please consider donating if you really enjoyed. I spent a lot of work and time on this one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-17T03:18:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34a/34a9f2a8dcffc483103c42520dfd118d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LoadingRemexe"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
