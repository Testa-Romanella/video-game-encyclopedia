This package includes platforming polish tricks such as</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Apex modifiers:\u00a0</strong>the force of gravity is reduced when at the apex of a jump</li><li><strong>Coyote Time:\u00a0</strong>When off the ground, you get a very short duration in which you're still considered \"grounded\"</li><li><strong>Edge Detection:</strong> When it seems like you're on an edge, the game will bump the player up to meet that edge</li><li><strong>Variable Jump Height:\u00a0</strong>Jump height depends on how long you hold the button</li><li><strong>Jump Buffering:\u00a0</strong> If you press the space bar a bit too early, the game will buffer it so that you'll jump in the next few frames if you land on the ground</li><li><strong>Clamped Fall Speed:</strong> Fall speed is clamped to make falling objects easier</li></ul>\n<p>In addition to the platforming package, I also added a grappling hook variant that builds on top of this package that can be used to latch yourself to walls and hooks, and then dash to those positions. That being said, the dash is a bit glitchy when it comes to corners</p>\n<p>The prototype consists of a simple onboarding level and a time trial course.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Anthony Hoang: Lead programmer for the player package and level designer</li><li>Andrew Smith: QA Tester</li></ul>\n<p>Made in the span of around 1 month.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T11:22:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b8/0b840e3f4f4d836e0a46b5ae3c488c63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anthony Hoang"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
