With over 30 possible updates (and bugs) available, in a somewhat random order, each playthrough can be as exciting and unpredictable as the last!</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>LD49 Entry!</p>\n<p>Unstable Release is a throwback to the classic game breakout, with a twist based on modern game development practices, hot fixing, and bad development. Play a rapidly deteriorating\u00a0game where unstable developers push unstable patches without testing,\u00a0and try to survive as long as you can.</p>\n<p>This is my 1st Ludum Dare and I loved trying to think more creatively around the theme. I hope you\u2019ll like the game as much as I enjoyed making it :)<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n</p>\n<p>- Press space to release the ball.</p>\n<p>- Move the paddle left and right with the arrow keys, or A/D.</p>\n<p>- Don't let the ball fall below the screen edge!</p>\n<p>- Don't let the blocks hit the bottom of the screen!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T05:46:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a80/a80620727bce5b85b3551df2a3d0a4be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["hi-im-alex"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
