{"id": 612856, "slug": "treacherous-journeys", "name": "Treacherous Journeys", "name_original": "Treacherous Journeys", "description": "<p>Treacherous Journeys is an online multiplayer Action RPG (ARPG) in early development looking for players to test the game.<br/>A Pre-alpha demo is available for download.<br/></p>\n<p>The original inspiration comes from classic Hack \u2018n\u2019 Slash  sidescrollers, adventure games, isometric ARPGs as well as text-based  multiplayer RPGs (MUDs \u2013 Multi User Dungeons).\r\n </p>\n<p>Obviously the influence of the MMORPG genre, itself originally  derived from MUDs, is undeniable. But where the focus in MMORPGs has  historically been on massive game worlds with tens of thousands of  players the ambition is to have smaller server populations and focus on  being true to the ARPG as well as the MUD heritage.\r\n </p>\n<p>This means that in contrast to most current ARPGs much of the world  is shared. Some locations will be instanced to provide for an immersive  experience for solo-players as well as small groups.\r\n </p>\n<p>In contrast to most MMOs this is in fact an <em>Action</em> RPG.  Everything is done in actual game space and in real time. This means no  tab-targeting, and as a player you may sidestep an incoming attack \u2013 if  you can. Basically there will be no homing missiles \u2013 except for actual  homing missiles\u2026\r\n<br/><br/>Official website: https://treacherousjourneys.com<br/>Discord: https://discord.gg/R2Cet5QUaB</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T09:42:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/070/0700980f2c4725b734f4235482e0d9ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TreacherousJourneys"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
