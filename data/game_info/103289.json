It's up to you to sort them out, but there's a lot of litter around ready to spoil the party. Can you get through all 15 levels without losing your mind and quitting on the spot?</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Arrow keys </strong>(D-Pad): Select rail.</li><li><strong>Enter</strong> (A Button): Open/close rail.</li><li><strong>Space </strong>(Start Button): Open pause menu. Useful when you need a break.</li><li><strong>Shift </strong>(B Button): Useful to return to the previous menu.</li></ul>\n<p>A better explanation is given in the <strong>ReadMe </strong>file included in the downloadable archive.</p>\n<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE</strong>:\u00a0This game was developed in only seven days. Bugs are VERY possible, but hopefully they won't bite. In any case, while most feature have been successfully implemented, I unfortunately didn't have the time to fully code in the highscores, but they'll come in a future update (once the GBJam 6 is over, that is...)!</p>\n<p>I also had to resort to music from the always great RoccoW because I couldn't find a composer in time to work on my game. Oops! I guess that's an automatic DSQ. Oh, well... Hope it doesn't deter you from enjoying my little work.</p>\n<p>Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with how this came out. There still is some (well, a lot) of work to do, but I guess it came out pretty alright for a 7-day effort. The controls can be a little wonky at times, but they do work.
