The brief was to create a game that fit with the popular franchise of Star Wars, The game had to include three levels that were based on set molecular maps.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When looking at the contribution of the project everything was created by myself. The assets were all from the Unity asset store and were provided for us. I designed the level to create different pathways for players to explore. The level was designed with multiple different stair cases and platforms so the player is encouraged to explore throughout the level. The level is based around rescuing the hostages and trying to get all six hostages back to the ship.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When reflecting back on this work, the one element I would change is the text boxes. This is because I would have the text boxes pop up instead of just being there constantly. Another element of the game I would change is the layout.\u00a0This is because even though I enjoy the multiple platforms in the game, I believe that players would find it repetitive after playing through one of the levels.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T12:23:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/409/4095c1d077986a97918d87cf71bceebd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jacinta Jobsz Allen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
