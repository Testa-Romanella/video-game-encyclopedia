This jam was a prefect opportunity to challenge myself to create something more complicated. Everything in my game, I have written and modeled from scratch and it was quite the learning experience.</p>\n<p>A lot got left out due to time limitations as usual. This time, among other things, sound didn't make it in.</p>\n<p>Why I think my game is nifty:</p>\n<ol><li>I used a marching square algorithm to generate and modify the environment.</li><li>I have a nice object pool for the visual effects so they don't slow down the game</li><li>I spent a very large amount of time creating a level editor and I am pretty happy with it</li></ol>\n<p>Why I think it's not:</p>\n<ol><li>The square march algorithm is not very optimized and it causes a little slow down</li><li>Visuals are lacking</li><li>Sound is missing</li><li>Had no time to create more than one level</li></ol>\n<p>I have included the entire project.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-09T06:45:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a1/1a16a532747b0abd5b59625d08bc1865.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tzanislav"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
