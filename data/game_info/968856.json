The cruelty of her father has reached an all-time high, alongside his command capacity, and Andara is the only one who can stop him this time around. It is time for the heiress of the Ethadian Empire to rise and fight against Ordon\u2019s army, to reclaim what\u2019s just. Fear, pain and death are prices worth-paying, if only to stop her tyrannical father once and for all.<h3>Loaded and Cyber-implanted</h3><br/>The hyper-advanced technology that has helped the oppressors crush the people of Hailstone might just also be their downfall. As Andara, make use of your incredible powers and movement capabilities to breeze into combat, cast powerful blasts of energy, finish enemies and even slow down time.<h3>Special Forces</h3><br/>Nobody said it was going to be easy. Each enemy will have their own behavior, strengths and weaknesses. Special soldiers like the Charger or the Deadeye will pose a formidable challenge, so fight them all as you\u2019re supposed to - constantly moving, aiming for their weak spots and making full use of both your weapons and your whole repertoire of skills.<h3>Extended Synopsis</h3><br/>Ethadians are running out of natural resources. Their home planet will soon stop supporting their hyper-technological way of life. \u2018If Ethadians wish to live, they are forced to conquer\u2019, says supreme commander Ordon to his people. In his mind is Hailstone, a nearby planet where the mining resources are plentiful and the natives are a much less advanced society. \u2018They won\u2019t stand a chance\u2019, Ordon anticipates.<br/><br/>He is right, of course.<br/><br/>Ethadians conquer Hailstone in a breeze. They subdue the natives, killing those who dare to resist and capturing the rest of them. Ordon and his troops set outposts and advanced mining stations all over the rocky planet. They build the huge Central Tower and set up the servers that control their cyber-implants inside it. Ordon\u2019s thirst for expansion won\u2019t end here \u2013 Hailstone will only be the first of many planets to be vanquished by the Ethadians.<br/><br/>Or is it?<br/><br/>Ordon finds opposition where he least expected it. How could Andara, her own daughter, rebel against him? It was a mistake to bring her with him, thinking that their broken relationship could be mended. Andara has escaped her designated outpost on Hailstone. Aided by G1TH, her companion AI, she is now close to destroying the last generator that shields the Central Tower. She is trained, cyber-implanted and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 ready to do almost anything to stop her father\u2019s iniquitous plans.<h3>Key features</h3><ul><li>Engage in fast-paced combat against varied enemies.<br/></li><li>Explore Hailstone while completing puzzles and platforming sections.<br/></li><li>Watch Andara\u2019s rebellion against her own father unfold.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-03T20:42:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa1/fa1aa4045490005b0c0de15418a34655.jpg", "website": "https://www.esat.es", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 303, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ESAT", "Chivito Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["ESAT"], "esrb_rating": null}
