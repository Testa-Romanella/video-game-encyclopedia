You play as one of the champions armed with a bow and the gifts of the god Nuzion. Using your witt, platforming, creative thinking, problem solving, and exploration skills progress through each increasingly difficult challenge in order to claim leadership for your god. Use your arrows to break targets and reveal exit doors, drop hidden platforms to solve puzzles, and use your platforming skills to quickly navigate fast-breaking platforms before perishing in the abyss below. Only one champion ever emerges from the temple. Will you be that champion? Or will you disappear deep inside the temple never to be seen again? Trust is the key.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T06:09:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/422/422ac35a4371d561f792828f6a8da073.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["DanD0415", "Shadow Path Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Marist College"], "esrb_rating": null}
