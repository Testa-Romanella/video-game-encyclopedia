This game was created in a Game Jam (from 11th to 13th May, we had 40h to do it, and some hours were spent sleeping a bit), so at the moment is in active development because we dind't had enough time to finish it correctly but the main idea is done.</p>\n<p>The objective of the game is to collect the 5 types of fruit. Every fruit is located in a different room. There you will find different enemies. You can kill them with your insecticide.</p>\n<p>When you collect a fruit, you have to put it in the mixer but be careful, when you carry a fruit, you can't jump. You can't carry two fruits at the same time.</p>\n<p>You have 3 lives, and if you loose them, the game will finish. If you loose a live and you were carrying a fruit, you will loose it and you will have to pick it again.</p>\n<p>Letter \"P\" is for display de pause menu. You only can save the game near the mixer in the \"safe zone\". Anyway, in the game you will find a wall with the instructions.</p>\n<p>Native (and recommended) game resolution is 1024 x 768.</p>\n<p>If you have any question or idea please tell me in the comments section. We will work on it as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Thank you and have fun!</p>\n<p><strong>STAY TUNED FOR UPDATES!!!</strong></p>\n<p>-Best regards, Sonikka :)</p>\n<p><em>All the music is from\u00a0</em><em>https://freesound.org/</em></p>\n\r\nThis game is made by:\r\n<p><strong>Sonia Prieto</strong>\u00a0(<em>Programmer</em>)\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Carlos Fernandez</strong>\u00a0(<em>Programmer</em>)\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Javier Fernandez</strong>\u00a0(<em>Art/3D Modeling</em>)\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Samuel Baltasar</strong>\u00a0(<em>Art/3D Modeling</em>)\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Luis Martinez</strong>\u00a0(<em>Art/3D Modeling</em>)</p>\n\n\r\nVersions:\r\n<p><strong>15/05/2018 Alpha v.1</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0b/c0bcc2ddf5c6251904d90a5e0714ca31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sonikka"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
