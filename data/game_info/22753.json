They will take you back to a time when RPG\u2019s were truly challenging and, because of this, very rewarding games. By finishing one, you felt like you have really accomplished something. Those were the times where games didn\u2019t lead you by hand with a big, red dot on your minimap or a huge arrow above your head. Many have failed in completing those games without help from a guide or a walkthrough, but those who accomplished this quest can be proud of it because here, being a hero really means something.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach part of the series features very interesting and well told story. The combat is intuitive and fast, and the game mechanics are very easy to get into. So, if you want to test your cRPG skills or find out how they made games back then, this series is an excellent place to start your journey.\n<br/><br/>\nLanguage Notice: Crystals of Arborea is available only in English.Includes Crystals of Arborea, Ishar: Legend of the Fortress, Ishar 2: Messengers of Doom and Ishar 3: The Seven Gates of Infinity\nFour Epic adventures set in a vast, open world full of mysterious places, evil creatures and deadly secrets\nLead a party of five adventurers, each with different set of skills and abilities.\nOn your journey you will find many powerful artifacts and learn new devastating spells.
