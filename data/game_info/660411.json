The beast fires fire balls which you must dodge to avoid damage, as well as a novel kind of ball known as a posi ball, which you must catch. As it is an endless game, you cannot defeat the beast, but rather your goal is to survive and get a high score. For more information on the gameplay, there is a help screen that can be accessed through the settings menu.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T17:47:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e46/e46dd057ca82bee24a3be573eeb6a3dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Aleph_Z"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
