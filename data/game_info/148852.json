Your main weapon will be the bombs you carry: they will allow you to blow rocks blocking your path. Time is of the essence in this journey: the pressure level of the volcano will increase continuously, and too much pressure will result in the dreaded eruption.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSometimes along the way you will encounter rock platforms containing the lava behind them. These will often leak lava: be vary careful! A well-placed bomb in their weak point will make these platforms blow, and the pressure level go down again.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tMade by \r\n\tOnirium Games, sound design by Pierre Le Cardinal.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a4/2a4b244f50df1538ba9f90a5c0ef0bf8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Onirium Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
