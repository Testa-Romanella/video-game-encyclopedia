JUST WATCH OUT FOR THE POOP! <br/><br/>This is a physics puzzle game. It is inspired by the classic Chinese tale, \"Colt Crossing River.\" The goal of Donkey Tonto is to deliver packages, avoid the poop, and collect the envelopes. Making deliveries requires creative use of the objects around Donkey. There are multiples ways of passing levels, but you should find the fastest one. Bear in mind that sometimes a Donkey's mind is more powerful than his muscles. <br/><br/>This game has a vibrant, hand-drawn style, combining exaggerative animation with a humorous plot.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T14:29:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c8/0c84a296f6e131d4aacedcd67392cd96.jpg", "website": "http://www.rocheon.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 212, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Luo Zhi En"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Luo Zhi En"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
