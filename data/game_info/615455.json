But because of some IRL stuff and lack of motivation i couldnt continue the game any longer. But leaving the game to waste entirely is also hard to do, so here is a prototype/tech demo i created from the things i have made so far.</p>\n<p>The future of the project is quite unknown, either i continue it or i would use the source code for other projects.
