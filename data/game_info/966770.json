{"id": 966770, "slug": "tapventures", "name": "Tapventures", "name_original": "Tapventures", "description": "<p>Tap the screen repeatedly to kill the monsters</p>\n<p>Tapventures is an RPG that&#39;s very similar to other clickers. In it your goal is to go different places annihilating all the monsters you can find by quickly and repeatedly tapping the screen.</p>\n<p>As you kill monsters, others with more life points will appear. Fortunately, each time you kill a monster, it drops coins you can pick up and use to increase the damage you do with your taps. You can also unlock other features, such as friends who inflict a fixed amount of damage every second.</p>\n<p>You&#39;ll find the real challenge in Tapventures in the bosses. These creatures have loads of life points, and you have to beat them within a fixed amount of time. If you can&#39;t get their health to zero before time runs out, you&#39;ll have to start the fight again.</p>\n<p>Tapventures is a simple and addictive game. It&#39;s not very original, but still offers an excellent gaming experience, with graphics that are really nice and polished.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-22T07:43:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98c/98cb90c4a785e49048bd80136b8bc79c.jpg", "website": "https://www.amazon.com/Underwater-Apps-Tapventures/dp/B00PHOQZ44", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
