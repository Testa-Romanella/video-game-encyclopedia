It changed a lot as I was learning all the time. It still isn't perfect. It's far from it and I know it. I'm giving it to you for free to have fun and eventually tell me how you feel about it. I will appreciate every honest opinion and please tell me if\u00a0you'd like to play full version of it. For now I'm a little tired and don't know if it's worth developing further.<br/><br/>To make it sound a little more optimistic. I'm super excited I can show you this game. I'm proud how it changed over the year. I hope you'll have fun playing it!<br/><br/><strong>Controls (as they aren't mentioned in game, sorry!)<br/></strong>AD - movement<br/>W/Space - jump<br/>LMB - shoot energy / shoot item (when hold)<br/>RMB - pull item from ground (if you have enough energy) / drop item<br/>E (hold) - heal (if you have full energy container)<br/><strong>After beating boss there's nothing more to do, sorry again!<br/><br/></strong><strong>Music by Aurorae</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>NOTE<br/></strong>Why is it \"Pay what you want\"? I can't sell it. It's too imperfect. But if you want to it's the only way to say a little \"thanks\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-27T03:30:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a52/a52e3533f685c6416be07e1c09c56290.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Cornel"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
