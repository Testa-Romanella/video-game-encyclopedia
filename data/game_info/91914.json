This is the first 3rd of the final game and currently takes about 10-15 minutes to play. There is just the one ending with the choices only making small changes to the story flow and appearance at this stage.</p>\n<p>I made this game to explore different things I had learnt to do making the previous short game. I wanted to make a game I can keep returning back to and building more silly things onto when the fancy strikes me.</p>\n<p>I'm working my way up to being brave enough to try make a point and click adventure game next, so I'm enjoying using this to practice backgrounds and tiny puzzles.</p><p>\u00a0Unfortunately this is a shelved project as it was made to see what I could get done in a\u00a0 month for the game jam, there are many errors and I learnt a lot along the way.\u00a0 Unfortunately I couldn't pull together a full game in the months time frame and only managed to create a small section of a larger game.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent Demo version: NaNoReno Demo", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72f/72fc8ba8a382f1cde6e6e4a049a72091.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 199, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Tookipalooki"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
