This is the first one of its kind to use 3 dimensions that I know of for movement and placement, and it works and functions very well. In fact this is the only true 3d strategy space game that I can think of since Homeworld movement-wise.\"<br/><br/>\"The details are great, especially with the battle. Keep up the good work!\"<br/><br/>\"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE that I can ram, and/or fire upon my fellow ship(s) if I am not careful.\"<br/><br/>\"The concept of the game is great.\"<br/><br/>\"Saw you guys at PAX and played on the Android build. Lots of cool details and a great simulation of 3D space combat.\"</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:14:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8a/c8a414cdd37859565be7fe89d897f098.jpeg", "website": "http://www.starlighttactics.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 9}, "playtime": 7, "achievements_count": 59, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 494, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Escape Hatch Entertainment", "Escape Hatch Entertainment,LLC"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Escape Hatch Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
