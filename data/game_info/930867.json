In My Dream Setup, you can create any setup you want. Any color combination, any budget and any purpose. You are free to create whatever you want.<br/><br/>My Dream Setup is a simulation game about building the room you've always dreamed of. A huge selection of furniture, computers and their accessories, posters, pictures, plants, and other interior details await you. Try all of them and create your dream setup.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Arrange the furniture the way you want. No placing by the grid - complete freedom of action. If you don't like where you put a piece of furniture, just move it at any time. No limits on the amount of furniture in the room. Make a small neat office or a huge studio with a bunch of computers, monitors and other things - it's all up to you.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Change the color of the furniture. All colors of the RGB palette are available to you. Each piece of furniture is customizable separately. This allows you to create all kinds of color combinations. You can paint almost anything: doors, windows, furniture and background color. Try combining different colors and shades to get the best looking room.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A huge selection of wallpapers and wall paints awaits you. Do you want to put wallpaper with flowers in your room? Or are you a fan of loft and want a brick wall? Paint each wall separately to create the most unexpected designs, or paint an entire room in one click. We let your imagination run wild.<br/><br/><br/><br/>See how your room looks under different lighting and weather conditions. We offer you five weather options: sunny, sunset, rain, snow, and night. Each option gives the room a new atmosphere as well as a new view from the window. Also in rainy and snowy weather, precipitation appears on the windows for even more immersion.<br/><br/><br/><br/>My Dream Setup offers you the opportunity to design the room you'll be setting up yourself. Use Blueprint mode to place walls, windows, and doors. You can redesign the room at any time, even if you've already started decorating it.<h3>More features</h3><ul><li>Relaxing, engaging, and highly varied gameplay, limited only by your imagination<br/></li><li>Huge selection of furniture, computers and their accessories, posters, pictures, plants and other interior details<br/></li><li>Ability to share your rooms on Twitter right from the game<br/></li><li>Cozy atmosphere<br/></li><li>RGB lighting</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-03T03:32:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a29/a294e012ee31455541083cb067cf6383.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"owned": 15, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 17, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Campfire Studio"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Campfire Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
