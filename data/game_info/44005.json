Almost always the sky covered in dark gray clouds. Maybe because the city itself is a port, and the endless splashing of the raging sea.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNow is a difficult time. We earn money with Erica as we can: we donate blood, we collect bottles, we distribute leaflets. I work as a loader, she is a cleaner. But everything earned is spent on renting a small one-room apartment in a seedy district.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI often ask myself: \"Why is this happening to me?\" What did I do wrong?\" But still I can't find the answer.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nA few months ago a plane crashed near our city.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt is rumored that one of the passengers in the business class was a well-known sheikh, who carried a large amount of money with him. And money, especially big money, is usually kept in suitcases or safes. And often, in fires, hurricanes, explosions and so on - they remain intact. Find at least a million - you can already live on bank interest from this amount.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAnd I couldn't help but take a chance.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-27T16:14:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/589/589400eb2f75c8db7bcb12f35ca2dfad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 66, "beaten": 2, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 9, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 211, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["morojenoe's empire"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["morojenoe's empire"], "esrb_rating": null}
