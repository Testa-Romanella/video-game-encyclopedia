{"id": 180939, "slug": "bg-adventure", "name": "BG Adventure", "name_original": "BG Adventure", "description": "<p>Follow this link to play</p><p>http://www.sark-ent.com/</p><p>So this is totally free, I don't ever expect anyone to pay or donate anything for it. Honestly it wasn't as good as I hoped it would be when I conceptualized it, but it might provide for some short term entertainment if you want to try it out. It is essentially a board game turn based RPG. Originally it was only multi player but I added a single player mode as well. I have a lot of in game instructions to help you figure out how to play. You will need to be able to run java applet which means using IE, Firefox, or Safari to play. The art sucks I know I did it myself, and I never added music or sound effects. So it's a pretty bad looking project. But the game is fully playable and bug free. </p><p>You pick from 4 different character classes, warrior, paladin, mage or ninja. Each as special abilities and different armor and weapons they can use. The warrior is the only class that does not have magic, instead he uses rage to power up during battle. </p><p>In multi player up to 4 players compete to collect resources which are found in chests or by fighting monsters. Each time and area of the board is cleared of all chests or monsters it upgrades to the next level or chests and monsters, which provide better rescores but monsters are harder to kill. You can select how many levels you want to the monsters and chests to upgrade to before the end game, up to level 5. When all monsters and chests have been collected you battle each other. </p><p>In single player mode you collects recourses and fight a boss at the end of each board, to go on tot he next board which ahs better chests and harder monsters. The more turns you take on each board, the harder the monsters get, so it's not a good idea to try and collect everything each time because the monsters will get too hard. </p><p>There is a lot of details perhaps i made such a simple game too complicated, but you can learn all about it with in game help.  Hope you find at least some level of enjoyment. </p><p>I do plan on making another game, one that is very different form this one. Kind of like the original Zelda but with guns and technology rather than fantasy. I'm looking for someone who can do graphics or music and sound effects. If you're interested in being part of the project, jsut for fun we won't be making money, than let me know. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/388/3883d83f5319746894b319000f5954e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Bugsta"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
