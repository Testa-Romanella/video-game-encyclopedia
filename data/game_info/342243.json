By being educated about the Hydroponic method of farming, the urban space that are available can be repurposed<strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong>for Hydroponic farming that can be an alternative solution to sustain the agricultural needs of the country.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This simulation\u00a0was designed to be a learning material and source of information about building a Hydroponic system. The simulation provides step by step instructions on how to build an actual hydroponic system, Information Menu that contains all the important details about a set of\u00a0suitable plants for hydroponics, and the materials to be used and the different types of Hydroponics method.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>MINIMUM SYSTEM REQUIREMENT</strong></p>\n<p>&gt;Windows OS(64 bit)<br/></p>\n<p>&gt;Intel i3 5th gen</p>\n<p>&gt;2gb VRAM</p>\n<p>&gt;4GB Memory</p>\n<p>&gt;400mb of Storage</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-19T05:05:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d3/4d3f2344c82a3d27adb3dfbf1debf719.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JPHT"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
