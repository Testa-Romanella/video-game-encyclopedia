Find some scrolls, beat up monsters with your staff, and escape the dungeon.</p>\n<p>This game was the first I've ever made by myself. It's pretty unpolished but it is functional. All art assets were created by me. Code snippets were provided either by my instructor, Dylan Fries or by various tutorials found online.
