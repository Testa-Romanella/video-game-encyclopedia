{"id": 310790, "slug": "sprint-3", "name": "Sprint 3", "name_original": "Sprint 3", "description": "<p>Sprint 3 is a painting tool that creates prefabs of 3D primitives where the user clicks on the screen. The program reads user input from the mouse and displays the mouse position at all times. When the user left clicks on the mouse, it creates 3D primitives and destroys them after three seconds. The user can choose to have primitives automatically destroyed or not, change the time to be destroyed, destroy them with a right click or the clear all button. The user can utilize a user interface allowing an individual to choose from three prefabs to be spawned, or hotkeys 4, 5, and 6. Each prefab has 3 unique animations that can be accessed by a dropdown menu or hotkeys 1, 2, and 3. Additionally, one can alter the color scheme, size, opacity, and glow of those primitives. There are toggles to randomize animation speed and type of spawning prefabs, and a slider to directly change the animation speed. Lastly, there is a dropdown to manipulate the animation of the background.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-19T07:12:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25c/25c277773351387632d19ca73b656d12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jansenpimentel"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
