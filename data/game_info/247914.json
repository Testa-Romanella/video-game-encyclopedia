Follow the red lights on the snake's back and press the spacebar with perfect timing to add segments to the creature. Missclicking will instead remove a segment, so be careful.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Sounds confusing? No worries, the game comes with a handy and simple how-to-play tutorial.</p>\n\n<p>Mecha Serpent will certainly test your reaction skills, but also how focused and determined you can stay. There is a cutscene at the end of the game, so do not even consider giving up :P\u00a0Good luck!</p>\n<p>This game was made for the JimJam #2, in 45 hours.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6be/6be0af92c25bc4217cd9afe5e3aa32f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["M8rix"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
