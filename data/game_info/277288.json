One problem\u00a0 was that we weren't actually married, so the boss had to forge us\u00a0some new identities. Another was that the other team was actually in love.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>This was really hard to fit into 1,000 words, and it's definitely cutting it close. Twine counts it at 1,589, but my best estimate puts the amount of code at near 600. There is a decent amount of procedural and conditional stuff going on here, considering.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I ended up having to cut a whole lot of content from the story. I was just so in love with the idea, and got so flowwy with my worldbuilding that it got a teeny bit out of control. Regardless of the Jam results,\u00a0I would love to revisit this and really flesh it out. I may eventually post the somewhat-longer-version with more context, characters, and generative options.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>An entry for SubQ Love Jam.\u00a0Title made using icons from game-icons.net.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dec/dec898bf76abe5ce3eb2d3449f3fcf88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Olivia C Dunlap"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
