{"id": 123205, "slug": "the-flawless-cube", "name": "The Flawless Cube", "name_original": "The Flawless Cube", "description": "<p>Game Description: This is a platformer, but with a flawless character that doesn't even kill his enemies (it can't). This is a game that doesn't need to talk about glitches (because it has a lot). This is a game that is more realistic than the last most realistic game you played. By the way, if you encounter glitches, they were meant to be there (nah, not really).<br/></p><p>Glitch Workaround: As mentioned in the actual description, this game does have some glitches. I haven't been able to fix them entirely, but the workaround for most of the glitches is to press X and respawn at a checkpoint. So whenever you get stuck at a platform, just press X.</p><p>Additional Information: This is my first game. I made this game using Game Maker Studio. Please leave a comment about what you liked/didn't like about it. And thanks for trying it out!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ed/4edbad7f64fce2be72dcb4adf053c3bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Utkarsh Dwivedi"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
