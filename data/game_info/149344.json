The game is currently in development.<br/></p><p>Desciption</p><p>--------------</p><p>F-drummasta is a rhythm game where Guitar Hero and Taiko Drum meet the incredible DJ world of fingerdrumming. Finger drumming is where people play dance tracks with just their fingers by triggering instrument samples that are linked to touch-pads. The game is about building this skill while having fun.<br/></p><p>Controls</p><p>-----------</p><p>Use a keypad or the keys in the center of your keyboard if you are using a laptop. Please follow the tutorial called \"Intro\" to see the keybindings. I highly recommend using a keypad with stickers. Go to our Facebook page to see what I mean :)</p><p>Known bug : Press the refresh icon on the bottom of the screen twice if the Dj Pad is muted at the beginning of a game.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><p>Twitter<br/></p><p>Facebook<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/311/311d5f10d7105a863f1ce1e61c66faef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["sta64"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
