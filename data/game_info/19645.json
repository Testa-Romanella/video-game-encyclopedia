{"id": 19645, "slug": "worms-blast", "name": "Worms Blast", "name_original": "Worms Blast", "description": "<p>Worms Blast is a puzzle game developed by Team 17, a spin-off to the artillery tactical games series Worms. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gameplay shares many similarities with Puzzle Bobble. You control one of several characters most of which are animal weapons from the previous Worms games.<br />\nYour character sits in a boat floating on water and has to clean the playfield from multicolored hexagons hanging on the top. To do so, you can use a variety of weapons, including the iconic Worms\u2019 bazooka, grenades, dynamite sticks, shotgun and many more. With every shot, the weapon changes its color. Shooting blocks of the same color make them along with all color matched blocks connected disappear. If the block is a different color from the weapon, the block gets recolored. </p>\n<h3>Game modes</h3>\n<p>There are three single-player modes: Puzzle, Tournament, vs. CPU; and eight multiplayer modes: Deathmatch, Don\u2019t Drop Em, Star Collection, Tide Trial, One Line For Two, Star Race, Survival and Fight. In multiplayer, the playfield is divided into two separate parts for each player.<br />\nThe barrier between them periodically opens, allowing the player to shoot each other. The puzzle mode consists of 60 levels with different challenges. Completing them unlocks new characters. Each character in the game has its unique characteristics.</p>", "metacritic": 73, "released": "2002-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-28T01:19:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33c/33c4f185c9f312cfcf5243d496178b11.jpg", "website": "http://www.facebook.com/WormsTeam17", "rating": 2.59, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 57, "owned": 1304, "beaten": 24, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 41, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 78, "suggestions_count": 219, "game_series_count": 18, "reviews_count": 78, "platforms": ["PC", "Game Boy Advance", "Classic Macintosh", "GameCube", "PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Team17 Digital"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Ubisoft Entertainment", "Feral Interactive", "Team17 Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
