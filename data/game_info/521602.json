I god rid of this project and decided to name this game raster instead. I made this game over a 48 hour period, and made a video about it which you can find here:</p>\n<p>. I let the game sit for a couple weeks before adding a level editor. I never uploaded the video that I made until about a month after the level editor, and I made this project simply so that people interested can play it.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Speaking of the level editor... You can add every block in the main game into a level. You can save that level and can even load it (crazy I know). The file for this level is located in c:/user/appdata/local/grid/[here]. If you really wanted to go through the effort, you could even distribute your level files on the internet and have others import them into their folder to play.</p>\n<p>Also, I am aware that this itch.io page is particularly lack-luster, it's 11:01 pm right now and I'm tired and don't feel like taking more screenshots.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T07:28:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4a/d4acc54f51dddfecf2654480c7a48823.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Harre"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
