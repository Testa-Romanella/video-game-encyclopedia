{"id": 358468, "slug": "bounding-boxes", "name": "Bounding Boxes", "name_original": "Bounding Boxes", "description": "<p><em>--- Android build below, WebGl isn't supported for mobile\u00a0---</em></p><p>Bounding Boxes is a proof of concept prototype showing that a complex game like Super Smash Brothers can work as a single touch mobile game. This was one of my earliest Unity projects I made so it is not a reflection of my current ability as a game developer. While it's intended for mobile, it is still mouse compatible for those interested in seeing how it plays, multiplayer just won't be possible.<br/><br/><strong>-Controls-</strong></p>\n<p>Swipe and tap to make the boxes move! The input area for player 1(Red) is\u00a0 the left side of the screen and Player 2(Blue) uses the right. Imagine there is a line in the middle of the screen dividing the area each player should be touching and should not cross over.</p>\n<p>Jump: Swipe in any direction. The angle you swipe and the distance will affect the horizontal and vertical speeds.</p>\n<p>Double jump:\u00a0Swipe again in the air. You can only perform one double jump after you leave the ground. To get another double jump, simply land again. Swiping downwards won't consume the double jump.</p>\n<p>Air Movement: When you no longer have another double jump, swipe left, right or down to change directions in the air.</p>\n<p>Punch: Tap the screen.</p>\n<p>Charge: Tap and hold. When the charge is complete the box will glow. When grounded you will take less damage and won't be launched.</p>\n<p>Charge Attack:\u00a0When fully charged, drag your finger in the direction you would like to attack and release.</p>\n<ul><li>Up: Performs a rising attack. Gain additional height and attack the opponent. Can only be done once after leaving the ground.</li><li>Side: Performs a tackle attack. Charge into the opponent for a powerful attack. You cannot be knocked back for a short time after starting the move but are left vulnerable after</li><li>Down: Performs a spin attack. Attack in all directions. It will stop the box's vertical momentum at the start of the move.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>-Rules-</strong></p>\n<p>Knock your opponent off of the screen 3 times to win. When you attack the opponent, they will receive more damage. The more damage they received, the further they will be launched by attacks.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T08:14:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72b/72b9c739d1a707298391326405673170.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Jamie Spruin"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
