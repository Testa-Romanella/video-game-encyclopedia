Now an atoll, some people travel around by ferry above sea level and others prefer looking for ancient artifacts from the 21st Century, underwater.</p>\n<p>As the wanderlust player, you set off for an adventure out of Rose Hill Cove. Depending on your choices you might take the ferry to New Chagos as planned, or get black out drunk with your best friend, or even find treasures !</p>\n<p>------</p>\n<p><strong>This game includes:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>11 core endings and 2 or 3 variations for 2 of them.</strong></li><li><strong>A cast of 5 characters to talk to.</strong></li><li><strong>Different paths exclusive to some choices.</strong></li><li><strong>A special surprise\u00a0(hint: it's accessible only in a very musical ending.)</strong></li></ul>\n<p>This is my first visual novel/narrative point and click. This was made in 4 days while I was making an informational game about the Global Game Jam 2020 in Mauritius. I'll make more in the future. The next one will obviously be a GGJ20 game. But after that I have plans for another Mauritius Atoll game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T02:08:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c8/1c8d486661283966c32197530dc2799a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Guimero"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
