New horror game! A little nervous to hear what you guys think ^^' Here's how to play: Press the right arrow to view the doll, press the left arrow to go to the recharge station (R to recharge). If you hear footsteps, view the doll quick! DO NOT recharge if the batteries are bloody. Keep pressing the left arrow until they're clean and then recharge. Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T09:16:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/506/5069cb71b1bb8e931dbcd447f5f99ce5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MoonlightShine"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
