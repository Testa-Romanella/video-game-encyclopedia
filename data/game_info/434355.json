All you need to do to survive is to keep your campfire alive, however, this might be easier said than done. This was our first Gamejam, and we loved the experience! Hope you enjoy our game.!\u00a0</p>\n<p>GamePlay:</p>\n<p>Keep the fire alive for 3 min to win the game!</p>\n<p>1) Chop trees and add logs to the fire to keep it alive!<br/>2) You will freeze to death if you get cold enough, stay near fires to warm back up.<br/>3) The wind will periodically change direction, rotate the wind cover to protect the fire and keep it alive longer.<br/>4) Grab a torch from the fire, to find trees that are further away. Grabbing\u00a0 a torch reduces the fuel amount in the fire, so use torches sparingly.<br/>5) Have Fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T08:46:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/693/69398c9fa4852352adee7c5001ccdbd9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["shuhmo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
