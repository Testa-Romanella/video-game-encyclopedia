While preparing his next YouTube video, \"Code-It-Yourself: Universe Simulator\", the simulacrum Javidx9 has triggered the inception protection mechanism and The Great Machine has been shutdown, but not before significant damage was done to multiple critical circuits. We need you to repair the damage and bring The\u00a0Great Machine back on line.</p>\n<p>The system watchdog, an opto-mechanical Turing machine named Jody, will direct you in your quest to bootstrap The Great Machine and bring the universe back online.</p>\n<p>Should you fail in your task then your entire department's funding will be pulled and given to Jenkins, that obnoxious moron on the second floor, and you and your colleagues will be assigned to other duties. So the stakes really\u00a0aren't that high. You may as well give it a shot though. You have until next Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Open source at GitHub<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T03:51:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a1/2a133751126de75c10a68b6bb8cf5d04.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GeneralLeeInept"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
