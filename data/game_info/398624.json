This is a disaster! There\u2019s been a garbage compactor accident in Stoke-on-trent, and they\u2019ve declared a no fly zone! How will I deliver presents now?! I can\u2019t do it on foot, there\u2019s no way I can lug my giant sack around all of the town!\u201d\r\n<strong>Elf</strong>: \u201cDon\u2019t worry Santa, we have just the thing! We invented the \u201cSanta's Holiday Automated Rubbish To Toy Transformer\u201d, AKA The SHARTTT for just this situation! The SHARTTT\u00a0 will suck up trash, and recombobulate the mesotrons at the subatomic level to turn that trash into presents!\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Santa</strong>: \u201cWow, you guys are great! But what about the kids? If I have any hope of being done on time, I\u2019ll need to start early. They\u2019ll still be out on the streets, they\u2019ll see me!\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Elf</strong>: \u201cSeeing you isn\u2019t the problem here, it\u2019s the touching. Have you seen these kids? So full of <em>germs\u2026</em> If they get close they\u2019ll infect you, and there\u2019s no way you\u2019ll finish if you get stuck with a *<em>shudders</em>*... cold\u2026 Or worse, MANFLU! You'll be stuck in bed for all of Christmas if you catch the dreaded Manflu.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Santa</strong>: \u201cI see, so what do I do?\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Elf</strong>: \u201cWell, we equipped the SHARTTT with a launcher, so you can fire presents at the kids from a safe distance. So you just need to make sure your aim is true, and no kids slip through the net.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Santa</strong>: \u201cExcellent. Do you have any snacks, or any... *a-hem*... pick me ups to help me out? I don\u2019t normally do this much physical work.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Elf</strong>: \u201cSanta! What kind of operation do you think we run up here!? Of course we have the usual assortment of \u201cpick-me-ups\u201d as you call them, but that\u2019s irrelevant. Instead, when SHARTTT picks up some really high quality garbage, it\u2019ll drop a \u201cpower up\u201d. It\u2019s a special little concoction of mine. Can have random effects on you, the kids, or even SHARTTT. That\u2019ll get you through the day.\u201d</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-16T02:37:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00a/00a5a44daa9ad41302f537db15403d3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["keyz182"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
