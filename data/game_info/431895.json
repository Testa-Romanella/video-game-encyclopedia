After eons of research and actions designed to understand the existence of many 'selves', scientists have found that the many individuals who share\u00a0the same physical form also share the same skills, dreams and\u00a0passions. A set of many versions of beings from this multiverse emerged\u00a0in order to protect you\u00a0 from the evil that was increasingly alive. Dialectics is natural in\u00a0this scenario and, if there is a good initiative, obviously, there will also be its antithesis.\u00a0A group of space pirates, led by an elite spaceship brought in from the\u00a0future, TIAMAT, were now in the sights of Another Dimension Heroes.\u00a0Just survive long enough until another companion arrives.
