Many thousands managed to escape sailing away to the Imperial Colony of Varannar: a savage island, dangerous and unexplored. Mistrust and blame made impossible to elect a new Emperor, and the four Exiled Kingdoms were proclaimed.<br />\nNowadays, the ragtag kingdoms still struggle to survive in a harsh land, often waging war on each other. Empire and the Horrors are, for many, just old legends and fairytales. You are a novice adventurer, rarely paying attention to such old stories; you&#39;re more concerned with your latest misadventures and lack of gold.<br />\nBut for once, luck seems to be on your side. You received a letter from New Garand, stating that you are the sole beneficiary of a big inheritance. You don\u2019t remember any relatives in the capital of the Kingdom of Varsilia, but certainly that won\u2019t stop you from an opportunity like this! The road to New Garand will reveal many surprises, and will teach you that fairytales and legends can become, in fact, very real.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T22:05:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ec/9ec8504eb8d73a5d451a9c3e4f57cfb8.jpeg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["4 Dimension Games"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["4 Dimension Games"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
