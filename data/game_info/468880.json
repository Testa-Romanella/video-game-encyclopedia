In this period, the\u00a0Soviet Union\u00a0launched missions with passenger slots for at least 57 dogs. The number of dogs in space is smaller, as some dogs flew more than once. Most survived; the few that died were lost mostly through technical failures, according to the parameters of the test.</p>\n<p>On 19 August 1960 Belka &amp; Strelka were launched to spend a day in space and get back to the Earth.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This game tells you an alternative look at that historical moment. What if they were sent not to the open space, but to the moon, as a secret operation of becoming the first nation to conquer the Moon.</p>\n<p>A catastrophe happens and a ship with dogs crashes on the surface of the moon. You play as Belka, and you have to somehow get in touch with the planet to save yourself and Strelka.</p>\n<p>Will you be able to get back home?...\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T21:35:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e5/3e500a39bd6844f650e68ddbf7b2cec8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Restless Boat"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
