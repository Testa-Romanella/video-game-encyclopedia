And from it, the survivors learned to harness the power source known as Zygnoka. In the next forty years, the megacity known as The Structure was erected inside the impact crater. Here, the people isolated themselves, accelerating their dependence on technology and created a society as a machine of its own.<br />\nIn The Structure, order and efficiency is maintained by severe top-down control.
