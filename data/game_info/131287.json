It is Inspired by the Die Hard 4 Helicopter meets car scene, and is made for #MovieGameJam (https://itch.io/jam/moviegamejam) It has been a great learning experience, and if there is enough interest I'll continue updating it after the voting period for the jam is complete. Possibly even make a more sound game. Although the concept feels more like a side mission for a game like Saints Row.<br/></p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>2/10/18: At this time the game is currently unfinished and very buggy. Your vehicle can fly indefinitely if you hit the angles right and it has no sound what so ever. I uploaded it in this state because I feel I will run out of time to finish it before the submission deadline, and my brain is telling me I need 3 days minimum away from this project. I have included the complete project file for those interested in the ins and outs, the one simply named \"Surface to Air.zip\"<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e5/7e5a1f63e02329681cbe9302a5312b61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["WiseGaurdian"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
