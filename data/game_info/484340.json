We followed the idea of \"Don't panic\" by putting the player in a situation where you would panic, so to collect all the bombs in time you have to keep an eye out for them (some are hiding well, some aren't) and not just rush through every mini game. We hope you like it!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>Left Click - Select Object</p>\n<p>Right Click - Deselect Object</p><p>P - Pause</p><p>Esc - Quit</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T07:27:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/716/71693300fa6602b91a9ee2bee8747b63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Julien_C", "JessicaT219"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
