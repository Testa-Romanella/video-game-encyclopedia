{"id": 980620, "slug": "the-croaker-2", "name": "The Croaker", "name_original": "The Croaker", "description": "This game is a 2D platformer with tons of features: a level editor, online levels, online leaderboards, and a XP/leveling system! When you use the Level Editor, you can create and play levels and upload them directly to the servers for other people to play, rate, and comment on. Race to collect the most amount of apples on the Leaderboards... or maybe you don't like apples; You can also race to have the most amount of XP! Kill wildlife, such as Chickens and Rhinos by groundpounding them for XP! The game comes with 18 pre-made levels by the developer, with a new one coming in each update! Want even more? You can buy the Ice DLC for only a dollar! This DLC will give you 500 apples, and 5 new playable levels, all of which entirely revolve around a ice  theme, with ice, icicles, and snow! Once you beat the Ice DLC, you unlock a skin- but that's not all, you can also use ice yourself in the level editor, as well as play levels that contain ice. Although it may seem like it, this is still not pay-to-win! You can collect an infinite amount of apples in this game, it's just that purchasing the Ice DLC gives you a boost. I hope you have fun collecting apples, XP, and creating and playing levels!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"it's a game alright\" -Milkman Timby, Composer<br/>\r\n\"made me dissolve into hydrogen atoms\" -funkedt0ast, Artist<br/>\r\n\"frog\"- Botscoutt, Playtester", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-22T08:22:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f0/9f0a410812aa9c8aa5bc57d757b4c890.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jason Took the Aliens"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Jason Took the Aliens"], "esrb_rating": null}
