Make good use of the weapons and shields you find along the way and hit those targets! Remember that gravity and physics are just a barrier that mean almost nothing to a living wooden toy trying to escape!<br/>\r\nPlay alone to reach the end or ask a friend to join you and help. Also enjoy the Versus game mode where you can fight against up to 3 friends locally in a small arena to see who's the best puppet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMore information :<br/>\r\n- It is recommended to play with a controller but playing with the keyboard and mouse is also possible.<br/>\r\n- All multiplayer game modes (coop or versus) will require one controller per additional player as you will be playing on the same screen.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-01T07:30:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/347/347fa42f1901eeb077d9a7cc8b85eebc.jpg", "website": "https://wood-guy.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Yso Corp"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Yso Corp"], "esrb_rating": null}
