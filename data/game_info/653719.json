Creatures that crawl out of the Shadow World into our world to feast on humans. We are an inexhaustible food source for them.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>When Argo\u2019s sister gets kidnapped by a monster after an ill-considered adventure into the forest, he embarks on a quest to save her.</p>\n<p>But he\u2019s still a child and as such his powers are limited. Until he meets Almin'nan, a shadow creature that offers Argo its powers if he allows him to possess Argo, transforming Argo into a half shadow. Can Argo trust Almin'nan? And what horrors will Argo encounter on his way?\r\n</p>\n<p>What makes Argo\u2019s roguelite inspired gameplay especially interesting is the mix of jump &amp; run and RPG elements, mixed with an input command-based battle system. Other elements such as crafting and randomized maps are a focus as well.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you'd like to be kept up to date on the game's progress, then feel free to check out our Twitter! @RocRacGames</p>\n<p>---------------------------</p>\r\nOur public alpha demo is out!\r\n<p>If you'd like to help us make Argo the best it can be then make sure to check out our alpha!
