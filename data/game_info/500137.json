Together, they form a certain tension and harmony, a descriptive paradox in times of pandemic, where we see how interconnected the international community is, but we are also closed off and isolated. Using diverse media made possible by the digital space, these interactive and static pieces connect back to the spirit of Isle of Games, looking at games as art and art as a game.</p>\n<p>_</p>\n<p>Isle of Games<em> is an art game collective founded in 2017. The collective consists of a diverse group of people all with the common goal of making and exhibiting video games and their extended family in Iceland in collaboration with local poets, novelists, musicians, and artists of all kinds.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T05:41:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95e/95eb66e4e7820ac5df51fe443600846a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Isle of Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
