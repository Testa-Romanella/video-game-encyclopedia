Which is a node located at the very end, but to reach that, it will take some patience and know-how. <br/>\r\nThe game is controlled only with your mouse, so sit back and relax.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs you start playing the game, you will start off with a couple of nodes. Use these to gather enough resources to unlock and purchase new ones, which will be needed to progress further in the game. You can also use resources to upgrade the nodes you already own. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nBe careful when planning out your factory, connecting everything together might seem trivial, but it becomes quite the challenge the further you progress.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWill you end up with a beautiful factory creating everything like a well oiled machine, or a mess of epic proportions?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T06:14:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61d/61d160f8a757107787168be503147320.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 7, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Dreemore", "Damaged Axons"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dreemore", "Damaged Axons"], "esrb_rating": null}
