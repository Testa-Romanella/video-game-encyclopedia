{"id": 480262, "slug": "little-pink-submarine-beta", "name": "Little Pink Submarine (Beta)", "name_original": "Little Pink Submarine (Beta)", "description": "\n\n<p><strong>Little Pink Submarine</strong> is a game about diving underwater and collecting treasure before your oxygen runs out. Make sure to avoid mines, spikes, and sharks, as hitting them\u00a0depletes your oxygen supply.\u00a0If you dive and resurface successfully, you can purchase upgrades from the shop that will aid you in future levels.<br/><br/>This game is a fleshed out version of a game jam entry I made for Mini Jam 33: Underwater. The original game can be found<strong> here.</strong>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>: Little Pink Submarine\u00a0is still in early development and there are bound to be some bugs. I'll try my best to update the game as soon as possible when new feedback comes in.<br/></p>\n\n<br/>\n\n\r\nHere's a list of things I hope to add before Little Pink Submarine gets a full release:\r\n<ul><li><strong>Controller support</strong></li><li><strong>Mobile support (<em>Android/IOS</em>)</strong></li><li><strong>New enemies</strong></li><li><strong>Deep dive mode with a global high\u00a0score board.\u00a0</strong></li><li><strong>1 vs 1 split screen multiplayer\u00a0</strong></li><li><strong>Updated UI\u00a0</strong></li></ul>\n\n\r\nIf you're interested in following the development of this game, I post regular updates on my Instagram and Twitter.
