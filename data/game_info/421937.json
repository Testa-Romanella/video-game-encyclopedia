The concept was for the player to fight off soldiers inside a mirrored maze to give a sense of confusion but the cpu overhead/usage was too much to handle. The mirrored maze is still in the game files I just disabled it because it might be too much for regular laptops, if you guys want me to add it for the next update please let me know.\u00a0This is still work in progress so mind the early look. Just think of it as a sandbox for now. For controls and gameplay please talk to the npc/Asian Guy in the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you for your kindness and patience.</p>\n\n<p>-The Dev</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T02:54:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e37/e3713d1087770467dfb129e0faf65b0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Import Hill"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
