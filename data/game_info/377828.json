You save them, but they pull a gun and steal your car. <br/><br/>You walk to a diner. It feels safe. As night falls, noises in the darkness outside scare the hell out of you anyway. The door crashes open and something unseen slides in and you\u2019re cornered. Now there\u2019s a woman with a baseball bat beating the things over the head. Guess you can trust her. For now.<h3>Grand Theft Cthulhu</h3><br/>Dead Static Drive is a horror survival adventure.  You're on the road.  The world begins to fall apart in front of you.  Your friendships will make every bit of difference as order collapses and the people you meet fight for their own survival.  Sneak, scavenge, fight, befriend, barricade and bunker-in or steal a car and drive off into the sunset.  There's no escape; there's only what you choose to do with the little time that's left.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-30T02:23:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/def/def87bfe3ce46b4c8e3c38087d7cd195.jpg", "website": "https://deadstaticdrive.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 2, "toplay": 17}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 253, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fanclub"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fanclub"], "esrb_rating": null}
