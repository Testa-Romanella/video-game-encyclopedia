His most famous works are the Skyspaces. A Skyspace is (most of the times) a room with a hole in the ceiling that allows to see the sky above, with nothing in between. At specific times during the day \u2014 at sunrise and sunset \u2014 a hidden strip of LED lights color the room, rotating trough the whole color spectrum. And if during the day the hole in the ceiling simply frames the sky, during the light show, filtered through a cloud of colored light, the view of the sky is altered. The sky can become pink, green, deep blue. It\u2019s a beautiful spectacle.</p>\n<p>In this game, you sit for one hour in a Skyspace, specifically you are in <em>The Color Inside</em>, a Skyspace built in 2013 at the The University of Texas at Austin. You play in a chill evening, looking up at the sky and enjoying the sunset light show.<br/></p>\n<p>This game is an invitation. An invitation to discover James Turrell\u2019s works around the world, of course, but also an invitation to slow down and sit with something different. For an hour or just for five minutes. I don\u2019t expect anyone to play the game end to end without doing anything else. But run it in a window and keep it there, like a hole in the ceiling that shows the sky above in a very chill evening.<br/><br/>(Since you got all the way down here: here's a secret for you.
