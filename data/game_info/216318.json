A new level of complexity and passion! It needs good reaction! It requires a lot of thinking! We simply can say: FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT AFRAID OF SUPAPLEX HARD!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is you, the player, named Murphy. You will have to collect a set number of Infotrons (see below) in each level (can be zero) before you can leave through the Exit (see below). Watch out for the many hazards around, and make use of all the helpful objects you can find, it's the only way to survive in the \"cruel\" world of Supaplex.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBASE (a green circuit board). <br/>\r\nThis is the most common one around. It's main function is keeping things (Zonks, Murphy (only when there's gravity), Orange Disks) from falling down. Murphy can freely walk through this, doing so, he \"eats\" it away, leaving a void behind (where all those nasty sniksnaks and electrons can move through). apart from Murphy nothing can pass through this.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nZONK (a round rock).<br/>\r\nThis is another very common obstacle (and usually a very unpleasant one) a Zonk tends to fall down whenever possible (i.e. there is a void underneath). Be careful, when a Zonk falls on you (Murphy) you will explode (read: die). Murphy can push Zonks to the side (not up and down) if nothing is blocking the Zonk (i.e. there is a void on the other side). Murphy can only push one Zonk at a time, so watch out when dropping Zonks next to each other! With some good timing, you can also drop Zonks on Electrons (see below) or Snik-snaks (see below) which will explode (and not bother you again). Zonks have the nasty habit of falling SIDEWAYS off Ram-Chips (see below) and other Zonks if possible (i.e. there is a void to the side), on all other objects the Zonks will lie steady.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nINFOTRON (three colored ovals which are connected at the center of the picture and extend to the edges).<br/>\r\nThese are very important in almost every level. You need to collect a set number of these before you can leave the level via the Exit (see below). Look on the menu button of the game to see how many you need to collect. To pick one up, simply walk over it, or (when standing next to it, in any direction) press (and hold) spacebar, and then press the arrow key corresponding with the direction the Infotron is in.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSNIK-SNAK (a pair of scissors).<br/>\r\nThese are your enemies. If you touch them you will die. So you better avoid them, at all cost! The only thing that kills them is an explosion which is close enough, or a Zonk falling on top of it. Usually dropping a Zonk on a Snik-snak requires good timing. All explosions create a nine-field explosion cloud around the source of the explosion, and if a Snik-snak is present in this cloud, it will blow up too (creating another nine-field explosion). Snik-snaks can not move though Ports (see below).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEXIT (an orange square with a big letter E on it.<br/>\r\nThis is the final objective of each level. When you have collected enough Infotrons (see above), you need to press against the Exit to leave the level. Be careful that you don\u2019t have any explosions near the Exit, because it can explode, and that will leave you forever inside the level, without a way out (read: without a way to finish the level).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBUG (A BASE with a blue spark on it).<br/>\r\nThis is a dangerous version of the normal Base squares. If you try to remove it while the bug is active (i.e. there is a blue spark on it) you will be toasted (read: die). To remove these, walk over them (or remove them with the \u201cEat away\u201d, see above) while the bug is not active (i.e. when it looks like a normal Base). And there's the big problem. Whenever the bug is not active, you won't be able to distinguish it from a normal Base, and it just might activate while you are removing it. Be careful!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nELECTRON (Four blue sparks on a black background).<br/>\r\nThese behave exactly like Snik-snaks (see above) until they explode. If they do, in stead of just blowing up and leaving nothing behind, they fall apart into Infotrons (see above). Except for Hardware (see below) squares, all nine squares in the explosion will yield an Infotron. This is handy for those levels which just don't seem to have enough Infotrons for you to pick up. The fact that Hardware squares don't blow up and change to Infotrons, can make it tricky if you need all nine Infotrons to be able to collect all the Infotrons needed to finish the level. Electrons can not move though Ports (see below).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDISKS (Three disks, with a colored label: Orange Red and Yellow).<br/>\r\nThere are three disks, which may look similar, but behave entirely different from each other.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nORANGE DISKS will fall down whenever they can (though not fall off the edges of other objects, like Zonks) and when they hit the ground (or any object in their path) they will explode in a nine-field explosion, killing everyting within, except Hardware (see below). This allows you to create passages in walls made of Ram-Chips (see below), blow up Zonks (which may be blocking your way) or annoying Snik-snaks that are bothering you, etc. Be careful with these, because once they fall, they won't stop<br/>\r\nuntil they explode.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRED DISKS can be picked up, the same way you remove a Base square (walking over it, or using the tap on the screen (see below)). Once you have one or more of these on you, you can drop them somewhere, where they will explode. Press, and hold the Spacebar, until a disk is dropped. Once you have dropped a Red Disk, make sure you get away in time, because you have very little time before it explodes. Red Disks will not fall down (before you picked them up and after you dropped them), even when there's gravity (see below)<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYELLOW DISKS will explode once you hit a Terminal (see below). Before they explode, you can push them around all you want, usually to a specific destination (to blow up a Ram-Chip wall mostly). They will not fall down, even with gravity (see below).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTERMINAL (A computer screen).<br/>\r\nThese will allow the player to blow up Yellow Disks. Press Murphy against a Terminal to activate (read: blow up ALL Yellow Disks). Make sure ALL Yellow Disks are in place before using a Terminal, or you will regret it. There is only need for one Terminal per level, but more Terminals are allowed (for ease, or just decoration).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPORTS (Red and blue tubes, with gray edges).<br/>\r\nThese Ports are an important aspect of the Supaplex world. Murphy can pass through them, but other creatures (Snik-snaks and Electrons) can not. The Ports with one gray side wider than the other are one-way Ports. Murphy can pass though them, but only in the direction of the widest to the less wide gray edge. Ports with equal gray sides are two-way Ports. Murphy can pass through both sides. The four-way Port is not really a four-way Port, but rather a combination of two two-way Ports (i.e. Murphy can only pass straight through, and can not make a turn inside).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAn important feature of the blue ports is that they can switch on and off the gravity (see below, mostly used in the higher (read: harder) levels). This ability is only available for the one-way Ports, and is predetermined.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRAM CHIPS (Chips, like there are so many inside your computer).<br/>\r\nRam-Chips are mostly used for walls in the game. They can be blown up, to create a passage to another part of the level. Zonks will roll of the edges (if the squares to the side and the one beneath that one are empty).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDOT WALL<br/>\r\nIt is an immovable object. You cannot pass through it.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHARDWARE (Hardware, all the other pictures you see in the game. There are 10 different Hardware blocks).<br/>\r\nHardware blocks are the most boring part of the game. They don't move, they can't blow up, they just sit there, usually bothering you, or just for decoration (that's why there are so many<br/>\r\ndifferent ones).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe have also added new features to this incredible adventure!
