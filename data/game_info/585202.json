The aim of the game is to decide who can enter the club and who cannot. The decision is made with the help of two buttons. The green one is allowed, the red one is not. To understand who can pass and who cannot, there is a list of prohibited items. The list is at the bottom of the screen. If a visitor has this item, he is forbidden to enter the club.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T07:58:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/893/893bb054fa854fa91ef7543eefe147aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SnowBat"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
