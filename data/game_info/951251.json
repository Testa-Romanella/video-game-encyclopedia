Listen and converse with the dead and help find what regrets they were left with and how to overcome them through narrative choices.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:\u00a0</strong>The release for Nanoreno 2023 did not quite get as far as the team wanted, however we've left the story off at a satisfying cliffhanger and hope to update with the full extent of the demo for next week. If you like what you experience here, we hope you'll check out future updates.</p><p><strong>Known Issues:\u00a0</strong>We are aware that the menu is hard to read on the message boxes at the moment - that is something we will be fixing. (The MAC version is untested as I don't have a MAC to test it on.
