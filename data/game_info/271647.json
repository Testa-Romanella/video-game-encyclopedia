As usual, I did a puzzle game. Use arrows key to move Amulets - each of them must be on its colored base (red, green and blue). This game is really hard and each movement must be considered. Be careful - snakes hurt you! I guess that players have to do many efforts to finish the entirely game - sacrifices must be made :)<br/></p>\n<p>USE ARROWS KEYS TO MOVE EFFIGIES</p>\n<p>ESCAPE TO GO BACK - TO THE MENU</p>\n<p>R TO RESTART A LEVEL ++<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2b/d2bd652fc717d5b673fbab0c323a3620.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Geckoo1337"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
