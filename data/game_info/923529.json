Best to play on a large screen at solution of\u00a01920x1080.</p>\n<p>You will know how to play, I am sure! ;-)</p>\n<p>Some tips for best playing:</p>\n<ul><li>Do not use too much Bluetooth controllers (not more than four or five, better less). Better plug in some USB controllers to not get too much interference.</li><li>If you like playing via keyboard or you want to play with more than eight persons in parallel, use the keyboard (additional or instead). Up to four players can use it via:<ul><li>W-A-S-D</li><li>I-J-K-L</li><li>Cursor keys</li><li>Number pad (2-4-6-8)</li></ul></li><li>Do not play using a too small screen like a notebook itself. Better use a large screen or a beamer to play. Much more fun!</li><li>Use a solution of 1920x1080. Maybe it will support other solutions in future.</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Hint</em></strong>: To pause a controller, just hold UP for three seconds. The controller will be unavailable for five seconds.</p>\n<p><em>Please give me hints to bugs or wishes for playing this game. Currently it is just the game itself, without option menu or anything else.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Heavy under development.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T08:04:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/caf/caffe7f01ce59c303045db9b193aaf19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Christian Packenius"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
