As a licensed <strong>Kill It With Fire</strong> exterminator, it\u2019s time to fight back!  Assemble your arsenal of increasingly excessive weapons, track spiders across suburbia, and burn everything in your path! IGNITION is a sampler chapter for the full game. Get an idea of what to expect when we launch in Summer 2020! <br/><br/><br/><br/>To defeat spiders you must exploit their one weakness: FIRE. Or bullets. Or explosions, throwing stars, gettin\u2019 smushed by stuff...pretty much anything, really.  But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll be easy - first you\u2019ve gotta find the spiders.  Use state-of-the-art arachnid tracking technology to pinpoint your quarry\u2019s location among hundreds of potential hiding spots - then, <strong>torch everything</strong> and smash the spider with a frying pan after it runs out.  It\u2019s the only way to be sure.<h3>Features</h3><ul><li>Dozens of weapons.<br/></li><li>Creepy crawlies.<br/></li><li>\u201cRealistic\u201d fire simulation system.<br/></li><li>Gratuitous chaos and destruction.<br/></li><li>Finally learn the truth about spiders.<br/></li><li>The IGNITION demo features about half hour of gameplay!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-25T06:05:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be8/be804df87e7a9d6e05365df266d8a8d6.jpg", "website": "http://www.killitwithfiregame.com", "rating": 3.17, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 8, "owned": 259, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 5}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 12, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 12, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Casey Donnellan Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["tinyBuild"], "esrb_rating": null}
