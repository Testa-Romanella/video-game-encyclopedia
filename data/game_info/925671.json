When savage rabbits burrow through for invasion, Amanita takes any measures necessary to protect his roots. A 2D shoot-em-up survival game, play as the fungus Amanita in his mission to protect the roots that sustain his home, delivering nutrients from the underground to help it grow all while killing enemy rabbits. To win, you'll need to fill up the plant's growth bar, while ensuring it doesn't die from the rabbit's appetite. When delivering nutrients, you will be slowed down and unable to fire your plant pistol, so think strategically.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T08:11:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07e/07e4e4b834e696f252d58fe1c4be8d97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["grizzledwarveteran23"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
