All of the art and audio was completed within 48 hours. The programming took a little bit longer though. Enjoy!</em></p>\r\nThere is a little god for just about anything you can think of. \r\n<p>Things are just better when these gods are around. For example, a\u00a0tree god might keep the tree healthy while a mailbox god could increase the chances of good news.</p>\n<p>But sometimes a god will abandon their dwelling..</p>\n<p>That's where <strong>you</strong> come in. You are an employee of the <strong>Little God Task Force</strong> (LGTF) and it is your job to entice these little gods into returning.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To do this, you'll be placing tiny items around their dwelling. Depending on the type of god, the god will either <strong>love</strong>, <strong>hate</strong>, or be <strong>indifferent</strong> to each item that you place.</p>\n<p><strong>You can only place a limited number of items</strong>. If you've placed the maximum amount and nothing has happened you'll need to swap out some items to get a combination that results in a reaction from the god.</p>\n<br/>Please all 3 of the gods to win the game!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed3/ed3d50f5575727e797dfe23b7732446c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Kevin Whitmore"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
