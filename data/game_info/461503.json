The game utilises a multiplier score system that means the more kills you get in a short amount of time, the bigger you score increase promoting players to stay in combat and be more reckless. Note the game utilises a controller instead of keyboard and mouse for the controls.</p>\n<p>This was a collaborative project from Team 8 in 2019</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T05:39:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa7/fa7560e9dfbeb243b58e6261a38c698a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ADHowww"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
