Luckily for you, they stick to marked paths, and you\u2019ve left plenty of space for your cannons! So, prepare to play your way through 16 scenic beach, jungle, dock, and village levels, and evict those scurvy curs from your island for good!<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>In classic tower defense style, the aim of the game is to place cannons in strategic locations to wipe out multiple waves of enemy grunts before they reach your treasure.<br/>Tap an empty grid square to build a cannon using your precious gold coins. Killing certain enemies will reward you with gold coins which you can spend on cannons, upgrades, and repairs. Tap on a cannon at any time to sell, upgrade, or repair it, or to change its target priority. Unlock new cannons as you progress, and upgrade them for enhanced firepower and special effects!<br/><br/>Fallen pirates will occasionally drop gems which you can tap to collect. Gems can be spent on helpful items, like a powder keg that blows grunts to smithereens, a voodoo drum that turns grunts into lumbering zombies, or a smoke bomb that hides your cannons from enemy view! Simply tap a path tile to deploy an item at any point during a level. You can also tap the fast-forward button at any time to speed up the action.<br/><br/>For more information, please refer to the How to Play screens within the app.<br/><br/>FEATURES<br/>* A swashbuckling strategy game of wits and cunning!<br/>* Instantly accessible pick-up-and-play gameplay!<br/>* Intuitive touch-screen controls!<br/>* Six dastardly cunning pirate enemies!<br/>* Four trusty cannons to build and upgrade!<br/>* A bevy of powerful items to obliterate the enemy!<br/>* Beautifully realized scenic 3D environments!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:19:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd6/fd6d3d76aa5a860309e6a831b5cb28e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["PENDYLUM"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["PENDYLUM"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
