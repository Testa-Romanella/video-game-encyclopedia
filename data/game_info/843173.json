Explore the ocean and collect samples for analysis.<br/><br/>WASD for movement, SPACE for extra speed. 1/2/3 buttons to enable/disable utilities for collecting samples.</p>\n<p>It's definitely not finished, there was a lot we wanted to implement but we simply ran out of time. It might be an active project we continue with in future after the jam, in any case it was fun and I'm looking forward to checking out some of the other games in the jam too.<br/><br/>Credits:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>James Haworth - Development / GFX / Sound</li><li>Ben - Development: fish movement, randomised bubbles</li><li>Sounds from http://pixabay.com</li><li>Additional sound effects from https://www.zapsplat.com</li><li>Music from https://www.zapsplat.com</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T10:15:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/249/249c48fc24775472612fb0c9fa856897.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["zerog3n"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
