The PC side of the Eight Classics!<br/><br/><strong> Travelers and Creators</strong><br/>You can be a traveler or creator of many game worlds.<br/>A script file corresponds to a world, which can be published in plaintext or encrypted (to keep your game world more mysterious).<br/>Each world exists independently and can also depend on each other, if you don't understand well, for example: 1. For example, the worlds of each hero in the slow universe are both independent and related; 2. Another example is the alien iron and blood war biochemical tyrant, alien is a world, iron blood is a world, biochemical tyrant is a world, they exist alone and can encounter monsters or NPCs with exactly the same attributes in another world in another world; 3. If you still don't understand it, you can enter the built-in template world experience (make money in the 'Heavens Exchange' world, spend money in the 'Apocalyptic Survival' world, but these two worlds are independent of each other, you can abandon each other or even delete another world, play alone)<br/>New creators, welcome to use the built-in script templates (plaintext, unencrypted) to practice, modify and even magic, and try to create your own wordplay world.<br/><br/><strong>Help &amp; Support</strong><br/>The author can be contacted @\u6587\u5200\u5c71\u5b97 for assistance", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-20T04:12:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/583/5835dff8ba33e88104e70de597c931c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u6587\u5200\u5c71\u5b97"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u6587\u5200\u5c71\u5b97"], "esrb_rating": null}
