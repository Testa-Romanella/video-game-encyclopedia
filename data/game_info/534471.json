Form a pair of two same objects to gain points. Or combine a top-half with a bottom-half of a present-box to gain a bunch of points at once. The more objects are between the box-halfs the more points you get.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game is still in early development. Currently, there is only an endless-mode with simple paint-graphics. Updates will follow shortly!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T03:47:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b2/7b2bd5e1ad96aa511fcc96a397ed26e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VanFelsen"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
