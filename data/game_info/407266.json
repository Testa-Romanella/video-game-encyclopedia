Each spacelets and ennemy are\u00a0randomly round\u00a0generated meaning you will not get the same combination twice per round.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pass by Mittens Galatic Emporium to acquire spaceship upgrades, round upgrades or new spacelets. If you don't have enough currency, consider visiting the challenge mode and test your abilities. Be wary, each unlocked spacelets are a bit wackier and\u00a0offer a positive and a negative impact during your adventure mode increasing or decreasing the difficulty.</p>\n<p>You can toggle on and off unlocks in order to pick your favorite combination to help you beat PhaseV and also reach a higher score.</p>\n<p>Available now free NYOP.</p>\n<p>This game was created by myself Joey Russo with the usage of Gamemaker Studio.</p>\n<p>Enjoy and if you like, please leave a comment and tell your friends.
