The structure is relatively simple with one main environment containing five smaller consecutive levels for the player to traverse. Each level contains a goal point that will spawn the player at the beginning of the next level. At the end of the fifth level will be the final goal point in which the player must reach in order to complete and win the game. The level is reset when the player falls from the platforms into the depths of the dungeon. Directional controller movement is done with the WASD / directional arrow keys and jumping with the space bar.</p>\n<p>\u00a0The physical layout of the environment consists of a centrally-located duct with the five levels being connected to and interwoven with it. In order to establish a cohesive thematic connection, the environment consists of crumbling stone and rotting wooden platforms for the player to navigate along, falling rocks for the player to utilize in reaching certain locations, and water to help the player reach certain heights of platforms.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/861/8613dfd4b095e063e412db2a4fc58dd4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["maxwellmatt"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
