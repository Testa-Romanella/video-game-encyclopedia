The goal of the project is for the students to practice working together on a cohesive project, with a focus primarily on the artistic side of the project. (Including\u00a0 gameplay is allowed however.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Project Sandstorm</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The project takes place on a tidally locked planet: One side always in the light and hot and one side always in the dark and cold, with a temperate belt right in the middle. The environment in this project is on the hot side, where people hide in canyons from the sand and sun, projected by giant structures called \"Jellyfish\" who circulate air, provide space for plants to grow and shield the city from sandstorms. But this city's Jellyfish stopped working and the citizens abandoned the city: A lone engineer returns to try to restore the Jellyfish.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Maja Sayk S\u00f8rensen</p>\n<p>Colin Michel </p>\n<p>Jonas Melgaard Jensen</p>\n<p>Xinru Liu Fog</p>\n<p>Samuel Mathiesen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T22:07:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c84/c84f1f8fe1792070c427ce5f185ba8f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hallwinther"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
