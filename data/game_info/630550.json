That means you choose a cell (on _pen'n'paper_ version, they are labeled A1-J10, on Gameboy I didn't find this thing necessary) and the software (the opponent) tells you whether you missed, hit a plane part or its cockpit (in this situation, the whole plane is destroyed). Everything is illustrated below:\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Note:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0\"X\" = missed\r\n</li><li>\"O\" = hit\r\n</li><li>destroyed plane appears dotted\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>It's a\u00a0<strong>2 players - 1 console</strong>\u00a0game, so you have to pass the Gameboy to your opponent each turn.\r\n</p>\n<ol><li>\u00a0Title screen appears. The first player presses `A` and the board will be loaded. Planes need to be moved (`D-pad`) or rotated (`Select`) such that no two planes overlap in the end. Press `A`,`B` to commute between airplanes.\r\n</li><li>When ready, press `Start`. Be careful, once you pressed it, you can no longer edit your board configuration, unless you hard reset the game.\r\n</li><li>A message will appear telling you to pass the Gameboy to the next player. Player 2 presses start and sets his/her board, then presses `Start` and passes Gameboy to Player 1.\r\n</li><li>Player 1 presses `Start` and opponent's board will be shown. Player 1 chooses a cell to attack, then presses `A`. Player 1 passes the Gameboy to Player 2, who does the same thing.\r\n</li><li>\u00a0Both player repeat the process until one player destroys all the 3 planes of the opponent.\r\n</li></ol>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><em>(screenshot from Android emulator)</em>\n</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>GBDev\u00a0community for their kindness and willingness to help uninitiated people like me in terms of GBz80 (or whatever want to call it)\r\n</li><li>alexhulk2002\u00a0for his idea of one-Gameboy gameplay.
