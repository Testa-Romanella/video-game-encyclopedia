Many of them involve smashing.  This is unfortunate, but you must get home.<br/><br/>You should know that Smasher can be quite difficult at times.  Escaping can involve fast-paced action situations.  Perhaps a description of the controls will help to determine if you like this sort of challenge.Controls<br/>The left stick moves you around.<br/>(You can also use the D-Pad or WASD on the rebindable keyboard.)<br/><br/>The right stick is the smash stick.  Be careful.<br/>(Also ABXY buttons or IJKL on the keyboard.)Game<br/>With these sole powers, you must manipulate your environment, and escape the labyrinth of levels.   If you succeed, the external reward is a simple home screen, as befits a square.  Of course, the real reward is always the journey, which has perhaps made you more than a square.Editor<br/>Or you can make your own Smasher games, full of your own Smasher levels.  The built-in editor has full controller support.Features<br/>Smasher features a custom-built engine for its own crafted feel.  It includes a soundtrack appropriate for smashing, performed by its own homemade synthesizer.<br/><br/>Thank you for smashing.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:50:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc1/cc18ca98c3d5bccacc2409b3e1b4470c.jpg", "website": "http://beautrongames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Beau Brueggemann"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Beautron"], "esrb_rating": null}
