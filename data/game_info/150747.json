Just discovered PICO-8 today in about 10 hours while deciding to join the GDL May 2018 jam (https://itch.io/jam/gdl-may-jam). I grew up playing a lot of Double-Dragon esque beat-em-ups, but since this was my first project i wasn't confident to make a traditional side-scrolling beat-em-up game quite yet. I was also inspired by how \"good\" it feels to charge and release Doomfist's punch in Overwatch, so I lifted that mechanic over here.</p>\n<p>It was super fun to make everything from scratch, from art to music (music is soo hard, even though I can hum something it's so hard to transcribe to the Pico music system for me).\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2b/a2b7a541ad56684b2433a604b143283e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tarngerine"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
