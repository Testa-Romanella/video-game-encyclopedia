We've developed this idea for 3 years, but due to lack of skill, we could never make it become reality. But now, with enough experience, and support from our newest programmer Tumeo, we could finally make this project bloom.</p><p>\u3000\u3000Fighting against the visual simplicity of similar games in the indie scene, <em>Stargazer</em> features lush visuals and art, all drawn by Gors and put into life by Tumeo and Vinicius. To top it off, the game's piano soundtrack and ambiance wrap the game nicely, in a pack of instant relaxation. It's a nighttime experience, but at any time, in your device.</p><p>\u3000\u3000I have been posting the development progress of this game on my Twitter @spritergors and on Tumeo's Twitter @williamd1k0. Some extra footage of the game and insights are there (Twitter Moments with the game jam progress). </p><em>Credits</em><p><strong>Game Design, Director, <strong>Graphic Design</strong>, Composer: </strong>Gors</p><p><strong>Additional Design, Programmer</strong><strong>, System and Effects Development</strong><strong>: </strong>Tumeo</p><p><strong>Sound Designer, Arranger, Additional Composer, Effects Animator: </strong>Vinicius</p><p><strong>Text Font: </strong>TypeSETit</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/324/324bd118f886892bfe92a59262261406.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Novastrike Media"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
