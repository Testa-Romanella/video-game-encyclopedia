You have to get out, by breaking the magic crystal. Will you take the correct path towards freedom?</p>\n<p>This game was made for the Wowie jam 3. The theme was \"Faliure is progress\". How does this game fit the theme? In the game you'll have to make a choice to pick a path, which you think will lead to frredom. If you\u00a0<strong>fail</strong> to pick the correct path, you're still making\u00a0<strong>progress</strong>, because now you know where to go.</p><p>Here's my twitter where I post about games:\u00a0https://twitter.com/TheoTheTorch\u00a0and here's my reddit account where I do mostly the same:\u00a0https://www.reddit.com/user/TheoTheTorch</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>+ Whiteshampoo - Awsome jump and dash pyhsics.</p>\n<p>+ Jonas Tyroller - Ambient music.
