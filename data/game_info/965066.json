In this 3D comic style RTS, the goal is to destroy the enemy's base, just like in a classic RTS. For this you have a small arsenal of tanks, which must be produced in the appropriate buildings. Pear and also Mr. Blue have different toy tanks with their own attributes. Each tank is in its own way a part of the respective element.<br/><br/>In the case of Birnchen, it is fruit, and the base is a fruit basket. Therefore, the tanks shoot with bananas, coconuts, pears and melons. Grape serves as a barricade and the defense tower shoots with pumpkins.<br/><br/>Mr. Blue is more of the apocalyptic tech geek. His base is a cloud, his tanks works with lightning, thunder, earthquakes and rain. The tides serve as a barricade and the defense tower creates a hailstorm.<br/><br/>Matching the respective faction also comes the resources needed for the productions. Birnchen uses her well-deserved diligence lollipops to build new buildings and tanks, while Yoshie uses his cooling refreshment as a water reservoir.<br/><br/><strong>Story</strong><br/>\"Minor Confrontations\" is the result of Mr. Blue being bored while Birnchen is once again only thinking about studying and her homework.<br/><br/>Birnchen sits at her desk and reads stubbornly in her book. To relieve his boredom, Mr. Blue thinks about what he can play until Birnchen has finally finished her homework. In his search for a suitable toy, Mr. Blue causes chaos as usual.<br/><br/>Since Birnchen is distracted from her homework by the noise, she has to counterattack.
