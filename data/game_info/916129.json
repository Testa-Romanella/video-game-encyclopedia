Another thing the legends lie about is that vampires can only turn one person every 500 years, on the day that the planets align (who knows why). You are such a vampire! And in other words, you have ONE DAY to find your soul mate that you'll spend the next 500 years with, or you shall be lonely for quite a while! In the modern day, this thing called \"speed dating\" is a thing, so maybe tonight's the night... or day, in this case.\r\n[GAMEPLAY]\r\n<p>Here are some tips on how to have a successful date night with Heart String!</p>\n<ul><li>Remember to be honest! Be yourself! If you have to lie to someone, chances are they aren't the right match for you.</li><li>If you know someone isn't a match, click the \"Pass\" button! Heart String doesn't put a limit on how many people you can date, just be yourself!</li><li>When you've found \"the one,\" click the \"Turn\" button! But remember, as a vampire, you can only turn one person every 500 years!</li><li>As a vampire, you have two superpowers: Hypnotism and Mind Reading!</li><li>Click the \"Hypnotize\" button to impress your vampire presence upon someone! This will increase their initial affection, but they might get mad at you if you do it too much!</li><li>Click the \"Read Mind\" button to learn someone's opinion about a particular trait! Remember, if they conflict with your own traits, they might not be a match!</li><li>Good luck ;)</li></ul>\r\n[CREDITS]\r\n<p>Nine Levitzki - <strong>Game Designer/Writer</strong></p>\n<p>Jamie Whitmarsh -\u00a0<strong>Composer</strong></p>\n<p>Paul Shelley -\u00a0<strong>Sound Designer</strong></p>\n<p>Dylan \"Celtican\" Cragle -\u00a0<strong>Programmer/Animator</strong></p>\n<p>Valencia Coleman -\u00a0<strong>Programmer</strong></p>\n<p>Chase Middleton -<strong>\u00a0Pixel Artist</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T14:06:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45d/45d8fbcea013c227e8c7572cbcdf2bf2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SplendidDog", "Celtican", "pauls134", "Valencia's Creative Endeavors", "Jamie Whitmarsh || Game Audio Wixard", "Nine0Wands"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
