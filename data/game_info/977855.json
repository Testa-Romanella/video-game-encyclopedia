Outrun the zombies and don't let them catch you. Your speed increases the further you run, but so do does the zombie's. Randomly generated obstacles will keep you on your toes.

Also, watch out for the pesky water blocks as they will slow you down.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are a few achievements so far, as well as stats.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI am a sole coder trying to get into game development, and this is my first attempt.
