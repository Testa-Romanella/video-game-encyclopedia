It's not very good at all, but this is my first game that I've ever completed. I've never worked with Unity before so I found myself spending most of my time figuring out how it worked.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My only real goal with this submission was to finally finish a programming / game project. (after so many abandoned projects)</p>\n<p>I incorporated the limitation by using the players health as both the construction material for towers, and the ammo for shooting. I added a 'resupply at home' feature to get around the player quickly running out of health.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this pretty crappy game, I had a blast making it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T14:23:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c69/c69753f902a1b383f761bf034f9f87ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AquaMang"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
