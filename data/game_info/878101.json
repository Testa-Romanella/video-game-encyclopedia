How do you not know about the Robodome!? Have you been <em>sleeping</em> for the last century or something?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well whatever, I like to talk so you're in luck! The Robodome is none other than the most popular sport around! It is a competition of professional Robo Battlers, athletes whose goal is to destroy robotic sentries and face off against each other in the arena. They must attain as many points as possible to be the victor of the season. Over their career they must come out on top of Dome competitions across the world to gain the title of a <strong>true champion</strong>!\r\n</p>\n<p>I am <strong>Martin Scrapmetal</strong>, the host of our wonderful Robodome in <em>Valhalla city</em>. I hope you enjoy this season of shredded metal and mayhem!</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>This game is currently in a demo state! The gameplay is stripped down to the core loop.\u00a0Eventually we'd like to build out more bosses, narrative and rogue-lite elements. Until then we hope you enjoy what we have so far. Feedback is welcomed and appreciated!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T05:59:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf2/cf20ae1e53f1975ba190aac1c2e5b070.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["theStoff", "HT_Kage", "Toonic"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
