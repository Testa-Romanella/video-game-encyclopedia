All you need to do is press the buttons on the cube in the right order.</p>\n<p>If anyone plays this game and comments on it, I will make it so high scores are saved and perhaps develop the project further.</p>\n<p>Thanks for taking a look at this game!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Grab cubes with your hand. You can rotate them by using your grabbing or by using the transform handles to rotate them along an axis.</p>\n<p>Push buttons with your hand (the game may have issues tracking so if it does get stuck bringing your hand out of tracking range and back in or using multiple fingers).</p>\n<p>Turn your hand towards you to open the menu up. I couldn't put labels on them so they are in the image below.</p>\n<p>Music was created by Jade Schwab and the sound effects by Rosie Mcclelland for another project we worked on,\u00a0Piplets! Check it out if you got time,\u00a0 it's a better game :)<br/></p><p>And I have gotten permission from both of them to use their work on this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T06:10:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/907/907dc5fb3907976661ac3ef1e035cde6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UrFriendXD"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
