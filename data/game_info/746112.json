This sure is game! I know it's kinda ugly and the fonts look like shit, but I was too lazy to fix it. Instead I spent a whole bunch of time writing a stupid song that you will hear (spoiler alert) when you die. Why did I make this? What is wrong with me? Anyway, I'd recommend checking out the first two games in the series if you like this one. Also check out the soundtrack on my SoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/dennismagnusson/sets/goblin-adventures-soundtrack<br/></p>\n\n<p>You advance the narration with the SPACE key on your keyboard. The main game is controlled with the mouse cursor. Don't be afraid if you're a touchpad boi like me, tho. I created the game and played through the entirety of it without a mouse.</p>\n\n<p>That's basically it. Yeah. Enjoy.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T05:19:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/391/391b2efd7db0e3bea945924980952dce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DennisMagnusson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
