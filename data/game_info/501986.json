What if I were a blob of goo with just one distinguishing feature? Who would want to adopt me? How could I\u00a0convince a loving family to take me in as one of their own?</p>\n<p><strong>So here's the deal</strong>: you've gotta impress your potential parents with quick tricks. They'll call something out, and you'll press the <strong>red</strong> character on your keyboard to perform it. You can't spend too long on any one stunt, or they'll begin to question your intelligence (and try not to hit a key that corresponds with another trick while you're at it). Manage twenty five without slipping up three times, and you're golden. Thanks for playing, and good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T07:09:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50c/50ca6b43d0df6567079222c3dff3876a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Carbon Dog"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
