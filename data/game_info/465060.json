The fire is out of control, but more importantly is the people you are guiding who are out of your control. You can only issue one command per turn, and some people won't listen to what you say after long enough.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Each level is a puzzle about how to properly give instructions to multitask each person. Can you solve every level?</p>\n\n\n<p>Also it turns out I accidentally forgot to disable the level editor, so you can still access it if you press the backspace key during gameplay. But it's basically unusable if you don't have the console, which I did disable. So if you click that and things get weird, just feel free to press backspace again to return to gameplay, or press esc to reload the level. Don't worry about accidentally overwriting any levels, the save system doesn't work like that. You'd only permanently save anything if you intentionally did it in the files.</p>\n<p>I also forgot to disable the FPS counter, but eh, no big deal.</p>\n\n<p>Oh! I also forgot to add the dialog line to tell you how to access the help tips.\u00a0On each level if you type \"HELP\" on your keyboard you will be give some advice on the level. They were supposed to mention this during level 3's dialog, but I\u00a0was too busy and forget to.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T07:25:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31d/31d48681f97df3ec935ae0d278a11618.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ninto55"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
