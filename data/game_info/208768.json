I\u00a0plan to develop this as a co-op game mode, 1 player will have to fly the aircraft and shoot from the wings, while the other will be able to switch between dropping bombs or using a turret at the back of the Spitfire. Smoother controls will be added, aesthetic and intractable upgrades from a shop and different types of enemies.</p>\n<p><strong>Links</strong></p>\n<p>Twitter\u00a0-\u00a0Website\u00a0-\u00a0Blog\u00a0-\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0-YouTube\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9b/c9bce11c1b9d70cf1a8ae8c5ee746434.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DevLiamW"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
