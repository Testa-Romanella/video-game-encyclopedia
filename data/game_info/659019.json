A game ends when the board is full or you run\u00a0out of mana gems.</p>\n<p><strong>Interaction</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Drag and drop a card from the drafting area into the game board to place a creature. After you've placed a creature the creature will gain or lose score based on its affinity types. Then the creatures ability is triggered. After that the drafting area is refreshed.</p>\n<p>The mana gem bar (purple gems in the middle) shows you the current mana gem value on the left. To place a creature on a tile with 4 types you need a mana gem with at least 4 points. If you place a creature on a tile with less then 4 types, the current mana gem is reduced to 1. Once a mana game is used up, the draft is refreshed.</p>\n<p>Use the<strong> Lock Button </strong>(left) to lock a card and keep it for the next refresh. You can only lock 1 card per refresh.</p>\n<p>Use the <strong>Refresh Button</strong> (right) to refresh the drafting area. Refreshing\u00a0reduces the current mana gem by 1 the first time you use it, after that it will destroy the current mana gem until you place another creature. Then it reset's to -1 again.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Click</strong> on a placed Creature tile to see it's card.</p>\n<p><strong>Tile Types</strong></p>\n<p>Each tile and creature is associated with a specific tile type. There are 6 types:</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd25\u00a0Fire - Destruction, Chaos\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca7Water - Duplication, Expansion\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf32\u00a0Wood - Growth, Creation\u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf1e\u00a0Desert - Isolation, Scarcity</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udea8\u00a0Stone - Endurance, Dislocation</p>\n<p>\u2744\ufe0f\u00a0Snow - Conservation, Limitation</p>\n<p>A creature has always 1 affinity towards a tile type\u00a0and 1 aversion against another. You can see which types\u00a0below the creature on each card.</p>\n<p><strong>Card Abilities</strong></p>\n<p>Abilities are always triggered when a creature is placed.\u00a0Some cards have a <strong>Draft keyword</strong>, which means that this cards ability is only triggering when the card is or stays in the drafting area.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Filling type Gems</strong></p>\n<p>You can fill the 6 outer type gems by creating creatures of their type. When filled each creature that was placed on a tile that belongs to the type gem will gain a bonus once. Each type gem has it's own bonus (1,2,3...)\u00a0and fill requirement (6,12,18...).</p>\n<p><strong>Score</strong></p>\n<p>The score is the average of your last 6 games. Each time you play the last score is removed and the average\u00a0\u00a0is calculated again.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>\u00a0This game is a rough prototype\u00a0and will contain major bugs and issue!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T10:48:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e3/6e30c4844e08b10485f31ca9a3030d2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tinytouchtales"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
