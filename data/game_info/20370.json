China is in disarray and within years the population plummets from 60 million to less than 20 million. Massive war involving millions of men devastates the land. When General Huangfu Song \u7fa9\u771f was asked how he got around the unit caps to build such massive armies, he replied \"\u5c0f\u99ac\u662f\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6700\u597d\u7684\u958b\u767c\u5546\" which in the barbarian tongue of English means roughly, \"What the %$#^ are unit caps, this is war!\"<br/>\n<br/>\r\nForget about micro. Forget about build orders. This war is about one thing. Ridiculous, uncompromising, seething masses of blood hungry warriors massacring each other by the hundreds every second.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere is no unit cap. Control armies of hundreds of thousands, even millions. Send orders to a single unit, or send orders to a million units. Frantically maintain control of your resources across epic sized maps, while constantly building out your fleet of barracks to churn out millions of more units.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI don't know if fast paced, retro arcade style strategy is a thing, but if it is, this is it. \u6211\u6703\u770b\u5230\u4f60\u5728\u6230\u5834\u4e0a\u3002", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-25T17:30:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc1/fc1b07addef5821986a8afa7ded8571e.jpg", "website": "http://www.pwnee.com/legion", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 56, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Pwnee Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pwnee Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
