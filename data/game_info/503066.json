If you wish to quit press the windows key and right click on the program and press close window. This is a very basic test of my skills with Unity. Use the W, A, S, D keys to move around and collect the floating squares. Once you collect all 12 you will move on to the next level. There is only 3 levels before you quit. DISCLAIMER: I do not know how this game will look like on different resolutions so it may look weird.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T06:19:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/938/9386f831ccd54eb5cc6fe3fca887f2b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Foxy Dreams Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
