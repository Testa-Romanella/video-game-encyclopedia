The <em>Fuzzies</em> like to be special and so don't like it when they connect with others that share their colour.</p><p>Connect as many <em>Fuzzies</em> in the amount of time you are given as you can by linking different colors together. You gain more points if they connect to an existing chain. Connect enough to reach milestones and bank your points.</p><p>Choose how you want to play by customising the round rules. Change the time and if getting penalties will cause a game over.<br/>Try to get the best FPS (<em>Fuzzies</em> per Second) for a new Highscore.</p><p><em><strong>Fuzzy Rainbow</strong></em> could be described as a \"Reverse Bubble Shooter\", where you are trying to catch the objects launched at you.</p><p><strong>Controls</strong> (also shown in game):</p><p>Keyboard: W / S for moving your<em> Fuzzi</em>.<br/>Mouse: For navigating menus and controls your<em> Fuzzies</em> direction.<br/></p><p>Dev Note:<br/>This game was made for the Game Maker's Toolkit 2021 Game Jam.
