As the world around falls to ruin, you play as a hardworking digger John, who must guide a mysterious girl named Sam through dangerous decaying cities, inhabited by strange monsters, and even stranger people! Inspired by 90s Japanese animation, the visual style of Eastward has been brought to life using a combination of a modern, innovative 3D lighting system and a rich retro-pixel artwork.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2021-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-08T03:28:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/cd3/cd3bf69db1093510cf1386b76564ea70.jpg", "website": "https://eastwardgame.com/", "rating": 3.69, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 79, "owned": 439, "beaten": 38, "toplay": 194, "dropped": 41, "playing": 26}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 37, "ratings_count": 87, "suggestions_count": 271, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 90, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox One", "Nintendo Switch", "macOS"], "developers": ["Pixpil"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Chucklefish"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
