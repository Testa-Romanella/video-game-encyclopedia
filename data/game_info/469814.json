One day, a suspicious group of people takes over your neighborhood, and yet no one seems to bat an eye. Something is wrong here. Very wrong. Little do you know, this is the first day of the rest of your life. The world of peace and everyday school life is gone, replaced by a world where you have to look over your shoulder.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Ani Me: Zero is a game heavily inspired by the Mother series as well as numerous anime series'.\u00a0 In development since 2016: Ani Me: Zero has grown from a small side project to a full fledged commitment between me and my work partner. Be warned,\u00a0 it helps to know or at least partially watch the following anime to understand some things:</p>\n<p>Bakemonogatari (Up to the first season)</p>\n<p>Love Live!! (Up to the first season)</p>\n<p>Mirai Nikki</p>\n<p>Girls und Panzer<br/></p>\n<p>Kemono Friends</p>\n<p>Gakkou Gurashi!</p>\n<p>(Note: though it is urged to watch these series' in their entirety unless told otherwise, not knowing or not having the time to watch them is perfectly fine. There might be a few references that would otherwise go over your head. Just a heads up!)<br/></p>\n\n<p>DEMO ONLY GOES TO CHAPTER 2!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T06:03:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74b/74b4a1a8d4175948bb80797982c383c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bayoen"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
