Emperor Nero says from the balcony of the Palace that the defenders of the city should protect him. Marius, the General of Rome (you will play for him) and the commander of the defenders, gives a small sack to a subordinate with the instructions to display it, saying this is the key to victory. Then he secures the ruler in the secret room and begins his story.</p>\n<p>The player will have to fight a lot with the enemies. There is a weak attack, there are quick sword strikes, allowing to deprive the enemy off balance, as well as a potent offence, for which you need to hold the button for a few seconds. It is better to attack at the right moments: striking, dodging and parrying, you can bring the combo counter to indecently high numbers. </p>\n<p>There is also a system of finishing the enemy, which can finally overthrow the opponent. Over the heads of heavily wounded enemies there is an icon in the form of a skull, and by pressing the right trigger, you can finish them with the help of the provided reception.</p>", "metacritic": 61, "released": "2013-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-21T17:39:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/736/736c0eaec96d848d7824b33298a182f2.jpg", "website": "http://www.rysegame.com", "rating": 3.58, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 215, "owned": 4012, "beaten": 738, "toplay": 101, "dropped": 269, "playing": 29}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 157, "ratings_count": 933, "suggestions_count": 721, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 947, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["Crytek"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Microsoft Studios", "Crytek"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
