(Yes animations aswell :D Fun things to do, mostly with Photoshop)<br/>- Sound design</p>\n\n<p>Idea of the game:</p>\n<p>In Bug War, two players take control of an army of good and an army of evil bugs. The game is a two player game in which one player takes control of the good bugs, while the other player takes control of the evil bugs. The players control their own army of bugs tasked with destroying the bugs of the opposing team. The bugs have different qualities, weaknesses and weapons which gives the players various strategic options. Bug War has been influenced by the Worms series. The Worms series consists of turn-based artillery games which were particularly popular in late 1990s and early 2000s.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T07:28:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4f/d4fd01907619480bf654019cce903b0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mightysaurus"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
