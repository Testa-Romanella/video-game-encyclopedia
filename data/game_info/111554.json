You were kidnapped by a newly formed cult where they wanted to use you for a human sacrifice. Since they are new to the spell world they messed up and gave you partial demonic powers instead of killing you. You must battle your way to the leader and defeat him in order to obtain the spell book and change yourself back into a human.\u00a0 The main challenge is that you are still part human so bullets to your head and body are still very fatal and one bullet can kill you. Use your environment to protect yourself and kill enemies, you are able to throw objects with abnormal force so each object can kill enemies in one hit. The Main Objectives are to find the two keys to unlock the room to the cult leader(boss) kill him and use the spell book to make your final decision. Will you return back to human and return to your family as planned\u00a0 or will you choose to become all powerful?</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oculus Rift and Touch Controllers<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>L/R Triggers to grab objects</p>\n<p>Left Stick to move</p>\n<p>Right Stick to Rotate</p>\n<p>Hold Left trigger to Sprint</p>\n<p>Press A for Ghost Scream</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c85/c85329bc0bb26b99de9dadc95f609414.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 220, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Student Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
