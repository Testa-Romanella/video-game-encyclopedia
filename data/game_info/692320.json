He also undertook the construction and final layout of the game\u2019s map/level and applied textures to the map/environment models, as well as helped with the Itch.io page</p>\n<p><strong>Jordan Holman:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Jordan was the one behind the programming for the AI and their movement using Nav Mesh and Waypoints for them to pathfind throughout the map. He also programmed interactions of the AI once it saw the player.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Joe Barlow:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Joe programmed player movement and the player actions such as switching Host bodies upon death and attacking the AI.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Ryan Eshraghi-Yazdi:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Ryan coded the UI features such as the Timers and Kill counter, the menu buttons, the Pause Screen and the Main Menu making sure it all worked as intended. Afterwards towards the end of the process set up the Itch.io page for the game and filled out a lot of the info pertaining to the game and the gameplay.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Edward Dawson:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Edward created the script for the spawning of enemies including things such as a spawning limit and added the spawning points to the map. They also designed the UI buttons, Main Menu screen, Background art, and Title art for the game and designed a Cover Image for the Itch.io page.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Brandon Healey:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Brandon created and unwrapped all the Map/Building Models (such as the walls, floors, corridors, and doors) to be used in the creation of the level, designed the first drafts of the level layout, and provided added details to the Itch.io page.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Mentoring:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Level 5 and 6 Students were very helpful and mindful of the experience of the Level 4 students. They took out plenty of time to help solve any problems, run through solutions and teach the Level 4 students how to use and/or navigate the software used in the process of creating the game. There was good communication between all members of the group; no one was left out of important discussions on the ideas for the game and mechanics within, and everyone was encouraged to bring ideas in no matter their level of experience. Everyone was ready and willing to help one another to help things to run as smoothly as they could go.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T10:25:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8da/8da932a3eb1ab3435e75db01292bddc8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OccasionalEgg", "TaxemicSpark27", "Jakeintor", "Blofelde", "Brandon Healey"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
