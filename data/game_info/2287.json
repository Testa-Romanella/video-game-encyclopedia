Her Story also is an interactive movie video game which is written and directed by Sam Barlow. Her Story is about a man who is missing and the player has to focus on searching through databases of various video clips from police interviews with missing man\u2019s wife Hannah Smith, in order to solve a case. </p>\n<p>Her Story is the first game made by Sam Barlow since his departure from Climax Studios. He wanted to create a game which focuses on story. He decided to use live action footage and created a police procedural game. In order to make it as much realistic as possible, Barlow watched lots of real police interviews, by doing so he discovered that there is a lot of ambiguity in those files and he wanted to incorporate that into the game as well.  <br />\nThe game was praised because of its original narrative, character performance and interesting gameplay mechanics.</p>", "metacritic": 88, "released": "2015-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-04T07:41:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a9a/a9a4e45ad8e653df2295e8410b7e96fd.jpg", "website": "http://www.herstorygame.com", "rating": 3.98, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 230, "owned": 2181, "beaten": 581, "toplay": 150, "dropped": 86, "playing": 13}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 18, "ratings_count": 607, "suggestions_count": 235, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 615, "platforms": ["Android", "macOS", "PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Sam Barlow"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Sam Barlow"], "esrb_rating": null}
