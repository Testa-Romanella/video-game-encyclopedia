Bombs can paint the ground, applying different status effects \u00a0(good and bad) to the unaware.<br/>Excuse the lack on content and poor balancing and art, I ran out of time for them n_n.<br/><br/>Currently playable on Windows and browsers. I'll try to get updated MacOSX/Linux builds by Monday.<br/></p>\r\nCredit\r\n<p>I used character assets from a couple of packs I purchased as part as a Humble Bundle<strong>. </strong>Specifically:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Over 80 RPG Characters with animations</strong></li><li><strong>Monsters Time Fantasy RPG Sprite Pack</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Both by @finalbossbluesAs for code, I did almost all of it from scratch, although I did reuse some bits from past projects for pathfinding and bsp generation.<strong> </strong>Feel free to check the repository @ https://github.com/wildrabbit/fairybomb (rushed overengineering ftw)<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><strong>QWEASD: </strong>Movement<strong> </strong>(use TAB if you have an AZERTY keyboard layout to change)</li><li><strong>J: </strong>Place a bomb. They'll go off automatically as they move or if they get caught on the area of effect of another bomb's explosion.</li><li><strong>Spacebar: </strong>Spend a turn.</li><li><strong>1,2,3</strong>... Select bomb on the inventory</li><li><strong>Shift + 1,2,3</strong>...Drop bomb (except the first one)</li></ul>\r\nChangelog\r\n<ul><li><strong>09/03/2019: v0.0.5 [SUBMISSION] </strong>Inventory + status <br/>feedback. Tile updates, fixes all around. Not so complete as I would \r\nlike to and it needs some heavy balancing / content design, but here we \r\ngo :D</li><li><strong>08/03/2019: v0.0.4 -</strong> During these days with no updates <br/>I've been adding a bunch of stuff:\u00a0 Enemies are now bombers after all, \r\nadded faction-based paint as a side effect of bomb explosions, BSP map \r\ngeneration and a basic loot system (currently only giving out bombs). \r\nI've had to cut a number of systems and features, but code-wise I think \r\nI'm relatively close to freezing it. \r\nHowever, I'm less than 12h away\r\n (minus some hours of sleep) and I'm missing HUD, game screens to close \r\nand the art, besides more fixes, not to mention balancing &gt;.&lt;</li><li><strong>05/03/2019: v0.0.3 - </strong>Added chase/escape/attack monster <br/>states. Chasing relies on some Dijkstra-based pathfinding, and I created\r\n the skeleton for a battle solver, currently handling some absurdly \r\nbasic melee combat. It feels quite one-sided against the player, so \r\nmaybe I'll just go with bomber/static enemies.</li><li><strong>04/03/2019: v0.0.2 - </strong>Enemies system (creator + ai controller basics\u00a0) and game data using scriptable objects. Provided MAC + Linux builds</li><li><strong>03/03/2019</strong>: Created project. First Windows + HTML5 dev builds (movement, time, hp, bomb placement, functioning hud)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-11T04:03:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80f/80ffecbe7fd5043e497eb89c18266161.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Ithildin"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
