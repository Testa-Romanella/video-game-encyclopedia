This was originally a Patreon exclusive release since it's not what I would really consider a complete game since it's missing a save system + better game balancing, but I've decided to release it anyways for free just for fun and\u00a0change the Patreon rewards to early access instead of exclusive releases.</p>\n<p>This is the Roguelike/Broughlike that I made about a month ago. Play as one of six different classes (Knight, Ranger, Defender,\u00a0Priest, Wizard, and Rogue) and defeat enemies in this turn-based adventure! Use the d-pad to move and move into enemies to attack them or into trees to cut them down. However, beware, as enemies move when you move! Press A to use your class specific special ability. Beat level 20 to win!</p>\n<p>Check out how I made it here:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T20:47:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c57/c570a21c39b511f3d869495c934b1bfa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SquidGod"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
