I haven't touched up on this since 2017 and am not likely to update it as I no longer have access to the original drafts in unity as well as the game bringing me too many painful memories. I figured I'd keep it here as an alternative to MEGA in the off chance I forget to update that storage. I'll have it published here should anyone be curious. I hope it can offer inspiration through the visual aesthetics of the game.\u00a0 Any bugs, mistakes, or outdated notes discovered through play will remain as is for the reasons previously stated.<br/></p><p>Summary: You play as an explorer making first contact with an alien force who grant you the ability to explore sections of their world, then they grant you a \"choice\" to determine the fate of humanity.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T09:03:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a5/5a50ca2af43c1312c9d8a185000a722a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["AnthonyPanics"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
