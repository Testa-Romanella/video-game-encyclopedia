You must collect all of the gems on each level, but to do so you can only make one short flight path (so make it count!) which will loop forever. Levels increase in difficulty. The first 8 levels are set in a low-poly earth environment, the last 8 levels are in space.</p>\n\n<p>All content was created in the Game Jam timeframe (except font).
