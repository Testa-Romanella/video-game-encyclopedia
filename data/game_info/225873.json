It will scale up on Android devices as  well.</p>\n<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> Cosmetic change. The way bullets are drawn now depends on the power of each bullet: 1-circle, 2-lines, 3-square. </p>\n<p><strong>Update 3:</strong> A new game mode with friendly fire *on* introduced. In this new mode turrets can hurt turrets and viruses can hurt viruses. Player still gets money for every turret destroyed, but now viruses can hurt each other too! Also viruses became smarter and now aim with more precision than ever!</p>\n<p><strong>Update 4:</strong> Various bugfixes, visual tweaks and (finally!) Android apk!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41d/41dc4a8b6302f5e75bc8996c77cfd4eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["4aiman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
