Echo is a nymph who is cursed by Hera to only be able to repeat what she hears last. In this first level you will play as Echo trying to follow the path through some woods. Remember to read the signs and keep in mind the curse.</p>\n<p>How to play: Use the arrow keys to move around!</p>\n<p>Bugs: Known flickering problem when moving off of signs.</p>\n<p>Note: Unfortunately I could not add more levels in such a short amount of time, but I hope the concept is interesting!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T11:51:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f6/9f6c10198dde23fdafb02bef592dbb83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["garethton52"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
