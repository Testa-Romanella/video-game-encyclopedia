But don\u2019t forget your defense in this\u00a0 multiplayer, PvP gardening war!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This is the first real game we all worked on. It's a university project and was created in the 2. semester</strong></p>\n<br/><br/>\n<p>Cut your grass, plant flowers and defend your hedges to get points!<br/>The play with the most points (\"best looking garden\") wins!</p>\n<p>By pressing E on any flowerbed you can buy a seedling from the menu. After it fully grown you can either keep and defend it to get points, or sell it for money. Vegetables are best to gain money, while normal flowers are your best choice for points.\u00a0 Press LMB to sell plants. </p>\n<p>Press space to open the buy menu. Here you can choose between multiple items to improve, defend or attack gardens. </p>\n<p>After each minute the player with currently the nicest garden gets a money bonus!\r\n</p>\n<p>That's the gist of it. </p>\n<p><em>A more detailed description of the rules and items is included in the download. </em></p>\n\n\n<p>We are running on the free version of the Photon Network API, therefore we have a slot limit of 20 players at a time. If the severs are currently full, just wait a moment :)\r\n</p>\n<p>The most important bug you should know is a item-pick up bug. If you drop an item and pick another one up, before the server realized your actions, your pickup doesn't work anymore. So please wait until you see your previous item laying on the ground. Most of the times you can fix the bug by buying an item (scissors are the cheapest) and drop that. </p>\n<p>And you probably want to close the game with Alt-F4 after finishing a match. Using the restart button takes at least a minute longer!</p>\n<p><em>Some more minor bugs are listed in the readme.txt.\u00a0</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Lukas Hort</strong> - Game Design, Vegetation creation, Particle Effects, Idea\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Juliana Kralik</strong> - Characters, Concepts, Shed Modelling\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Julius Trasselli</strong> - Progamming\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Niklas R\u00fcffler</strong> - Character Modeling, Rigging, Animations, Item Modeling\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Andr\u00e8 Molkenthin</strong> - Sound Design<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-14T03:44:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/003/0039becd65fa0c74c6796ea8e040f082.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dagliadubi"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
