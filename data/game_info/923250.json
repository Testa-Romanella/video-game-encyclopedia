Every question is randomly generated.</p>\n<ol><li>Lesson 1 is Addition.</li><li>Lesson 2 is Subtraction.</li><li>Lesson 3 is Multiplication.</li><li>Lesson 4 is Division.</li><li>Lesson 5 is a mix of all of them.</li></ol>\n<p>There are 3 difficulty settings. Easy, Medium and Hard.</p>\n<p>Because the questions are randomly generated some of them are repeated, especially in Easy difficulty. Which is fine because repetition is a good way to learn math.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Difficulty ranges from 5 to 12 year old's. Some question even take me a little time to answer.</p>\n<p>When you complete your lesson it will show your results and ask if you want to try again. Also it will save your Name, Lesson and Difficulty to a txt file. It will also save all answers to the text file and if there is an answer that is wrong it will save the correction underneath it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is played in the windows console atm but I am thinking of moving it into the Raylib game engine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I made this by request of my father for the kids to learn. So I decided to share it here.</p>\n<p>If I end up making a Raylib version of it I will post it here as a second copy of the game.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T06:02:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c0/2c0e9ecbb3ca69e476a340c2c7c3c559.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["C Smith"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
