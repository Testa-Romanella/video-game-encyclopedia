The flower grew\u00a0in the heart of the primeval forest. A glorified noble house was chosen to complete this mission, and none of its members could fail, return without the flower and avoid severe capital punishment. But the one who succeeds would gain riches and immortal glory.</p>\n<p>After his farther and brothers went deep to the woods\u00a0and never returned, the turn of the youngest son came.</p>\n<p>HOW\u00a0TO\u00a0PLAY THIS GAME</p>\n<p>Use <strong>Left mouse button</strong>\u00a0to attack and <strong>Right mouse button</strong>\u00a0to block.\u00a0The running timer in a fight shows how much time is left before you can attack again. Exclamation mark alerts you to a coming monster\u2019s attack. The hero\u2019s block lasts only a second, so be careful with timings. The numbers near a monster show its maximum (comes first) and actual HP. A healing potion is used automatically when hero\u2019s HP is lower than 15, but you can use it manually too. When a monster is defeated, the hero gets an item (sword, armor or shield). Its level is in the bottom right corner of its icon, the higher level, the better chances. To equip an item click on it or drag to the equipment slots (on the left, with characteristics above).
