To present a visual style that mixes the traditional way of animation in a three-dimensional world so that the two things look and work as a whole. In the beginning it was quite difficult and I had never programmed in my life before. I am grateful to the people who have extended their hand to me and continue to guide me all this time and to believe in me. I hope to live up to the expectations of all of you and give my best.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T11:36:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d3/1d3d3a09382608ed9cd47fb8a7546c39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Whooshez"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
