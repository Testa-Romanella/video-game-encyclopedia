You will have to make your neighbor angry by destroying every corner of his apartment.<br/><br/>This game is an excellent anti-stress, where everyone gets an opportunity to make a little prank and smash everything around. Who could refuse such a thing? Also, after you make all your fruition a reality you'll have to get away with it...or just take it...<br/><br/><br/><br/>You mistakenly walk into an apartment that isn't yours open wide and remember how you once worked at a house demolition job. But this time you decide not to demolish the whole house, but just one apartment. Of course, after all, behind the wall is yours!<br/><br/>It will be especially interesting to draw on the walls and throw grenades, which you have in abundance. But be careful: the time until the arrival of law enforcement in the form of a robot is limited. Try to plan everything so that there is time to have fun and escape.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Features :<br/><ul><li>Realistic physics of destroying objects<br/></li><li>Realistic explosion simulation<br/></li><li>Stunning graphics</li></ul><br/><strong>Destroying other people's property has never been more fun!</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T05:51:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfb/cfb93c518e6a2d68487ecdff65de7cbd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alexey Miroshnichenko"], "genres": ["Action", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Shinyo"], "esrb_rating": null}
