There's no real game here at the moment, no goal, not even a final chamber to seek out, just a small area to run around through in order to prove out player movement.</p>\n<p>This is a prototype of the movement system for\u00a0Project AdVRnture\u00a0(temp name), a VR adventure-platformer\u00a0currently in development by Hypernoodle Games.\u00a0Check the\u00a0Hypernoodle Games website\u00a0for more about the project\u00a0or\u00a0Jon Ludwig's Twitter for development updates.</p>\n<p>This demo is going to be full of jank and bugs, so please make sure you understand this when downloading, and then tell me about what bugs you find in the discussions page when you find some!\u00a0On that note, this demo will be continuously updated as development continues, and as I respond to feedback from users who try the demo. So please do give feedback in the discussions page!
