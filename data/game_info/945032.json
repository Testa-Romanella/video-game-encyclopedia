Once again, the world is in peril and only you-world-class sprinter, aerospace engineer, consultant to every free-world leader of the last two decades, and ace helicopter pilot-can stop the Mad Leader. Too bad; it looks like you'll have to postpone the christening of the USS McGibbits and that little soiree you had planned with Vanna this evening.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAfter all, you'll be busy flying your Gizmo DHX-1 Attack Chopper behind enemy lines in search of the Mad Leader's new headquarters.
