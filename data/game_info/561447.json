Managed to finish it just in time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0In this game, you play as Karolinn, a girl who lives in a world that was infested by Uggas. Her partner, Lorknian, is a talking sword, who helps her through this adventure, even if he isn't able to move without her. Together, ther are stronger, as Karolinn isn't able to fight and Lorknian isn't able to move. They need to get to the Pillar of Rewriting, so they can rewrite the story to a point where no Uggas have invaded the world, and it is your job, as the player, to guide them there.<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0I hope you like this little game, and I hope it fits the theme well enough! It was wonderful working in this project in such a little time spam and I hadn't released a game yet, so I'm not expecting it to do very well, but it is something I acomplished and something I'm proud of! Blessings!
