Especially when you're talking about Dwarf labour. - Your Benevolent\u00a0Machine Intelligence Overlords</em></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Space Dwarf is a mash up of FTL and Frantic Flippers with a healthy dose of malicious machine intelligence. You will have to build all the components your ship will need in combat, including missiles, shields and lasers. To be successful you will also have\u00a0to manage the load-out while in combat.</p>\n<strong>Web support for this game is currently experimental.

Even as you finally approach your distant destination things do not seem to be going right. The Machine Intelligence\u00a0that runs the ship seems to be becoming more and more extreme. Will you, or any biological life, make it out alive?\r\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>'wasd'\u00a0 - Move\r\n</li><li>'Space'\u00a0 - Interaction (pickup/drop)\r\n</li><li>'Delete'\u00a0 - Delete the currently held item\r\n</li><li>`m` - Mute</li><li>`/` - Cheat</li><li>1-8 - Jump to encounter (use if you lose your progress)</li></ul>\n<p>You can also click on any item in game to get it's\u00a0description.\r\n</p>\r\nAttribution\r\n<ul><li><strong>Game Code</strong>\u00a0- Alexander Griffith (GPL3+)\r\n</li><li><strong>Game Art\u00a0</strong>- Alexander Griffith (CCBY 4)\u00a0\r\n</li><li><strong>Music\u00a0</strong>- Alexander Griffith (CCBY 4)\r\n</li><li><strong>F</strong><strong>ont\u00a0</strong>(FFForwa) - (OFL)\r\n</li><li><strong>Font\u00a0</strong>(Inconsolata) - (OFL)\r\n</li><li><strong>Sounds Effects</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0 NeadSimic, Nicole Marie, Jalastram, Blender Foundation, MentalSanityOff (CCBY 3/4)\r\n</li><li><strong>Library (</strong>Lume) - RXI (MIT/X11)\r\n</li><li><strong>Library\u00a0</strong>(anim8,bump) - Enrique Cota (MIT)\r\n</li><li><strong>Engine\u00a0</strong>(L\u00d6VE) - L\u00d6VE Dev Team (Zlib)\r\n</li><li><strong>Language\u00a0</strong>(Fennel) - Calvin Rose (MIT/X11)\r\n</li><li><strong>Web Support\u00a0</strong>(Love.js) Davidobot\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Built for the web using\u00a0https://github.com/Davidobot/love.js\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>This was a submission to the 2021 Lisp Spring Game Jam</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The source code can be found at:\u00a0https://gitlab.com/alexjgriffith/space-dwarf</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T20:30:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69f/69fecbb7d11e96dbcd00b04b9f61cb60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["alexjgriffith"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
