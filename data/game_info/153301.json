I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. There's no lose condition so the only goal is to see how high of a score you can get. I really tried to add a bit of polish to is and I think I did a decent job. I mainly use the two button controls theme but tried to incorporate growth into a difficulty mechanic. My highest score is a 926. I'm interested to see how well others can do. <br/><br/>I recommend that you use a mouse. <br/><br/>Feedback is always welcome. <br/><br/>Made using Haxe and HaxeFlixel. <br/>Art done in Photoshop/Illustrator. <br/>Music/Sfx done in Ableton Live.</p><p>#LDJAM #LD34</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d4/8d4eee3e8b717f62f9737110398840db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cxsquared"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
