Each map is designed to be played from a pistol start, but some effort has been made to support continuous play as well.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Valiant includes a number of new monsters and weapons implemented through an extensive MBF format DeHackEd patch. As a result, Valiant is not compatible with gameplay mods, and can only be played in ports with full MBF DeHackEd support. At present, these include ZDoom, GZDoom, PrBoom-plus (complevel 11), and Eternity. Zandronum is also supported through DECORATE.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-06T13:16:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85e/85e11d91eaea766052e4d6c229f2ab37.jpg", "website": "https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/Ports/megawads/valiant", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
