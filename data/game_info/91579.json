{"id": 91579, "slug": "a-nightmare-on-sesame-street", "name": "A Nightmare on Sesame Street", "name_original": "A Nightmare on Sesame Street", "description": "<p>Story: Freddy Krueger is haunting Elmo's dreams. You must find the radios to wake up and escape Freddy's Nightmare, but beware, Freddy is fast and deadly so if he spots you, he'll catch you and stab you with his claw glove. Will you be able to escape his Nightmare?<br/></p>\n<p>So, I guess someone had to make a Nightmare on Sesame Street game eventually, cause I don't think anyone has ever done one. The only Sesame Street horror game I've heard of is that Alphabet Lane game on gamejolt. But no one (I think) has ever made a crossover Nightmare on Sesame Street game before. So here it is, a really random kinda short game that I'm sure you'll enjoy.</p>\n<p>Remember to report any and all bugs, and if you want some improvements to the game, let me know and I'll try to add them as soon as I can. Also If you find the game too easy or hard, or too fast or too long, let me know and I'll try to fix it.</p>\n<p>You know the drill, let me know if you make a video about my game, cause I'd honestly love to know. ;D</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: I don't own A Nightmare on Elm Street or Sesame Street obviously. This is just a parody game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1fe/1fe8062cdda19f4b6eb0f6bbddfbd059.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dave Microwaves Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
