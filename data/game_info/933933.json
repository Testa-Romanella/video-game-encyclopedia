The goal is to keep your tower as high as possible while the woke mob tries to drag you down. Coots has a basic charged attack which drops a sphere on those below. Coots can also charge orbs for a variety of attacks which include a bomb for extra damage, rapid fire, freezing the towers descent for a time, wiping out one side of the tower and an ultimate ability which destroys any enemies touching the tower. Coots also has the ability to raise the tower back up using the central orb, but beware, at later levels this becomes impossible with too many enemies touching it at once.
