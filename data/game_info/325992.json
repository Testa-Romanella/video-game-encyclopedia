Can you be truly connected with someone if you don't know what they're thinking? And would you be truly connected if you did ? What if those connections are broken\u00a0? What if you can't restore them anymore?\u00a0 Can you imagine the confusion and chaos that would cause?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Disconnected Yet Connected is a game that asks all these questions-and never proceeds to answer them. Because I'm a terrible writer and It's impossible to answer those questions in a 10 minute long game anyway.<br/></p>\n<p>But yes, I did have fun making it.</p><p>Note: You can speed up most dialogue by pressing Z. It's a huge help if you want to replay the game for another ending.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T19:39:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/772/772cf8c9ff9095b7d29cd50a673763e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["B-Deshi Dev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
