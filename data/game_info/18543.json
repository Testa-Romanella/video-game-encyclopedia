This game also gives you a chance to think about the value of paying money to Pay2Win games. <br/>In this game, you become a warrior in a fantasy world, experience the Pay2Win business model and uncover the hidden secrets behind the systems.Before you play this game:-The Pay2Win model is not necessarily evil. But you must know on what you spent your money. Now you can, with this game. <br/><br/><br/>-We recommend this game to those who have read Thomas Baekdal's 'How In-app Purchases Have Destroyed The Industry' and were excited by it. <br/><br/>-In this game, you will have to purchase countless transactions just to play. But worry not. The cash in this game is free and virtual, and is provided limitlessly. <strong>(NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE!!)</strong><br/><br/>-However, the accumulated cash amount you've spent will be shown in the game screen, and this will bother you a bit.<br/><br/>-This game cannot represent all the pay2win tricks that exist in the world. Even now, new tricks are being conjured.<br/><br/>-This game simulates an MMORPG, but only supports single play mode. NPCs who pose as other players appear in this game.<br/><br/>-The 'Avatar' you meet in the game is an extension of the game's creator. Talk to him. He is dead serious.<br/><br/>Best Gaem Studio <br/>\"We create gaem\"", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3b/c3b4d69c30f81c351c488001d92eef41.jpg", "website": "http://www.bestgaem.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 67, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 360, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Best Gaem Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Best Gaem Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
