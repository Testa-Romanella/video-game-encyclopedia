The main goal of this storytelling FPS game is to walk around the dark rooms and learn what happened in the past. In this game, the concept of duality is based on the connection between the world of ideas which exists in our minds and the materialist world which actually exists. The importance of the line between this duality is considered in the context of the disasters that can occur if two factors intermingle.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T10:32:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db1/db12c7f10d43ea661bb908188f009548.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BlueBonfire"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
