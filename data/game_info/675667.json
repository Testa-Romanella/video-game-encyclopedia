It must survive in a randomly generated dungeon against many dangerous foes. To do that he can use the special abilities of its different states and it can get a special upgrade to give him back its original form.<br/><br/><strong>Instructions and commands :</strong></p>\n<p>Sadely, this game doesn't contain any tutorial level (we didn't have the time). That is why you can first find here the inputs for the game :</p>\n<ul><li><strong>To move :</strong> Arrows or WASD</li><li><strong>To shoot :</strong> Left mouse button</li><li><strong>Special :\u00a0</strong>Right mouse button</li></ul>\n<p>Furthermore, you will be able to find your <strong>lifebar\u00a0</strong>in the bottom right corner (in red). In the bottom left corner there is, in white, your <strong>transformation gauge</strong> which indicates the time left before the next state's change of your bot. Around this indicator you will see, in green, the <strong>ultimate gauge</strong> that you can fill by collecting some green pills which appear when you kill an enemy. Be careful, the red pills will decrease this gauge. Finally, above your lifebar is placed in yellow your <strong>special ability cooldown</strong>.</p>\n<p>Last thing, when you finish killing all the enemies in a room, do not hesitate to go around it to find the corridor leading to the next one, the goal being to go as far as possible in this dungeon.</p>\n<p><strong>Colaborators :</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>@1Moi</li><li>@Math's314</li><li>@lilpopopaulll</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T10:03:13", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Shaonde"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
