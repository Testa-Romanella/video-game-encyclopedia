The original game reached the <strong>second place</strong> at the competition.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe game is free, but I'm accepting donations so I can keep doing awesome things. Honestly, I would be very happy if you just play my first game and you have at least half the fun I had making it!\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\r\nContact me\r\n<p>\r\n\tYou can reach me on my Twitter for updates and for more projects (lots of gifs!) or send me an e-mail at <strong>fran.exfer@gmail.com</strong>.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3d/d3db87574bbce9b19d1bf05c62499bbd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daruu"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
