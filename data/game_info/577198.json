Well now you can! In this game you play as a frog, that can leap between lily pads. On the way to the lily pads, you may eat some \"Fireflies\", which will slightly increase the time you have left. The aim of the game is to collect as many coins as possible, as well as\u00a0<strong>coining</strong>\u00a0together some sick combos to give you even more points!</p>\n<p><strong>NEW ADVENTURE MODE:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This new mode tracks your score by time alive. To make this challenging, there are now alligator lily pads that will end the game if you land on them. Furthermore, there is now a snake that will follow you around, and if it gets to close then you die. In the adventure mode, coins increase the time that you have lived for, and turnips spawn, which make you invincible, and faster.</p>\n<p><strong>Source code available </strong><strong>here</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T08:11:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd5/fd54d3fcad5b1286787e6173cea760d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Forbit"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
