Please note that this game lacks music. For more details on its development, go ahead and download the game for free, and then look at the readme in the zip file. Also note that it is my every intention to continue, in one form or another, the development of this game. Thank you!</p>\n<p>For future development updates, see @That_Two_Guy on Twitter.<br/></p>\n<p>For Game Jam Players: please note that the \"Writing Tweaked\" version was finished after the jam due date.
