{"id": 117984, "slug": "kombine-itch", "name": "Kombine (itch)", "name_original": "Kombine (itch)", "description": "<p>Kombine is a minimalist puzzle game played on a grid. The goal is to remove all of the blocks that have borders by matching three or more of the same blocks together. When blocks are matched, a new block is created with the same color and a higher value. Three 1s create a 2, three 2s create a 3, etc. However, you can only place blocks with a 1 value, so it can become challenging to create a match with higher value blocks. There are 50 levels to play through in both normal and time trial modes. In time trial mode, you play quickly through 10 levels at a time trying to get the best time.</p><p><strong>Vote on Steam Greenlight</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/698/698294915fcd4d3ee99bd278c4f9ed76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["rob1221"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
