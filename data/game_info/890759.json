You are an amateur cartoonist from Chicago trying to get your start in the film industry. At this point, things have been going well enough; you have several films to your name, and you have even recently established your own studio.<br/></p>\n<p>But one night, out of nowhere, you find yourself in a terrible nightmare unlike anything you have ever experienced. You are trapped in a dungeon, specifically a room with 3 boarded up exits. Oddly enough, you feel like you are in full control. The harsh fluorescent lights pain your vision; the cold breeze through the room gives you chills. All of the sensations feel very real.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As well, you find a weird device in your hand unlike anything you have ever seen. Before you have time to understand what is going on, you get the uneasy feeling that you are being watched.\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Mr. Manatee (Peyton Murdock):\u00a0Programming, UI, Character Models, Environments, SFX\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Oli:\u00a0Character textures, Menu Music\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Lillian:\u00a0Soundtrack\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Sunken Studios:\u00a0Character Animations, Bug Patches\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Dillon:\u00a0Testing\u00a0\r\n</li><li>DiceGames:\u00a0Testing\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Tuned:\u00a0Feedback\r\n</li><li>Squeaks\u00a0D'corgeh:\u00a0Itch.io Page Setup</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T10:01:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd2/dd278edab2c756d43133ce4dd89013df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mr. Manatee"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
