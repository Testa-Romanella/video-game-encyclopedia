The pictures you'll draw are just as much pieces of art as they are complex, endlessly detailed and somewhat self-similar mathematical objects. <br/></p><p>Relax and enjoy watching your drawings form beautiful fractals. When you like what you see, you can save your images too!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T15:53:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d88/d88803de8732c446f8a9d732eb6cc802.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 175, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xotla"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
