So you cherish the nights you get more than a couple of hours of the sweet respite.</p>\n<p>Your phone ringing next to your bed lets you know that this will not be one of those nights.</p>\n<p><em>'Hello?'</em> you answer, sitting up in your bed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0<em>'Hey Detective, sorry to wake you up so late, but we have a strange case for you.' </em>says the police dispatcher on the other end of the line.<br/></p>\n<p><em>'What are the details?'</em>\u00a0 you sigh.<br/></p>\n<p><em>'It seems like a robbery gone wrong. You'd best head down there, the officer at the scene will fill you in.'</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>'Ok, send me the address'</em> you reply as you get up and start getting dressed. The dispatcher sends you the address for 'Spotlight' Art Gallery, and you call a cab. <em>'Coffee first'</em> you think getting into the car.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>The Art Gallery is a text-based puzzle-hunt game, inspired by the 'Cryptex Hunt 2021' games. Navigate your way through puzzles in a strange art gallery to get to the bottom of what is going on. You might need Google, a pen and some paper.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T08:27:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aff/afff416347c0ab59b820f1301c6a173a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JefftLink"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
