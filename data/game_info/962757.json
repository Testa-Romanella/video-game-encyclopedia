{"id": 962757, "slug": "true-love-95", "name": "True Love '95", "name_original": "True Love '95", "description": "<strong>True Love ~Jun'ai Monogatari~</strong> was released by Japanese developer Software House Parsley for the NEC PC-98 in 1995. Four years later, the game was localized for Windows 95 and released in the U.S. and Europe by Otaku Publishing. Despite its popularity, the game has been in licensing limbo and only available to play through unofficial sources... <strong>UNTIL NOW!</strong><h3>The Re-Release</h3>The majority of work put into the re-release of True Love '95 involved uncovering the existing license holders so that fans can support this classic for its 25th anniversary. There are some known issues with the game we have identified below and on the Community Hub.<br/><br/><h3>The Story</h3>The main character is a single, nineteen-year-old Japanese college senior living in the city of Meiai, forced out by his parents at the idea that independence may attract him a partner. With no direction and unsure of his future, the player embarks on a quest to define themselves and find a person to love. The game is played through a series of days consecutively spanning three months.At the start of each morning, players designate an activity to pursue for evening, night, and in the case of weekends or vacation, daytime. Each choice impacts the overall profile of the player and points are distributed across stats for <strong>passion</strong>, <strong>appearance</strong>, <strong>fatigue</strong>, <strong>scholarship</strong>, <strong>strength</strong>, and <strong>art</strong>. Depending on the level of these stats, and the order of schedules made during particular days, the player will shift their romantic focus and possibly trigger events and encounters with other characters.<h3>The Known Issues</h3><br/>We want everyone to be informed of known issues with the game ahead of purchasing. Due to the age of the game, these are the issues that may impact modern systems.<br/><br/><strong>\u2022</strong> There is a 2-3 second delay on modern systems when loading MIDI tracks.<br/><strong>\u2022</strong> Default save file includes two junk entries. Loading them will crash the game.<br/><strong>\u2022</strong> CG images from the first day of the game are unlocked ahead of playing the first day.<br/><br/>FAKKU is working to fix these issues, but given the age of the game and the loss of the original source code (both the original Japanese and English releases), we are not confident these issues will be resolved.
