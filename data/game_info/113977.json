We took a\u00a0satirical twist on the Battle Royale genre -\u00a0it is literally King of the Hill. As a player you must race to capture the golden crown that lets you TRANSFORM in to the powerful CastleDay's\u00a0King or Queen.\u00a0 All other players must rally together to knock the King (or Queen) off the WarHill!<br/></p>\n<p>The longer you keep the crown the more points you gather!\u00a0The player with the most points at the end of the 10 minute match wins the game!\r\n</p>\n<p>Even better, there are some pretty amazing jokes in this game! From our hearts to your heart enjoy the game and have FUN! Thank you for your support and all our amazing viewers on Twitch!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eab/eabafcc9b08e26708ba59e8a52f4a56d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stark Gaming"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
