The idea was moderately ambitious: you, as the small spark representing the core of a planet, hurtle through a nebula to collect the essential elements of your future self. The composition of your collected components determines the type and look of your planet once you've accreted enough things.</p>\r\nThe Result\r\n<p>As is often the case with jams we attempt, we didn't spend nearly as much time on the project as it needed, but we did come up with something pretty neat that lays a foundation for the grander vision.</p>\r\nThe Gameplay\r\n<p>Use the left and right arrow keys to spin your spark, causing it to veer off in the respective direction as it flies through the cosmic building blocks. As you pass through the four elements that can make up your planet - metal, rock, water, and gas - you'll pull them into your core until you've collected enough to Grow into a brand-new planet.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T11:45:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f37/f37587eef75fa77fb36926aba1942688.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["twchapman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
