It feels good to be able to say that I have finished a project, even though there are still more things I would like to add. </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the project as much as I do.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T09:08:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45a/45a899e9e332fa2bbcb3e85c47e2666b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NukeMonkey"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
