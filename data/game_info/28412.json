The player performs on behalf of a black-and-white pinata horse.<br />\nThe aim is to fulfill requirements such as digging the ground, sewing weeds, harvesting ponds, and sculpting plants. During the game, the player also has to keep the garden from antagonists \u2013 sour pinatas. They usually harm plants, eat seeds, drop poisonous candies and destroy various objects. Once the requirements are fulfilled, the player\u2019s pinata becomes a full-colored version. The next goal is to find a couple suitable for mating; this part of the game includes a minigame.
