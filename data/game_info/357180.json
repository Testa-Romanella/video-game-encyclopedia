Sure, but\u00a0you must also dive and surface before your oxygen bubbles run out and you lose your submarine.\u00a0\r\n<p>The amount of treasure you collect each dive will also weigh your submarine down, decreasing your speed.</p>\n<p>You will find\u00a0rarer and greater amounts of treasure the deeper you travel. But be sure to leave enough time to surface or you will lose all your treasure from that dive.<br/><br/>If you find yourself running out of oxygen, you can hold down space bar to drop your treasure in order to decrease weight,\u00a0increasing speed.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid touching bombs, as hitting them will make them explode, decreasing your oxygen.</p>\n<p>Once you complete a successful dive and surface, you can purchase upgrades from the shop that will allow you to dive further and collect more treasure, letting you reach a higher score.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e8/3e8f337cdc72d361a3574becfd3e1e02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Unicorn Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
