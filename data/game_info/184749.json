P1 uses the 2 lowest octaves of the keyboard, P2 uses the highest octaves. Whichever player is leading the melody plays a note on the beat from the 7 white keys of their upper octave and plays the melody associated with it. The other player must them play an accompaniment for that melody, and will take damage for any mistakes. If the leading player makes a mistake or the accompanying player plays well enough, their roles will switch.</p>\n<p>Programming : Jonathan Montineri, Adrien Farhat<br/>Graphics &amp; misc visual assets : Jonathan Montineri<br/>Melodies and audio design : Veronica Boychuk</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p><strong>Third party software licenses</strong>: This game uses the MidiJack plugin by GitHub user Keijiro.\u00a0 License info available on the GitHub page linked here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b50/b50967c5f8eba7821a8f6d44471e73c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jonathan Montineri"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
