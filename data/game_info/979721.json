Good, because this game is like that game, but it is full of heart-clogging proteins and greenhouse gas emissions. Join some hotdogs in the kitchen in their quest for the meats they've been missing.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDrop meats into a jar and just like in real life, if two of the same type of meat touch, they'll merge into a higher quality meat. See if you can beat a high score, or maybe just enjoy the smooth sounds of meats merging.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-05T12:43:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/135/13554243d56f56d4a822fb8c4784aaac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gorilla Dome Games"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Gorilla Dome Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
