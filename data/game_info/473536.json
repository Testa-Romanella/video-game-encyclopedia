Finish a stage and receive gems that can be later used to increase the power of your items.<br/><br/><br/><br/> \u201dFree-for-all\u201d friendly fire system, meaning traps and enemies can hurt everyone, allowing for complex tactical options. Enemies can hurt each other too, so use it! Observe and plan who to defeat first and who will unsuspectingly aid you in battle!<br/><br/> Dynamic 360 combat experience. Slash enemies and move in any direction. Fluid gameplay means players have more control.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Gain points by playing in campaign mode and mini-games.
