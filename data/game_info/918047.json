Special baits are colored blue and if a snake eats it, it generates a block of wall on the random coordinates of the arena in the same color as the player who ate the special bait.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Basically, snakes can pass through the blocks with the same color as themselves while these blocks hit damage to the different colored snakes. So the more you eat special baits, the more danger you create for your opponent.</p>\n<p>If a snake's length is reduced to 1 block it loses one of its lives and after 3 frames pass, the snake goes back to the starting length.</p>\r\nScreenshots\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a9 2023 Super Snake Bros", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T07:13:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a0/0a09ebe435249b896cbf0bb4c973a985.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bb732"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
