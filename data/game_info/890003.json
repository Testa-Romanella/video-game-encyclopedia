Nobody is allowed to notice that a plushie can walk, so move swift and quickly between the parent to the second floor where your buddy lies.</p>\n<p>Sadly, we have a little bug with the shader on the main character, and it's really hard to lose. Still, it's the end of the jam, and we want to finish our little project.\u00a0 I hope you enjoy the visuals and have fun.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You are the favorite plushie of your child.<br/> Unfortunately, they forgot you while you were playing with them outside.<br/>Get back inside to the top floor but don't let their parents see you, they can't know that you are alive.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T04:31:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3c/d3c0b2302e22d455d213714729483e31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Unshackled-Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
