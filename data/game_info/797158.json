Rumor has it that the Ichor can reverse time if all Reflections are gathered. Unfortunately for Brick, they're not the only one hunting for E.I.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aside from deadly alien plants and\u00a0other Retrievers suddenly going rogue,\u00a0there are the binding laws of the Galactic Council and a sinister race known as the Th'radis who are seemingly at odds with every race they come across.\u00a0 Yet more surprises await Brick and their faithful companion In Reflections of Death.<br/></p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p><strong>WASD/Left Joystick\u00a0</strong>- Movement</p>\n<p><strong>Space/Joystick Button0\u00a0\u00a0</strong>- Jump</p>\n<p><strong>ESC/Joystick Button 7\u00a0</strong>- Pause<br/></p>\n<p>((<strong>Author's Note</strong>-- Hey yall, I'm sorry this doesn't have more to it but with a timeline of ten days and my computer having to be completely wiped and everything reinstalled due to a blue screen issue... well, there isn't much 'gameplay' there yet.\u00a0I definitely spent more time than I should have on the menu/intro but I'm real proud of it regardless. I hope to come back to this\u00a0 -- you know, after I've had some sleep. Overall it was fun, I've never done coding or used Unity-- <em>or any game building program</em>-- before and I learned a lot through doing all of this. I know I could have used more free assets-- <em>instead of doing all the animations by hand lol</em>--\u00a0but to be honest I really enjoyed the more hands-on approach because it gave me a lot of opportunities to learn.\u00a0Thanks for looking/playing!))<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Planned v2 future updates--</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Finish Sprite Animations (for both Brick and Pebbles)</li><li>Complete Pebble's follow mechanics</li><li>Add 2D light sources</li><li>Finish and implement Character UI panel</li><li>Finish LVL 1 story and setting</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T18:29:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db3/db3fa92effd55c969d23db7e03acf231.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Sinister Biscuit"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
