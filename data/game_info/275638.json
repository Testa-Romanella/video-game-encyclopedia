The game is set in a desolate, frozen environment seemingly abandoned by all life. Scattered throughout the icy landscape are mysterious energy crystals emanating a strange power. The player navigates 36 levels of arctic terrain using their platforming skills and a tool that allows them to tether between crystals. The constantly ticking timer encourages players to complete levels as quickly as possible and compete with others to earn their place at the top of the leaderboards.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2022\tFast-Paced Movement Mechanics<br/>\r\n\u2022\t36 Levels<br/>\r\n\u2022\tLeaderboards<br/>\r\n\u2022\tAchievements<br/>\r\n\u2022\tCollectables<br/>\r\n\u2022\tUnlockable Challenge Levels", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-05T13:16:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a96/a966577b26ecbf79cbdd1600c5fafb96.jpg", "website": "https://www.frostrunner.com", "rating": 3.56, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 3, "beaten": 11, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 28, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Think Arcade"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SMU Guildhall"], "esrb_rating": null}
