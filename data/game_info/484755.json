Waves of enemies come and follow a path and you have to build towers and defend your base. We have 3 types of enemies and 3 types of tower to destroy them with. Strategic placement of the towers will make your victory certain. Fail to choose the best place to put your towers and you can end up losing the fight against the enemy.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDon't expect any refined gameplay mechanics or an amazing game. We are just starting out and we will make better and better games as time goes by.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-27T18:08:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/167/167baa6eefa1c8097e2dfaa0e23e3f77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pretty Bad Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pretty Bad Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
