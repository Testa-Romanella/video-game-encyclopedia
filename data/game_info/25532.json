{"id": 25532, "slug": "art-of-fighting-2", "name": "ART OF FIGHTING 2", "name_original": "ART OF FIGHTING 2", "description": "<p>\n      Released in 1994 by SNK, ART OF FIGHTING 2 sees 12 characters compete \n      for the title in the toughest fighting contest of them all: King of \n      Fighters. Each character has a range of deadly techniques in his/her \n      arsenal, and players must use these lethal techniques to fight their \n      opponents. As in the original ART OF FIGHTING, however, using a deadly \n      technique lowers a character\u2019s mental-energy gauge. For this reason, \n      players must use these techniques carefully. Meanwhile, players can \n      taunt an opponent to exhaust his/her mental energy, and even suppress \n      the opponent\u2019s techniques if successful. This type of mental-energy \n      offense and defense gives ART OF FIGHTING 2 a uniquely enjoyable spin on \n      the fighting-game genre. Further adding to the strategy required to win, \n      an attack will become stronger or weaker depending on exactly when the \n      button is pressed. And even if a player is thrown, defensive action is \n      possible with the timely press of a button. All of this adds up to an \n      intense and nail-biting fighting-game experience not found anywhere else!\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
