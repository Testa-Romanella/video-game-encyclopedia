This was made in an hour, please roast it as bad as you can. W/SPACE/UP-ARROW to jump. Left click to restart (when you click the restart button). Game puts you straight into the game without warning and no title screen so uhh beware of that. I didn't add a title screen because it's 1 hour and I can't be bothered today. If you want future updates, tell me and I'll make it better.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T08:38:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39e/39e3eb9fbdc126dfc3d3dca58fdb37c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NotMyself"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
