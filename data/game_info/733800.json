Little did they know the human remains they find would lead them to investigate a nearby village. A very strange village is full of evil and strange characters. A traditional RPG-style horror game.</p>\n<p>Will you earn $1,000 to buy a shotgun? Will you take a Necronomicon-like book from an old church? Battle a number of strange creatures, all hand-drawn by me. Can you stop the murderous Ted, Ted's mom, and roaming cultists? Use old man Harold's chicken to pet them, or perhaps his cane and or shotgun if you can afford it.</p>\n<p>The first RPG I've made. It's a sorta test to learn the software, and I think it turned out well. The maps are pretty small but full of locations, NPCs, quests, etc.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The main theme in-game by my wonderfully talented friend Lucy</p>\n<p>Terrax lighting plugin https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/terrax-lighting-system.49339/</p>\n<p>Old man resources: https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/old-man-resource.47456/</p>\n<p>A couple of others, but some I can't find the originals to add, but I thank them dearly.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T08:05:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/416/416509bebfae1f2c94e7eb23713db8eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ViolentBaby"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
