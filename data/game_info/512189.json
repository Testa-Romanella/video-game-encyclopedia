The key locations are randomized each run, and so is the searching pattern of the creature</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>The Creature:</em></strong><strong> Within this Corn Maze lurks a Creature trying to Hunt you down because you are eating too much of the corn\u00a0without sharing</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>The Player: </em><strong>You play in a first person perspective, searching for 4 keys, Which\u00a0Spawn Randomly throughout the Corn\u00a0Field each try</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>What must I press within this video game...To exit the game you must press the Escape/ESC Key\u00a0 ..Press W,A,S,D or Up Arrow, Down Arrow, Right Arrow, Left Arrow in order to move...\u00a0</strong><strong>and move your mouse in order to look around.. ITS THAT SIMPLE!!! :O</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you want my recommendation how to play the game then I would suggest to play this game at night in a Dark Room...\u00a0Have Fun!!!</p>\n\n<p><strong>I should mention there is no main menu, meaning that when you startup the game you get right into the gameplay... As of now</strong><br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Future\u00a0Plans List:</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>1. Maybe Split Screen Multiplayer</p>\n<p>2. Maybe Split Screen 1V1 (Probably not but we will see)</p>\n<p>3. Sensitivity Options</p>\n<p>4. More Map layouts</p>\n<p>5. A Lantern Item for players with screens that are too dark</p>\n<p>6. The Creature will check where the last Key Collected Location was</p>\n<p>7. A Ringing Sound notification when the player is close to a key</p>\n<p>8. More Screenshots and a Video to show off what the game is about in the main menu (Very Soon)</p>\n<p>}</p>\n\n\r\nIt Would Be Amazingly Helpful if you could leave a review on this game and share what you liked and what you disliked within this game so that I may be able to improve in the future...
