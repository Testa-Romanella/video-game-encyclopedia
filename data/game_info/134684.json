Your escape pod flies towards the crash site but sustains damage during flight. You'll need to find and repair any parts for the escape pod you come across and even worse, it seems this planet isn't uninhabited. An incoming dust storm has got XZ-03's residents feeling rather aggressive and you're looking like a perfect target...</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>[W,\u00a0A, S,\u00a0D] -&gt; Movement</p>\n<p>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] -&gt; Select firing type</p>\n<p>[LMB] -&gt; Fire<br/></p>\n<p>[RMB} -&gt; Build defences<br/></p>\n<p>[E] -&gt; Build mining/repair droid</p>\n<p>[ESC} -&gt; Pause game<br/></p>\n<p><strong>OTHER:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game was built in just over three months as a personal goal to develop a longer project from start to finish in the Unity engine.
