But you may never feel how your order really impacts your people.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As a famer or worker, you have little chance to understand the dilemma of choice-making that your king is suffering.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this game, you will first play as the king and then the famer or worker who are controlled by you before. These two parts have mutual influences: when you are being a cruel king, you will experience a harder life as a worker; if you do well as a worker, your king will benefit from it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Developers:</p><ul><li>Programmer: Okami Wong</li><li>Artist: Yuheng Zhang</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T05:52:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3eb/3ebd76c6530197ffcae61eb1391238cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["okamiwong"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
