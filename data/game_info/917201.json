Behold! The First First-person shooter game in thumby ... Thoom.<br/><br/>This is a demake version Doom written in MicoPython, with raycasting pseudo-3D and sprite scaling (for upscale only, it looks unrecognizable when downscale).As a proof of concept, there is only one level, filled with Demons and Imps, and locked doors requiring key card to open, and last but not least a small bossfight.<br/><br/>Hope you enjoy this short game. And hope you use this project to create something more fun.
