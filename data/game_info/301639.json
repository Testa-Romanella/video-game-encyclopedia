It may or may not change over time or release as a final product. Purchase only if you are comfortable with the current state of the unfinished game. \r\n\r\nDeep Rock Galactic is a co-op-first sci-fi FPS featuring badass space Dwarves, 100% destructible environments, procedurally-generated caves, and endless hordes of alien monsters.\r\n\r\nHoxxes IV has the highest concentration of valuable minerals ever discovered; however, everything on the planet from the creatures to the fauna is extremely hostile. Good thing Deep Rock Galactic employs the best space miners in the universe: Dwarves! Combining two things Dwarves love most - mining and killing monsters - Hoxxes is the perfect job for any proud, space-faring Dwarf.\r\n\r\n*** 4-player Co-Op ***\r\nWork together as a team to dig, explore, and fight your way through a massive cave system filled with hordes of deadly enemies and valuable resources. You will need to rely on your teammates if you want to survive the most hostile cave systems in the galaxy!\r\n\r\n*** 4 Unique Classes ***\r\nPick the right class for the job. Mow through enemies as the Gunner, scout ahead and light up the caves as the Scout, chew through solid rock as the Driller, or support the team with defensive structures and turrets as the Engineer.\r\n\r\n*** Fully Destructible Environments ***\r\nDestroy everything around you to reach your goal. There is no set path so you can complete your mission your way. Drill straight down to your objective or build an intricate network of paths to explore your surroundings -- the choice is yours. But proceed with caution, you don\u2019t want to stumble into an alien swarm unprepared!\r\n\r\n*** Procedurally Generated Cave Network ***\r\nExplore a network of procedurally generated cave systems filled with enemies to fight and riches to collect. There\u2019s always something new to discover and no two playthroughs are alike.\r\n\r\n*** High-Tech Gadgets and Weapons ***\r\nDwarves know what they need to bring to get the job done. This means the most powerful weapons and the most advanced gadgets around - flamethrowers, gatling guns, portable platform launchers, and much, much more.\r\n\r\n*** Light Your Path ***\r\nThe underground caves are dark and full of terrors. You will need to bring your own lights if you want to illuminate these pitch-black caverns.\r\n\r\nFull details on the latest status of the game, how you can give feedback and report issues can be found at https://www.deeprockgalactic.com/", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-15T02:41:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5be/5be3c912b2afc82c0bd65252a340188f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 443, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Xbox One"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
