Getting the girl won&#39;t be easy though, since most of them are waaay out of your league!<br />\nTo make things worse: you have a few months left before this huge war happens, and the only thing you know is how to milk cows. Good luck cramming years worth of training into four months! If it&#39;s any consolation, you get a medal if you die. \u00af_(\u30c4)_/\u00af<br />\nNo one believes that a lowly squire can save the world while banging \u2013 err, bagging \u2013 the girl of his dreams... but with a shitton of dumb luck, well... you might just prove them wrong!<br />\nWelcome to the world of Love Esquire, and may the fertility god have mercy on your virginity.<br />\nNameable Hero \u2013 Whose name will these girls cry out during those scenes?

Properly time your actions to unleash the full potential of your skills which are simply... out of this world!<br />\nManage your day \u2013 Allocate what little time you have in this world by forcing yourself to socialize or doing your job as a squire barely living on minimum wage.<br />\nGit gud by raising stats \u2013 Stats will have an impact on your skills during combat, and they also affect your relationship with the girls. In other words, shape up to be the ideal man for the best results!<br />\nForge Relationships \u2013 Get to know your waifu on a personal level by being around her and talking about stuff.
