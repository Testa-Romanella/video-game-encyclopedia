It presents players with a sci-fi world, seen only through their deceased character\u2019s memories, and a choice: which of those memories do they take with them into the next life?<br/><br/>In Progeny, you are a clone\u2014the 7th of your line\u2014undergoing the routine process of transferring your progenitor\u2019s memory into your mind. A voice guides you through the process, and a message from your (former) self encourages your ambition. But there\u2019s a hitch: the knowledge from your myriad lives is too much to contain in your finite brain, and with every clone generation, it just gets worse. Review the report of your previous life &amp; choose which of your many memories you wish to take with you before embarking on a new one; the memories you pick will help determine the kind of person you become, leading to new adventures, and thus, new memories.<br/><br/>And then... you do it all again. Immortality isn\u2019t always glamorous, but really, what\u2019s the alternative?<br/><br/>Features:<br/><ul><li>Soothing virtual environments to ease your new-life-transition.<br/></li><li>An unfeeling A.I. to guide you through purgatory<br/></li><li>Branching story arc told over several sessions &amp; playthroughs: Transcend the limits of your death and attempt to carve a multi-generational legacy.<br/></li><li>Secret endings?!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T06:18:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a69/a69b5bf7ce1fa488d78881f02f3080e9.jpg", "website": "http://silverstringmedia.com/progeny", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 101}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Silverstring Media"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Silverstring Media"], "esrb_rating": null}
