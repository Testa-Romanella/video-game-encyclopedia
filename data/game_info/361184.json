Thankfully, your experimental ship is equipped with a UNION drive, which allows you to absorb a single enemy at a time and use their energy\u00a0as a weapon. Be warned, however \u2014 \u00a0this weaponized state renders you immobile,\u00a0\u00a0only lasts a limited time, and leaves\u00a0you vulnerable to attack. Different enemy species provide different types of projectiles, so think fast and choose your targets carefully!</p>\n<p>Artwork by @Willetton, sound design by @Cbasedexplorer and code by @IsaacAzuelos.
