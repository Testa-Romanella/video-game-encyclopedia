Things might get distorted and/or overall, go horribly wrong.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-01T05:25:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/133/1338788f17cd91d6a8783bf91f868e31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["blooperss"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
