Candidates include current Democratic front-runners like Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg, as well as Internet favorites such as Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard. Republican candidates include Donald Trump, George W. Bush and Mitt Romney.<br />\nDon\u2019t like any of the current candidates? No problem, just create your own! Or, if you believe everything is going to hell in a handbasket, play as the Giant Meteor and adopt some truly wild ideologies (ban all video games - they\u2019ll rot your brain!).<br />\nThe Political Machine 2020 features brand new unique ideology trees for candidates, which allows them to play very differently from each other. Throughout the game, you\u2019ll visit Town Halls to gain ideology points that you will be able to spend to own certain issues. For instance, Bernie Sanders has \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 as an issue he can own, while Donald Trump can use points to purchase the \u2018Build the Wall\u2019 issue.<br />\nEach issue is modded on a per-state basis with their voter support based on data in order to allow for an accurate simulation of how those issues will play out in different states. It\u2019s important to win 270 votes in the electoral college, so you\u2019ll need to pay attention to what issues voters care about in the swing states. What plays well in Texas or California might hurt you in Ohio or Florida.<br />\nThe Political Machine 2020 is a complete rewrite of the original versions of the game with vastly improved graphics and a more sophisticated simulation that combines polling data, voter enthusiasm, and the most recent US census results to deliver a game that is both fun to play for casual players, and realistic enough for political wonks.<br />\nDo you think you have what it takes?
