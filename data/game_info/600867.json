You know, the games where you have a paddle in the bottom of the screen and you need to hit a moving ball to break all the colored bricks located in the upper portion of the screen to clear each level? Okay, now imagine the same concept but instead of one single paddle you have to control 4 paddles located at the top, bottom, left, and right sections of the screen, and instead of bricks, you have to break colored asteroids clustered in the center of the screen. Do you think you have Jedi reflects? Then challenge yourself by playing Cosmo Breaker! Get ready for some fast action!<br/></p>\n<p>The main objective in Cosmo Breaker is simple, break all the asteroids on each level by deflecting a meteorite using four UFOs (paddles) controlled by the mouse without letting the meteorite leave the playfield (screen), or else you will lose a life. You will have three lives at the start of each level, if you lose them the current level will restart.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>To unlock the next level you will need to collect three energy spheres on each level that are hidden inside the asteroids.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T12:53:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f3/3f3e7cf86b85e9c1115b0c7de53d9b62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Astral Memories"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
