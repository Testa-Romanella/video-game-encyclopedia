This will provide some kind of replayability.</p>\n<p>- <em>Interactions </em>are done with either pressing Trigger which uses VR Hand position or\u00a0<br/>\u00a0 by holding the Grip and Point with Laser to the object and pressing Trigger<br/>- <em>Laser Colors</em> :\u00a0<br/>\u00a0 A. Red : means you aren't able to interact with the object yet<br/>\u00a0 B. Yellow : means you are too far from the object to interact<br/>\u00a0 C. Green : interaction is possible</p>\n<p>*There are some rare cases where laser interaction wont be possible, you may want<br/>\u00a0to step away from the object and try again pointing on it.</p>\n<p>- <em>UI ONLY INTERACTIONS</em> : some objects, like Electronic Passwords or Locks may be interacted\u00a0 only with the use of Laser Pointer (Hold Grip)</p>\n<p>- <em>Inventory </em>: You may check and inspect items you have collected. The usage of items is<br/>\u00a0 done automatically, also when an item is used it will be removed from inventory.</p>\n<p>- <em>Difficulties </em>: Playing on Easy will not result in a loss, even if time runs out. However<br/>\u00a0 on Normal/Hard you have less time and when time runs out it will result in a loss. Playing\u00a0 on higher levels will provide bigger score bonuses.</p>\n<p>- <em>Saving </em>: Progress is saved ONLY when you Complete a level. This will Unlock next Level and\u00a0\u00a0current level's difficulty.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- <em>Gems </em>: gems will provide (depending on color) score bonuses, thus this item is auto-consumed\u00a0\u00a0and it will not appear on inventory.</p>\n<p>- <em>Statues </em>: same as gems but this time they provide extra Time.</p>\n<p>- <em>Papers/Letters</em> : some papers can be collected, but other will not. Also you may notice that when\u00a0\u00a0you complete a puzzle some papers will dissapear, this is normal as they are no longer needed.</p>\n<p>That's All!
