{"id": 46716, "slug": "gambol", "name": "Gambol", "name_original": "Gambol", "description": "      Gambol is a wall-hopping, ceiling-slapping jaunt of a platformer with straight forward controls, and buttery smooth movement.  You control the Gambol Gumball through a gauntlet of levels designed with flow and rhythm in mind to test your platforming grit.  But don't be too nervous, because along with the slick controls you also have a triple jump that's energy is reset upon touching any (non-lethal) surface, including the ceiling.  Holy cow, that sounds great.  The controls are simple enough that you could play it on a NES controller, with only run, jump, left, right, down-boost, and [REDACTED] to worry about. What's that \u201c[REDACTED]\u201d all about?  Hah, don't think too much about it, it's probably nothing.<br/><br/><br/>      \u201cWhoa!\u201d you say, \u201cthis looks crazy hard, is this one of those games that Poo-Dee-Pah yells at on the YouVideo?\u201d  Nah, it's not too bad, the levels appear a bit tougher than they really are since I had to put in more obstacles to make up for all that sweet, juicy, player agency you have. Oh, and when you inevitably meet your demise at the hands of a spike, laser, bomb, floating-shock-ball-of-hurt, or whatever else, you re-spawn within a couple seconds (or just hit the level-restart button if you're fidgety like me), so it's no biggie if you have to re-run a level a few times before you get the hang of it.  But for all you hardcore platforming buffs out there, I've made a second, harder difficulty with special levels, and normal mode levels with more hazards added.  Oh my!      Inconsequential!  It's probably about candy or jellybeans or some such nonsense.  Honestly, the story is just a vehicle to move the action along, so it's not super important, but I'll work something in there, just you see, and chapter four will shock you!<ul><li><strong>super-smooth Modern Platforming Action!</strong><br/></li><li><strong>A triple jump that's energy is reset upon collision with any non-lethal surface.</strong>  Wowie!<br/></li><li><strong>130+  Levels</strong>, designed to flow in a way so that they can be (fairly) easily speedran once mastered NO AUTOSCROLLERS! !<br/></li><li><strong>Loads of wild hazards to avoid</strong>, or use to your advantage if you're gutsy enough to experiment ('cept for the spikes, those just kill you.

Catch me on the Tweeterverse @ACEJester &lt;3<br/><br/>Q:  What Inspired Gambol?<br/>A:  I love games with wall-jumping, but I haven't found one with the mechanic done how I'd like it do be, so I'm making my own!<br/><br/>Q:  Is that font used at the end of the trailer Comic Sans?  If so, why should I trust you?<br/>A:  The \u201cGambol\u201d text is my own writing, but the text for \u201cFall 2017\u201d and my Twitter handle are in Comic Sans Neue, which is a much more stylish alternative to regular Comic Sans.<br/><br/>Q: It's A Stupid Font<br/>A: You're A Stupid Font.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0af/0af0f11f8ff2456ab9013e93f5e27d8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 127, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["HyperFunk Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["HyperFunk Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
