You fight enemies, explore the map, collect items and manage your\u00a0resources (such as bullets, water, grass, tea).</p>\n<p>There's also an \"energy\" mechanic, you only get 32 steps before running out of\u00a0energy and getting reset to your starting location - so keep an eye out for\u00a0shortcuts, loops and secrets. Drinking tea also refills your energy.</p>\n<p>There are two endings, depending on your actions.</p>\n<p>It's quite short and there's no save feature, so make sure you got about an\u00a0hour to spend with the game.</p>\n<p><strong>The controls:</strong></p>\n<p>arrow keys: move around<br/>CTRL: interact with the menus<br/>hold ESC:\u00a0 exit to main menu<br/>ALT + ENTER: toggle fullscreen</p>\n<p>The game was designed with 16:9 1080p screens in mind, but windowed mode should\u00a0work fine on every monitor.</p>\n<p>Made by (c)2022 Boz\u00f3 Attila Bertold</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/0atis0<br/></p>\n<p>Made with GameMaker Studio 2, which belongs to YoYo Games Ltd.
