Created for families with young children. 100 Spaces to save your own art, with over 50 images included. The attatched screenshots are an example of some inclued puzzles and were made totally in game. Drawing\u00a0 and coloring tools are included. <br/></p>\n<p>This game took me a silly amount of time to make. If you take a look at similar games you will see they typically use straight lines and free clip-art. The game is also on the play store, where it's usually free for a week every month: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DavidAnderson.Dot_to_Dot_MAKER<br/></p>\n<p>There is a bug with the Lock-Line function that I am unable to fix. If you find yourself unable to reselect a line, and clicking on the dots does not work, try saving and exiting the level.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-15T03:37:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ef/2efa76402a239ae1810b5be7f614c7ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thisisBeans"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
