We have over 1,000 cards and more to be added until the official launch. We have balanced and optimized the performance of all cards by collecting hundreds of thousands of AI combat simulation data.\u2018God does not play with dice\u2019 : We wanted to create a game you could win without relying on luck or randomness, a game more reliant on player\u2019s skills than drawing cards. Players can arrange the order of use of up to 15 cards to form the best strategies and tactics for combat.Strategic Deck Configuration : Opening a card pack is always a pleasure, but there may be some cards you do not want right at that moment. Players can return card back into the card pack for another time, and the decks can be edited at any time with the cards obtained.<br/><br/><br/>Playing events with cards : In the game event, every decision you make is essential.  Various situations you encounter during your adventure in Second Second will be played using your cards, giving different results by cards you choose.Importance of choice : Just as important as the player's choice, the character in the game will also have many decisions to make.
