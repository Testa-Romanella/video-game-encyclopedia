The game is about creating a relaxing, peaceful and calm environment where you are able to place trees, stones, rocks, flower beds, ponds and so much more. It is all about creating your own piece of wonderful art. We aspire to create a sandbox game that has the tranquility of a zen garden.<br/></p><p>The development team wanted to create an experience for the casual player that tends to have short play sessions to calm them during stressful hours.</p><p>The team <strong>Grimbird</strong></p><p>We are four university students studying game design at Uppsala University. We started developing this game during a course but now we aspire to make this our first released title. We are two programmers and two artists currently working on this project.
