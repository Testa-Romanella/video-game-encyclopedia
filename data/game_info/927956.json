{"id": 927956, "slug": "mario-royale-deluxe", "name": "Mario Royale Deluxe", "name_original": "Mario Royale Deluxe", "description": "<p>Mario Royale Deluxe\u00a0is a battle royale in which up to 75 players either race to the end of a Super Mario Bros. world or fight to the death in multiple PvP stages!</p>\n<p>(Mario Royale Deluxe is also available in the browser:\u00a0here)</p>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Royale</strong> is the classic Mario Royale gamemode; Players race through worlds 1-8 from the original Super Mario Bros. to see who can reach the end of the worlds first! Second and third place are also awarded a victory, but anyone after that is unfortunately doomed to the lava pit.</p>\n<p>- As opposed to interacting with each other, players interact with the environment. You can break a brick someone is standing on top of, steal an item from someone who really needed it, up to the perfect koopa shell snipe.</p>\n<p>- Things switch up when you pick up the Super Star. In this form other players are vulnerable to you. Run up to anyone cluelessly standing and kill them! Multiple players can also pick up the star at the same time for double the chaos.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Player vs Player</strong>\u00a0grants everyone a Fire Flower and lets them fight to the death to see who the Last Mario Standing is!</p>\n<p>- Like in Royale mode, you can pick up a star to damage anyone. Random person camping in one spot? Pick up a star and kill them for not playing the game!</p>\n<p>- Play in several themed maps; Such as <strong>Super Mario Kart</strong>, <strong>Lineland (Super Paper Mario)</strong>, <strong>Super Mario Bros. 2</strong>, <strong>E3 Mario Maker 2014</strong> and others!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T18:53:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e3/0e36e1048c8cde911f636c4be1d0d7bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["terminalarch"], "genres": ["Racing", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
