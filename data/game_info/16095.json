Of course you haven\u2019t. <br/><br/><strong>Megalo Polis</strong> gives you a taste of the insanity by throwing you onto the political trail, rubbing elbows, overselling scant promises, and engineering scandals to become the next President of the United States of America. <br/><br/>There\u2019s no rest on the campaign trail in this quick-witted RTS. You\u2019ll need to think fast to recognize and seize opportunities to spread your influence\u2026 with maybe just a touch of manipulation.<br/><br/>Any great (white) house sits atop a solid foundation. Build your campaign from the ground up as you identify key states, political allies and amass a loyal group of supporters to spread your word and do your bidding. But that\u2019s only leg one of this political race. To truly achieve greatness, you\u2019ll need to outsmart and outmaneuver your equally hungry rivals.<br/><br/>Budget your time and your wallet as you persuade voters to vote in your favor, by any means necessary. Whether you\u2019re making it rain on impressionable students or spreading seedy gossip, you\u2019ll want to make it clear you deserve to be top dog. Who said political campaigns were clean business?<br/><br/><strong>Do you have what it takes to decide the nation\u2019s future?</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbb/dbbec232ceecda666bf6b0d03ae23748.jpg", "website": "http://megalo-polis.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 370, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Black Sheep studio"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Black Sheep studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
