Hands washed? Clean apron around your waist? Then we're ready to begin!<br/><br/>Let's go to the fridge and get out all the ingredients we're going to need:<br/><br/>That's the butter, flour, an egg, some sugar, a carton of milk and a jug of water - don't get the yoghurt! Your donuts won't cook right if you use yoghurt!<br/><br/>Now, we can't just throw all the ingredients into a bowl and wait for the magic to happen. We have to add them one by one, in the right order, to make our donuts extra special!<br/><br/>First, add your flour to the bowl. Now take that glass of water and pour it on top. That's the way! Next, we tip the sugar in to make it nice and sweet. Are you ready to crack the egg in? Careful you don't get any of the shell in your mix - the egg shell donut has never been very popular! Excellent, just like a real chef! Now let\u2019s get us a slice of butter for our mixture. Okay? good, it's time to get mixing!<br/><br/>What kind of a cook are you?

So difficult to choose! Let's make one of each!<br/><br/>Now you've got your donuts cut, it's time to cook them!<br/><br/>Put them carefully side by side on the baking tray and turn on the stove. The water in the pan needs to be at just the right temperature to cook these donuts to perfection!<br/><br/>When they've turned a beautiful golden brown, it's time to get them out of the pan and back on the baking tray. Don't they look good enough to eat? But wait! They're not ready yet! There's still plenty to do in Make Donut Sweet Cooking Game!<br/><br/>Sure, they're tasty looking now, but we haven't added any flavor yet! And there's so many different flavors to choose from! Kiwi, melon, banana, blueberry, strawberry - it's so difficult to know which one to choose! Better make one of each just to be sure...<br/><br/>First you have to chop your fruit up, you can't just slap a pineapple on top of your donut and say it's done! <br/><br/>Now let's get a bowl and add some water, sugar, milk and a little bit of oil to our chopped-up fruit. Whisk it all up again until it's like a really yummy jam - top chefs don't stick their fingers in the jam and neither can you!<br/><br/>Cover your donut in this yummy jam and make the finishing touches - sprinkles, chocolate hearts, funny faces, candy icing - there's so many extra toppings to choose from to make your donuts look delicious!<br/><br/>And now it's all made, let's choose a gift box to wrap it in.
