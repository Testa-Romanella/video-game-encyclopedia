You can call the opponents bluff about their cards, ending the round. If you called right, you win! But if the opponent was telling the truth then they win the round instead.<br/>If neither player calls the bluff, the face down cards are assumed to be the real thing. <br/><br/>Each defender blocks one Soldier or Archer, while each Wizard blocks one scientist. Any attacking Sheepie that are unblocked steal cakes from the defender.<br/>Players draw back to 4 cards each from the same deck, so pay close attention to what your enemy has played!<br/>After all cards are played, the player with the most cake wins the round!<br/><br/>All matches are best 3 out of 5 rounds. <br/><br/>**A fast and visual rules tutorial is built into the game that you can revisit at any time!**", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T02:13:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/940/940b86bdc1220e044525e3d2d49b7fec.jpg", "website": "http://cakeduel.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Sizigi"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Card"], "publishers": ["Sizigi"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
