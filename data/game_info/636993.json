To find it's vulnerabilities, You're using your only room, randomly arranging boxes, stylized as furniture. Then, controlling a little bug, Your another ingenius machine, You try to reach vent in opposite side of room, while Droid is trying to defend it!<br/>Also,\u00a0your poverty testifies precisely to the fact that the bot does not always work correctly..<br/><br/>RULES, 1st PART:<br/>Place as many objects as possible on the white space given to you - a room, gaining maximum points. Red objects give 1 point, green - 3, blue - 5. Keep in mind that they cannot be placed very close - there should be a small gap between the bodies. take / place the body - lkm, deselect the body - pkm, rotation - wheel (+ shift to slow down)</p>\n<p>RULES, 2nd PART:<br/>WASD - move<br/>Shift + WASD - run<br/>Space - jump<br/>Space (holding in mid-air) - glide<br/>Space (repeatedly, with moving towards wall) - climbing<br/><br/>The main goal is to get to the opposite side of the room. Into vent, to be percise. Bot will try to stop You.

The main reason of our\u00a0participation is practice. We're new to Unity and either game making, so many things were done first time. And of course, far to be perfect.<br/><br/>\u00a0Also, we had different ideas what to make.. so, two different approaches merged into.. this. You'll guess where is wall between them easily)<br/></p>\n<p>p.s.</p>\n<p>was quite fun tho</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T12:50:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddb/ddba69776d7d4da7e6a038ad8bfa5490.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gerrrard", "CyanMARgh"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
