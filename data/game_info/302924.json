Featuring two to three hours of gameplay, the game will take you through several different areas each with their own story, enemies and characters. You control one character as you progress through the different areas. When you encounter characters or objects, you can interact with them and in some cases you can pick up items. <br/><br/><strong>Battles</strong><br/>As you progress through the story, you will encounter various kinds of enemies. When you collide with an enemy on the map, the game will change to another scene where you can see all of your characters and all of the enemies you must fight. Every character and enemy performs an action one at a time. When it is the turn of a character to perform an action, you must select which action to perform and the target for that action. Enemies select their action and target automatically. Once all enemies have been defeated, you are taken back the original map.<br/><br/><strong>Progression</strong><br/>When you defeat enemies in battle, your characters will gain skill points.
