It was fun to make and having constraints really helped speed things along by not having to focus on asset creation or any additional gameplay mechanics.</p><p>The gameplay of Cube Shuffle is simple: Tap either left or right on the screen to move in that direction. Avoid falling lines and try to collect lines of the same color as your cube to score points! Beware, after scoring a point your cube's color will change.</p><p>The game is endless, so try to stay alive as long as you can.</p><p>The game was made using Unity 5.<br/></p><p>I would love to hear your feedback on what you liked and what you thought could have been better, it would be greatly appreciated!</p><p>Thanks for playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/318/3187934e4097d01ecb5046cb8313c999.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["KeyItem"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
