And by the way\u2026 you also have to collect powerups on your way to the end of the level. Collect them all and you will activate the endpoint and be allowed entry to the next level. Powerups are strategically placed throughout the level to challenge your skills!<br/><br/><br/><ul><li> Unique player controls<br/></li><li> Physics-based interactions with the game world<br/></li><li> 200 unique levels<br/></li><li> Variety of obstacles including spikes, saws, hammers and blades<br/></li><li> Use strategy and the laws of gravity to outsmart clever obstacles in this action-packed arcade platform puzzle game!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/579/5792cadaef53e8e52fde468d9902f3e7.jpg", "website": "http://ultimatesolidgame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 53, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["What The Fantastic Games Group"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["What The Fantastic Games Group"], "esrb_rating": null}
