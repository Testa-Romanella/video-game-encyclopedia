{"id": 60396, "slug": "arrowborn", "name": "Arrowborn", "name_original": "Arrowborn", "description": "Arrowborn brings you the fast-paced and visceral action of a multiplayer first-person shooter and combines it with the immersive experience of virtual reality archery. Show your lethal accuracy and clever map tactics as you load your quiver full of deadly magical arrows and lay waste to the competition!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Select from an ever-expanding assortment of magical arrows each with their own unique way of wreaking havoc on your opponents and giving you the advantage. Attach a powerful gem to your armor to increase your survivability or boost your mana pool to fit your playstyle! Spec out defensively and utilize your shield to score points by blocking the incoming barrages!<br/><br/><br/><br/>No teleporting here. Free roam down hallways, then super leap along cliff sides, and bound over buildings all while putting your arrows on target. Get those big point bonuses for sweet mid air shots!  Once you land, feel the true immersion VR brings as you step into cover behind a nearby pillar, wall, or railing. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Sling on your quiver and steady your aim to experience the action-shooter genre from a whole new virtual perspective. Use your aiming skills to outshoot and outmaneuver the competition in a variety of game modes! Drop into a Free-For-All for a 10 player shootout, or team up in Team Deathmatch, just like old school shooters. Add Bots to the game and go Players versus Bots in a few rounds of comp stomp.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Is the raw action too chaotic for you? Try TopShot mode for an accuracy-focused target shooting competition and climb the leaderboard with your sharpened aim.<br/><br/> Available for Arcades on SpringboardVR", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4aa/4aa7fd340eb8d6f6f3dc9e43d8c24e6d.jpg", "website": "http://arrowborn.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 26, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 595, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kung Fu Robots"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Kung Fu Robots"], "esrb_rating": null}
