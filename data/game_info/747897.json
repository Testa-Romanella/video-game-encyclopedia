A place where many crazy characters gather to try and win your heart &lt;3</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>-Created in 15 days for Yandere Jam 2022-</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(If you're a yandere fan, check out my other games :D They all feature at least one yandere character of some sort, haha.)</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br/>This visual novel is an unofficial fandub\u00a0based on the Japanese drama CD series of the same name. Originally aimed at a female audience, each volume features two yandere characters in different scenarios who fight over you, the listener.<br/><br/>Yandere Heaven was one of the first drama CDs I ever listened to, and it wasn't long before I was hooked. I always wanted to make a fandub of the series, but when I heard there was going to be a yandere game jam, and knowing I had very little time to actually create something to submit before the deadline, I decided that now would be the perfect opportunity to not only make an English localised dub of the first volume but also turn it into a visual novel!\u00a0<br/><br/>While I tried to stay as true to the original Japanese script as possible, I did make some small alterations here and there.<br/><br/>The series is pretty old now, but I'd recommend checking out the original version if you can find the CDs anywhere!</strong></p>\n<br/>\n<ul><li><strong>Full English voice acting</strong></li><li><strong>Pick your pronouns (he/him, she/her, they/them are currently available)</strong></li><li><strong>Choose your yandere lovers from either male or female characters</strong></li><li><strong>A bright and bubbly world with comic-style cutaways!</strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong>This game contains:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Swearing</strong></li><li><strong>Threatening behaviour</strong></li><li><strong>Kidnapping &amp; imprisonment</strong></li><li><strong>General yandere shenanigans!</strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Based on the original Japanese drama CD series 'Yandere Heaven'</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Script Localisation &amp; VNification\u00a0by Melancholy Marionette</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Voice Director - Anthony Rodriguez</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Kakeru - Anthony Rodriguez</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Atsushi - Brian Watts</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Kasumi - Falon Echo</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Aoi - Mel Valentine</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Thank you so much to you all for lending your amazing talents to the project ^-^</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(For full credits, please see the credits document inside the game download folder.)</strong></p>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>I'd love to be able to give the remaining volumes in the Yandere Heaven series the same treatment, however, Darling Duality is my current main project, so I can only work on this as a side project.
