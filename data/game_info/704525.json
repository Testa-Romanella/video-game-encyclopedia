This painting tool creates a variety of 3D shapes which are Unity defaults and uses them to paint where and when the user clicks on the screen. This is done by detecting the user input of the location and how many times they are clicking, or whether they are holding the mouse on the screen and following the mouse to where it is dragged. The U.I allows the user to change the shape, as well as the opacity of the 3D prefabs (the opacity stopped working, to be blunt, but this was intended to be the second U.I feature. The code is there for it, but I could not get it to work). The U.I also allows for the user to change the shape, to clear and pause the drawing, as well as has a timer to time usage and a mouse tracker to track mouse coordinates.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The interactive NJIT part contains the clock tower, which has an interactive bell as well as a working clock, a \u201cbuilding\u201d (it is a cube that is supposed to be the campus center) that has a surprise creature that looks a lot like Kirby come out of it, and a skateboard that rolls across the scene. Both apps are navigated to using a main menu and the user can toggle between them, as well back to the menu to change apps or quit the application.\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T14:19:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf3/bf3133678cb5315505943d8b339987a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CodeJirachi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
