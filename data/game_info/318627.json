The game is to smash objects around the house to create certain beats however you want! This game is based off of a background story of one angry salesman who is fed up with his boss. He finally storms off and throw random kitchen items and other house objects\u00a0all around. Afterall, you can only call it a home if it's a stress-relieving place!</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy!\u00a0</p>\n<p>(must have compatible VR gears).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-13T03:44:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b7/7b7050941a7eae130699923c58840275.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["stv369", "VeryBester"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
