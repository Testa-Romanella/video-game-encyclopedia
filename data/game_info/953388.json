A bright, fun-filled city where there are no humans and you should never disobey the police. Don't even think about escaping, because there is no way to. All city exits are blocked off, there are checkpoints everywhere, and you would need to kill your neighbors to get enough magic to build a portal anywhere. That's all a moot point, because why would you want to? Everything is right here. Enjoy our relaxing suburbs where nothing suspicious ever happens...</p>\n\n<p>Made by Me, TheGarlicGamer, Josh Gerendash, and Nafi B</p>\n<p>Made in Unreal Engine 5<br/></p>\n\n<p>Trigger warnings: Cartoon violence/death</p>\n\n<p>Note: This game is not done yet.
