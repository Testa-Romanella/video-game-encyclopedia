{"id": 130771, "slug": "tales-light-souls", "name": "Tales: Light Souls", "name_original": "Tales: Light Souls", "description": "<p>1) Storyline. First of all, Tales: Light Souls is a story. The Girl has to meet various characters, both good and bad ones. In this world, it is meant to save souls of its Denizens lest the black world engulf them. There\u2019s a certain inward meaning in the game that the Girl is about to find out and comprehend. There is much the Girl should learn about the world of the game. She has to grasp the rules of the world to overcome obstacles and make it through.</p>\n<p>2) Gloomy and calm atmosphere. The Girl travels through the evil world.</p>\n<p>3) Gameplay. \u201cTales: Light Souls\u201d gameplay represents a tranquil journey. You have to learn the storyline and get to know the game world. Of course, there will be many risks on your way.</p>\n<p>4) It\u2019s an offbeat and arthouse game. Offbeat, oddish story along with simple graphic style won\u2019t let you get complete understanding without thinking hard. The game features something great. So you should play through very carefully to find answers to all questions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My message to you!</strong></p>\n<p>In this game I want to show my outlook on the world. Through this game I want to tell how good and evil work in this real world of ours. I\u2019m willing to put a certain meaning into this game, the gist that is hard to notice on the surface of it. By playing this game through, I want you to learn something, to obtain something important for yourself. By playing this game through, I want all the good parts of your soul to shine even brighter! That\u2019s the reason I\u2019m developing Tales: Light Souls!</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why I need your opinion, my friends!</p>\n<p>I want you to try an alpha demo version of the game and share your opinion on it. What ideas does the game evoke in you when you play it? What do you like and dislike?</p>\n<p>But first I wish to share my ideas that spur me on to develop this game:</p>\n<ol><li><p>I believe that games are something more than just graphics + text!</p></li><li><p>I believe that a plot can be conveyed by using simpler approaches, and that the meaning which is conveyed by such approaches is more valuable!</p></li><li><p>I believe that graphics are not of paramount importance in video games. Visuals in this game are decided to be so unsophisticated but on purpose, and I didn\u2019t wish to make the game look more stunning as it would probably distract from my message that I hope to bring out to you. I love stunning graphics, we all love it, and it\u2019s quite important, too \u2013 yet I think it is not the main thing in games.</p></li></ol>\n<p>To be more precise, I wish to know your personal opinion on the following issues:</p>\n<ol><li><p>What did you like in this game?</p></li><li><p>What did you dislike in this game?</p></li><li><p>What do you think of the gameplay of the game (and its levels) on the whole?</p></li><li><p>What do you think of the presentation of the plot in the game? Do you like it? Does it awake any thoughts, associations, feelings in you?</p></li><li><p>Do you find it more convenient to add more text into the game, in order to explain what\u2019s going on there?</p></li><li><p>What would you add into the game? What else would you wish to see in it? Say, a bit more gameplay variety? Or more challenging levels? Enemies? Or do you still want me to improve its graphics? Feel free to put down anything that you find necessary, your ideas and requests to the author of the game.</p></li></ol>\n<p>I will certainly read your opinions carefully and I will consider them while developing a demo version, and later, while developing a full final version of the game. I\u2019m not creating this game just for myself, and so I\u2019m eager to learn opinions of those interested in my project and those who do not regard it just as another \u2018ordinary game\u2019. And indeed, it\u2019s not quite an ordinary game, and hence, each of you would accept and understand it in your own way.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m looking forward to hearing your responses!</p>\n<p><strong>Subscribe\u00a0and follow the development:</strong></p>\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/TalesLightSouls</p>\n<p>Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/taleslightsouls/</p>\n<p>Youtube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsrlhIUFXIO4ubDOOOhbrQg</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here'are my social pages:</strong></p>\n<p>My Instagram account:\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/andrewigumnov</p>\n<p>My Twitter account:\u00a0https://twitter.com/AndrewIgumnov</p>\n<p>My Facebook page:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/andrewigumnov42</p>\n<p>My Vk page:\u00a0https://vk.com/amadeus42\u00a0</p>\n<p>My blog (in Russian):\u00a0https://andrewigumnov.livejournal.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc1/dc1a094920d98c8d61dee27664dca25d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Andrew Igumnov"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
