{"id": 20573, "slug": "friendship-club", "name": "Friendship Club", "name_original": "Friendship Club", "description": "Imaginary friends battle for supremacy in the mind of young Timmy Bibble! Play as <strong>Chud</strong> - a beast from the mountains; <strong>Old Man Ricketts</strong> - a prospector driven mad by his lust for gold; <strong>Shakey Jake</strong> - a ninja, bandit, skeleton... thing; and <strong>The Canardinal</strong> - a duck from the Vatican! <br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Friendship Club</strong> is a bullet-hell party-game for PC, Mac &amp; Linux. Pit yourself against your friends (and enemies) in brutal combat with finely-tuned controls, customisable game mechanics and procedurally generated levels in which bullets bounce forever!<br/><br/><strong>Please Note:</strong> since this is a twin stick shooter, a Microsoft Xbox 360\u00ae Controller for Windows\u00ae (or equivalent) is strongly recommended.<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li><strong>LOCAL MULTI-PLAYER MADNESS</strong> - Friendship Club supports up to 8-players locally. Not only that, but you can have any possible configuration of team members, ranging from all-against-all to 2v2, 3v2, 2v4v1v1... whatever you fancy!<br/></li><li><strong>FULLY CUSTOMISABLE GAME MODES</strong> - Choose from a selection of tried and tested game modes, or create your own with the advanced modifiers! Do you want a strategic battle using the level layout to your advantage, or a fast and furious rampage? Friendship Club is designed as a sandbox for the discerning local-multiplayer fan.<br/></li><li><strong>PROCEDURAL LEVEL GENERATION</strong> - With procedurally generated levels and unique content rules for each world, you'll never play the same arena twice!<br/></li><li><strong>ADJUSTABLE GAME SPEEDS</strong> - Battle in super slow-mo, hyper-speed and everything in-between! Become a bullet-time master or a champion of twitch-gameplay.<br/></li><li><strong>A WORLD MADE FROM GIBS</strong> - Nearly everything in Friendship Club is destructible. Charge through tables, chairs, TVs, or surprise a friend by smashing through a wall - just like you've always wanted to!</li></ul><br/><br/><br/><ul><li><strong>NEW WORLDS</strong> - We've got a host of new worlds waiting to be made, each featuring their own new gameplay-warping elements.<br/></li><li><strong>NEW CHARACTERS</strong> - We'll be adding to the current retinue of eccentric imaginary friends with some equally twisted new creations from little Timmy's mind.<br/></li><li><strong>NEW MODIFIERS / NEW MODES</strong> - We're going to gradually add new modifiers and new modes, opening up even more gameplay possibilities. We want to cover game types like Deathmatch and Capture The Flag, but with a Timmy Bibble twist!<br/></li><li><strong>MORE GIBBABLE EVERYTHING</strong> - Just about every new level object we add will be gibbable. Of course.<br/></li><li><strong>SINGLE PLAYER</strong> - We're focussed on trying to make the best local-multiplayer game we possibly can at the moment, but in time we want to expand Friendship Club with a single player mode.<br/></li><li><strong>DESIGNED LEVELS</strong> - Some of the new worlds we're planning on might work best with pre-designed levels (or partly pre-designed), meaning that we'll offer symetical maps for perfectly balanced matches...<br/></li><li><strong>LEVEL EDITOR</strong> - \u2026and of course, there'd be no point making a level editor just for us to use...<br/></li><li><strong>STEAM WORKSHOP INTEGRATION</strong> - \u2026and there'd be no point in you making awesome new levels and modes if you can't share them!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T17:05:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2be/2be8f92ff6a1a8bdd1449332eac7c3a9.jpg", "website": "http://timmybibble.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 34}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 209, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Force Of Habit", "Clockwork Cuckoo"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Force Of Habit"], "esrb_rating": null}
