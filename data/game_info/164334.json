In \"Edge Runner\" you literraly need to run out of space. No like you need to run to the edge of the universe and actually physically run out of space. You get it.</p>\n<p>Anyways, I am super proud with the result of my game this time around. I tried to make a game mechanic as simple as I could and have it fully complete with art, audio, and gameplay. While I wasn't able to get any art put into the game, I feel that the rest of the product is as complete as I would have hoped.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The only thing that didn't work out at the last minute was a short video that is supposed to play at the end. I guess Unity WebGL has some incompatibilities with it. So, if you want the *full* experience, feel free to download the executable of the game. Fortunately the video isn't that important to the overall game and the gimmick at the end still works without it.
