I've long ago giving up the idea of finishing a complete and fun game within the 48 hour limit, as this just seems way too difficult - so instead this time I've concentrated on a genre of game I've never attempted before: a racing game.</p>\n<p>I used a library which I have been building up over the last 7-8 Ludum Dares and this time around I had to write (copy/paste from stack overflow) some new methods for particular collision/response code but I still managed to get a full track generator, track/car physics and a crude A.I. racing around. The challenge is definitely shallow: simply finish the track without exploding.</p>\n<p>As usual, I left too little time to do any decent graphics and I totally neglected soundFX/music (the only music is from Incomputech: of course I disabled the sound rating).</p>\n<p>There is definitely a lot of room to expand on this game in coming weeks: pickups, weapons being the obvious missing components to make this a proper 2d wipeout clone - and better track generation with loops, intersections and jump would be cool. The vehicle physics are quite fun, although there is no real opportunity to use the hand-brake which is a shame.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<p>WASD\u00a0 \u00a0- movement<br/>SPACE\u00a0 - Air-brake<br/>M\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - Toggle music on/off</p><p>***</p><p>* Linux Version</p><p>Please note that although I have uploaded a Linux version of the game, when I tested it the timing functions are messed up (some components are crazy fast while others are too slow). I was using Ubuntu with OpenSDK 1.8.0 - maybe it works for you (I'd love to hear)?\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69c/69caa2ebf2663e60e3dd55489d8a8790.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["LintfordPickle"], "genres": ["Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
