What could you possibly do with so many plates? Why, fight monsters and cook them up of course!</p>\n<p>Monsters come in waves, and each drops its own unique ingredient, and you can do one of 3 different things with these:<br/>1) Prepare them into a dish and then sell that dish for money (score).<br/>2) Prepare them into a dish and eat it.
