If you<strong> leave your touch, mouse button</strong>, he's arms will come back to original position but he will be\u00a0<strong>VERY DISAPPOINTED</strong> and his anger will go up.</p>\n<p>If you grab a food on the conveyor, sir pie-a-lot will eat that food, but keep in mind that he's not a fan of foods other than pies so watch out for his anger.</p>\n<p>All the best!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Programming and Art: Vedang Javdekar</li><li>Music: Eric Matyas</li></ul>\n<p>I hope you will have fun playing this game.\u00a0Let me know what you feel about the game by commenting below.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T02:58:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a12/a12a6d13e3f860d46f55d7410373d3e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Vedang Javdekar"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
