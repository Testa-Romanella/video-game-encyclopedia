READ THIS WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED WITH THE GAME:</p>\n<p>At the ending scene, there's a cutscene where the space capsule falls down to the ground but there's a menu\u00a0 that\u00a0shows up in the front of the scene. I just want to also say that this isn't a bug. It may look like it is but it's not, don't worry about it. Well the number at the bottom left at the ending scene is nothing. don't mention it.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>NOTES:</p>\n<p>when you die in the game, the game will automatically restart the level.</p>\n<p>the number at the bottom left coner is a timer that counts down to 0.
