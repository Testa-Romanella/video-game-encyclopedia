{"id": 965863, "slug": "plebs", "name": "Plebs", "name_original": "Plebs", "description": "Pleb is a casual real-time strategy game that places players in an unexplored land ripe for expansion and conquest. Set in a time with ancient Nations, you are tasked with leading a civilization to prosperity and dominance. The key to victory lies in efficiently gathering resources from the land, expanding your towns, building a diverse army, and outsmarting opponents through cunning tactics.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Resource management is the foundation of Plebs. You must collect various natural resources such as wood, stone, food, and metals, from the surrounding land. Each level offers a unique challenge, exploring the map to establish a steady supply of resources is key. You begin with a small settlement and a limited pool of resources, but with careful planning and strategic decision-making, you can flourish into a formidable empire.<h3>Expand your Settlement</h3>Each building has a unique purpose, be it harvesting natural resources, growing food, expanding your town, refining metals, training soldiers, or expanding your population. As you grow and upgrade your town, new buildings will become available enabling better tools or stronger soldiers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Being a Pleb is tiring work, growing or catching food is a must to ensure your population keeps working at full capacity.<h3>Refine Metals</h3>Tools and weapons can be created with any metal, but providing your workers and soldiers with higher-level metals makes them more effective.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Building a powerful and versatile army is crucial for survival and success. Each unit type has strengths and weaknesses, and careful army composition is vital to counter enemy forces effectively.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-04T03:38:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9e/c9e459ee13f131d77e3c46db17f7db3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 339, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PixelWhipped"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PixelWhipped"], "esrb_rating": null}
