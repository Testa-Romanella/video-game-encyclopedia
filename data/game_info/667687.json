{"id": 667687, "slug": "solys-2", "name": "Solys", "name_original": "Solys", "description": "Solys is a fast-paced multiplayer FPS, where 3 teams of 3 players compete against one another to destroy the other teams' bases.<br/>Each team spawns on their own planet containing a resource generator, a monolith acting as the spawn to be destroyed and a shop.<br/>Players can buy items in the shop with the generated resources, these items include weapons, armor, jetpacks, defenses, ships and building parts.<h3>Spaceships</h3><br/>Ships are essential to access the other teams' planets and to collect resources.<br/>As of now, there are 3 ships in the game being<br/><ul><li>The passenger ship: a one person unarmed ship</li><li>The dropship: a multi crew unarmed ship</li><li>The fighter: a one person armed ship</li></ul><h3>Base building and defenses</h3><br/><br/>To protect their spawn each team must build around it and place defenses. Place high external walls to prevent players without a jetpack from getting in, stairs to have the high ground on your enemy or turrets to blast any enemy in a close radius. There are other building parts such as walls, a vehicule pad, corridors, doors and so on.<h3>Weapons and special items</h3><br/><br/>Maybe you like hiding in the bushes with a powerful sniper rifle. Or you'd rather get to close quarters with your enemy and blast them in the face with a shotgun. Maybe you're an average Joe and enjoy our rifle. Either way these 3 weapons cost quite a bit of resources, you'll probably do your early fights with a pistol. To protect against these weapons, buy armor ! If you want to sneak in other bases or have an element of surprise on your enemy, use the jetpack !<br/>All these tools can be combined and used together in fights, all you need to do is buy them and store them into your inventory.<h3>Other features</h3><br/>Don't like first person view ? Switch to the third person camera. Don't like your character's look ?
