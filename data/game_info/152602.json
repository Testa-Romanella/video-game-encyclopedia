I took an extra hour during the grace period to try to finish some things up and was able to add some much needed checkpoints and a start/end state.  I think the time can be justified as I spent at least that much time facilitating the jam.</p><p>You\u2019ll need Adobe Flash Player to play.</p><p><strong>Tips:</strong></p><p>The game is quite unfinished, and some parts of the level are more difficult than I'd like, so here are some tips to get through.  <em>Minor spoilers ahead!</em></p><p>Traps are vicious. Block them off to get past them. You may have to switch lenses to find extra blocks, or reuse ones you've found before.</p><p>Take your time and look around with the different lenses. Try to anticipate what's coming up, especially around beasts. Be careful though as you're not likely to survive after enraging a beast by using a lens near it.</p><p>If you're having trouble with a beast, keep your lenses off and stick to the shadows.  Usually, making a break for it is not a good option.  Listen for the lower growl when he returns to his home spot and wait a few seconds for him to get there before moving to the next shadow.</p><p>The last beast is really too hard at this point, but it <em>is possible</em> to get past him.  Use the nearest shadows you can.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40e/40e5e08d9d84832768bd647023899fce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["huhwhozat"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
