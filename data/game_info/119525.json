I hate moss, rocks, seaweed, big fish, anything large under my feet. So I tried to make a top-view RPG in a world that is all water.\u00a0<br/><br/>Join Cod and Sunny, two mercenary women, who go on adventures on their ship. Until one day...\u00a0<br/><br/>The creatures that lie below the surface are beginning to emerge.\u00a0<br/><br/>An RPG with procedurally generated stuff, from collectible coins to encounters. Not that it matters, story takes first seat!\u00a0<br/><br/>I worked alone on this, art (not really pixel art, most of the time, due to rushing, mostly oekaki) game design and code. Post mortem here<br/>Please tell me what you think and how I can improve on the experience.\u00a0<br/><br/>Christina Antoinette Neofotistou ( https://twitter.com/castpixel\u00a0)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b57/b572d864e89aa546db0d7bc565f228f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["castpixel"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
