The GGJ entry page can be found here.</strong><br/><br/>You play as the only healthy neuron left of Juan. You have the ability to claim neutral neurons to collect memories but your power comes with a cost, as every time you attempt to capture a neuron, you lose an amount of brain power. You regain a portion of it when you capture a neuron and more so when you capture a rare memory by solving the mazes. As you progress through the game, you begin to uncover various memories. With each collected memory, the more you remember about yourself.<br/><br/><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>Left Click and Drag\u00a0- Connect Neurons/Maze<br/>Esc - Quit Game<br/><br/><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Developers (Links to GGJ Profile)</strong></p>\n<p>c-Ram - Asset Artist, Animations<br/>dyep - Programmer<br/>KathCabs - Project Management, Character and Asset Artist, Story Concept<br/>sulren - AI, Programmer, Original Concept<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Font</strong></p>\n<p>Pixeled\u00a0- OmegaPC777\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>SFX &amp; BGM</strong>\n</p>\n<p>FREE Casual Game SFX Pack\u00a0- Dustyroom\r\n</p>\n<p>Universe\u00a0- Sappheiros (Added a Filter;\u00a0Tempo and Pitch Altered)<br/>LICENSE:\u00a0https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/\r\n</p>\n<p>Sadness came soften slightly\u00a0- Masa Murra<br/>LICENSE:\u00a0https://pixabay.com/service/terms/#license\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T08:33:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66c/66cf17676017b71626f660ca847abc9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dyep-dev", "Sulren\ud83c\udf19", "KathCabsVO"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
