While the game is still in progress, there is still an ending to this game, and a majority of it is done.\u00a0There are several areas in the game in which you will see a very out of place looking yellow caution triangle with WIP written on it. This is to indicate that the specific area or content has not been added in yet, but there are plans to do so.</p>\n<p>Some of the backgrounds also might look a little janky right now.</p>\n<p>I would estimate to have somewhere in the realm of 4-8 hours of content currently, with maybe another 2-4 to be added in future updates.</p>\n<p>Currently, this game is Windows only.</p>\n<p>Controls are bound to keyboard Z, X, Spacebar, Enter, and Arrow Keys, but it also has controller support. There are viewable controls in game.</p>\n<p>You can save and load this game and come back to it later. By default, the savefile will be saved in your Local Appdata. This savefile should be compatible with the full game when it releases, but I cannot 100% guarantee that just yet.</p>\n\n<p>Developed by ChaosComposer, with Art by perplexingPariah, and Music by SparkFist, Anthony Felos, and OneTrueDave.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-16T05:14:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e1/7e1ec361a618a95f974ae58b8044eee4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChaosComposer"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
