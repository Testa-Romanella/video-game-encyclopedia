Align the same number of digits\u00a0as the\u00a0digit itself to make those dominoes disappear.</p>\n\n<p>Written in 2005\u00a0to see if I could get back into writing Z80-assembler\u00a0Spectrum games (after a lot of hassling by a friend!) this is a novel\u00a0take on the Tetris theme where, rather than completing lines of block,\u00a0you have to match digits on dominoes - 2 twos, 3 threes, 4 fours and so\u00a0on - to make them disappear.</p>\n<p>Unlike <strong>Stranded</strong>,\u00a0which was written on an actual Spectrum, Dominetris\u00a0was the first game written on a PC using freeware programs such as\u00a0Crimson Editor, Pasmo, and Spin before finally being tested on my\u00a0original 48K Spectrum (from 1983) and a recently purchased grey +2\u00a0machine.</p>\n<p>Originally\u00a0intended for the Cronosoft \"Cassette 50\" charity compilation\u00a0it never had a loading screen, in order to pack as many games as\u00a0possible on the tape. However an accomplished loading-screen<br/>artist,\u00a0de Vandemar Croup, produced a loading screen for it, and it is that\u00a0screen which is now included with the game.</p>\n\n<p><strong>RetroGamer</strong> -\u00a0\"<em>Dominetris\u00a0is a rather original and interesting\u00a0take on Tetris. The controls are simple, and play is\u00a0thoughtful and\u00a0sometimes fraught</em>\" - 79%</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/137/137d18aab0d7c36cb390167cad150aaa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bob's Stuff"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
