The Order of Sil\u2019ocy and the Brotherhood of R\u2019whin, dwindling factions of a wasted world. You enter the pivotal silo that supports Sil\u2019ocy life, hoping to carve out a better life for your kind.<br/><br/>DOOMBRINGER wears its influences on its sleeve. Exploration, weapon variety and tight movement are emphasised above all else. It\u2019s a chaotic, superlative experience - while very familiar for any AFPS fans.<br/><br/>Episode 1, will be released soon as early access and should whet your appetite for more horde filled labyrinths in future!<h3>Multi-player(free to play):</h3>DOOMBRINGER is like any other multi-player FPS you\u2019ve played, but on growth hormones and steroids. You move faster, the guns hit harder and victory tastes much sweeter.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T03:48:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/811/811ddc52ac26e75b97f4fb557e2b899a.jpg", "website": "http://www.doombringer.eu", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 426, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Anomic Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Anomic Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
