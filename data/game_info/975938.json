She has a prestigious job, she just got her own house, and the fellowship pays her a monthly stipend... Or it did, before it kicked her out for failing her annual review. Alice's only means of getting reinstated is to complete one of the quests she's been given.<br/><br/>With multiple main quests to choose from, it's up to you how Alice goes about getting her job back!<br/><br/><br/>Each of the main quests issued by the Alchemists' Fellowship involves different methods of playing the game. Will you brave the dungeon area and all of its turn-based RPG action to bring the fellowship proof of your prowess? Will you elect to go the farming route and grow mythical crops in your garden? Will you gather the resources you need to expand your home beyond what contemporary craftsmanship allows? Or will you spend your time fishing for a legendary lunker?<br/><br/>No two routes play exactly the same, and you can take on whichever you want\u2014or even all of them at once\u2014while also completing optional quests for a variety of townsfolk.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Multiple Ways to Play</strong><br/>No two main quests play the same. You can enjoy a traditional turn-based RPG or complete quests that involve no combat at all.<br/><br/><strong>Mercenaries for Hire</strong><br/>If you choose to challenge the game's dungeons, you can hire your choice of four mercenaries to go along with you. Each one has her own unique talents, so you can enjoy building a party of two that suits your combat style!<br/><br/><strong>Pacifist Routes</strong><br/>Several of the game's main quests focus on different kinds of gathering, and thus can be completed without ever seeing a battle screen. If you like to relax with a fishing rod or a pickaxe in hand, Alchemist Quest has you covered!<br/><br/><strong>The Tower of Ordeals</strong><br/>For those who love a challenge, there's a gauntlet of brutal post-game battles waiting to test your mettle after the credits roll!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-16T15:10:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85f/85fc762648f08dc9c9839ef6eb30ec6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ShiroKuroSoft"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Kagura Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
