The game demos full PvP 2D shooter-platformer gameplay, that I wanted to develop into a full game if I could partner with an artist.</p>\n<p>You can move, jump, double jump, drop prone, crawl while prone, and shoot semi-automatic bullets. Shooting causes knockback for yourself.</p>\n<p>The two simple placeholder square characters swap sprites effectively between each state, transitioning between movement, prone, crawling, jumping, falling, shooting, being hurt, or dying. This is pretty trivial, but was a cool demo for high school when I was just starting with game development.</p>\n<p>The camera automatically adjusts to the midpoint between the two characters.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T05:48:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f23/f23ff601acd63bc7b4a9057d0756dc6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gunnar Clovis"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
