FootGolf is a hybrid of two of America's favorite sports: Golf and Soccer!<br/><br/>FootGolf follows the same rules as standard golf, but the golf ball is replaced with a soccer ball instead.  The controls are simple, just use your finger and flick the soccer ball into the hole in as few kicks as possible.  Make sure to pay attention to the wind and curve your kicks to avoid hitting any trees!<br/><br/>Every time you finish a round, you earn coins and improve your Career Status based on how well you scored. As your career status improves, so will your kicking power.  You can also use your earned coins to unlock new balls and a fun new course.<br/><br/>Have fun and enjoy!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T12:15:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d64/d64596dc8323652f0025f1a9bde416d7.jpg", "website": "http://grassapper.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Grassapper"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Grassapper"], "esrb_rating": null}
