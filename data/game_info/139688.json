Duncan's games reminded me of KISS games because they were about exploding, playing, and the strange enjoyable slowness of messing around. </p>\n<p>It is also inspired by Jeremy Blake and the Winchester Trilogy. </p>\n<p>Programmed, Composed and Drawn by Diana Poulsen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e57/e57c26f1ed37f977935f7de9ac6199b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["dpoulsen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
