{"id": 4541, "slug": "burgertime-world-tour", "name": "BurgerTime World Tour", "name_original": "BurgerTime World Tour", "description": "Classic arcade games need to evolve with bold ideas to remain relevant.  While influenced by all previous versions of this Data East gem, BurgerTime World Tour elevates retro gaming to the Next-Gen universe. Elemental gameplay and mechanics are kept intact, but the BurgerTime world is transposed onto a much larger canvas.<br/><br/>BurgerTime World Tour takes platforming to a new plateau with a Rotary Environment System, allowing cylindrical 3D levels to rotate around a center axis and the player to build around the circumference. This system ensures that BurgerTime World Tour becomes a \"new classic\" while satisfying the hunger of old-school Burger freaks. <br/><br/>Four-player action and online play add to the chaos and brings your friends into play.  Four themed environments, four bosses and fifty levels of fun assure a ragin' romp and great value.  Download now and check out why everyone is already online and playing.
