Free and open source.<br/>Game is designed for SteamVR using Vive headset + 2 vive wand controllers + 3 additional vive trackers (hip + 2 feet). Other steamvr systems should still work, you may have to remap controls for this app using steam's system.\u00a0<br/>Game involves punching/kicking/hip-bumping targets as they approach you. Targets can only be hit by the appropriate limbs, i.e. hands/feet/hip.<br/>Game has a scoring system and a failure system. To play without failure, enable godmode.<br/>Game has a built in level editor, see below.</p>\n<p>NOTES ON CAUTION:<br/>It is easy to hurt yourself, others, or property while playing this game. Please exercise caution.<br/>You should have sufficient room to swing all of your limbs in every direction. Some levels may require an even larger playspace.</p>\n<p>NOTES ON LICENSE:<br/>This software is Public Domain (CC0). You can do anything with the source files, be it commercial, closed source, anything.
