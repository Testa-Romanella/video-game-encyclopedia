The player will continue to spawn into a death loop.\r\n</li><li>At the apex of the vertical area, there is a turret that is destroying a crucial block. If that block gets destroyed, the player can not move forward.\r\n</li><li>Sometimes when the boss hits you with his arm-hammer, you get ejected out of the map.\r\n</li><li>In the beginning area, the platforms go below the pit, meaning you can ride them down to your death.\r\n</li><li>There is a lower-platform right before the double-bridges that if you fall on it, the distance is too great for you to jump onto the next platform.\r\n</li><li>When the boss slams his hand down, he does 5 damage, but if youre still standing there next to his fist even though hes clearly not attacking, he will do another 5 points of damage\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>K.S. (THEY\u2019RE KNOWN AND SHIPPED WITH THE ERROR CAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE ONLY HAD 7 DAYS :) )\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>The grenades don\u2019t destroy blocks the player is standing on.\r\n</li><li>The boss\u2019s decisions are a bit too quick.\r\n</li><li>Overall, the game isn\u2019t balanced.\r\n</li><li>Enemies just stand there and don\u2019t run at you.\r\n</li><li>Some of the platforms don\u2019t move like the others do, whether it\u2019s up or down or left and right.\r\n</li><li>Visually, the platform behaviors aren\u2019t consistent, meaning, if a platform just drops, others that look like that platform may move left and right and so on.\r\n</li><li>When the player is in prone, she can angle her body up too high or waay too low.\r\n</li><li>Players have a hard time understanding why they need 2 guns.\r\n</li><li>The ice-blocks don\u2019t melt.\r\n</li><li>There are no ice-attacks.\r\n</li><li>The RBG (Random Block Generator) HP is too high.\r\n</li><li>It would be nice if we had a clamber animation when blocks are just out of reach.\r\n</li><li>It would be nice to have a double jump.\r\n</li><li>The SFX are too loud.\r\n</li><li>The fonts don\u2019t look consistent with the branding.\r\n</li><li>There is no real GUI HUD\r\n</li><li>The Gun-Goblins have no eyes.\r\n</li><li>The lighting was not built before shipping.\r\n</li><li>The enemies don\u2019t fall when you shoot out the blocks from under them.\r\n</li><li>When a platform moves down, the jump is truncated.\r\n</li><li>The player spawns facing the camera.\r\n</li><li>The music stacks when dying.\r\n</li><li>Respawning bridge units will not explode again.\r\n</li><li>In the vertical section, there is a platform that just disappears when trying to get the extra-life.\r\n</li><li>You can\u2019t shoot Gunner-Goblins when they are standing right next to you!\r\n</li><li>The turret has no material\r\n</li><li>The turret is not on a block\r\n</li><li>The Gunner-Goblins won\u2019t turn around when the player is behind them.\r\n</li><li>No SFX when hitting the boss.\r\n</li><li>When standing on the \u201cL\u201d Block, you hover and not stand on the lower platform.\r\n</li><li>When fighting the boss and he kills you, you don't get to use your extra-lives.\r\n</li><li>When you defeat the boss, there are explosions, but the audio doesn't fire off with each blast.\r\n</li><li>Player can\u2019t drop down to the platform below.\r\n</li><li>Player is no dash.\r\n</li><li>Player is no melee.\r\n</li><li>The camera is too far underneath the boss. You can\u2019t really see his head.\r\n</li><li>The camera doesn\u2019t lead the player when turning, meaning,the player shouldn't be in the center of the screen but offset to wherever she is facing so that you can see more of what is in front of you.
