Weather added and bird behaviour improved afterwards.<br/></p><p>http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php<br/>Controls :<br/>LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN : Move<br/>C : Action<br/>X + UP/DOWN : Change speed</p>\n<p>For the theme of childhood memories, I chose the cherry tree in my former garden. It produces actually cherries, not cherry blossoms, but I put some because who doesn't love cherry blossoms ?<br/>It's an open-ended game. Shape your tree as you feel like. If you have birds perched in your tree, you have pretty much seen all the content.<br/>Let me know how you did and what you would like to see improved in a future version :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6cf/6cffa6b0e774ae511de06a072dd922fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Casual42"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
