I am glad to present you a prototype game called \"Survive!\" I created it alone in a couple of weeks. In the future, if people like the project, I will work it out more carefully and add a lot of new content to the game! The game is a limited zone where you have to hold out as long as possible and repel the attack of a crowd of zombies.\u00a0Why does the game cost 1 dollar? I need to recoup the cost of developing this game.</p>\n<p>Be sure to leave your review and your opinion regarding the game, and if you liked the game, follow the link to my patreon and vote for my next projects!</p>\n<p>The choice is up to you!</p>\n<strong><em>Attention before buying, please read the following information:</em></strong>\r\nMy patreon - Patreon\r\n<p>For personal questions and other my email - 13371337ddd@gmail.com<br/></p>\n<p>Minimal system requirements for stable operation at 75+ fps\u00a0</p>\n<p>Game only for windows.\u00a0</p>\n<p>GPU - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080</p>\n<p>CPU: Intel Core i5-2400\u00a0</p>\n<p>RAM: 8 GB RAM</p>\n<p>DX: Version 11</p>\n<p>OS: Windows 10 64-bit</p>\n<p>STO: 1.5GB available space</p>\n<p>Not tested on AMD systems!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T11:02:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be5/be50a862763ec6c521b1899a30095071.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 292, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Loki"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
