I'm using game jams to try something new / different to learn new staff. For this gameJam I decidied to make a game in UI system in Unity, and that's why the resolution is really messed up (sorry). I'm still learning, but I really like how the mechanics in the game end up working. And the exit button at the beginning doesn't work for some reason, but the later one does.\u00a0</p><p><strong>How does the game fit in the theme.</strong><br/></p><p>[SPOILER]</p><p>At the beginning of the story, the whole situation there is happening because Ssasia wasn't able to control Earl (player). This later on is expanding when the player doesn't know exactly what to do, and when he can't control the the game like it would be able in a platformer.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>[also the screen sizes\u00a0 is out of control only because I can't fix it :(]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T09:57:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6e/f6e926db1fbe42eee7b4cc4950853b66.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheRzeper"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
