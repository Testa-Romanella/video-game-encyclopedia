The only server involved is a small (python) signalling server to initialise the peer-to-peer connections. The peers then form a mesh network via WebRTC.</p>\n<p>The game state exists only in the clients. When someone starts the game, the game will check if there are already other peers. If there are, it reuests the game state from the peers. If there is no one else yet then it creates a completely new game. Since the game state only exists in the clients, the state simply vanishes once the last person closes the game.<br/></p>\n<p>Each client has authority over itself. When a client wants to pick up a fragment it needs to ask the other peers if this is a valid action. This only succeeds when more than 50% of the peers validate the request. This way the clients dynamically determine authority over individual fragments.</p>\n<p>This is a proof of concept for me, so please don't expect the mesh to be particularly stable. In case of problems try restarting the game.</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>GAMEPLAY &amp; VISUALS<br/><strong>Winston Yallow</strong></p>\n<p>AUDIO<br/><strong>Kenney (CC0 License)</strong></p>\n<p>FONT<br/><strong>Poppins (OFL)</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T07:40:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fd/7fdaa5ab92324f7cd54fc12acc61ad93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Winston"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
