Your objective is to record the highest temperature possible by getting as close to the star (or indeed into the star) as you can. To achieve this objective, you must acquire fuel from asteroids\u00a0using your ships thrusters (which both propel you and mine asteroids).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Along the way, you may modify your ship by purchasing upgrades. However, each upgrade also has its downsides, such as increasing your ships power usage. Care must therefore be taken to choose the right upgrades.</p>\n<p>To help you navigate, you are provided with a minimap, a notification of the current biome you are in, a map of the star system, and a pointer to the Star. You may also use the temperature of your craft to determine whether you are going in the right direction.</p>\n\n\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>W </strong>- Boost Forwards / Shoot Backwards</p>\n<p><strong>S</strong> - Boost Backwards / Shoot Forwards</p>\n<p><strong>TAB</strong> - Open / Close Upgrade Window</p>\n<p><strong>M</strong> - Open / Close Map Window</p>\n<p><strong>ESC</strong> - Pause / UnPause Game</p>\n<p><strong>F11</strong> - Enter / Exit FullScreen</p>\n\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Designed, Developed and Submitted by\u00a0</p>\n<em>Alex the Roaming Maelstrom</em>\n\n<p><strong>Graphical Assets</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Kenney -</strong>\u00a0Sprites, Select UI Elements and Fonts - \u00a0Kenney.nl</p>\n<p><strong>Wenrexa</strong> - Select UI Element -\u00a0wenrexa.itch.io</p>\n<p><strong>Cody \"CodeMan38\" Boisclair</strong> - Fonts -\u00a0fonts.google.com/CodeMan38</p>\n<p><strong>Bonsaiheldin</strong> - Background -\u00a0OpenGameArt.org/bonsaiheldin</p>\n<p><strong>Music</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Brandon Morris (HaelDB)</strong> - Cave Theme, Walk With Me\u00a0(Patience), Story Time, Tragic Ambience -\u00a0OpenGameArt.org/haeldb</p>\n<p><strong>Retro Indie Josh</strong> - The Sun Awoke <em>(Modified by Developer)\u00a0</em>* -\u00a0retroindiejosh.itch.io</p>\n<p><strong>YD</strong> - I Swear I Saw It -\u00a0opengameart.org/yd</p>\n<p><strong>Sound Effects</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Fusehive</strong> - All SFX Excluding Thrusters\u00a0<em>(Modifications by Developer) -\u00a0gamedevmarket.net/fusehive-com</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Kenney</strong> - Thruster Sound Effects\u00a0\u00a0- \u00a0Kenney.nl</p>\n\n\n\n<p>* Full Author Credit</p>\n<p>Contains music \u00a92022 Retro Indie Josh (https://retroindiejosh.itch.io) Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T14:59:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66c/66c80e35122d11d24273aadb61a049b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Roaming Maelstrom"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
