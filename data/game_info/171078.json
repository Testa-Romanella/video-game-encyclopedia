The theme was based on the Cambrian era's flora and fauna, which predates the age of dinosaurs. The game was created by 3 computer science students from the University of Toronto: St.George over a weekend.</p><p>Shale Striker, which adopts its name from the Burgess Shale (home for the referenced creatures), plays as a classic top down arcade adventure with a few unique twists. Depending on the creature's residence on the food chain (for example, apex predators like the anomalocaris), each playable character offers its own challenge.</p><p>The goal is to consume enough of other wandering specimens to collect \"evolution points\". When a sufficient amount has been accumulated, the creature essentially \"evolves\", and transforms into a different creature higher up into the food chain.</p><p>The initial upload, on the 18th of September 2016, is more a demonstration than the final product - the planned difficulties and differences between organisms have been simplified for the sake of presentation and constraints of time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b88/b88249107c0d6a99a1d158b603e720ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BlueGargoyle"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
