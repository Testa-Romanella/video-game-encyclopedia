{"id": 710060, "slug": "possessor-andy", "name": "Possessor (andy)", "name_original": "Possessor (andy)", "description": "<p><strong>!!!IMPORTANT NOTE!!!</strong><br/>There's a shitton of blinking lights and fast-moving bright images in this game. Now I haven't tested this, but I suspect that this might cause issues for folks who are susceptible to that sort of thing. Please be careful.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What's this?<br/></strong><br/>A (super late) entry to the 7dfps jam. A fast-paced shooter with some twists and peculiarities. Inspired by Hotline Miami, Cruelty Squad, F.E.A.R., Unreal Tournament '99, Max Payne 1, Kane and Lynch 2 and CS 1.6 (in that order).<br/></p>\n<p>You are the <strong>POSSESSOR</strong>, and possessing is what you do best. Enthrall your enemies and make them do your bidding and fight for you; or just shoot them with one of 5 available weapons. So many choices, so many decisions await you. Oh, you can shoot people in slow motion too!<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>!!! In the browser version, pressing Escape to free the mouse doesn't work all that great (at least in Firefox). Instead, use [F1] to pause the game and free the mouse. Sorry :( !!!</strong></li><li>[WASD] to move, [Mouse] to look around, [Left Mouse] to shoot, [Right Mouse] to throw weapon away.</li><li>[Shift] to slow down time.</li><li>[F] to interact with highlighted object (pick up weapons, press buttons).</li><li>[Q] to go out of body. When out of body, press [F] to POSSESS the selected enemy. While out of body, press [Q] again to return.</li><li>[R] to enter super-secret and super-shitty third person mode.\r\n</li><li>[Esc] ([F1] in browser version) to pause.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>\n<ul><li>While the browser version is playable, I guess, it's kinda wonky. The game runs much better as a native app.</li><li>This game was made in slightly over a week, total hours around 65 (30 of which happened over the last two days. Yay crunch.)</li><li>The soundtrack can be found HERE.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Extended credits</strong></p>\n<p>Programming, design, art, music and sound design by Andy Kosakovsky (unless otherwise stated) (that's me!).</p>\n<p>The SFX were sourced from samples found on freesound.org. Specifically, samples recorded by these folks: cedarstudios, johanwestling, acidsnowflake, shelbyshark, Daleonfire, FilmmakersManual, NeoSpica, Fission9.<br/></p>\n<p>The game uses some textures from the Tiny Texture Pack by Screaming Brain Studios. It also uses that one green metally-looking texture that I can't remember where I sourced from :( (I <em>think</em> it's CC0 though) If you recognise your texture work in that green metally-looking texture, please let me know and I will properly credit you/take it out, whichever you prefer.</p>\n<p>The following softproducts were used in various stages of production: Godot 3.4 as the engine; Blender, GIMP and Paint.net for graphics; Reaper for music and sound design; TrenchBroom for level design. The game also uses the lovely Qodot plugin by Shifty (to import TrenchBroom maps), and the lovely Palette Filter shader by Fernando Brandt (to filter palettes). <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T08:14:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab2/ab220c8779a8557629badd20a7b63cfb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Andy"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
