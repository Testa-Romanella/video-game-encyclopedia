Click on a different cannon to switch to aiming that cannon. Cannons take time to reload, if their cannon part is fully forwards they are ready to fire.</p>\n<p>There will be pirate ships coming towards your island from the sides of the screen, and they each have 3 health. <strong>AIM AT THE SHIPS WITH YOUR CANNONS</strong> to avoid them reaching the island. When they reach you, they will start shooting your cannons which are destroyed instantly if they are hit. Survive as long as you can!</p>\n<p><strong><em>You will have to be very fast at aiming and then switching cannons to survive!</em></strong></p><p>I have survived for over a minute personally, it is possible.</p>\n\n<p>I ran out of time, but there was a lot of tweaking that needed to be done to this, so it won't be anywhere near as good as it could be, but it should be more or less ok.</p>\n<p>The art is from the pirate pack at https://kenney.nl, partly edited on gimp during the three hour period.</p>\n<p>The music is from a collection of free music that I have.</p>\n<p>Either way, enjoy (if you can), and check out my 3 proper games on my itch.io profile, that were made in a lot more time than three hours :).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T08:30:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/273/273bd3cf085e8ccd258a0bc6dd9bd2bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sense_101"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
