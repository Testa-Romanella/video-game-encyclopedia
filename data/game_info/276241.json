{"id": 276241, "slug": "vansim", "name": "VanSim", "name_original": "VanSim", "description": "<p>I have recently started to convert a van to live in. While doing this I noticed that driving a van is a bit more tricky than I first thought, especially after being so used to driving cars.</p>\n<p>I decided it was ripe for making a game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So I did.</p>\n<p>This is an early free prototype to test out the idea. There is lots of room for expanding on this idea and I would love to explore this game further, so if you like this little taste of what a vansim game could be, let me know!</p>\n<p>The prototype is free to download but if you do worry about how I afford food and want to support a sole indie, you can also choose to pay for it, this will show me you think this could be a full title.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>When I captured the promo video I was listening to the doom soundtrack, I thought it was so funny I left it in. Hope it makes you smile.</p>\n<p><strong>#Vanlife</strong></p>\n<p>If you are interested in the idea of vanlife (buying a van and living in it as an alternative lifestyle), you may be interested in the vlog that me and my lovely girlfriend Sarah produce, documenting our mostly mad but never boring\u00a0life.</p>\r\nOur vlog!\r\n<p><strong>Development</strong></p>\n<p>This game is built on my own technology, written from scratch in c++ and OpenGL. The development of the engine has taken my entire adult life and this is the first year I have started to produce titles with the tech. I hope to eventually release everything to give indie developers a fully indie alternative to the big engines.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f73/f7340dc4f2c55ffbf34d3ee2088c7699.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["yesindiedee"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
