At home, in the boring evening, in the circle of friends, on Friday night with friends at the bar, while unconsciously stealing a prolonged break at work, probably every one of us could have spent those moments playing Dart.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you get bored with the classic version of this game, please browse for its multimedia version- our newest project \"VR Dart Zone\" where well-known darts were transferred to virtual reality.. Challenge with your friends for the title of champion, compete with your computer, adapting the difficulty to your ambition and skills.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOnce you've put your HTC Vive goggles on, our simulation will take you to the stylized American saloon bar.
