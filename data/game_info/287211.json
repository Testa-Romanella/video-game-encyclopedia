Feedback on these mechanics would be very much appreciated as it will help us to further develop this project and understand what players want.</p>\n<p>These time mechanics are built upon a top down, fast paced shooter. These mechanics are primarily in place as more of a test bed for the time mechanics systems and so are very basic but hopefully enjoyable enough for this test, feedback on these mechanics are very welcome also.</p>\n<p>All feedback is welcome and we hope you enjoy what we have so far and look forward to hearing about your suggestions to improve the game design in our further development.</p>\n<p>Change Log - 23/01/19:<br/></p>\n<p>- Bottom walls now fade out as the player approaches for visibility</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-25T04:30:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/907/907b579672e17f4c8c4349250cef23b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EscapeFromTimeTower"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
