I still remember\u00a0Asbj\u00f8rn Thirslund saying that If you want to make a clone Just make it in your now style, don't hesitate, So I decided to give my own twist to classic Asteroids game and took a lot of stuff from his Sugar Warrior game. My main Intention was to make a clone using BlackThronProd's art style that I always wanted to replicate in some game. This is a game where my dream of making my own style of clone and using BTP's art style came true. I would like to thank\u00a0Asbj\u00f8rn Thirslund and Noa Calice\u00a0again for inspiring me to make such a game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T03:15:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cca/cca28da9b5ef73ed13d00f4eb12b224d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Phani Srikar"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
