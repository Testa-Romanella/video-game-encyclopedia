Now it's your duty to capture them all with your grimoire using your four basic elemental spells (water, fire, plant, air). You have to destroy the shields with the correct spell and then stun them to be able to capture them.</p>\n<p>This game was made mostly by first semester Game Design Students of the School4Games in Berlin.
