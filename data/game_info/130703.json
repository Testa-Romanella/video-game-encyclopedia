Each level has a key and a safe. But they may not match. So, you should try safes from another level. Along the way, there are locked doors which will only open after you answer a Maths question. Don't worry they're easy. And after opening all the safes, you will win the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everything except art was made by me and between Feb 9 - 12. The free player sprite was downloaded from\u00a0bevouliin.com/opengameart.org\u00a0and the free\u00a0background and game tiles were downloaded from\u00a0www.gameart2d.com.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5bc/5bcf922c1494747f753a491e9b6d80a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Shree56"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
