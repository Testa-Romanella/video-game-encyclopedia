I like rougelike very much. I often think that if an adventure story can be combined with rougelike, our protagonist will feel like God is throwing dice.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo the ending of the game and the easter eggs that can be triggered are quite a lot (the kind that racked my brains).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAll you need to play this game is a single-click mouse, you'll know where to click, make a choice and just click.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe're really looking forward to someone discovering all the endings and easter eggs in this game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThanks to everyone who would like to experience our first family product.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T05:18:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ac/4acd4701b027b3cff5727fee3a28cb7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["u_twinkle_star"], "genres": ["RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["u_twinkle_star"], "esrb_rating": null}
