{"id": 475534, "slug": "scallywag-showdown", "name": "Scallywag Showdown", "name_original": "Scallywag Showdown", "description": "<p>Scallywag Showdown is a 2-4 player party game where each player must shoot each other off the ship wreck, however, the more rounds you play the more the odds may stack against you. Ghosts of dead players can still haunt and push you off the ship wreck and other players can give you debuffs through special cannon balls.</p>\n<p>This project is a prototype made by a\u00a0group of 2nd year students studying\u00a0<strong>Bachelor of Software Engineering\u00a0</strong>and\u00a0<strong>Bachelor of Creative Technologies\u00a0</strong>under\u00a0<strong>Media Design School, New Zealand</strong>.</p>\n<p>This prototype is the second we've done as a group. If you're interested in looking at our previous prototype before Scallywag Showdown Click Here. For each prototype we're only given 1 week to create so bugs, errors and issues are inevitable.<br/><br/>All players need a controller in order to play the game. Mouse is used to Navigate Through The Main Menu!</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLLER CONTROLS<br/>\n</strong>\u00a0 \u00a0<strong>-</strong>\u00a0 Right Joystick To Aim<br/>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0<strong>-</strong>\u00a0 Left Joystick To Move<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0<strong>-</strong>\u00a0 Right Bumper To Shoot<br/>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0<strong>-</strong>\u00a0 Left Bumper To Use Special Cannon Ability<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0<strong>-</strong>\u00a0 A Button To Jump or Join The Game<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0<strong>-</strong>\u00a0 A.
