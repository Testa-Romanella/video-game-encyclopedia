You play as Tina, a cat trying to catch a bus that unfortunately is taking an unusually long time to arrive. To make matters worse, a big storm is brewing! With no true shelter nearby and only an umbrella to take cover with, how long are you able to delay the inevitable before getting soaked out?</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Move:</strong> WASD or Arrow Keys</p>\n<p><strong>Toggle Umbrella Position:</strong> Space Bar, Z, or X</p>\n<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>\n<p>- Deflect droplets to delay the storm. If a droplet hits the ground, the precipitation meter will fill up faster.</p>\n<p>- Waterfalls cannot be blocked by any means. They have to be avoided.<br/></p>\n<p>- After certain point thresholds, a sunflower seed will appear. Get it to the pot and something good will happen!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T09:53:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70b/70b90a7da2bd5686c015f0b2597ee3a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cruise Elroy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
