It was released for the Nintendo 64 video game console in August 1997. The game features a single-player campaign in which players assume the role of British Secret Intelligence Service agent James Bond as he fights to prevent a criminal syndicate from using a satellite weapon against London to cause a global financial meltdown. The game includes a split-screen multiplayer mode in which two, three, or four players can compete in different types of deathmatch games.<br />\nGoldenEye 007 was developed over a period of two and a half years by an inexperienced team led by Martin Hollis, who had previously worked on the coin-op version of Killer Instinct. It was partially conceived as an on-rails shooter inspired by Sega&#39;s Virtua Cop, before being redesigned as a free-roaming shooter. The game was highly acclaimed by the gaming media and sold over eight million copies worldwide, making it the third-best-selling Nintendo 64 game. It received the BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Games Award and four awards from the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences.<br />\nRetrospectively, GoldenEye 007 is considered an important game in the history of first-person shooters for demonstrating the viability of game consoles as platforms for the genre, and for signalling a transition from the then-standard Doom-like approach to a more realistic style. It pioneered features such as atmospheric single-player missions, stealth elements, and a console multiplayer deathmatch mode. The game is frequently cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. A spiritual successor, Perfect Dark, was released in 2000, while a reimagining of the game, also titled GoldenEye 007, was released in 2010.</p>", "metacritic": 96, "released": "1997-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-12T12:44:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/5a1/5a145fe3002fc988140f7f00edcb9715.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.37, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 29, "owned": 104, "beaten": 166, "toplay": 40, "dropped": 79, "playing": 6}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 193, "suggestions_count": 258, "game_series_count": 21, "reviews_count": 196, "platforms": ["Nintendo 64"], "developers": ["Rare"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
