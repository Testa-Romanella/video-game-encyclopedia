Game runs better in Edge though perhaps\u00a0not perfect. I've uploaded Windows and Linux executables which should perform better.</p><p>Feel free to leave feedback and suggestions on what you do or don't like or if you think something could be done better or added. I may release a post jam version with increased resolution and other changes.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>STORY</strong></p>\n<p>The humans have screwed up the Earth and are now looking for other planets to inhabit. One of these planets happens to be yours. Defend it against the kamikaze drones sent by the human invaders.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In arcade mode the player moves to the right automatically. In easy mode the player can choose if and when to move to the right.</p>\n<p>Other than the enemy drones you also have to watch your energy which is displayed by a yellow bar at the top. If the energy reaches zero the lever is restarted. Collect yellow energy balls sometimes left behind destroyed drones to replenish it.</p>\n<p>If you get hit your shield goes down. One more hit and the level is restarted. To restore the shield use the tractor beam to pickup two blue energy balls.</p>\n<p>The counter in the top left displays how many more enemies you have to take down to win.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>Movement: Arrow keys</p>\n<p>Attack: X</p>\n<p>Tractor Beam: Z<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p>Maybe with Godot by Benjamin MD.</p>\n\n<p>FONTS:</p>\n<p>Pixeltype</p>\n<p>Author: TheJman0205</p>\n\n<p>7segment</p>\n<p>Author: Benjamin MD</p>\n\n<p>AUDIO:</p>\n<p>Beam</p>\n<p>Author: Deatlev</p>\n<p>License: Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p>URL: https://freesound.org/people/Deatlev/sounds/254942/</p>\n\n<p>The Essential Retro Video Game Sound Effects Collection [512 sounds]</p>\n<p>Author: SubspaceAudio</p>\n<p>License: CC0</p>\n<p>URL: https://opengameart.org/content/512-sound-effects-8-bit-style</p>\n\n<p>Grey Sector (8-Bit)</p>\n<p>Author: FoxSynergy</p>\n<p>License: CC-BY 3.0</p>\n<p>URL: https://opengameart.org/content/grey-sector-8-bit</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-20T00:12:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/073/073c32f231a846165318d1c87fb10915.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["dabski"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
