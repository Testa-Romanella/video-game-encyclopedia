Whether you built a new item, an avatar or a world, or made modifications to an existing one, everything can be persisted with a single click of a button. You can efficiently store multiple copies as well - our deduplication system will ensure that any shared assets only get counted once<br/></li><li> <strong>Development tools</strong> - our development tools range from simple brushes and procedural meshes to more advanced and powerful ones, similar to ones you find in classical game development tools - except that you can use them in VR with real time collaboration!<br/></li><li> <strong>Cross-world synchronization and persistence</strong> - with our integrated cloud tools, you can easily preserve user data between sessions or synchronize state across multiple different worlds<br/></li><li> <strong>Import 3D models</strong> - thanks to open source libraries, it's extremely easy to bring in large variety of 3D model formats - simply drag and drop your FBX, OBJ, GLB or other files and bring them in<br/></li><li> <strong>Texture/Audio/Model processing</strong> - need to make a quick edit to a texture, audio file or 3D mesh? Basic editing functions are fully accessible in-game - from hue-shifting textures, normalizing and clipping audio to recalculating normals and tangents on meshes or baking them<br/></li><li> <strong>Export content for external tools</strong> - as easy as it is to bring content in, it's just as easy to take it out! With this, you can make edits using external tools or make Resonite part of your workflow</li></ul><h3>Code and develop</h3><br/><br/><ul><li> <strong>ProtoFlux</strong> - ProtoFlux is the crown jewel of our creative tools - the most powerful visual programming language that our experienced team has designed to date, which lets you quickly prototype and build anything from simple interactions to complex games and systems - with full real-time collaboration support and immediate feedback<br/></li><li> <strong>Script anything</strong> - ProtoFlux can interact with anything - the world, the items, your avatar and any combinations of these!<br/></li><li> <strong>Websockets</strong> - thanks to built-in websocket support, you can easily communicate with external applications and scripts and build extensive functionality, such as your own game servers, fetching external data to integrating new and custom hardware, without having to depend on official integration<br/></li><li> <strong>Async Flows</strong> - creating code that needs to yield or wait across different frames is a native feature of ProtoFlux, with full execution scope preservation - you can even have multiple async flows running off the same code, each with their own unique context, which is a highly powerful and flexible tool for simplifying your logic<br/></li><li> <strong>Flexible storage system</strong> - locals, stores and data model - pick where you store your computational data depending on the desired scope and context, to build highly efficient systems</li></ul><h3>Resonate with anything, anyone, anywhere...</h3>We are a team of passionate developers, who are developing more than just a piece of software, but something that we call a second home.
