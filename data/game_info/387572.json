Each ship is an homage to a franchise or play style from shooter history. This way, you learn to build four different styles of gameplay under one umbrella. I really hope you enjoy this one level demo. I've worked really hard on it! Please send positive feedback and/or constructive criticism. If you encounter any bugs or crashes, please let me know so I can fix them. Thank you and enjoy! Current build is Windows only. My apologies to anybody left out.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T04:13:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd1/bd1648984ace8c4a55c3f39e313d2e10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Retro Cemetery"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
