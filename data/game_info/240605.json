Playing this game will challenge and improve all of these.<br/><br/>Each game begins by presenting you with a random collection of zodiac signs. After 10 seconds, the signs are covered, and you have to touch where each one is located when its prompt appears.<br/><br/>The game has 5 levels. The lowest level displays 3 zodiac signs, and the highest displays all 12. To move to the next level, you have to uncover each sign without making any mistakes.<br/><br/>For each level, the game keeps track of how many attempts you have made so far.<br/><br/>Don't get discouraged! Your scores in this game will improve with practice. Still, you are unlikely to complete the highest level, no matter how long you try. Very few people are able to memorise 12 symbols in only 10 seconds.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:15:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd3/dd3e8d2001e5e4233d5ab2361d9d7f0d.jpg", "website": "http://www.hatzicware.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Hatzic Intellectual Software"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["D.
