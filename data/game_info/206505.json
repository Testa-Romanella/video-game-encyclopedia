Everything changes when you find a ticket to the expo ROBO-Assemblage! Make your way there as early as possible, but maybe take the opportunity to get some upgrades on the way?</p>\n<p>Beware: Your power core can't be upgraded, so each upgrade will take its toll on the HEAT-meter. Hopefully you can keep it together and show some SWAG at the EXPO!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9fb/9fb57b1ce0878dd5b31e5987a6c3c3d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GettingRekt"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
