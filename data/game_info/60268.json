With the unique dual protagonist system, play as George the rancher and build up your ranch, or hand control over to Erin the female mercenary to explore challenging dungeons and difficult bosses. But be careful: the dungeons are full of dangerous creatures out to get her!<br/><br/>You start the game drowning in debt, a disgraced noble in a world of aristocracy and privilege. Will you charm your way back into the upper class? Will your heart reach out to those who struggle to even survive? Or will you disregard this all, and become a titan of industry by creating through competitions and training the most famous and capable Chichi ever?<br/><br/>Although Chichi appear human-like, they are primarily kept for their milk production. Chichi owners can, for a fee, compete on a national level at Chichi Competitions. There, they send their Chichi to compete in beauty, skill, and talent. Those who do well are rewarded with prizes and fame. But more important than prizes is rank. A higher rank is a great honor for a Chichi trainer, and the highest ranked Chichi can produce the ultra valuable Mega Milk.<br/><br/>Can you, through diligence, energy, and a sparkle of fate, capture your favorite girl's heart and find wealth and fame?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>GeorgeOur heroic protagonist and the victim of outrageous misfortune.
