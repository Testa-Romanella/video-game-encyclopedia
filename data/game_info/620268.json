You control a damaged and lost probe trying to collect resources, rebuild itself, and ultimately resume communications with Earth.</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>Use WASD to rotate and move. Click on an asteroid to explode it. Collect the resulting ores. You can explore a massive open space-themed world. Collect hidden \"module bases\" and combine them with resources in the crafting menu (accessed via the space station you spawn next to) to build modules.\u00a0Don't run out of fuel! There are four asteroid types: Copper, Aluminum, Lead, and coal. The first three are used to craft--coal refills fuel. Each module crafted gives a small (or large) advantage, making it easier to complete the game.</p>\r\nStory\r\n<p>A space probe is launched from Earth. Its journey is going well... until a speck of space dust demolishes five critical modules on the probe. The probe loses its rock analyser, communications, cameras, navigation module, and magnets. The probe must find its way around, locate the bases of the modules, and combine them with ores collected from asteroids to rebuild itself and continue its journey.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Game design:</p>\n<p>flying zucchini</p>\n<p>Game programming:</p>\n<p>flesheatindragon</p>\n<p>Art:</p>\n<p>flesheatindragon</p>\n<p>Music:</p>\n<p>flesheatindragon (tracks 1 &amp; 2)</p>\n<p>bob1o1 (track 3)</p>\n<p>Sound effects:</p>\n<p>ZapSplat.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T18:10:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4a/b4a129a34077da68517733a1a0c95c8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Future Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
