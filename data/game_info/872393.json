Short but hopefully sweet game paying homage to the art gallery \"Underdogs\" in Lisbon.<br/></p>\n<p>Computer Keyboard is Z, X, Enter, Shift and direction buttons. Or you will get an interface on your phone. A, B, buttons, D-pad, select and start on the console (when you can download it).</p>\n<p>This game was inspired by my local gallery which is called Underdogs. Underdogs is a cultural platform based in Lisbon, Portugal. It represents many graffiti artists who have crossed over into the fine arts. Vhils is one of the founders of the gallery.<br/></p>\n<p>Underdogs is also down the road from where I live. Over the years I have met many interesting artists there such as Shepard Fairey and Norman Cook\u00a0(actually a musician aka Fatboy\u00a0Slim).\u00a0The gallery\u00a0has\u00a0a public\u00a0art\u00a0programme.\u00a0Our\u00a0neighbourhood\u00a0and\u00a0Lisbon at\u00a0large\u00a0has\u00a0been\u00a0made\u00a0more\u00a0visually\u00a0interesting with\u00a0murals\u00a0from\u00a0this programme. <br/></p>\n<p>If you are ever in Lisbon, certainly see whats on at the gallery and make a visit.</p>\n<p>This game is made for the Game Boy and should play on DMG-01, pocket, colour and GB Advance.
