They shoot continuously on their own.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0To hit the Orange or Purple shell, you need to collect the respective PowerUp.</p>\n<p>2. The Red level in the Right-Pane indicates the Health of your vehicle. If you have undamaged health, your vehicle can freely move in the entire area of the screen without continuous throttle. However, once your health starts depleting, throttle of your vehicle degrades and you have to continuously use your throttle to keep the vehicle up and running. If you fail to do so, your health depletes further. Remember, lesser the health, more harder you have to throttle the vehicle everytime.</p>\n<p>Health is downgraded if your vehicle hits any of the shells coming your way, and also if your vehicle is not able to remain in the flying zone!</p>\n<p>3. When you are able to get two different colored PowerUps consecutively, you unlock a new power to penetrate any shell within your flying zone, including the otherwise impenetrable Purple shell! Also, you can instantly revive your health by collecting special Red PowerUp!</p>\n<p>Theme of the Game is supposed to be Confusion, so figure out the rest of the ingenuities of the Game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T08:53:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/342/342d75889db23091bbc29c62032865d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Teams24"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
