You work in a government office, where your job is to sort paperwork into \"male\" and \"female\" - all day, every day. Now get to work.</p>\n<p>Click and drag objects into one of the tubes to sort them. Press Esc to bring up the pause menu.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was a collaboration between a group of queer friends. We started working on it in Spring 2021, inspired by (although not an entry to) the Search for the First Cisgender Protagonist game jam. After a long break, we finished it off in Spring 2022.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Initial concept: Dylan Jaide White</li><li>Writing: Coriander, Dylan Jaide White, Kaz Nuckowski, Rat Council</li><li>Art: Coriander, Kaz Nuckowski</li><li>Music: 'Flutey Jazz' by Kevin MacLeod (CC BY 3.0)</li><li>Sound effects:\u00a0Freesound.org (CC0)</li><li>Sound design:\u00a0Dylan Jaide White, Kaz Nuckowski, Rat Council</li><li>Programming: Dylan Jaide White</li></ul>\n<p>Special thanks to Evelyn, Klara, and Morgan for playtesting the game &amp; providing suggestions!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T18:32:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/643/6434b37bd014e630e945debc843d6e73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ChatChocolat", "Kaz", "dylanjaide", "GayDylan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
