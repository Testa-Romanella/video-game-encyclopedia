{"id": 751935, "slug": "switch-or-not", "name": "SWITCH or NOT?", "name_original": "SWITCH or NOT?", "description": "<p>Game \u00abSWITCH or NOT?  - logical problems of logic and deduction &quot;is designed to inform about the logical elements (gate) and the principle of work. All logical tasks are constructed in such a way that gradually, increasing complexity, get acquainted with the world of logic of the computer. The idea is to change the information flows to activate the last element. Logic elements are included if the logic condition is met. What type? It all depends on the type of logic element. If the element is on, it will emit a signal, which in turn goes to the input of the next gate, enabling or disabling it. Logic elements come with one or multiple inputs and always with only one output. A single-input gate is NOT. If there is no signal at the input , then it turns on, but if you just give it a signal, it will turn off immediately. In the game there are elements with two inputs: &quot;AND&quot;, &quot;OR&quot;, &quot;Exclusive OR&quot;. &quot;AND&quot; (square) is activated if signals are input to BOTH of its input, throughout  In other cases, it is off.  &quot;OR&quot; (triangle) is included if at least one of its inputs has a sign.  &quot;Exclusive OR&quot; (rhombus) is included if only one input has a signal.  All these elements are connected in the same chain.  Input signals are controlled by switches.  The puzzles in the game are divided into 2 types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In the first one, you need the information flow to reach the endpoint and it needs to be done for a certain number of switching operations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The second type of task is a tower defense type.  You for a limited time, when changing information flows, you need to achieve the inclusion of tower defense.  Your defenders - tower protection will be needed from the aliens.  The attack will be a spaceship known to the game space invaders.  At the same time, it is impossible to include all the defense towers, we will have to solve the logical tasks directly on the battlefield to redistribute the necessary flank combat power.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Game Features \u00abSWITCH or NOT?  - logical problems of logic and deduction&quot;:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>94 logic tasks designed to develop your thinking, memory, intelligence</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>of them 71 puzzles for adults, which you can think about for a long time</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>23 tasks in the logic tower defense genre, which need not only the mind, but also speed and intelligence</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sleek and minimalist design, intuitive operation</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>addictive gameplay where each brainstorming ends with a cry - eureka!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the game is suitable for children and adults, everyone will have something to think about</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ingenious riddle with many solutions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ideal for people who love intellectual games</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you like riddles and smart logic games for free or you need brain training and memory development, if the words intellect, memory, logic and deduction are not an empty sentence for you then this game is for you.
