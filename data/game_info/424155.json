You can keep an eye on that to see how much potential dmg you'll do when you punch (changes as you move and momentum changes).</p>\n<p>Going below 33% stamina you can't block and dif low enough you can't attack. Jab has less stamina requirements than hooks but deal less dmg.</p>\n\n<p>Damage:</p>\n<p>Dmg is based on your movement vs the opponents (you moving into your punch is better than standing still, even better is if the enemy moves into it as well), the amount of you have vs the stamina the enemy has (you having more vs enemy having less is best), and the base dmg of the punch.</p>\n<p>Bad punch example: Stepping backwards, with little stamina and punch opponent = low dmg</p>\n<p>Good punch example: Dashing forward just before punching either after blocking an opponent or as they step forward = very high dmg</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T02:50:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d6/3d62c924e9f1680599b802a1ae975170.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["AaronMakesGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
