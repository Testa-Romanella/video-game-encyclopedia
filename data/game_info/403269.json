It was an exploratory piece that was created in response to a discussion of the role of choice in games. With it, I have tried to evoke a certain contemplative experience, asking the player to be swept away into this fairy tale and pay close attention to the choices they make. It is intended to be played multiple times, to compare outcomes.</p>\n<p>A Figure Met in a Shaded Wood was made in Twine, incorporating some JavaScript and CSS. The font used in this game is Caudex.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-10T02:57:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/732/732dc8ca79b41179a3216895fa9d86ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["incobalt"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
