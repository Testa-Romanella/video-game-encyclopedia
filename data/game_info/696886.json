Where you have to jump up platforms to get to the treasure chest. The pattern of the Platform is procedural generated. I hope you will enjoy your small journey and maybe even relax a little.</p>\n<p>The game is really short. Developing the game was a small Test for me, what I can do in 12 hours of developing time. There are a few features which I could add in the future, but I don't know if I will add them.
