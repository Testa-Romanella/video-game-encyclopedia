Theme: Offline</p>\n<p>Also submitted on\u00a0PROCJAM.</p>\n<p>A bullet hell game about a hermit disrupting telecommunication system antennas.</p>\n<p>Destroy drones with the energy you accumulate on your Tin Foil Hat, collect 10 scraps to build faraday cages around each antenna and get 'em all offline!</p>\n<p>All art work was done pixel by pixel using a text-editor, mapping each character to a color. Some tile details and animations are generated randomly.</p>\n<p>The look and feel and play experience where inspired by games like Nuclear Throne and Battle City, with arcade elements.</p>\n<p>It's the first full game I have ever made. It was fun to learn lots of new stuff. If I had more time and game-size, I would do:</p>\n<ul><li>Special attack and defence, like \"dash\" and \"blast all enemies\"</li><li>More story details</li><li>Other types of terrains</li><li>Better auto adjust screen size (tried simple things, but it was interfering on the mouse aim)</li><li>Music</li><li>Multiplayer</li><li>More feedbacks, like when you take damage</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab1/ab1a9c1541b3963d1043369095ac1143.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["arturaugusto"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
