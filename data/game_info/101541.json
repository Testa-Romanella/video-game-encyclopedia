Listen to the clues they give to throw together the perfect potion.

After talking to the customer, you can try again.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Controls: WASD and Mouse. Click to talk to a customer, select ingredients, and use the cauldron.</p>\n<p>Each potion takes 1 base and 2 ingredients, just pick them out, put them in the cauldron, then talk to the customer! When you get it right, they'll leave a little decoration for your shop!</p>\n<p>This is my first attempt making a game in unity!
