We had six weeks to attempt to replicate PikuNiku, which was made by Arnaud De Bock,\u00a0R\u00e9mi Forcadell, and\u00a0Alan Zucconi and\u00a0published by\u00a0Devolver Studios.\u00a0It includes the town scene and six different building scenes that the player can move in and out of. There are npcs all over the town that you can talk and interact with as well. Cloning the game included recreating the unique movement for the player character, Piku, making the NPC dialogue and movement system, replicating the visuals, and more.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T18:04:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ee/9eea1cf4cc931efb22e10b5af0d89093.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jhdoubler"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
