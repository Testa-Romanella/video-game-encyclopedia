The twist is that the marble gets damaged if it hits things too fast or gets crushed by a heavier object.\u00a0 Try to get a better grade by solving the levels without taking damage!<br/></p>\n<p>This game\u00a0was made in 9 days for the LTGD: Let's Talk Game Jam 2022. The theme of the jam was to make a game with the acronym LTGD. We thought the title Little Things Get Damaged was cute and gave a lot of room for a poetic interpretation. What if the small things to protect\u00a0were precious emotions that one risks losing as they age? What if life was represented with a maze?<br/></p>\n<p>------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Game Engine: Unity 2021.3.1f1</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>Code &amp; Game Design by\u00a0Namida Sai</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by\u00a0ComfieDev</em></p>\n<p><em>Music: Gnossiennes by Erik Satie</em></p>\n<p><em>SFX: Impact Sounds by Kenney<br/></em></p>\n\n\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T09:52:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/185/185e160628c4e417a4bf9fa39123f0dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Namida Sai", "ComfieDev"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
