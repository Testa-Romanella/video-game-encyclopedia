The goal is to make a path from I to II in the same color tiles.</p>\n<p>Neutral tile, they can be part of either a yellow or pink path, but they cannot be moved.<br/></p>\n<p>Wheelbarrow, they can be pushed back and forth but not turned, and tiles can be flipped into the wheelbarrows and pushed. You must have all wheelbarrows off the path to complete the level.</p>\n<p>Water, the player and wheelbarrows cannot go on water, but tiles can, and then the player and wheelbarrows can go over those tiles.</p>\n<p>Here's my latest dev log!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This prototype was built in the wonderful Puzzle Script, but I have plans on making it better, and updating\u00a0the graphics.

I don't have a hard timeline for the development yet since my time is limited, but if you donate at least $10, I'll send you a copy when it's finished!<br/></p>\n<p>You can also keep up to date on this and other game projects with my newsletter\u00a0https://tinyletter.com/alexwcolby</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cdf/cdf701ffa928f50f245232c3839a3ca6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["boomboombap"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
