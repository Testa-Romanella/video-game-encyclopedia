{"id": 43967, "slug": "ashes", "name": "Ashes", "name_original": "Ashes", "description": "Ashes is first person adventure with a heavy focus on narrative and atmosphere. <br/><br/>We mixed a few game genres to try to achieve something new. <br/>The game draws from walking simulators, first person medieval adventures and horror games. It's not exactly a horror game nor it is an adventure rpg, it is something in the middle to be enjoyed in one sitting, like a short interactive bed time story for casual players. <br/><br/>You play as a man that wakes up with memory loss in a dungeon, as you progress through the dungeon you get your memories back unraveling the mystery behind your situation.<br/><br/>With puzzles, first person combat, weapon management, platforming and story telling, we hope to give a new kind of adventure to the everyday gamer.<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/><ul><li>Engaging story<br/></li><li>First person combat<br/></li><li>First person platforming<br/></li><li>Puzzles<br/></li><li>Destructible objects for stress relief</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:06:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9fa/9fafb8a11c5327b157f28933762e7bd2.jpg", "website": "http://www.ashes.windlimit.net/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 34}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 11, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 225, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WindLimit", "tom_jackson"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["WindLimit", "tom_jackson"], "esrb_rating": null}
