This is probably one of the best stable versions, we have made.\u00a0If we end up making a Version 3 or more, that'll probably be our final build for the system. Though, from what we can agree on. There isn't much we have to work on anymore, for the base.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Feel free to use this for your play by post games, voice games, or anything else. We won't be working on a 2nd build anytime soon. So, this is our first official playable 1st game system build. Bullet Hell Reverence, for the win!</p>\n<p>Cheers, Kagami and Prince Hades! :)<br/>(The picture is not mine.
