It could see, but sadly it could not move. It needs the Bat\u2019s help to move! Also, it can make a sound, which calls slime from everywhere!<br/></p>\n<p>\u2003<strong>Slime</strong>: The brainless jelly-like being, the plant\u2019s pet. Possessing no sign of intelligence. Not even you, the almighty spirit could control it. It only reacts to sound and it will go \u201cSTRAIGHT\u201d to it (Well, at least it tries to because the game is tile-based).\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>\u2003<strong>You</strong>: A mighty deaf spirit so you cannot hear any sound, even effect or bgm \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af</p>\n<p>\u00a0<strong>Controls\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>WASD / Arrow Keys - When in bat's perspective, move the Bat\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Space - Swap the character's perspective between bat and plant\r\n  </p>\n<p>Q - When in plant's perspective, call the slime\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>R - Restart the Stage\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>B - Back to Main Menu</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>The goal</strong>: Help the wimpy gang reach their goal!\r\n  </li></ul>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\r\n<ul><li><strong>Water</strong>:\u00a0 If you push the magic block down, the block will become the floor.
