Exactly this is what shocked Bunny the most, how sudden the change in behavior was, how friends no longer welcomed Bunny with a smile on their face. Now, their eyes were filled with nothing but pure red anger.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Everything happened overnight without any warning or any cause, Bunny being now stuck in the middle, quite literally since Bunny`s body is now half while, like it used to be, half black, due to the Disaster.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Somehow, the only way to bring the animals back was showing them affection, hugging them, patting their heads, or giving them a kiss. This brought back their old selves, and it was now Bunny`s task to fix them one by one, from the smallest ones, up to the most dangerous of them all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>How to play:\r\n  </p>\n<p>When it comes to the movement, you move with WASD.\r\n  </p>\n<p>You also have the option to jump which allows you to move faster and to cross longer distances.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Jumping on pillows allows you to jump higher and it also give you more control options as to when and where you would land. <br/></p>\n<p>You also have two path options, one that goes along the river, and one that leads you up on a road made out of stone.<br/></p>\n<p>The Bunny has three attacks, each filling the enemy`s Love Bar. The strongest attack is the kiss, followed by the hug, and the least strong being the pat pat.\u00a0 \r\n  </p>\n<p>Once an enemy`s love bar is filled, you can use them to charge your own bar. \r\n  </p>\n<p>In the beginning you, you have your two main attacks, pat pat and hug. The third one is unlocked later in the game. \r\n  </p>\n<p>The game`s goal is fixing as many animals as possible and defeating the final boss.\u00a0 The boss can be found on top of the pillow mountain. The path leads you straight to it and all you have to do is climb.\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Apart from designing and programming the whole game, we also created:\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li>Animations - pat pat attack, hug attack, crying, blow kiss attack\r\n  </li><li>The whole UI - Buttons, menus, instructions\r\n  </li><li>Re-textured the following assets: The rabbit, The dark skins for the sheep and boss\r\n  </li><li>Sculpted and textured the 6 pillows used in creating the environment\r\n  </li><li>Sculpted the heart for the blow kiss attack\r\n  </li></ul>\n<p>The other assets were found on Unity`s Marketplace. <br/>\n</p>\n<p>Runes and stones:</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/stylized-rocks-with-magic-rune-19...</p>\n<p>Environment:</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/lowpoly-environment-nature...</p>\n<p>Table and chair:</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/furniture/free-egg-coffee-table-s...</p>\n<p>Characters:</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/creatures/party-monster-duo-...</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/lovely-animals-pack-...</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/the-realtime-rascals-191779</p>\n<p>VFX that we bought: https://syntystore.com/products/polygon-particle-fx-pack<br/></p>\n\n<p>Team:</p>\n<p>Dan Rizescu, Adrei Danila, Maria Bucurenciu, Raluca Stefan.<br/></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T04:15:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dea/dea80e939285a91b41d0f8607dec0d23.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 247, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rinkka"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
