To stop the flow of time at your will...</p>\n<p>For one girl who has this wish granted, finally being \"on time\" suddenly takes on another meaning.</p>\n<p>Coded in 10 days for the\u00a0UNC Game Jam 2022.\u00a0Finish the game to see the credits, or scroll down.\u00a0Walkthrough is in the video.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>WASD or Arrow Keys\u00a0+ Space: Move, Hold to jump variable heights<br/>Click: Apply force<br/>Shift or C:\u00a0Freeze/Unfreeze Time<br/>E: Progress Dialogue</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/>Lead/Mechanics Programming: Die_Dai<br/>Level Design: Die_Dai<br/>Playtesting and Additional programming: Irene.M<br/>Story: Irene.M + kobkiet<br/>Visual and UI Programming: kobkiet<br/>Art + Music: kobkiet<br/>Concept and Game Design: All three :)<br/>Emotional Support:\u00a0Chaotic_Wizzard, Mischele, Snaphap and others :)</p>\n<p><strong>STUCK? LOOK HERE FOR HELP:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>-Momentum is applied when moving off an object in motion<br/>-Objects can be ridden in midair<br/>-Seesaws cannot be moved by the player character<br/>-Scroll wheel can be used to pan up and down slightly<br/>-Use R often if you feel like you are stuck, many puzzles need to be restarted if you mess up the sequence.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Still stuck? Watch the walkthrough, or...</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Super secret dev tool: Right click to teleport :)</p>\n<p><strong>KNOWN BUGS BY ORDER OF APPEARANCE:</strong></p>\n<p>-If the game/audio is very laggy, try turning on hardware acceleration<br/>-Hovering on a button displays debug text<br/>-Hitting exit on the web version of the game freezes the game<br/>-Exit button on pause menu obviously also doesn't work<br/>-Spam clicking R to restart the scene will progressively break the fade-in transition and add extra dialogue instances<br/>-Hitting R right after dying will also break the game<br/>-Time freezing during fadeout of restart carries over the freeze<br/>-Dying immediately after freezing carries over the freeze<br/>-Seesaws get stuck or have objects clip through them sometimes<br/>-Spam jumping on an object may sometimes launch you higher than intended<br/>-Under certain timings, you get ~extra~ horizontal momentum<br/>-Scrolling the camera will let you look out of bounds<br/>-Emotional support in the credits doesn't appear in certain resolutions. We promise that wasn't intentional...</p>\n<p><strong>IN CONCLUSION: PLEASE DON'T SPAM ANY BUTTONS :( that is the number one game breaker</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>A note about the final level:</strong> This was die_dai seeing how far they could reasonably push the game with the physics system they had at that point in development. They could've done more, but\u00a0it's probably a bit overtuned still.
