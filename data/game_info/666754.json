This includes the barebones functionality for 3D Platforming, such as:</p>\n<ul><li>3rd Person Character Controller, with WASD movement, Mouse Camera Controls, Jump, Double Jump, Dash, and a Ground Pound.</li><li>Obstacles, such as pendulums, fans, and vanishing platforms</li><li>Platforms, such as moving platforms, rocking platforms, and see-saws</li></ul>\n<p>None of the individual gameplay mechanics are new or innovative. This project was to see how well I could create these mechanics in the Godot Engine, specifically. The lack of tutorials on certain subjects, in contrast to the vast quantity available for Unity or Unreal, meant that I had to come up with my own solutions for certain elements that I wanted to achieve in this demo.</p>\n<p>There's also loads of behind the scenes stuff that I'm rather proud of, although it's impossible to notice when playing. For instance, I use a state machine to handle player behavior, which is something I've never done before.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T04:00:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14c/14c4744e9419f1bdf72110b37f1ca091.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DorkYface"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
