Features classic JRPG gameplay segments and nice chill bits as well.<br/></p>\n<p>This WIP can take you around 30-90 minutes depending on your level of experience with this sort of thing.<br/></p>\n<p>Made in RPG Maker VX Ace. All assets including graphics, music and sound effects are made by myself. There may still be some RPG Maker elements in there which I haven't phased out yet. This had led to the filesize being larger the necessary for which I apologise, I just didn't want anything to break.<br/></p>\n<p>Press enter to interact with people and items on the map. <br/></p>\n<p>Press F1 to view the options.<br/></p>\n<p>You can fullscreen the game with alt+enter. You may also want to enable the fullscreen option in the options mentioned above.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>SAVE REGULARLY. </strong>You can save and load at any point but a Game Over will have you back at the title screen regardless.</li><li><strong>The beginning and other parts of the game are loud.</strong> Watch your ears. There might also be some corny jumpy moments but it's hard for me to tell from my perspective.</li><li>A character can get their HP and CP back by leveling up or taking a shower.</li><li>If you're sick of random encounters, stay off carpets and grass.</li><li>Don't forget to check out the Clever Tricks that all the characters have. You'll need to do so to get through certain parts of the game.</li><li>If it looks like a character or an interesting object, try interacting with it.</li><li>You can talk to some people again and they will have more dialogue. Not lizards however so don't bother with them! A lot of people will also have new dialogue depending on plot events (including lizards).</li><li>A lot of the music tracks last far longer than the areas they are featured in. Maybe stick around to listen to them because they might fuck off on the next screen...</li><li>pige's front door is at the bottom of the cone.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>What's next?</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Most importantly, I will be porting the game over to RPG Maker MV. This will allow for higher resolutions, a less crappy screen size, and HTML5 support. As well as other things I haven't looked up yet probably.</li><li>The second half of the game.</li><li>Fleshing out the present areas more with things to do and look at.</li><li>More skills and equipment.</li><li>Fully purging out the RTP assets.</li><li>Maybe some bonus things to find...</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T06:18:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16b/16bbc87ea33e8e0e4785acc4a3ea6785.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lemon_lime_itchy"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
