Travel between stops, meet unique characters, and learn their stories. Can you free yourself and return home? Or will you ride the train forever...?\r\n</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>[Z/C]: Jump\r\n</p>\n<p>[X/V]: Use Shooty\r\n</p>\n<p>Enter: Pause\r\n</p>\n<p>Left &amp; Right Arrow Keys: Movement\r\n</p>\n<p>Up Arrow Key: Interact &amp; Shooty Up\r\n</p>\n<p>Down Arrow Key+[X/V]: Use Shovel\r\n</p>\n<p>The game is also compatible with most controllers.</p>\n\r\nNotes:\r\n<p>Due to the way I used PICO-8 to make this game, and as a result of the level layout, you are unable to save in any \"train stop\" level. The game can only be saved in the train (when the screen flashes \"game saved\"). Note that the candle checkpoints are only checkpoints! You will not start at the checkpoint if you restart the game, so\u00a0I'd recommend playing one level at a time, when you have the time to beat a whole level in a single sitting.</p>\n<p>Note that there may be some bugs still left in, so please let me know if you spot any! (I really need some variation in my cockroach stew I'm making)</p>\n<p>I'll be releasing the whole soundtrack on my YouTube Channel, so go check it out if you want!</p>\n<p>Even if you're not interested in playing, thank you so much for checking out this game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T06:11:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a2/7a25138cce0770eec37cc65a39a0e867.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["meivuu"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
