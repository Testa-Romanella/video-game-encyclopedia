As in the classic rickshaw, a single empty square allows you to move rows or columns to modify the configuration. Try to match at least 3 identical symbols to send them to the fusion vial and earn points. <br/></p>\n<p>The bigger the block you manage to form, the more points you score!<br/>A block of 3 is only worth 1 point. <br/>A block of 4 is worth 4 points. <br/>A block of 5 returns 25 points! </p>\n<p>Note that logically you cannot form a block of more than 5 elements. </p>\n<p>But... <br/>The next 4 injected tokens appear at the bottom, try to plan the configuration to try a shot at 200 points, 1000 points or more with a block of 6, 7 or 8! With a bit of luck you will win 1st place! <br/></p>\n<p>Once in the vial, the symbols can merge but be careful because it cannot contain more than 20 tokens otherwise it will break, and that's the end! To be the best you will have to be very focused and astute. <br/></p>\n<p>The parchment of alchemical fusions that you can consult at any time will help you make the right decision, it is not complicated to decipher it for initiates. <br/></p>\n<p>Hours of fun and relaxation in perspective to score the highest possible score! </p>\n<p>AlchemystOpus is also the subsidiary question, can you recognize the 10 symbols: Mars saffron, fire, gold, \"hermetic\" gold, silver, air, water, earth, acid and azure? </p>\n<p>You would access a new aesthetic knowledge.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The author of the game: Here\u00a0</p><p>The author can also be contacted here(with source code):\u00a0Here</p><p>AlchemystOpus was programmed in\u00a0GFA-BASIC 32.
