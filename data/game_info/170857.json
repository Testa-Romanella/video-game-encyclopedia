Don't run into Lang, and don't let too many missiles hit San Francisco! Watch out, his arms have minds of their own. </p><p>This was a fun project for Giant Rom 4. It was also my first time using GameMaker 2. The \"sprites\" are a mix of photoshop and hand-drawn stuff. The player sprite is from opengameart, and all of the music is from YouTube's royalty free audio library. The sound effects were made using SFXR.</p><p>I would have liked to include a part where you chase Lang's severed robot head into space to finish the job, but alas, we can't always get what we want.</p><p>Hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33d/33d66764b06c739f208df5430eadeea5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JakeLunn"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
