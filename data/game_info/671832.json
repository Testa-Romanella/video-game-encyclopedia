Sadly I had trouble finishing up the game in time so it's very rough around the edges : many bugs, no sound/music, and many features were cut.</p>\n<p>Still, the main element of the game still works, the objective is to take down all pirates in the sector by fighting them in real-time card battles. You can loot cards along the way and battle a small boss at the end.</p><p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p><p>A - A Button</p><p>Arrow Keys - D-Pad</p>\n<p><strong>List of Cards</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Cards effect can be a bit hard to understand, here is a list of what each card does:</p>\n<p>- Laser : deal 2 damage.</p>\n<p>- Cannon : deal 3 damage.</p>\n<p>- Fix : Gain 1 armor.</p>\n<p>- Shield : Gain 2 armor.</p>\n<p>- Clunk : For every armor lost deal 1.</p>\n<p>- Dodge : Gain 10% dodge.</p>\n<p>- Peck : Gain 30% dodge and deal 1 damage.</p>\n<p>- Cobra : If you have at least 80% dodge, deal 7 damage.</p>\n<p>- Missile : Deal 2 damage, discard a card from your deck.</p>\n<p>Dodge is the likelyhood of an attack missing and armor will block incoming damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Death Cards</strong><br/></p>\n<p>When you get to the end of your deck, you'll get to choose a death card :</p>\n<p>- Slow : Reset enemy dodge, restore your deck.</p>\n<p>- Armor-: Your attacks require +1 armor to block.</p>\n<p>- Damage: Your attack deal +1 damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Even though the game is very rough, you will find that you can use various strategies to beat it. Protip : Aggro &gt; Dodge &gt; Armor &gt; Aggro.</p>\n<p>I'll be sure to post an updated post-jam version in the future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T07:18:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/952/952981da84424b5e1cd5eeb747dbdd3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ghost_wave"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
