Fight your way through random-generated dimensions, steal from poor (?) monsters and take items back home!<br/><br/><h3>SINGLE PLAYER OR NETWORK CO-OP</h3>Play it solo or work together with your friends to conquer the dungeons.<h3>Important CO-OP information</h3><ul><li> Offline single player or up to <strong>online</strong> 10+ players. (via Steam P2P or TCP/IP)<br/></li><li> No same-machine, no split-screen co-op supported.</li></ul><h3>MIX OF SKILL-BASED AND ROGUE-LITE</h3>You can upgrade character skills or use carry-over items from the previous run to help in the next. All character upgrades are also refundable, this allows you to adjust your stat to reduce the gap when playing with newer players or enables you to challenge the run without any upgrade for a real test of skill.<br/><br/><h3>ITEM AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT</h3>Aside from limited supply of food and recovery items. Always keep your spare equipment as they can wear down from usage. If all of your armors are broken in the middle of boss fight, things might get ugly really fast! Also plan ahead when to send some of your items back home for home base upgrade, or when to keep them with you.<h3>CONTENT AND EARLY ACCESS WARNINGS</h3><ul><li> This is work in progress, there <strong>WILL</strong> be some inconvenience, we will try our best to help with your issue.<br/></li><li> This game will be using a handful of ready-made assets. (FYI, if this is not your cup of tea)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T02:10:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c56/c5680cc4bc25851a6a0ff40641dd7cdc.jpg", "website": "https://wappen.games/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 322, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wappen Games"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Wappen Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
