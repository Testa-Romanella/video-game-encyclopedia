Everything is physically simulated and you are encouraged to solve the problems in your own way.</p>\n<p>Donors can also play the game\u00a0in split-screen or in VR-mode.</p>\n<p>Recyclinator is not a game for everyone, it's a challenging puzzle game that doesn't hold your hand, and require you to figure out things on your own.<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p>Instead of solving predefined puzzles you build your own solutions in Recyclinator. Every puzzle can be solved in different ways, in single player, co-op or VR.<br/></p>\n\n<p>There is a wide array of weird and inefficient tools for you to use. Since the puzzles are physics-driven, you can use most tools in more than one way.<br/></p>\n\n<p>There are loads of different secrets and easter-eggs hidden in the game. Good luck finding them!<br/><br/>Listen to a part of the soundtrack here and here.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/519/5196edbfec5b393219d49d5914e41048.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Philisophic Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
