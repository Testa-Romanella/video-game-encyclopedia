Rune Gate is a deck-building roguelite where you can design your own cards by slotting in runes of various elements.<h3>Customizable Your Card Your Way</h3><br/><br/><br/><br/>The Rune system makes card customization super fast and easy. It's up to you how to craft synergies across different cards, and how strong or useful each card is. Slot in attack runes, you get a high damage card; Slot in draw or energy runes, you get an utility card; Slot in debuff runes, you get yourself a curse card. Need a new slot? Just upgrade your card!<h3>A Sea of Runes to Choose From</h3><br/>Right now there are around 100 runes in the game, each rune has its own signature and restraint. They can be earned through combat after unlocked or crafted through lower tier runes. And more runes will be added through out the development process.<h3>Team-Based Combat</h3><br/>You use a party of champions against enemies on the other side. Each champion has its own type of weapon and runes to play with. Each type of weapon is a deck with its own unique sets of cards to build from. There are 18 champions for you to recruit, 3 of each elemental type.<h3>Yes... There Are Loot</h3><br/>Not only can you get runes after combat, you can also get gears and augments. Gears can boost your champions' offence and defense abilities, they also have runes slotted in for you to use when equipped. Augments can give your champions a unique buff in combat once equipped.<h3>Wait... You Can Summon?</h3><br/>Followers are also a type of \"Gear\" you can get and can be summoned during battle. They have their own move sets which are also a set of cards that can also be customized through runes.<h3>Fame-Based Meta Progression</h3><br/>Fame can be gained through combat in each realm. You can use them to permanently unlock certain runes and give yourself various advantages to help you progress further in future runs.<br/><br/>-Discord: https://discord.gg/cCWrQKwg<br/>-Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/@devwindgames<br/>-Twitter: https://twitter.com/devwindgames", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-28T03:05:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b0/7b02fdb044a8ba38dd95457928c083e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 310, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Devwind"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Devwind"], "esrb_rating": null}
