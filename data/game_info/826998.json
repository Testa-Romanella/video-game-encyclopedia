Leverage those high school geometry skills to combine polygons into even bigger polygons. Remember those pre-school learnings to figure out which colors will combine to give you the most advantageous outcome.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was created after ~5 weeks of learning to program. I have no formal artistic or programming experience. This game was meant to be more complex than my last published game (9! The Game).
