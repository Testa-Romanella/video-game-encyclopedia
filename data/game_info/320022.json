In the process I really felt the desire to help it with my own commands, so why not?! When creativity comes, just embrace it hard.</p>\n<p>I found it really fun to play, hope you enjoy it too. Share with me your feedbacks and highscores ;)</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p>This was meant to be\u00a0a programming exercise, which I felt like sharing. I only had the idea, made the code and used some free content, for which\u00a0I should give\u00a0credits to some people who are cited\u00a0below.\u00a0</p><p>-Pok\u00e9mon Company for the use of Ledyba pok\u00e9mon. The sprite is from the game\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon Shuffle, a great match-3-pok\u00e9mon-themed game, played it a lot.</p>\n<p>- Super Mario Bros. 2\u00a0(NES) creators. I made a little adjust in your\u00a0hills sprites do they'd gradually change colours, hope you don't mind. Great game.\r\n</p>\n<p>- konstantinusz, great artist at freesound.org for his insectoid sound effect. I used it as the SFX when you or the AI give a command.</p>\n<p>-Finally, once again,\u00a0Benjamin Tissot at\u00a0www.bensound.com\u00a0for his amazing groovy beat which fit just perfect with the game aesthetic!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-17T07:01:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e10/e101103f2b85292143347c74251130b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["VictorSouzaCV"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
