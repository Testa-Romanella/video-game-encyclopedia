The hunter trained for years to gain great speed and, even if partially blind, he can actually concentrate to sense presences from afar.<br/></p>\n<p>An attempt to make a 3D first person shooter game for LOWREZJAM... of course it's really hard to see at long distances, so I tried to implement a mechanic that complements this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Play:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Track the beast following its scratch or examining wolf corpses. Use the sun (the West) or the compass to orient yourself and get near the beast. Use the aim (right click) to spot far enemies or cacti (cactus plants).</p>\n<p>Stamina (the green bar on top right) influences your speed, you can replenish it interacting with a cactus. Some cactus can replenish also health.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>wasd: move</p>\n<p>mouse: look<br/></p>\n<p>left mouse: shoot<br/></p>\n<p>right mouse: aim</p>\n<p>left shift: run</p>\n<p>e: interact<br/></p>\n<p>increase/decrease mouse sensivity: pageUP/pageDOWN or numpad +/-</p>\n\n<p><strong>Procedural generation:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Every new game the world is procedurally generated and the beast is placed in a different location.
