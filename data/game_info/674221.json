The player must choose between buying defensive structures, attack soldiers, or mining. As the game progresses, special and aid units are unlocked, also the enemies are upgraded in their variety. It is a very entertaining game where you do not pay to win, it does not require internet, it is not too long (infinite), it is complete and contains unlockable elements.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHistory: A war between the north and south zones forced all retired soldiers to return to service, Colonel Steve among them. Steve has a special mission within his own territory, and this is to recover the containers from laboratory 3. This would be a simple mission if it weren't for the fact that he must confront the biological weapons that the enemy used in the city and the scarce resources assigned to him. Will he be able to overcome all obstacles? It depends on you.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T02:42:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c7/2c78991c919bfd20f7d8a5af8a025083.jpg", "website": "http://gmdtech.com.ar/index.php/games/1-EPIDEMYC", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 409, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ruben Dario Acosta"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ruben Dario Acosta"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
