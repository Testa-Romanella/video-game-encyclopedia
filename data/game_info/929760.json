Can you clear all <strong>12 levels</strong>?<br/> Help <strong>Fluffn't</strong> make it out of this nightmarish place in this top-down puzzle game with very simple rules:</p>\n<p>- Some objects can be pushed (and pulled) around to help traverse the levels, <strong>including your tombstone</strong>! <br/>To push an object, simply move <strong>towards</strong> it. <br/>To pull an object, <strong>hold SHIFT and move away from it</strong>.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>- You can't die in Purgatory (you're already dead!). If that were to happen, you'd just spawn back below your tombstone (if the tile is blocked, then it will try every other tile in clockwise order -first left, then up, then right-. If no tiles are available, you're <strong>extra-doomed!</strong>)<br/><br/></p>\n<p>- You can move multiple objects at once!<br/><br/></p>\n<p>- Don't leave a level without your\u00a0<strong>tombstone,\u00a0</strong>or you'll wander in Purgatory for all eternity!<br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong><em>The game was made in one week and submitted to Brackey's 2023.1 Game Jam<br/>The theme for the jam\u00a0was \"An end is a new beginning\", which gave me the idea for the tombstone mechanic.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><strong><br/>-\u00a0Programmed by mli, using the Godot\u00a0Engine<br/>- OST by mli<br/>- SFX by rfxGEN + mli<br/></strong><strong>- Tilesets &amp; UI by mli, inspired by Loop Hero's color palettes<br/></strong><strong>- Base Fluffn't &amp; Rat sprites by HungryDingo, recolored and modified by mli<br/></strong><strong>- Fonts by GGBotNet (HelpMe) &amp; Lafontype (Creato-Display)</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T12:40:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7f/b7f179cfbb2d36bd38b401c36bc7bda1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mli"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
