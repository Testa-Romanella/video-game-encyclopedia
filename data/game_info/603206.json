Rook Knight won't go down easy, so avoid their knife by jumping out of the way. For specific controls, go into the \"Controls\" menu in game to look up the buttons and rebind them to your liking.</p>\n<p>There are a few known issues. If controls don't work on the first menu right away, refresh the page and try again. The quit button will also just stop the game from running but will not close it or allow you to restart the game. Similarly, refresh the page to make the \"Run game\" button return. The game was also built with a DualShock 4 in mind, so use the South button to select a menu option.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the Minneapolis College of Art and Design course, \"Intermediate 3D.\"</p>\n<p>Concept, arena model, and character rigging: Connor Benson</p>\n<p>Animation: Kennedy Patterson</p>\n<p>Programming: Calvin Evans</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fonts:</strong></p>\n<p>Canterbury Font:\u00a0https://www.1001fonts.com/canterbury-font.html</p>\n<p>Source Sans Pro:\u00a0https://www.1001fonts.com/source-sans-pro-font.html</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sound Effects:</strong></p>\n<p>Provided by YouTube Audio Library and MCAD Sound Effects Library</p>\n\n<p><strong>Music:</strong></p>\n<p>Slow Burn by Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4372-slow-burn</p>\n<p>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>\n\n<p>Summon the Rawk by Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4434-summon-the-rawk</p>\n<p>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>\n\n<p>Motherlode by Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4083-motherlode</p>\n<p>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>\n\n<p>Thief in the Night by Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4521-thief-in-the-night</p>\n<p>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>\n\n<p>Take the Lead by Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4458-take-the-lead</p>\n<p>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>\n\n<p>Elevators Need Rock Too by SPENCE</p>\n<p>Artist Link:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzKV4AGJbjatioXorSn-sGA</p>\n<p>YouTube Audio Library License</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T08:06:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc9/fc9aa89f6c404b8a42c009ee0bcd4328.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Calvin And Hobbies"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
