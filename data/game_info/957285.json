I hope you all join me as I\u00a0slowly develop this little project :)</p>\n<p>currently, the only thing to do is wander through the generated caves, since cave generation is what I'm focusing on.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T19:34:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2bd/2bd060b526ceaaff696ff685d7cb4a85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["aurora's"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
