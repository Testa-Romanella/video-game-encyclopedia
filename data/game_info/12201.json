Then pick two additional abilities from a shared pool of spells that range from teleportation to a powerful kinetic blast that sends foes flying. Mix in passive abilities that increase your tactical options and you have a recipe for combat befitting a student of the Arcane Arts.<br/><br/>Many spells are inspired by our favorite MOBA games like DOTA 2 and League of Legends. Grimoire's FPS spin on these strategic spells creates fast paced tactical combat unlike anything you've played before. Grimoire is not a game of instant damage and unavoidable death. Every spell has a counter\u2026 if you\u2019re ready for it!Game Modes<br/><ul><li>Conquest - Magnus and Validus battle over control of key sources of magical energy known as ley-lines. The longer the ley-lines are held the more energy is gained including a large influx of power if one house can manage to take total control of an area. Destructible objects can reveal new territory or bring the environment crashing down on your enemies. Inspired by games like Day of Defeat, the Battlefield series, and Team Fortress 2; Conquest is a territorial battle that features large (8v8) teams.<br/><br/></li><li>Free-For-All (Deathmatch) - Chaos reigns supreme in this fight to the death. This classic game mode is a great way to try out the game without worrying about objectives.<br/><br/></li><li>Survival (Singleplayer) - The people of Orinfell are under attack! Hold off waves of undead fighters, mages, and golems as the survivors escape through the city's catacombs. This game mode is great for testing out new spells and learning the basics of the game.</li></ul>The World<strong>Two Families Fight for the Fate of a World</strong><br/>The northern land of Futhark is home to two great houses locked in a bitter struggle. As ruin rises from the south, each vies for the Grimoire, a powerful artifact of a lost age. It was the Grimoire that ushered in the Dawn of Magic, called forth the destruction of an empire, and which now heralds civil war.<br/><br/>Honorable House Magnus clings to their charge of sealing the book\u2019s secrets, willing to sacrifice Futhark if only to save the world from the horrors held in the Grimoire\u2019s binding. Ambitious House Validus has little time for craven hearts and strives to brave the tome\u2019s power to save the republic and lead it into a golden age who\u2019s like has never been before seen. Yet the Grimoire is no idle prize to be fought for. That dusty tome has begun to glow, welcoming their dissent even as it spreads its pages, unleashing the Mana Storm in the battle to come.<br/><br/>War approaches.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:49:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/352/3525d893fb0ab1a703bbebe6ba6fc54c.jpg", "website": "http://www.grimoirethegame.com", "rating": 2.2, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 32, "owned": 879, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 15}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 35, "suggestions_count": 478, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 35, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Omniconnection"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
