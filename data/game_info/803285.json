I still find it amusing to this day, and thought since I did finish up until the prologue, to share it for historical purposes. Because I had so much fun writing my part in the\u00a0<em>Reverse Robin</em> collab, I wanted to write more crack stories, and I even re-used my \"guy who's always yelling\" character from RR (named him Ran here). Although I also used the lady in red sprite, she is not the same person from RR (then again that whole game people kept changing identities lol).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Despite how silly this unfinished game was, I hope it'll at least make you smirk even just a little. I have virtually left it untouched, save for fixing some scripting errors to make sure it works and giving it a menu image,</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T14:41:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec6/ec63e4534d5758fdfb820818cef9a892.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tofu Sheets Visual"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
