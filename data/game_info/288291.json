But the scope was too high. So I have thought about how am I going to interpret the theme and I have decided to make a game where beings on planed trash their planet until they go extinct. Though, it's a jam - spare me.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lesson: I should have spent less time on UI views - there were only 2. And I have spent a lot of time automating animations creation.</p><p>Thanks\u00a0Hotaru Petrov! For awesome ambient music and sound effects!
