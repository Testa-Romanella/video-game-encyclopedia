{"id": 465009, "slug": "fx-bit", "name": "FX bit", "name_original": "FX bit", "description": "<p><strong>FX bit is another game!</strong></p>\n<p>Ninja's Mask is a famous arcade game from the 80's, where a bad guy kidnaps a ninja's girlfriend, or whatever.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the problem: an old game requires an old TV. And old TVs have rusty speakers.</p>\n<p>In FX bit, you help this old speaker to read the sounds under its dusty wires, and do its job.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Gameplay</strong></p>\n<p>Be precise! Wait until the icon reaches the marker and press \u201cA\u201d to make a Coin sound, \u201cS\u201d to make a Jump sound, ahd \u201cD\u201d to make a slash one.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Development</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game was\u00a0 elaborate to face the challenge of GMTK Jam 2020. All the art, code, soundtrack\u00a0 and FX was created and composed in 48 hours, between July 11 and 13, by Gus Costa.</p>\n<p>The theme was \u201cOut of Control\u201d, so, in order to respond to this challenge I invented a game in which the player has no control of the game that is been played! Instead, while the game flows without any human interference, the player's goal is to help and old speaker to recognize images and sounds shown by the game.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for playing!<br/></p>\n\n<p>[Update] - There is a sound bug on Level 10. I'll only be able to fix it after the GMTK voting period. =/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T07:15:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f0/5f02d7423029f6d5a0baa7ac40960512.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gus  Costa"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
