This project is the follow up art project after Ichigo. With this project I had to create a small environment from using only my own design as opposed to using pre existing designs which was the case with Ichigo. The task was to create an environment based on a real life location. The location I went with was the Greek Island of Santorini but given a dark twist by turning it into dark ruins. This project also comes with my first Game Art Bible (MDD) which is 123 pages long.</p>\n<p><strong>DEVELOPMENT</strong></p>\n<p>The Lone Ones had a much shorter development time when compared to my previous art project. The main bulk of my development time went into my MDD and Art Study. The environment itself only took just over a week to develop using the designs which I had drawn in my MDD. I had used my 3D and UV skills from my previous project to achieve the final result.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-10T03:00:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf8/cf847d4be5b0390c48f069ced11dc868.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BRADLEY O'NEILL"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
