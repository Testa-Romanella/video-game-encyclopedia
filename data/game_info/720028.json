This includes character deaths or the ability to date.</p>\n<p>This follows the plot of Akame ga Kill. I might mix the manga and the anime and write my own stuff up. It's some what cringey. At least for me.</p>\n<p>Doing this in my spare time or smth.</p><p>The music used claims to be royalty-free.
