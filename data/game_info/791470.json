You have to start over. This means that you will need to be wise about your decisions as soon as you make them! It makes the game very difficult but in just 10 minutes, you know that in the end the game will speed up once - once you've got all the clues. Okay, if you can find all the puzzles. Use your mouse to explore, collect objects, and analyze trails to gradually solve various traps that will lead to your escape.</p>\n\r\nObjective:\r\n<p>After starting the game, the player's attention is directed to the timer which drops from 10 minutes.
