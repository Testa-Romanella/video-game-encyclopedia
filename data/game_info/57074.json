Using a variety of sliding puzzles, the player rolls a ball (possibly containing a small armadillo character as implied by the game's introduction) along tracks set on the tiles. Players must align the tracks together and have the ball roll over bridged tracks that have been set on the border of the puzzle in order to complete each level. Junction has a total of 50 levels which the player can select at random, but a certain number of points have to be reached by level 50 in order for the player to beat the game and see the ending.</p>\n<p>Junction is similar in design to Konami's Loco-Motion arcade game from 1982, but with isometric graphics.</p>\n<p>The Sega Game Gear version had a reference to Curse, a previous Micronet game, in its opening.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1990-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:00:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/430/430701c92a7989c5fc7dd35671a453d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 192, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Genesis"], "developers": ["Micronet", "Micronet co"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Micronet co", "Micronet"], "esrb_rating": null}
