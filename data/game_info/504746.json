{"id": 504746, "slug": "firewall-surfer", "name": "FIREWALL SURFER", "name_original": "FIREWALL SURFER", "description": "<p>(Please read the \"How to play\" and \"Controls\" section for the best experience)</p>\n<p><strong>Surf your way through high security servers</strong>\u00a0in this 80s and 90s inspired hacking game. Using state of the art looping technology the \"Firewall surfer\" software let you play out your hacker fantasies while\u00a0<strong>looping through and surfing over firewalls</strong>. The looping is so powerful that it\u00a0can be hard to control though, so it's time to break out those\u00a0<strong>1337 hacker skills</strong>\u00a0of yours! Collect password fragments to crack one server node after another until you finally get what you are looking for,\u00a0<strong>the mainframe</strong>!</p>How to play:\r\n<p>Collect the pink/red letters, numbers and symbols to crack the password. Once all the pieces has been collected a connection to the next server node will appear. Simply jump into it to progress.</p>\n<p>Avoid colliding with the edges of the firewalls (the white platforms). You are free to \u201csurf\u201d on top of them, but if you hit the edge then the loop will be broken, the firewall will disconnect you, and your connection will be broken for a short while.</p>\n<p>If you don't crack the password fast enough you will be detected and the attack will be aborted.</p>\n<p>Have fun, hackers!</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>W: Jump (press again to double jump)</li><li>S: Slam in to the ground to fall faster</li></ul><p><strong>NB! You will need to use both W and S to hit several of the firewalls (platforms). Jump first then slam down on to the the firewall.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T12:23:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d8/2d8017dd0428db52a2df4197947e3b25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tim Eriksen"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
