Don't expect much, but it's a game that you can keep playing over and over again\u00a0to try and get a better score. It's something do play while your are waiting on something or things like that. There is an end to the game however, so just letting you know that it doesn't go on infinitely. This is also definitely not a copy of Doodle Jump, but it's kind of a recreation and if you like it I\u00a0would love feedback and if you want I will try to improve the game in different aspects; just let me know :) There is also randomly generated seeds each time you restart the game. All art and programming was done by me and published.</p>\n\n<p>Controls - Very simple,\u00a0 just <left arrow=\"\"> to move left and <right arrow=\"\">\u00a0 to move right. You can press <up arrow=\"\"> to get a new seed and restart the game.\u00a0</up></right></left></p>\n<p>Have Fun!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T03:10:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f7/6f736142f7f2b5cec83a2050431e8d54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The15thdogo"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
