One day you get dumped into the \"Alchemist Cave\". You probably bragged a bit to much about your potion brewing skills during class and some of your classmates just couldn't stand it anymore.<br/><br/><em>\"You can only call yourself a real alchemist if you survive the cave and find the exit!\"</em>\u00a0one of your classmates said. Even though you're very angry at them for throwing you in there and knowing that the only way out is through the cave you also know that they're right. The \"Alchemist Cave\" is one of the most dangerous caves in the land. No one can survive the cave unless you're able to brew some really powerful potions.<br/><br/>So enough with being angry and let's show the world what a powerful alchemist you really are!!!<br/><br/>PS. You can even make your own levels in Paint! ;)<br/><br/><strong>CONTROLS<br/></strong><strong>Arrow keys:</strong> Move<br/><strong>A:</strong>\u00a0Throw bones, select stuff in menus<br/><strong>S:</strong>\u00a0Show ingredients, cancel in menus<br/><strong>D:\u00a0</strong>Punch<br/><strong>W:</strong>\u00a0Use potion<br/><strong>Q:\u00a0</strong>Cycle through potions<br/><strong>E:</strong>\u00a0Cycle through potions</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T07:46:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0d/d0ddd7ff21e028f38cf18b26a4a14d6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pedestal Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
