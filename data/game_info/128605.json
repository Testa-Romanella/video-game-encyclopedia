If you played the PC and Android version let me know which one you liked better.</p>How to play<p>During the song blue and red targets will appear. While playing a small black bar is moving up and down. You have to hit these targets when the thin black bar is over them. The smaller the distance of the bar to the center of the targets the better. Blue targets have to be hit when the bar is moving down and the red ones when the bar is moving up.</p><p>This game is best played using the numpad of your keyboard (1-9).</p><p>Backspace, escape or back on Android restarts the game.</p><p>If your playing on a notebook or have a keyboard without a numpad, you can either use UIO, JKL, M ; : or WER, SDF, XCV (QWERTZ-Keyboard) or play the Android build, where you just have to touch the tiles. However I recommend using the numpad, because the other solutions need a little bit more time to get into.</p>Credits<br/>Songs<ul><li>Recall of the Shadows by FoxConn</li><li>Secta Instrumental by Contra</li><li>Ko Instrumental by Contra</li></ul><p><strong>From the Youtube Audio Library</strong></p><ul><li>Barge by Gunnar Olsen</li><li>Donors by Letter Box</li><li>Pumping Irie by Jingle Punks</li></ul>Font<ul><li>Quantico</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/379/3794a903070abb22468b74e06b9af6fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["fishynator"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
