You have to hunt strange snake like creatures to harvest their energy, and that energy is scarce.</p><p>It was supposed to tie into the theme through the fact that the world is small and therefore the resources within are limited! Needless to say, as for many, I didn't get to do everything I want! ^^'</p><p>Thanks for playing!</p><p>PS: after the splash screen, the black loading screen may take time before the intro. Couldn't solve that problem. (It seems that playing it in admin mode fixes it?)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f73/f73b9c2b7c7a8d0569be87d18d75e56c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xangotrick"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
