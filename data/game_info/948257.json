For this project, I <em>designed my own map</em>, <em>modified the package delivery and boost assets</em>, and <em>included a package counter</em> to enhance the gameplay experience.</p>\n<p>Although I could have added more features to the game, such as advanced animations or sound effects, I decided not to invest too much time into it as it was primarily a practice project. Instead, I focused on implementing the essential elements to make the game functional and\u00a0easy to navigate, allowing me to learn more about game development basics in Unity.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T07:29:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/462/462399dfc39f9564c9da41ac728585fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dias"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
