Score Big with Gin Bonus, Big Gin and Undercut!You will enjoy for sure<br/><br/>Variations :-<br/><br/>Gin Rummy :-<br/>In standard gin, only a player with 10 or fewer points of deadwood may knock. Knocking with 0 points of deadwood is known as going Gin or having a Gin hand, while knocking with deadwood points is known as going down.<br/><br/>Knock :- Players have Knock button only when sum of cards (Deadwood) are less than 11 point.<br/><br/>Gin :- Players have GIN button only when sum of cards (Deadwood) is Zero.<br/><br/>Straight Gin :-<br/>In Straight gin players are required to play until one of them can go gin. Knocking is not allowed. Scoring and rules remain the same as standard Gin Rummy.<br/><br/>Oklahoma Gin :-<br/>In this version of Gin Rummy, the value of the first up-card is used to determine the maximum count at which players can knock. If the up-card is a spade, the hand will count double. So if the first up-card is a 4, you can knock and go out with only 4 or fewer points in your hand; and if the 4 was a spade, you would get double points that hand.<br/>Another version in this variation (mostly in match play) and in Hollywood Gin (see below), a second deck of cards will be used to determine the knock value of a hand. The knock value card will be dealt from the bottom and turned over on top. Above rules apply but both players are dealt ten cards with the last hand winner picking first from the deck.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f6/5f6b44afc16862f70d9b9af6883e28ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["jaiparkash"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
