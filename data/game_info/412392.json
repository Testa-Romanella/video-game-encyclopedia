Their ascension caused a phenomenon causing humans to praise them as deities. As an apology, the oracle's daughter sent a gift known as Gearnium, a metal containing evolutionary powers, in order to befriend the humans. But, this metal was a parasite, enslaving human minds, and eventually caused them to 'Ascend'. Those who followed these deities became monsters. Those who refused were killed. A majority of the human race serves these deities. Those who followed them were known as the enlightened. Now, in a last ditch effort, rebellious humans refined a piece of Gearnium to contain the same traits as the legendary Blaster Gear. The Rose Gear was built, and only two were made before the enlightened invaded the underground colony.</p>\n<p>The sigil is set. Your fate is bound. The Crisis Rose has now bloomed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-14T05:12:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90e/90e5549d75dd18628f86989953a09d25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 255, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OverloadedStudios"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
