I <em>could\u00a0</em>release a solo mode, but anybody following\u00a0my GitLab profile\u00a0can build that from the first commit. I would appreciate if anybody volunteered to build the latest commit for Mac or Linux, details further below.</p>\n<p>Launching the game is a breeze if you have the Itch.io app - tons of other indie games you will turn to appreciate over a course of browsing through its catalog. It's also more\u00a0<strong>secure -\u00a0</strong>it runs executable games in sandbox environments, making it safer to run than randomly trusting executable apps (though you can be assured that I'm no hacker :P).</p>\n<p>For easily establishing a<strong> virtual LAN to host your game </strong>(it's 2 player co-op, heh) use the Hamachi client. It's simple to set up, and you'll need to <strong>pass the host IPv4 address</strong> over a suitable medium, which may include the chat functionality in-built in the app.</p>\n<p>Since it's still an early build, quitting the game and restarting it is manual.</p>\n<p>Check out my post on\u00a0adjusting graphics settings\u00a0if the game isn't running satisfactorily on your device. The latest release should have the settings placed exactly where you'd want it, at high level (that's a 2).</p>\n<p>If you have an <strong>Unreal Engine installation &gt;= 4.17 </strong>check out some other stuff I've done -\u00a0active development and source code at my GitLab profile.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27b/27bb290aa2aac9d8008b7fed5f0c0bfd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shivam Mukherjee"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
