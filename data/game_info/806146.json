Fight your way through hordes of deadly mechanical soldiers as the Seeker \u2014 the last descendant of the ancient gods \u2014 who lost their only companion to these machines. Take your revenge and find a way to bring your loved one back to life...<br/><br/><br/><strong>Shoot, slash and dash to defeat numerous enemies.</strong><br/><br/><strong>Block projectiles with your shield. Time your blocks well and deflect the projectiles back at your enemies.</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Upgrade and modify your abilities to suit your own play-style and make them even more powerful.</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Journey through the futuristic neon-drenched world, explore different locations, meet new characters and uncover hidden secrets.</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>In BrightSeeker, harder difficulty doesn't mean enemies will have unfair advantages or become bullet sponges. Instead, you can adjust the difficulty to suit your own play-style and decide what benefits you or your enemies will get.</strong><br/><br/><strong>Unlock new abilities for enemies to make them more challenging to defeat or give yourself boosts to make the game easier. The game will be only as difficult/easy as you make it.</strong><br/><br/><br/></p>\r\nKEY FEATURES\r\n<ul><li>Shoot, slash and dash to defeat deadly enemies.<br/>\n</li><li>Block and deflect projectiles with a shield.<br/>\n</li><li>Unlock powerful special abilities.<br/>\n</li><li>Customize your weapons in The Ability Forge.<br/>\n</li><li>Vanquish challenging bosses.<br/>\n</li><li>Play at your own difficulty level.<br/>\n</li><li>Explore the futuristic world.\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T20:42:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a34/a34b646b42c5849fe7f797edb125174c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 378, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zakroutil"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
