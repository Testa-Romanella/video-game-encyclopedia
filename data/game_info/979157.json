Battle it out in the classic Starfield, which takes you back to the basics. Or compete in the Warpgate, which challenges the players with limited platforms and portals.<h3>Items</h3>Each Sportsman can gain points during gameplay from various tasks, such as scoring touchdowns or tackling other players. These points ca be used to gain advantageous items to help. Items only last for the round, but can help gain an edge on the opponent in different ways.
