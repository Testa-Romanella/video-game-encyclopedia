Flowers must be caught in full bloom so that the number of flowers in her possession will increase; catching flowers too early will consider the flowers to be wasted and flowers caught too late will be wilted. Wilted flowers will ruin the bouquet, causing the player to lose half of the flowers. By completing each round, the player receives one honey.\r\n\r\nBears have a taste for honey and cause the player to lose one of two hearts if one of them attacks the player. However, the honey can be dropped in order to render the bear temporarily harmless to the player. Bees giving her bonus items occasionally like apples and berries, clocks or extra hearts, as well as skulls, that make the player to lose the heart.\r\n\r\nAfter completing every two rounds, the player competes in a bonus round where she has to jump as many bears as possible to get a good bonus score. Successfully clearing twenty bears results in an additional bonus for performing the bonus stage perfectly.", "metacritic": null, "released": "1984-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-24T17:04:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c37/c37c753de270e87ba269c406286f4e9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["SEGA"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
