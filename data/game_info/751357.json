Basically, the more zombies you kill the faster they come and the more bullets you shoot the faster they come. The only problem is that it is very hard to play on a laptop touchpad. The controls are being worked on so it's better compatible with a touchpad and PS/XBX controller. This functionality can only be functional on PCs using Windows, Mac, or Linux using third-party software like JoyToKey. Other functionally will be added later one of which being a VR version. But until then, please enjoy SP Combat Ultimate! - Legionbus</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T07:41:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aef/aef83d65b4fdac5eaabe3b8ac1c71f67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Legionbus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
