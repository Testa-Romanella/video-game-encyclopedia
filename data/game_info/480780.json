A \u201cclade\u201d is a complete branch of the evolutionary tree, such as mammals, arthropods, and sauropsids (reptiles and birds together). Can you make a triple match with one card of each clade? What about animals of the water, land, and air? How fast can you spot the two cards that go with the first card to make a \u201ctriple\u201d?   <br/><br/>Features<br/>* Science notes about the three larger clades and the nine smaller clades, including bats, primates, whales, birds, lizards, winged insects, spiders, and crabs. <br/>* Modern animals, prehistoric animals (dinosaurs, mammoths, pterosaurs), or both<br/>* Play at your own pace.
