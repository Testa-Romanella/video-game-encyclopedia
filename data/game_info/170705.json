The goal of the game is to find an hidden word. You just have the number of letters and that's it.\r\n\t<br/>\r\nThis game has been designed for young kids, meaning that it is not possible to lose. you can pick all the letters up, the only end condition is to find the good ones.\r\n\t<br/>\r\nIn order to select letters, move your penguin below the desired one and just jump to get it. If it is part of the word, the letter will glow green. If not, it will glow red.\r\n\t<br/>\r\nAt the end of the game (when you have found the word), you have a specific screen appearing. You can restart a new word indefinitely.\r\n\t<br/>\r\nThe main advantage of this game is the  ability to create several dictionaries. Just add a subfolder in 'dictionary' folder, place a text file named dictionary.txt in it and (optionaly) a picture named logo.png (96x96pixels). you can add all the words you want, they will be randomly selected. It makes this game fit with your kid vocabulary.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>Controls<p>\r\nIn order to play, use the LEFT and RIGHT arrow KEYS to move your penguin. Press SPACE bar or UP arrow to jump and select a letter.\r\n\t<br/>\r\nYou can also use any controller pad plugged to your computer.
