The game can be played in the browser, however someone must host the game or run a server. This itch page contains the downloads required to be either a host or a server for Stone Parchment Clippers. The host download also allows the game to be played on a computer instead of using the web version.\u00a0The client download is the webgl stuff necessary for clients to connect from a website.\u00a0</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: The server version (headless) can be run in the command line. It takes an argument for the port to run on (serverPort=.......) and websocket port (socketPort=53094). The websocket port is different because each method of connection must use a different port.\u00a0Defaults are 53093 and 53094. If a client is having connection issues, try each port just in case.</p>\n<p>HOST INFO: If hosting a game of Stone Parchment Clippers, make sure to change the ip address field in the bottom to localhost and tell clients to connect to your ip and correct port (the port must be open to the internet / port forwarded in order for this to work).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-24T04:52:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e51/e51a8a65c1d8e8eae15653ba377d91ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["MequonMan"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
