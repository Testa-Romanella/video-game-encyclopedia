It's not like some tedious and boring games of spaceship which only tell you to put the laser gun in a fixed position.<br/></li><li>The current version of this game can offer you five component types, which are named joint, weapon, defense, flight and warehouse. These joints can determine the framework and motion mechanism of your spaceship. Weapon component and defense component can work as just what their names has described The flight component can provide impetus to spaceship, if you want a bigger spacecraft, the higher the power you will need. Warehouse component will offer you a place to store all kinds of materials you need, such as energy for your laser gun and shield, or shells for your kinetic guns.</li></ul><h3>A thrilling and exciting battle of barrage shooting</h3><ul><li>There\u2019s one thing to be noted!!! The spaceship is not a whole. It is connected by components. The break-down of one key component may reverse the situation. Imagine when you are destroying a  component of an enemy spaceship, a chain explosion reaction happened to other components connected to it.<br/></li><li>Or you can destroy enemy\u2019s flight component to have it lose impetus and be a complete useless object for you to defeat.<br/></li><li>Or you can destroy enemy\u2019s battery component to cut down its energy to make its laser gun a decoration.<br/></li><li>And so on</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T02:49:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/719/719c450c16b695c8cff3f91496cd9ea3.jpg", "website": "https://www.zhihu.com/people/chenjd-71/posts", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JinDing Chen"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["JinDing Chen"], "esrb_rating": null}
