Game Name: Annihilation Flag<br/>2. Genre: Platformer Puzzle<br/>3. Simple planning intention: We designed a game in which a large number of characters are controlled using flags, focusing attention on the theme of'flag' and using the flag used to lead people.<br/>4. Game introduction: A game in which the stray lambs are moved to the portal using the flag.<br/>5. How to play the game: Click on the flag to control the sheep around the flag. The red flag makes the sheep walk in the direction of the flag, and the blue flag makes the sheep jump in the direction of the flag. (There is a control text in the game folder!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T04:27:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f4/6f453882687202500931739eab78352b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ProtossGame"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
