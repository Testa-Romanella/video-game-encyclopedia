This game is a result of the Roll-A-Ball tutorial outlined by an awesome youtuber by the name of BMO who simplified the broken rollaball tutorial on unitylearn.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can see his tutorial here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I cannot recommend that you subscribe to him enough as he has a few simple and easy tutorials for core components when working with unity that are short and to the point. This man is a king.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Also, big thanks to the user named vandaar on the unity forums who helped me with the player movement script.
