WASD and space for movement. Press E to throw banana, which the wolves will eat and stop attacking you for a while. Cut down trees to gain boost in speed. Wolves spawn periodically. Was a test on procedural generation, animations, models, 3d graphics and sounds.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T04:55:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f82/f82778963c69ce597e8387927ee58d58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PRMantis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
