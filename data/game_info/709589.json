The current build converts midi files into charts to be played. It also\u00a0tracks the combo but I still need to create the sprites to reflect the scoring system. I have three other songs I would like to chart and add a menu where you can use I and J to toggle, and space to select. To keep with the upbeat theme I think adding some screen shake for space bar hits would be super cool, and using those notes sparingly (i.e.\u00a0at the drop that this build cuts off at). However it is 3am right now so I better sleep. I hope you enjoy it so far!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>J: Left Hit</p>\n<p>I: Right Hit</p>\n<p>Space: Bar Hit</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T06:31:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/336/336084328c9a96d5ab9625760e5b6fbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jameswcastro"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
