Well, it's a video game that comes with every copy of the game and is played with real money.\n\nThe cash is held by a bank where you are able to withdraw and spend money, but you eventually get killed and spend all your gold coins for a short period.\n\nWe get the idea that when you are a dragon, you deal with your two cousins, the Greys. However, the Greys don't always like their human-bashing, so you need to work together with them, and if you happen to be still alive, you can exchange your gold coins with their dragon form.\n\nYou can also destroy really bad monsters by combining other dragon forms.\n\nThere are also a lot of other possibilities for this game and many people still play it daily. So if you're looking for a new video game you can play with your money and go far from your aluminium monstrosity in these days of pocket square gaming.\n\nSource: Outhouse Media\n\nLike this: Like Loading...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T09:54:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ef/9ef6d5f4910fdf9dbfc02f343e8746b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
