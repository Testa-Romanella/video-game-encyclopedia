On top of that, the game had to be made so that it could only be played using one button, kind of a 'flappy bird' type concept.</p><p>I went into this task with the intention of making a really stupid looking game, I am confident I managed to pull that off. It was really badly made, it is unbalanced, choppy and largely incomplete. But it is just a rapid prototype, I simply did what I needed to in order to see if it could be a decent game concept, which it wasn't.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8f/c8f78af8f71bf2cdda4edcd89d8342c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kyle Gordon"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
