Currently it has no ending and is quite buggy because it's my first completed 3D game. I recommend downloading it if you want the full experience. Let me know what you think :~)</p>\n\n<strong>CONTENT</strong>The Tower\u00a0is an\u00a0experimental art-game, and doesn't follow a story or plot which is not for everyone. It has a creepy atmosphere, but shouldn't be too scary. The writing for this has transformed into\u00a0 another project that I am working on currently. The game has no ending, and is quite short.<strong>FUTURE PLANS</strong>At the moment, what will happen with this project is up in the air. Most likely, it will retire and not be updated because the project is very disorganized and difficult to update. I didn't know as much about Godot as I do now, and there are many things I would do differently. That's not to say that a project like this might not happen in the future, or the game might be repurposed. Stay tuned.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n<strong>CONTROLS</strong><strong>WASD\u00a0</strong>to walk<strong>Z</strong>to zoom<strong>E</strong>to interact<strong>SHIFT</strong>to sprint<strong>MOUSE</strong>to look\r\n<p>\u2606\u2606\u2606 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2606\u2606\u2606\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u2606\u2606\u2606<br/></p>\n<p>If you liked anything about this project, please comment your thoughts or follow me to see new games when they come out.
