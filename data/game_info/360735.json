We decided to make a tower defense game with only one tower. Instead of building new towers, you should change location of your tower to one of possible places.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Other features of the game:<br/>\u2013 minimalistic design inspired of the lack of drawing skills;<br/>\u2013 monsters are evil and you can kill them;<br/>\u2013 soundtrack uses only one note \u2013 C. We decided C is a boring name, so we called our game B#;<br/>\u2013 no lootboxes;<br/>\u2013 no microtransactions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We hope you\u2019ll have as much fun as we did while developing B#.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T19:21:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08e/08e051dfadcbe9443be258b0cf0a4ed7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["keepcalmgaming"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
