Blender for modeling, and Krita for 2d images and textures.</p>\n<p>Instructions are in game. However its very simple just use the sphere connected to your controller to push the purple ball to the goal on the other side of the maze.\u00a0(Or if your bored like my Wife, just wack it like a golf ball and watch it fly...)</p>\n<p>Any controller button should reset the maze.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ba/7bac7c46890cb3602511f8ea1c54d519.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["louki0101"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
