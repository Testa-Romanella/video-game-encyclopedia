Out-do your friends by creating complex shots using various tricks at your disposal. If you score, your friends have to match your shot by completing all the tricks you made. More tricks means a harder shot to make! Fail a shot enough times and you're out! The last player standing wins.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/>Bounce Pads. Cannons. Mid-Air shots. Mix and match tricks, and place new objects down over the course of the game for a gradual increase of chaos! Maybe you'll find a unique\u00a0 combination of tricks\u00a0that no-one else can perform?\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game requires\u00a02-5 players to play.\u00a0</p><p>https://thoseawesomeguys.com/prompts/\u00a0- UI Prompts<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T09:54:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/285/285b757816c76b650764c9e1c3c1e0ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lewis_Hill"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
