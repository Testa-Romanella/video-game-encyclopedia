The movement arose after World War 1 in response to the widespread trauma and suffering it caused. Because reality was so grim and difficult to cope with, artists became interested in making art that was less bound by logical rules and more inwardly-focused, and they turned their attention toward dreams and the subconscious mind.</p>\n<p>This demo level is based on the work of Magritte.\u00a0The background, enemies, obstacles, and collectible items are inspired by several of his paintings, including <em>Golconda</em>, <em>The Treachery of Images</em>, <em>The Lovers, Meditation,</em> and <em>The Son of Man</em>.</p>\n<p>Move left and right\u00a0using the arrow keys and jump with the spacebar. Win by collecting all 5 items while avoiding enemies and falls.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T06:12:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9e/a9e1867a2511349cb123ef972c29268e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lauren1204"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
