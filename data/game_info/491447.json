Alice returns to brave the depths of the Earth as well as the deep blue sea. These diabolical mazes are filled with fiendish foes and helpless piyos. Over the course of four game modes, you'll devise strategies that'll protect both you and your newfound friends.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>A variety of bonus items are found throughout the depths. Keys open the way to treasure-filled rooms while rods create instant walls for blocking adversaries. Manipulate the maze and its inhabitants to earn massive bonuses. Also, keep an eye out for various cameos. Color in their empty rooms and you're sure to be rewarded.<br/><br/>You don't have to be a pro-gamer to enjoy Space Mouse 2. The turn-based mode allows you all the time in the world to decide the next move.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Legendary Namco composer Junko Ozawa provides the music for this game. You may recall her previous works, which include Dig Dug II, The Tower of Druaga, Skykid, and Galaga 3. Ice Ribbon pro-wrestling superstar Risa Sera plays the role of Alice. Newcomer You is played by Miss iD2020 finalist and Melu Kishida award-winner Sensu.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>For over 30 years, Mikito Ichikawa has been creating games. Inspired by the classics of the past, his games present unique challenges. Oftentimes, they feature scenarios that are constantly changing. Players have to consider every move they make, no matter how minor it may seem. However, much like a sandbox, there's still plenty of room for creativity. With a little knowledge and inspiration, players of Mindware games can find creative solutions to the problems they face.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T02:58:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d60/d609cf5b7402123bfcbe0ee7eaa2f396.jpg", "website": "http://pinball.co.jp/games/SpaceMouse2/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 268, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mindware Co.,Ltd."], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Mindware Co.,Ltd."], "esrb_rating": null}
