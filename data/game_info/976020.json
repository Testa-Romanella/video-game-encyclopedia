Seemingly chess for idiots resembles regular chess. The game is played on the same board using the same pieces. However, this is where the similarities end, because everything that would discriminate intellectually against players was eliminated from the rules. Therefore, there are practically no rules, and players can make any move with any pieces and capture any number of opponent's pieces. The victory is determined by the IQ (the lower, the greater the chances of winning) and the decision of Ozjasz Goldberg.<br/><br/><strong>Weapons:</strong><br/><ul><li>Blowing<br/></li><li>Arrow<br/></li><li>Invisible hand of market<br/></li><li>Brushwood+<br/></li><li>Wozdoopy Grenade<br/></li><li>Inflation<br/></li><li>Hot Sauce<br/></li><li>And more...</li></ul><br/><strong>True story:</strong><br/>When I was going to primary school, there was this guy named Pawe\u0142, and during breaks I played a game with him which involved blowing own coin in turns to land on the opponent's coin. Years later, I met Pawe\u0142 and we remembered about this game, that day I couldn't sleep and I decided to copy this game to the computer. In addition to the coin mode, I added a chess mode and posted a video from a very early version of the game on a certain Facebook group where someone commented that it looked like Chess for idiots - it is a Polish political meme referring to a certain statement of a controversial politician, then I decided that this game will be a political satire. The game is therefore simultaneously a recreation of a physical game from my childhood, a parody of chess and a Polish political satire.<br/><br/><strong>Add to your wish list using the buttons above</strong><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-02T05:59:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/432/432ba0a623ddcf9e63094b7e94f2c566.jpg", "website": "https://www.tiktok.com/@warcoins", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 42, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Polish Hacker"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Polish Hacker"], "esrb_rating": null}
