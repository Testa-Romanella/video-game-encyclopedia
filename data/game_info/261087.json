It's very short, still requires tests and may contain some bugs.</p>\n<p><strong>VillageLord</strong></p>\n<p>[Cool description here]</p>\n<p>Game was created in 1 month for \"The Fall All-OGA Game Jam! 2018\". My original plan for project\u00a0was to create more idle-like game, where you could go afk and come back whenever you want. But result is completely different. In some cases my game is now similar to Settlers franchise - building stuff, exploring map etc.</p>\n<p>Game has simplified construction system - you only click on a tile and put a building.<br/>Economy system is somehow more fascinating -\u00a0 buildings generate one type of resource and require other, if you can't afford it - it won't generate anything.<br/>And the last\u00a0but not least: Military - recruit soldiers to defend your village. There are total of 5 unique units. Battles works like that: first soldier attacks random enemy, first enemy attacks random soldier etc.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Game is also full of easter eggs and references, so have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cdf/cdf75d7cd384fab563a3dd7c1245346d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["exewin"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
