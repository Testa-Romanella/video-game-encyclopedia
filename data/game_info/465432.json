Hope you enjoy the game!<br/></p>\n<p>How to play:<br/></p>\n<p>- WASD to move</p>\n<p>- Flashlight follows your cursor, point this at ghosts to stun them</p>\n<p>- Left click to catch stunned ghosts with your net</p>\n<p>- Right click to put ghosts back in the machines when you're standing near a vent</p>\n<p>- The ghost making machines spawn in ghosts on either side of the screen and they'll level up over time (shown on the red dial). The higher their level, the faster they'll spawn ghosts. You can slow ghost spawns and level down the machines by holding your flashlight on top of them. If the machines hit max level its game over, so keep them in check!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T08:48:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5c/a5c3492d05212cba453a5efc8a5d500c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BmeisterCD"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
