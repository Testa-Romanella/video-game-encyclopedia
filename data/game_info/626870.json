He has loaded you up with special powers so you can embarrass all the league's other cars.\r\n\n<p>Skip to Downloads</p>\n\r\nHow to Play\r\n<ul><li>You must spin out rival cars by <strong>ramming</strong>\u00a0them, catching them in your <strong>boost trail,</strong>\u00a0or <strong>spinning\u00a0</strong><strong>another car </strong>into them.</li><li>Spin out the required number of cars on each level to unlock the checkered <strong>flag.</strong>\u00a0Grab the <strong>flag</strong>\u00a0to advance.</li><li>You are <strong>invincible</strong>\u00a0while using your powers but vulnerable while you are not. Walls never hurt you, thanks to advanced bouncing science.</li><li>All your special powers always trigger at the same time. This consumes <strong>gel</strong>\u00a0because nothing is truly free.</li><li>If you run out of <strong>lives</strong>\u00a0or gel, the game is over... until you are brave enough to restart.</li><li>After you clear a level, your leftover <strong>gel</strong>\u00a0will convert to <strong>flex,</strong>\u00a0which is like a kind of score that measures how hard you have flexed in Hover Gulch.</li></ul>\r\nKeyboard controls\r\n<ul><li><strong>Arrow keys</strong>\u00a0to turn</li><li><strong>X</strong> to <strong>boost speed,</strong>\u00a0engage your <strong>ram,</strong>\u00a0and become <strong>invincible,</strong>\u00a0all at the same time</li><li><strong>Z</strong>\u00a0to skip scenes you've seen before</li><li><strong>Enter</strong>\u00a0to pause (and to quick-restart)</li></ul>\r\nHints\r\n<ul><li>As a hovercar, you have to complete your turn rotation before you start moving in the new direction. It's just how hovercars work, especially in the future. (Try turning a little on the early side)</li><li>There's a way to get one extra life per level, but it's risky.\u00a0</li><li>There's an even bigger secret, but it's <em>very</em>\u00a0risky.</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Audio, code, design, graphics, and writing by me, Rob Dubbin.</p>\n<p>Thanks to RALLY-X, Rocket League, Alfonzo's Bowling Challenge, and One Must Fall: 2097 for inspiring Hover Gulch in various ways.
