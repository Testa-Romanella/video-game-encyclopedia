Play as the window and keep your view on the ball. This game requires a game pad to play</p>\n<p>Controlls</p>\n<p>- Left analogue stick to move the window</p>\n<p>- 'back' button to quit</p>\n<p>- 'start' button to start</p>\n<p>- 'A' face button to restart</p>\n<p>Note that this game relies heavily on the resolution of your monitor so if you have an absurdly large of small monitor this game may not run as intended. It works perfectly on a 1920x1080 monitor. \u00a0Also if you are running windows 7 you may get a pretty funky effect . However \u00a0don't be alarmed because it can be easily fixed by opening a new window</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/866/86672ccd507a943df2ee124d14c37f6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Li_Macc"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
