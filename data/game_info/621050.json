The power of their love chains them together... or, well, I guess that's a literal chain. Well, ok, not exactly\u00a0a regular chain. This one has some wonky physics. Like it can go through walls. Weird I know.</p>\n<p>But Cannon and Ball will use any advantages they have to overthrow the king. Their connection may occasionally hold them back, but maybe it be used to pull them forward as well.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T21:18:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44d/44d406d4887a3237692887e445c5bc0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Pomegranate Curse"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
