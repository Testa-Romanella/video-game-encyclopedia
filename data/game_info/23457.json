The life of the last Undead Hunter twins was quiet and calm. They thought there weren't any monsters in the world anymore and the twins were the only pixel characters left. But suddenly one of them got nabbed by a humongous monster. And as the mystical old Gramps says - there is no other way to rescue the twin but to kill everything that moves!<br/><br/>Jet between peculiar places and times to find out who pulls the strings in this mysterious story!<br/><br/><br/><strong>\"Undead Hunter\"</strong> is an old-school one screen arcade game, where your protagonist is equipped with one of those wierd weapons of old times which were used at the very dawn of computer games to hunt monsters. But of course you can pick up a big deal of different power-ups during the game, like guns (including \"Tesla-gun\"), bombs, dynamite and all that. And even destroy monsters with your bare hands (bare legs to be honest), stomping them into the dust.<br/><br/>Mostly monsters in the game split into several spawns of smaller kind until you kill the smallest ones. Though some of them have only one form with a special ability. And yes, you are surely gonna face several bosses as well.<br/><br/><br/><ul><li> A multitude of different levels<br/></li><li> Huge variety of enemies and bosses to avenge<br/></li><li> Hard mode with alternative levels<br/></li><li> Different worlds (that's how we put our awesome animated backgrounds!) to travel<br/></li><li> Collectible awards for each mission<br/></li><li> A lot of different power-ups<br/></li><li> A bunch of deadly weapons<br/></li><li> Playable twins<br/></li><li> Quest and Survival modes<br/></li><li> Online score table<br/></li><li> High replayability<br/></li><li> Strong and beany narrative</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:07:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2a/f2aba8da6c01c0f0cd931acaf58be9ba.jpg", "website": "http://www.gameplay-labs.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 16}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 362, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Gameplay"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Gameplay"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
