Most\u00a0people don\u2019t think about what happens to all that water (and poop, food, etc.) when it gets flushed\u00a0down a toilet or goes down a sink. In each of these three games, you will learn how wastewater (and all\u00a0the stuff in it) can be recycled and reused! Play to learn how energy, water, and food for plants are\u00a0created from what you flush and test out how quickly you can make these recycled resources!</p><p>In the game settings you can change the volume, difficulty, and language (English or Spanish).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T11:03:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6c/d6c158d40f232b9b74b8de063da8e9d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["EarthGamesUW"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
