It is specifically the last battle between Giorno and The Cure. It may be short but I hope you have fun. If you want more there are small mini battles you can play by using character names from the book, so if you've read it, you'll get a lot more out of it. For the first week to month of this game's release, I'll be doing bug fixes so please comment about (and if you can, record) any bugs you find, afterwards I'll be moving on to other projects.</p>\n<p>Also this is a prototype of a prototype for another Jojo Game I have planned with the assistance of dmamet.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T08:38:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f35/f355d377f1ebece7b42ec867dd7155ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["red"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
