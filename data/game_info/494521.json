Your child will then slide the puzzle piece into its assigned location. Once the kid gets a piece close enough to its target location, the game assists the kid by snapping the piece into place. <br/>Every correct placement provides a colorful positive feedback to the kid amusement. Once kids complete the puzzle, a pleasant voice congratulates the kids on a their great work. <br/><br/>Tiltan Games (2013) LTD<br/>http://tiltangames.com/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T02:58:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05e/05efab635b70db10977efb8ed8b678b4_CBG4GMw.jpg", "website": "http://tiltangames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Tiltan Games"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Tiltan Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
