I feel like RPGs that are said to simulate fanfic don't really capture the nebulous imagination and narrative experience of a reader rendering (1) a lover and projecting cohesively a (2) Y/N (Your Name)/ Main Character/self-insert that doesn't sacrifice the thematic structures that are underpinned in a love story.\r\n</p>\n<p>Such as: Vulnerability, regret. Why we love really? or judgements (not long enough, too greedy etc) of the ones we had. The circumstances of our loving, and what it undoes in us when our hearts unfurl. This is what I hoped to capture in these stories and I hope you remember parts of your heart in playing them as well.\r\n</p>\n<p>I hope you remember, these things from your Lover.\r\n</p>\n<p>PS. let me know in the comments who calls you the most, how your play-thrus went.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T09:44:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc3/cc3bd88f71fa3538dcaa18b0f256d0c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Maria Mison"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
