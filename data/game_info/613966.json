We wanted to create a game similar to the old Mortal Kombat games, with a twist. The better player will have a hard time as the loser gets stronger by collecting Rage multiplier. Whenever you attack, you lose some of your rage points, and whenever damaged, the opponent earns rage points. It gets exponentially harder, and even a player with 1hp can win against a player with 100hp by one shotting them in the end.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T05:14:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e4/9e4620106bea89c566268ff1726e4bb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 297, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["aoakalin"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
