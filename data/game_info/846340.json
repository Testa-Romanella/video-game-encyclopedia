{"id": 846340, "slug": "empis", "name": "Empis", "name_original": "Empis", "description": "Empis is a turn-based strategy game that focuses on short and sweet multiplayer matches. Choose from individual factions each with their own unique units and upgrades, unlock technology, and build sprawling cities with buildings and fortifications.<h3>Micro 4x</h3>Empis is 4X distilled to its base processes and streamlined for quick matches so that you can get in and out as quickly as you'd like. Unlike large and lumbering 4X games that can go on for ages, Empis delivers fast paced and tactical gameplay to keep you engaged only for as long as you'd like it to.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Chess-like combat turns.</h3>Empis avoids problems often plaguing multiplayer turn-based games. Players go back and forth with combat while simultaneously building their cities.<h3>Unique Factions</h3>Choose between multiple factions - each with their own unique units and strategies. Play as the clever Falmorius, Steadfast Tyrus Imperium, or the ever Wild Keepers of the Forest.<br/><br/><br/><h3>New Worlds Every Time</h3>Empis procedurally generates new worlds for matches every time you play, giving you fresh and interesting chokepoints and control areas every time.<h3>Grow and Outsmart</h3>Expand your cities into this new world. Create synergies among your units and out-think your opponent's strategy. Destroy them at all costs.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T04:39:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/080/08057c24f56dbfa305bf629f485a9844.jpg", "website": "https://www.empisthegame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Colin Magerle", "Kyle Meadows"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Kyle Meadows"], "esrb_rating": null}
