Its the first game ive ever made and it was made for the Brakeys game jam. Updates may come but\u00a0<em>for now</em> it is just this. The reason i have a link to download the source code is so some of you can achieve the secret ending, which can only be gotten by changing some of the code in\u00a0Construct 3. Since it is the source code please if you see this game re uploaded somewhere else report whoever uploaded it cuz it wasnt me.\u00a0Yes i know it sucks, so go ahead and hate on me in the comments or feel free to say which ending you got first\u00a0:)\u00a0<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Some ideas i have:\u00a0 Expanding the map. Adding a new character named Spire. Giving Spire some more dialogue. Giving Spire some endings. Revealing who speaks in blue text.
