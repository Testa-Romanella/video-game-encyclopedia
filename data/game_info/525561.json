This, is <strong>puzzle</strong> a puzzle platformer where you control <strong>Rectangle</strong>, who aims to get to the end of and escape the cavern he got himself into! If your reading this now, this game is in <strong>heavy</strong> development, so keep that in mind. This is more or less an early access game, but I won't mention it too much as the term: \"early access\" is not really respected that much due to really bad early access games that launch broken and never go anywhere (I swear this game will not have the same fate). Anyways, just keep in mind that this is still in development and needs <strong>ALOT</strong> of work to be what I want it to be. That's enough from me folks, I may or may not create a youtube channel to document this process, but.... We'll see where we go.
