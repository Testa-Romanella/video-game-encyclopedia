More precisely, before and during the battle at Ho\u0159ice/Horschitz. Fight under the leadership of the legendary Jan \u017di\u017eka from Trocnov and experience the hardships of battle in this era! You will experience several days before and after the battle during the game, and your tasks will be to prepare the army for the fight, gather intelligence, earn the support of locals, and more.<br/><br/><br/>The game consists of 30+ missions that start with a short historical anecdote that CAN BE SKIPPED. Each mini-game is simple with a unique challenge, such as collecting coins on the map, racing around the prehistoric racing circuit of Gustav Havel, or fighting enemy knights. Experience history from the front seat and help Jan \u017di\u017eka win the civil war!<br/><br/><br/>You can play the game alone but also with your family or in a group of up to 4 friends on the keyboard/controllers. The game is well suited for kids, casual players, and playing with a girlfriend/boyfriend. You work together as a team, so it is OK if some of the players are beginners.<br/><br/><br/>I am a Ph.D. student indie developer. I have been developing the free2play franchise \"Engine Evolution\" for 6 years, and I have decided that I would like to try a different challenge. When the 600-year anniversary of this battle, which happened in my hometown, approached, I decided to capture this event in my next game.<br/><br/><strong>DISCORD COMMUNITY</strong><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-21T02:54:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11f/11f859f66731f194bc804dc465728832.jpg", "website": "https://www.battle-of-horice.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 474, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Petr \u0160im\u016fnek"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Petr \u0160im\u016fnek"], "esrb_rating": null}
