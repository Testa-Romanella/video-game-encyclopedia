There are fourteen game screens. There are three types of screens. First, there is a screen where you are given a tile with information and you must click the mouse on the best match. The tiles are static and stay in place. A second type is a set of multiple choice questions. And thirdly there are screens in which you are given an information tile and you must select the answer tile a group of moving tiles.\u00a0 Both the arrangement of the answers and the order in which the definitions appear are randomized each time the level is played.\u00a0 Users can press the \u201cH\u201d key in order to reveal the answer, but this will deduct points from the score. A printable report at the end shows the date, the name of the player and the final score.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The word list may be viewed and printed. This is a TOTAL FREEWARE Windows program. This means there are no ads, no registration, no collection of any data, no internet connection, and no limit to installations or distribution. The program will run on Windows versions 7 through 10.\u00a0 Download the zipped setup program, extract it and run it.<br/>NOTE: This program will run fairly well on Linux (Linuxmint &amp; Peppermint OS) when used with Wine or PlayOnLinux. Game play is okay, although viewing the word list and printing the end report may be compromised depending on your Linux system.<br/>====================================</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T03:41:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/465/46545116f0c6716eb21bd612b6be6c83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rtcgames"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
