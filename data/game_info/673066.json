For this game jam, we have implemented some concepts from cognitive behavioral therapy to help the player reframe negative thoughts into positive ones.   </p>\n<p>You are the commander of the <em>Brain Ship</em>. And the protagonist, who is in a state of mental anguish, needs your help! It feels like everything in their life is in <em>ruins</em>: their health is terrible, their relationships are falling apart, and their grades are slipping. As a result, their mind has become rampant with negative thoughts.   </p>\n<p>As these bad thoughts emerge in the protagonist\u2019s mind, you must operate the <em>Brain Ship </em>to eliminate any of the \u2018enemy\u2019 negative words. If the player is successful, the resulting sentence will be a positive one. For example, the sentence \u201cI will <em>never</em> be good enough\u201d transforms to \u201cI <em>will</em> be good enough\u201d. Eventually, as you help the player to generate more positive thoughts, the realms of their life which once troubled them (health, sleep, relationships, school) will slowly begin to improve. \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>The game implements this jam\u2019s theme of \u201cruin\u201d through the backstory and overarching narrative. Since the protagonist feels like their life is in <em>ruins</em>, it is your job to help them reframe their thoughts and rebuild their self-esteem. In terms of social impact, we hope that this game can be a framework for people with anxiety, depression, and other mental health struggles to improve their well-being.   </p>\n\n<p><strong>Commands</strong>\n</p>\n<p>For the introductions screen (when there is text on screen providing backstory) press the spacebar to see the next line.
