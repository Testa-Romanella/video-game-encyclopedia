I wanted the ability to give playable games to others and look to doing more.\u00a0 The game is a fully audio based game where you are recommended to play hands free and voice commands. Please listen carefully, the game is hard as it forces you to use only one sense that some may take for granted! Hope you enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T07:34:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c4/9c460b13cf29f27a0b7effe9e1b5461d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["terribleguide0426"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
