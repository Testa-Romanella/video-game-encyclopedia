The game structure is based on a day &amp; night cycle, triggered by a specific game event: when the controlled player is too much stressed. In the day, the player will have to try his best to avoid annoying and pressing coworkers that increase the player stress when they are near enough to him. When the player is max stressed, the game pahse will go into the night, and the game scene will change into a chaotic office, where all the coworkers will run away from the player, since he will try to kill them because he went insane.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>The game inputs available</strong>\u00a0are: PC Keyboard, Controller\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Game istructions:\u00a0\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>On day</strong>: use input to avoid contact with coworkers\r\n</li><li><strong>On night</strong>: use input in the opposite directions where the angry protagonist will try to go, to hold back him from killing his coworkers\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>This game has been developed during the Global Game Jam 2022, where \"Duality\" was the theme proposed.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Team composition:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Lo_Zar - Giovanni Meazza - Gameplay programming -\u00a0https://itch.io/profile/lo-zar\r\n</li><li>Fraffer - Francesco Ferrai - Gameplay programming -\u00a0https://itch.io/profile/fraffer</li><li>Ecchi-Sensei - Giuseppe Abagnale - Tech Artist\u00a0 -\u00a0</li><li>Loxar - Gianluca Gentile - UI\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T10:03:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e8/1e86e954d4b1fe389e6d6084fe591905.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ecchi-Sensei"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
