You can control 7 characters through the main story and more in the additional chapters.<br/>They all move their eyes, they change facial expressions, and they have some peculiar behaviours.<br/><br/>As the story proceeds, the player has to take some choices, affecting the characters mood and sometimes even the plot.<br/><br/><br/><br/>For most of the time the player controls a character surrounded by his/her friends.<br/>Each one has some kind of skill to be used at the right moment, and sometimes even their personality will be important to solve a puzzle.<br/><br/>Some puzzles can be solved by a single character, while other must be solved using the whole squad cooperation.<br/><br/>As I said, the game aims to give psychological horror vibes.<br/>So keep in mind that this game is not for everyone! Some scenes are disturbing, some scenes may give you anxiety, and some other scenes are extremely sad.<br/><br/>Characters are constantly called to face their difficult past, and to go through their scary present.<br/>They need to hide, to take terrible decisions and sometimes even to fight for their lives.<br/><br/>...But after all, your choices can lead you to the best possible ending, and if you fail, you can always try again.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T10:08:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58d/58dd27a1d555a6b872b218b2f7822910_5wA92Dr.jpg", "website": "https://www.suiarts.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 280, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Stefano Mazzotta"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Stefano Mazzotta"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
