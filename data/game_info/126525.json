If the Critter catches you, it'll eat all the bees you're carrying, so you have to be careful.</p>\n<p>Critters love cookies more than they love bees, though, and as luck would have it, you're carrying a couple. If you get in trouble, you can distract the Critter so you can get away safely with your bees.</p>\n<p>Beware, though - the more bees you have in your hive, the more desperate the Critter will get...</p>\n<p>Beebold's music and sound effects were composed by maple syrup. &lt;3<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f1/5f17b8dbd8f5925529d7e98c86d18269.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mischievess"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
