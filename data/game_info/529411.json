Traverse the treetops of a dense forest and avoid predators as you climb trees and hop from branch to branch to eat tasty leaves. Eat enough and you are able to\u00a0metamorphose into an exquisite butterfly, all\u00a0in order to reach that flower on the forest floor.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>\r\nCredits\r\nArtist\r\nSarah (Sami) Mirekua\r\nProgrammers\r\nTyler Gentry\r\nEvan Shi\r\nLevel Design\r\nTyler Gentry\r\nEvan Shi\r\nSound Design and Music\r\nJustin Hung", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T06:20:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/267/267bb0d236ab1bdb3e44b72db14f1de1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["alwayssami", "tygentry", "grishhung", "OVenege"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
