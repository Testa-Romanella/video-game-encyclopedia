The game serves not only as an educational tool but also as a marketing strategy for using toothpaste.\u00a0 \u00a0In the game, players are tasked with eliminating teeth bacteria from the teeth roots by hitting them with a virtual toothbrush. The more bacteria eliminated within a given time frame, the higher the score achieved. If players miss five bacteria, the game is lost. The game is similar to classic hammer-hit arcade games, and losing five bacteria ends the game. There are two types of bacteria in the game: green for 10 points and purple for 50 points, with the same amount of points lost for missing them.\u00a0 \u00a0This advergame can be utilized as a marketing tool in a variety of settings, such as trade shows and events, where players can participate and potentially win vouchers or prizes provided by the advertising company. It will help in creating brand awareness and also provide an interactive way of promoting healthy habits among children.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T20:03:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f09/f0950e09d37f46109dfebb06f3537853.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["esraa_kasem"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
