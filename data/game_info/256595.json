Embark (ha, ha, bark...) on a quest to bury a very important bone. Suck up blocks with your dirtpack and build into the sky to get them out of the way. The higher you build, the more power-ups you'll find to help you dig deeper. Can you reach the bottom... or the top?<br/></p>\r\nHIGHLIGHTS\r\n<ul><li> No baddies! Just you, a big pile of dirt, and a huge, blank canvas.\r\n</li><li> Unlock power-ups like new colors, hats, and even a jetpack.\r\n</li><li> Work towards the end-game, or simply have fun making pictures with dirt blocks.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1de/1decb2b365b291484712219b3d7189ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Roppy Chop Studios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
