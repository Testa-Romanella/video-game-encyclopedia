Limitation is a roguelike, and theme is empty. Made in 2.5 Days using pre made assets.</p>\n<p>You must make it as deep as possible into the slime dungeon to harvest their souls. Balance spending souls on upgrades and keeping the soul guage full so that it doesn't become EMPTY.</p>\n<p>I haven't had time to implement story or good UI, as I wanted to focus mainly on the code. But I like to think you are sending souls to the dungeon owner to stop him from kicking you out early.</p>\n<p>Lots of improvements that could have been made, more enemies, bosses, better feedback and more juice. But overall happy with my first ever game jam entry, I've never done procedural map generation before so that was fun to learn.</p>\n<p>All feedback welcome!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-24T05:19:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e92/e9255dff5d099f7dd3e91893fc5882dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Critchley"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
