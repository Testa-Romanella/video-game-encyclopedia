Kirby must travel through an assortment of levels, \n      battling an exotic array of enemies (both new and familiar) determined \n      to stop him from completing his mission. Always armed with his trusty \n      ability to swallow enemies and gain special attacks, Kirby can also \n      unite with some of his animal friends and make use of their particular \n      talents. Featuring detailed graphics, challenging boss battles, and the \n      distinct charm of a Kirby game, it's no wonder this title is considered \n      a classic.\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
