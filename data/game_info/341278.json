A lot of ideas are already made on paper, but had no time to make them work.<br/><br/>I really like to continue this project because it was great to make it and i know there are tons of features i can add.<br/>I don't \u00b4plan it to be the next Stardew Valley but it will be great if i can make a longer game and that's why save features should be improved ASAP.<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy them, if you have any ideas or notice a bug, please let me know, or if you only want to make a comment, it will be wellcome.<br/><br/>CONTROLS:<br/>Use arrow keys to move or ASWD, X and E are action keys.<br/>If you are using a mobile device, just click on the simulated controls. I could not have the chance to check the inventory, i'm sorry.<br/><br/>INSTRUCTIONS<br/>Talk to the seeds to buy them and then plant them on the field.<br/>Water them and see them raising.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/032/032b26fa19c810ac43f5c29932b67f62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sipsop"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
