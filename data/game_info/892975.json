The goal is to join or create a match, and just eliminate other players. The base game-mode is free-for-all (FFA), meaning that you attack everything and everyone with no remorse.<br/><br/><strong>What features does it have?</strong><br/>Currently, the game includes features such as:<br/><ul>- Double Jumping</ul><ul>- Proximity Chat</ul><ul>- Custom Matches</ul><ul>- 2 maps to select from</ul><br/><strong>Gameplay</strong><br/>After creating a match yourself or joining one, you will get put into the map that was selected by the host. Leaving the spawn area, you can press <strong>E</strong> to pick a snowball while you're on the ground. <strong>Left-clicking</strong> throws the snowball, and if you hit the enemy, they die and they have to wait until they respawn. Jumping while airborne enables you to jump again, and open proximity chat allows the player to communicate with others. Be careful not to use up all your stamina, or you'll have to wait until it recharges!<br/><br/>Please note: when creating a match, you can choose the map you'd like.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T04:18:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a6/5a666d51e095967c73bf770c396571a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ImBananaCrazy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["ImBananaCrazy"], "esrb_rating": null}
