The fuller version of the game is available on Steam Early Access at www.gornvr.com\u00a0 . The full version features more polish, more weapons, a campaign, literal eyepopping and better gameplay.</p>\n<p>I'd like to thank the itch.io community for the support and help in making GORN - without you guys it definitely would not be possible. I hope the final version lives up to everyone's expectations!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ad/2ad90a2df98d7edd6a4552ce485c1ee8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 237, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["raithza"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
