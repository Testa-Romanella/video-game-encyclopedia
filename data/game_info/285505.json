The players play as Sumo Wrestlers that lose weight upon taking hits from the opposing player, but can quickly gain it back by consuming delicious Japanese delicacies. Less weight means more speed, but be careful - it also makes it easier for your opponent to kick you off the arena!</p>\n<p>The game features intense fighting for two players locally. There are three different arenas to choose from and lots of food. The mechanics are simple to understand but hard to master.</p>\r\n\r\nControls\r\nKeyboard\r\nPlayer 1\r\n<p><strong>WASD</strong> - Move</p>\n<p><strong>Space</strong> - Jump</p>\n<p><strong>J</strong> - Attack</p>\n\r\nPlayer 2\r\n<p><strong>Arrow keys</strong> - Move</p>\n<p><strong>Numpad 0</strong> - Jump</p>\n<p><strong>Numpad 4</strong> - Attack</p>\n\r\nController\r\n<p><strong>Left stick</strong> - move</p>\n<p><strong>A</strong> - Jump</p>\n<p><strong>X</strong> - Attack</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-18T04:38:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80e/80ec5e7e9bec899e3f5085b9e22d878b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["isoaho", "siiri"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
