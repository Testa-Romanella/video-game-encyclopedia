{"id": 526322, "slug": "zapling-bygone", "name": "Zapling Bygone (itch)", "name_original": "Zapling Bygone (itch)", "description": "<p><strong>Zapling Bygone is a 2d metroidvania where you play as Zapling, a dancing tentacle alien.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Fast and responsive controls focused on minimising the gap between your brain and your controller. Everything responds instantly with absolutely zero horizontal inertia, and I NEVER take control away from the player. You should feel fully in control from the moment you launch the game to the moment you see the end credits. (You can even control the dancing!)</p>\n<p>All bosses have predictable movesets that evolve throughout the battle, creating a real sense of achievement once you slay them. Once you kill a boss Zapling collects the skull and can equip it to unlock new powers as well as the ability to tweak your current abilities by pimping it out with unique charms.</p>\n\n\n<p>This planet is as unknown to Zapling as it is to you. Explore the somewhat-habitable planet and fight through its various threats. Uncover the dark history that left the land to be a shadow of what it once was.<br/>Explore a vast interconnected world littered with secrets in every room. Find game-changing charms, unique collectable statues, lore, and of course- new dance moves. <br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Zapling may be one of last of his kind, an asylum seeker fleeing from his home planet that has been ravaged by war. His task is to find a new home for his species to grow again, and perhaps thrive. Could this planet be the one? <br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Hi, I'm Stevie!</p>\n<p>I'm a solo dev working hard on my passion project and enjoying every minute of it!. All I really want is people enjoy it as much as I do. I LOVE chatting with the community in Discord and making this game the best it can be.</p>\n\n<br/><br/>\n<p>Wishlist on Steam</p>\n<p><strong>Controller is recommended but not essential.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T06:28:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/243/24317cc309e773fd171710edef9dcc98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["9FingerGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
