{"id": 15689, "slug": "the-deer", "name": "The Deer", "name_original": "The Deer", "description": "<p>The Deer is an indie history education game developed by Fabio Ferrara and Giulia Airoldi.</p>\n<h3>Story</h3>\n<p>The game follows a deer living in the Pleistocene epoch that goes through the world&#39;s woods and gathers provisions to survive the winter.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The Deer is a purely educational experience designed mainly for children. The players control a deer that goes through the woods. No enemies are present in the game at all. All the game&#39;s assets are hand-drawn as well as hand-animated. </p>\n<p>As the players go through the woods of the Ice Age, floating tooltips will appear on the screen, telling them about different aspects of life and nature during that historical period. At some points of gameplay, the players will encounter puzzles, which help the players memorize various facts about the Ice Age. The players will also witness several time periods as they progress through the game, starting with Spring that is followed by Summer and Autumn, and Winter, which finishes the game. </p>\n<p>There are no bad ending present in the game, as the players will get the provisions necessary for the deer in any way. There is a little degree of interactivity present in the game, as the only thing the players can do is to move the deer, solve puzzles, and admire the game&#39;s drawn environments.</p>\n<p>There are no T-Rexes in the game, as they have already gone extinct several millions of years before the events of The Deer.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-25T22:52:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edc/edcc5b73fe333c9ebb110e439801e25d.jpg", "website": "http://www.chubbypixel.com", "rating": 1.72, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 41, "owned": 932, "beaten": 9, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 13}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 8, "ratings_count": 54, "suggestions_count": 298, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 54, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Fabio Ferrara", "Giulia Airoldi", "Dodo Digital"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Chubby Pixel", "Dodo Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
