It allows you to control a character in a third-person perspective and interact with people and objects in a sci-fi setting that I had arranged\u00a0using free pre-made assets. This experience allows the players to traverse two areas: The Resistance base and the city of Eden itself. Roam around and talk to people to learn who they are, receive hints, and learn about what else is going on in the area. You will find out about their troubles and choose to assist. There are plenty of dialogue options to choose from, so character reactions can be different each time. Your actions may even have consequences.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was created as a portfolio piece to showcase my skills in Unity and the Dialogue System by Pixel Crushers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here I demonstrate a blend of skills including:</p>\n<ul><li>Narrative Design</li><li>Environmental Storytelling</li><li>Dialogue Branching</li><li>Timeline/Animations</li><li>Cinematography</li><li>Quests<br/></li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Assets are used from the following packs:</p>\r\nEnvironment Assets:\r\n<p>City Assets Volume 1 FREE</p>\r\nhttps://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/exterior/city-assets-volume-1-fre...\r\n<p>Free Sci-Fi Office Pack</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/free-sci-fi-office-...</p>\n<p>Low Poly Street Pack</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/low-poly-street-pack...</p>\n<p>Neo City Free Sample Kit</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/neo-city-free-sampl...</p>\n<p>NYC Block #6<br/></p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/nyc-block-6-16272#pu...</p>\n<p>Sci-Fi Construction Kit</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/sci-fi-construction...<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Character Models:</strong></p><p>Mixamo Models : Ely (by K.Atienza), Astra, and Eve (by J.Gonzalez)</p>\n<p>https://www.mixamo.com/#/</p>\n<p>Asuna</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/sci-fi/free-test-c...</p>\n<p>Cyberpunk Man</p><p>https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/cyberpunk-man-da0af91a6f434e43bdb02f9f60e473c3<br/></p><p>Renegade Sci Fi Character</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/sci-fi/sci-fi-char...<br/></p>\n<p>Sci Fi Warrior</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/sci-fi/sci-fi-warr...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T23:32:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e26/e26c41188e0be380f8ccbab59a526cc3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 241, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Michelle Quiroz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
