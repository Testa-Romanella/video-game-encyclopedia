You awake from your disturbed slumber to hear deep growling from the woods. Running outside into the cold night, you see piercing red eyes approaching in the darkness.</p>\n<p>You reach for your pistols...</p>\n<p>---<br/></p>\n<p>Click the brass bolts, wheels and locks to load each pistol. When the hammer cocks back, you're ready to hit the trigger. \u00a0If you don't reload in time, a beast will reach you. If you fail to load the gun fully and try to fire, it will misfire and hurt you!</p>\n<p>Music graciously provided by Paws Menu\u00a0</p>\n<p>Submission for LOWREZJAM 2017</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/958/9580bce8667e1e0cb5560945d1c69b86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dan Emmerson"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
