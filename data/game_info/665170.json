{"id": 665170, "slug": "chunky-runnings", "name": "Chunky Runnings", "name_original": "Chunky Runnings", "description": "<p>An autorunner racing game in which you have to adjust your size by eating to overcome the obstacles of the racetrack and win the race.</p>\n<p>At the start of the game, all players / AI characters start rolling forward. On the track, food items can be collected, which make the players grow and thus give advantages (e.B. penetration and ramming power, speed, etc.). During the race, you have to overcome the various traps and obstacles with the help of your body size. An example of this would be holes in the map, which can only be overcome if the character is large enough so that you do not fall into it. Other (modular) obstacles can either be pierced, bypassed or driven through, whereby you can also block enemies through targeted destruction. Whoever reaches the goal first wins.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T05:00:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a49/a49acf60d99ad2bdbb81dd1e4011d482.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["susi2301"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
