However, a series of serious unidentified explosions occurred shortly after it took off. The crashing of \u201cNoah\u201d resulted in severe natural disasters and pollution, thus drastically reducing the number of the population on Earth. After years of hard work from surviving scientists, improvement on the environment still could not be seen on Earth. As resources on Earth are about to be exhausted, the director of the research institute decided to release all staff for them to seek hopes of survival among the wilderness and remains.<br/><br/><br/>After the game outline came out, the voice of YK sounded in my mind. The reverberations that hit me deep in my heart coincided with the core ideas that Requiescat wanted to bring to the players; perhaps because the team had some personal relationships with the musicians , I boldly visited the musicians with only the outline. Unexpectedly, they also have a lot of ideas on game scripting and production, so that the project can collide and spark a special spark in the early stage.<br/>YK is not just making the game soundtrack for Requiescat, but we have tailor-made a game that can touch you and me.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T03:44:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8aa/8aaba7e29851963aab87aa52a387c963.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 429, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GameBarley CO.,LTD."], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["GameBarley CO.,LTD."], "esrb_rating": null}
