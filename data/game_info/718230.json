The game difficulty\u00a0 per level is so gradual that \u00a0it feel like a tutorial until level 5. So yeah. It totally need more level.<br/></p>\n<p>As of right now there's sound that stick \u00a0even tho \u00a0it should of died.<br/>Will make sure to end\u00a0 this none sense in the next build.</p>\n<p>StatsGUI \u00a0is not accurate on death player, Red code on death player and operator on death player. Other stats in the Stats GUI should work as intended.\u00a0 No impact in gameplay. I probably will modify the look of it so it's more understandable .<br/></p>\n<p>Menu with settings but only the option for fullscreen work.(The \u00a0option for fullscreen is not enable and you start fullscreen so there's that to rectify) It a mess. Don't bother.<br/></p>\n<p>Music\u00a0 but nothing to be hype about.\u00a0 Use\u00a0 various music i made over the years. I messed up the speed \u00a0so everything sound\u00a0 a little weird. I made a mute button just in case\u00a0.(In Pause Menu)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>DESCRIPTION CORE MECHANIC:</strong></p>\n<p>SPHERE O PATH IS A HYBRID RUNNER GAME. YOU PLAY AS A SPHERE AND YOU\u00a0 TRAVERSE YOUR WAY TO THE END. <br/></p>\n<p>Instead of jumping over obstacles \u00a0vertically\u00a0 or dodging obstacles horizontally. The player will fall continuously and need to dodge obstacles in all axis.<br/>You may halt the continuous fall by floating.(Ability)<br/>Almost forgot to mention. The continuous\u00a0 fall act like gravity will do. The momentum will keep growing gaining speed in free fall.\u00a0 To\u00a0 survive the player will have no choice but to use float to survive and/or various else ability.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY:</strong></p>\n<p>Movement Control with W,A,S,D</p>\n<p>Space Bar to Float</p>\n<p>LeftShift for Turbo</p>\n<p>Slowdown time with F</p>\n<p>Rewind time with R</p>\n<p>Change Camera Distance with C or\u00a0 Scroll Wheel<br/></p>\n<p>Change Style of \u00a0Follow Camera with V Classic/Pro</p>\n<p>Q and E do nothing as of now. But my goal is to add a new Ability<br/>if you got any suggestions on what should that ability is comment it down below.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>BASIC GAMEPLAY:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Avoid getting in contact with red code or operators. Finish the level before time run out.</p>\n<p><strong>COMPLEX GAMEPLAY :</strong><br/></p>\n<p>the\u00a0 timer countdown.</p>\n<p>I was not to keen on making this game with a scoring system in mind.</p>\n<p>So i made something different with a countdown system that change overtime with some RNG involve.</p>\n<p><strong>Death:</strong></p>\n<p>Death progression on countdown.</p>\n<p>Dying for the first time will activate a countdown of 5 minutes.</p>\n<p>Dying 2 to 5 time will reduce the countdown time for 15 seconds each death.</p>\n<p>Dying 6 to 10 time will reduce the countdown time for 30 seconds each death.</p>\n<p>Dying more then 11 time will reduce the countdown time for 1 minute each death.</p>\n<p><strong>Particle Hit:</strong></p>\n<p>Every particle that hit a red code have a chance to do (only if countdown was activated(1 death))</p>\n<p>It will take 5 seconds before every chance will begin. Only one demand at a time. If the red code denied entry it will be ready for another chance.</p>\n<p>70% chance to denied entry inside Red code. Reducing time for 5 seconds.</p>\n<p>Ready for another attack.</p>\n<p>20% chance to get entry inside Red code. Will self destruct and Add time for 15 seconds.</p>\n<p>10% chance to get entry inside Red code but the system defense got inform of the deed.</p>\n<p>Sending a Operator to replace the self destructed Red code and Add time for 10 seconds.</p>\n<p><strong>On Contact With:</strong></p>\n<p>Contact With Red code will self destruct contacted Red code and reduce time for 15 seconds.</p>\n<p>Contact With Operator will self destruct contacted Operator and reduce time for 15 seconds.</p>\n<p>Operator on Operators. Will self destruct and Add time for 15 seconds each Operator self destruction.</p>\n<p>Operator on Redcodes. Will Self destruct and Add time for 15 seconds each Red code and Operator self destruction.</p>\n<p>Operator on Wall, Bounce and Glue. Will Self destruct and Add time for 15 seconds.</p>\n<p><strong>Why a Runner Game:</strong></p>\n<p>I know the runner genre is over saturate . The game was mostly created to get up to speed with C# without having to search every little code i wanted to add. I used Brackeys tutorial on the runner game for the base project. \u00a0It was easier to add new \u00a0idea over the same project following\u00a0 other tutorial. I tried creating project before\u00a0 looking at Brackeys tutorial to no avail. I kept getting stuck in the smallest detail.</p>\n<p>After getting the base started something weird happens. My mind could not comprehend the code in front me. I couldn't even see what my script did and why. I was \u00a0in a blank state. After revisiting all my script one by one and understood what was happening. It was a much easier ride to push more idea into the game without some invisible hand\u00a0 telling me what should i do next.</p>\n<p>Since the idea wasn't really about making a game but learning how to make a game. <br/></p>\n<p>Ill keep\u00a0 working on it hence why it still in\u00a0 In development\u00a0 to keep me updated while i start new projects.</p>\n<p><strong>IN DEVELOPMENT:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Will it differ from what it is now. Highly doubt it. \u00a0It will be more about making it bug free as possible, make more level\u00a0 and finish the settings menu. I may add new thing but the core mechanic/gameplay &amp; models wont change.</p>\n<p>Don't be afraid to give suggestions . If i find the idea excellent \u00a0i could change my mind on not changing any core mechanic/gameplay or models.</p>\n<p>If my game is publish online \u00a0for the most part is to receive objective criticism. For me that is a necessary step and is really important. It give me perspective on how \u00a0to keep going with my projects.<br/></p>\n<p>GOOD LUCK!<br/>AND\u00a0 HAVE FUN!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T04:17:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a9/6a90ad036c266e437be02e8308dde0eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Digressive"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
