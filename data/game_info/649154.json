This game was made for Major Jam 4 with a theme of Cosmic and a limitation of the player has to cheat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>How to play: A and\u00a0 D\u00a0to move left and right with\u00a0W\u00a0or Space to jump. There is also a directional dash on Shift. Interact with objects with E. The computer has rooms that you can drag with the mouse. Dragging one onto the other switches them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thoughts: This was my first game jam, so I tried to go small. I think I went a little big as I didn't add as many levels as I wanted. Also, how the \"cheating\" works isn't very explained well in game I think. I also couldn't figure out how to get it in HTML without it breaking.\u00a0\u00a0I'm happy I managed to finish it though.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T03:33:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fb/5fb09ff848cc545ec22c57c3908ce9da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Snapgon"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
