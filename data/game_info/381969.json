Tribes will in return provide you with offerings allowing you to create more resources. </p>\r\nHow To\r\n<p>There will be 3 different tribes (Blue/Water, Green/Wood, Yellow/Ore) that will appear soon after you\u2019ve placed their corresponding resource. Their inhabitants will wander around during the day to bring back resources to their tribe\u2019s houses, then after a hard day of labor get to bed at night.\r\nEach tribe is independant, meaning they require all types of resources to survive. They\u2019re also not really friendly, as in if members of two different tribes cross each other\u2019s path they will fight.</p>\n<p>There are 3 types of resources, each of them being necessary for the tribes\u2019 survival. :</p>\n<p><strong>Water :</strong> Drinking is healthy and required for a tribe\u2019s population to survive and grow.</p>\n<p><strong>Wood :</strong> Wood could be considered as houses\u2019 water, being used to maintain existing houses and allowing for new houses to be build. More houses in a village will allow for an higher population limit.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2018Precious\u2019 Ore :</strong> Ore is used to make offerings to the divinity, allowing you to place more resources for them to get. Each tribe will provide you with a specific type of resource.</p>\n<p>To place a resource, click on the corresponding resource icon then on the ground. The number of each resource you can place is indicated next to the resource\u2019s icon/button.</p>\n<p>Each tribe\u2019s survival is dependant on the others\u2019 as if one of the tribe came to disappear their corresponding resource would not be able to be generated anymore. The key is to manage an access to all three types of resources for each tribe without having them annihilating each other. </p>\r\nControls\r\nMouse\r\n<p><strong>Interact / Place Resources :</strong> Left Click</p>\n<p><strong>Cancel current interaction :</strong> Right Click</p>\n<p><strong>Move Camera :</strong> Move mouse towards screen\u2019s edges</p>\n<p><strong>Rotate Camera :</strong> Hold Middle Click + Move Mouse</p>\n<p><strong>Zoom in / out :</strong> Scroll</p>\r\nKeyboard\r\n<p><strong>Move Camera :</strong> WASD / Arrows</p>\n<p><strong>Pause :</strong> Escape</p>\r\nTeam\r\n<p>Axel Born - Developer, Game Design</p>\n<p> Jordan Benureau - Artist, Game Design</p>\n<p>Masami Komuro  <em>\u00a0- </em>Audio</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T08:16:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/370/3708228fcd3f4b87b1f9a90d676bb7f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["axelvborn"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
