The player is the protagonist in the story, and choose what action she will take. You always have two or three choices. Also, you need to solve the mystery in a picture to reach the \u2018ideal\u2019 goal. There are two kinds of endings, but you will have multiple pathways through the game. There are hints in a story and pictures, so players need to carefully look and think about the trick. The main theme and message from the creator are \u201c<em>hope</em>: don\u2019t forget your creative and playful minds in everyday life\u201d. If players find the correct answer, they will find the word (the theme of this game) at the end.</p>\n<p>The story is inspired by the song \u201cGhost in a Flower\u201d by Yorushika, and characters are inspired by the comic book \u201cToilet-bound Hanako-kun\u201d. I embedded some elements of song and characters in the story; for example, \u201csmell of summer\u201d, \u201cword is not everything\u201d, or names Mei and Misaki. Since the song visualizes the nostalgic, good-old Japanese summer, I tried to keep its image. Although the character set and elements are from other works, the entire story itself is originally made by the game creator.</p>\n<p>In terms of Mechanics, I used Twine 2 with SugarCube for the first time. Originally, I wanted to put music in the game, yet the coding didn\u2019t work well. However, I could put a YouTube link at the end of the game. I would like to do more research and improve this game in the future. Moreover, I utilized pictures effectively at this time. Players will see pictures change by time goes, which looks like the protagonist draws it as the story goes on. Also, I tried different codlings from last time with Harlow. Changing paragraph (&gt;&gt;), drawing a line (<hr/>), or making connections (with [[ ]]) was a new challenge in this game. In terms of technical coding work, I worked in JavaScript to disable to back button (wrote \u201cConfig.history\u201d), and it worked perfectly.</p>\n<p>I wish, after playing this game, the players will bring back the feeling of hope that\u00a0<em>they can do anything with their creative and playful minds</em>, just like Mei did in a game. Sometimes our reality is too stuffy and gloomy to live, as COVID-19 made people stuck in a house, yet I hope people don\u2019t forget their enjoyment of life through this game. May this game give people hope to live in this world better!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T03:41:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87c/87cdf03212664004162c3c8b8f9ef355.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Prunus_29"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
