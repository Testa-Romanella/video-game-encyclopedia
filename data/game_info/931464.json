It was a early class project that I was very satisfied with. It differs from traditional text games in the environment, rather than a grid that is travelled by N,S,E,W directions, you travel to the different locations by typing the place you want to go, but may get attacked along the way. There is lots of in game help, just type, help, info or hint. The game is quite complete takes, about 20 min to beat. I would love to hear what people think.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T09:46:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/798/798af9ecc8e63c259ec1255f85a6bcc4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["logicandchaos"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
