A single person from this town will do the wrong thing for the right reasons which will change lives of everyone he knows forever.</p>\n<p>Join Cherry and friends as they fight through web obsessed spiders, ancient spirits, inquisitive shadows and foul smelling zombies to save her little town from complete destruction.</p>\n\n<p>This was originally supposed to be a small game to test the limits of RPGMaker MV, but over time it ballooned to a much bigger project. It's a short game but it has a lot of love put into it despite some of it's small budget shortcoming. I do hope you enjoy playing it.\u00a0:]</p>\n<p>Shout out to Yanfly for his plugins.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T07:42:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bfd/bfd8dbea862dfee66a8c7d887ed2dd11.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adam"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
