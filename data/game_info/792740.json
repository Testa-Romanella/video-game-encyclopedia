The game has a relaxing gameplay, you just need to tap the screen in time to pick up coins or speed up. If the player doesn't move fast enough, they die, but they can watch the ad and continue playing at their renewed speed.<br/></p>\n<p>more about Artime</p>\n<p>VK: http://vk.com/artime_12</p>\n<p>Twitter: https://twitter.com/ArtimeDelta</p>\n<p>Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=ArTime</p>\n<p>itch.io: http://artime.itch.io</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T15:29:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/803/80397cc9ea583a53fe5f50875e5b3569.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["ArTime"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
