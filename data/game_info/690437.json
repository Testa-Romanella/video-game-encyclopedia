I started learning the Unity Engine with very little prior experience in both the engine and C#, and learned 3D modeling in Blender with no prior experience. All game assets, code and art, are completely created by me, although sound effects are found on freesound.org. The game is a current work in progress, for now it is only a sandbox with no real objective.\u00a0 Please check out the showcase, it displays weapon and enemy models that are from the game.</p>\n<p>PLATFORM REQUIREMENTS</p>\n<p>only functional on Windows systems\u00a0</p>\n<p>DOWNLOAD INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p>Install ZIP file</p>\n<p>Unzip folder</p>\n<p>Open exe file</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>WASD - movement</p>\n<p>Right Click - aim</p>\n<p>Left Click - attack</p>\n<p>F - dash</p>\n<p>Spacebar - jump (hold to glide)</p>\n<p>Number Keys - switch weapons</p>\n<p>Shift - sprint</p>\n<p>ESC - settings</p>\n<p>(SHOWCASE CONTROLS)</p>\n<p>Scroll Wheel - switch between currently displayed object of category</p>\n<p>Q / E - switch between categories</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T11:42:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36e/36e474984f4ac45752820a30c2efe7ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fishyladerino"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
