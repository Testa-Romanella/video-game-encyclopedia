There he meets a king who explains that they need a hero from another world to defeat a demon lord named \"Drol Nomed\". It is said that the demon lord cannot be killed, and he has existed since the world was born. The problem is, only heroes can kill the demon lord. Can the college student who became a hero and his party be able to defeat the demon lord? Of course! Because the hero's job is to defeat the demon lord!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Concept:</strong></p>\n<p>The Hero's Job Is To Defeat the Demon Lord is a turn-based game inspired by Summoners War.\u00a0Unlike other turn-based games where you only need to overpower the enemy, this game will force you to know the existing buffs and debuffs. Also, you need to memorize the attack patterns that the enemy will use</p>\n<p>In this game, you don't need to grind or collect good weapons. Because you will directly face the demon lord! You will face one-on-one. The demon lord will consist of 2 phases. Because it looks difficult, you will also be given 3 phases where your party friends will come to help.</p>\n<p>This game is submitted in the CSUI Individual Game Jam of 2021 and includes three\u00a0diversifier\u00a0provided by the game jam:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Queen's Gambit (Implement gameplay that requires players to think strategically to win/achieve goals\u00a0)\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>This is the basic idea in this game. Because you need to think about the skills you have, what buffs and debuffs you can give, and the moves the demon lord will do. So using skills at random points will not allow you to win this game. Plus, there is Random Number Generator (RNG) to be able to provide debuffs. So the game will be dynamic, and you have to be able to think of other strategies if the initial strategy fails.</p>\n<ul><li>Sis Puella Magica!\u00a0 (Enemies that cannot be defeated in one cycle/phase\u00a0)\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>This was the main idea of the demon lord. Because if only one fight,\u00a0then the game will end quickly. So the demon lord will have several phases that need to be defeated. But for this game, the demon lord will only have 2 phases that you can beat. But, of course, beating him is not as easy as it seems.</p>\n<ul><li>Pity (When the game is near over, you will get an advantage)\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>This is the main idea of how you can beat the demon lord. Because the demon lord has more than one phase, of course, you also need to have that phase! Namely, with the pity system. When you are close to death for the first time, there will be friends who will help. But if you still fail, there will be another friend who will come and revive you both. So the battle becomes 3 vs 1. If you still lose even in that situation, it's a sign that your strategy in playing is not good.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Move the\u00a0mouse to select skill and target</li><li>Each skill will have a cooldown, think of your plan carefully!</li><li>Skills can also evolve depending on how many times the skill is used. Use it to defeat the demon lord!</li><li>Each character will have different skills. So learn every role they have in battle.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>External Asset List</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Sprites:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>All character sprite</li></ul>\n<p>Music (Names are the way they are in the source code):\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Battle with the Incarnation - Wingless Seraph</li><li>Prologue - Wingless Seraph</li><li>Game Over - Wingless Seraph</li><li>Forgotten Place - Wingless Seraph</li></ul>\n<p>Sound Effects(Names are the way they are in the source code):\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Cursor-01 - Wingless Seraph</li><li>Damage-01 - Wingless Seraph</li><li>Miss - Wingless Seraph</li><li>Heal - Wingless Seraph</li></ul>\n<p>UI:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Buff &amp; debuff icon (Freepik &amp; smashicons)</li><li>Font (Open Sans)</li><li>Button</li></ul>\n<p>Other images:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Main screen, win scene, and lose scene</li><li>Battle background</li></ul>\n<p>You can access the\u00a0<strong>source code</strong>\u00a0of this game by clicking\u00a0here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T07:46:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7aa/7aa1c1b7c9ad9ede6b1c3d5286f1aae1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Iori"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
