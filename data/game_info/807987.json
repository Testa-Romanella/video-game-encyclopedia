A witch overheard their wish, and instead granted them a pot of dirt. Play the role of the hermit as you grow your adoptive child, and discover how many kinds of person (mushroom?) your daughter can be.</p>\n<p>Inspired by titles like <em>Princess Maker</em> and <em>Alter Ego</em>, we were looking to channel the same energy as classic DOS life simulation titles. The game features over a dozen types of mushroom girl with each having their own special qualities that impact the choices you can make.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game was created for the\u00a0<strong>PIGSquad</strong> June 2022 Summer Slow Jam!\u00a0The themes were '<strong>Character Creator</strong>' and '<strong>Unintended Consequences</strong>'.\u00a0We hope you enjoy creating some mushroom daughters... And reaping the consequences!\r\n</p>\n<p>We plan on continuing to update and extend this project beyond the jam version, so stay tuned :) Maybe even... In the coming months... :))\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T14:30:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/388/388d681829f9ad28f952056d5073a14b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Autumnotopia", "Minamiz", "MortallyMoonstruckGames", "BearLovingNerd"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
