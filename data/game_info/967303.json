{"id": 967303, "slug": "stardander-school-for-witches", "name": "Stardander School for Witches", "name_original": "Stardander School for Witches", "description": "<strong>Delve into the lives of four young witches as they learn magic, protect their families, try to stay on their brooms, and work hard to unravel the mysteries surrounding Stardander, the best school of magic in the world.</strong><br/><br/>Your time at Stardander will be full of surprising discoveries, strategic battles against many fae creatures, late-night study sessions, and not a few delightful pranks at your least-favorite teacher\u2019s expense. Breaking a few school rules is to be expected, but try not to get yourself into detention in the pitch-black (and probably haunted) dungeons!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Long ago, humans summoned Fae creatures to this world and bound them to their will. But when pacts were broken, the power of the Fae turned upon humanity and brought chaos.<br/><br/>Only the aid and protection of a group of sympathetic Fae kept humans from being annihilated. These Fae became known as the Protectors, and founded the human-Fae Alliance. But one notoriously powerful and malicious Fae - Apexsens - has a deep grudge against humans and has not given up his quest to exterminate them, using any means necessary.<br/><br/>The safety of the Protectors cannot last forever - only through mastering their own magic do humans stand a chance. For nearly 300 years it has been Professor Dare's task - and atonement - to teach humans the very magic that once dominated and enslaved her.<br/><br/>After mysteriously vanishing for seven years, Professor Dare is now back to re-open Stardander, the best school for witches and the hope of all humanity.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> <strong>Callie</strong> is frilly, pampered, and thinks magic is for common folk. Why in the nine realms does she end up at Stardander?!<br/> <strong>Freya</strong> is the deathly prankster who might see ghosts, but is the sweetest of cinnamon buns.<br/> <strong>Rory</strong> is the overachiever who tries to do what is right but is overshadowed by a notorious family.<br/> <strong>Mira</strong> is the feisty Fae-touched fighter who doesn't quite understand how to be human (yet).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Witches always have more to learn and players will be able to take part in a multitude of classes to help hone their magic. Learn projection, transmutation, channeling, telepathy and more. You never know what spell may come in handy at a desperate moment!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> Play as four complex main characters, each with their own reasons for learning magic.<br/> Make friends (or enemies) with your fellow witches-in-training.<br/> Recruit your friends to help you battle dangerous Fae in a unique turn based battle system.<br/> Talk to and form pacts with enemy Fae to gain familiars.<br/> Take classes, learn spells, pass your exams, cultivate magical plants and brew potions.<br/> Solve mysteries in a multi year story arc with a high-stakes conclusion.<br/> Grow magical materials to brew potions and enchant items!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-06T03:18:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ea/1ea953a87558148ddd0c108bcae60c7e.jpg", "website": "https://fancyfishgames.com/Stardander", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 553, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Fancy Fish Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fancy Fish Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
