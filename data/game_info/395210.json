Be careful to not drop the cargo, that would make our customers angry, and we would have to fire you from this job. <br/><br/>Try to deliver the shipment without losing it in this steampunk environment. Different mechanisms will try to prevent you completing the delivery.<br/><br/>Have fun.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-02T01:54:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b7/4b725650d17b3af1390aceb4cc23b838.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Qingqing Wang"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing", "Educational"], "publishers": ["Qingqing Wang"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
