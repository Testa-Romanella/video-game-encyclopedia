The game is set to be updated but is currently a working prototype.</p>\n<p>An angel falls from heaven, a demon is shot up from hell, and both characters merge into one. The angel can fly and maneuver the environment, but can not attack, so is vulnerable to obstacles. The devil character can't fly but is able to attack while falling through the air. Both character's abilities must be used together to reach the eventual end goal of separating themselves from each other. You must use momentum and speed to your advantage to try to beat the randomly generated levels as quickly as possible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c1/8c1aac5c832ff7d2a0a1154d9a644419.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TomBradshaw"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
