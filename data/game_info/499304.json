Postimperial upcyclepunk. Work levers, pull cords, rotate wheels... observe the effects and deliberate, and gradually fathom its workings.  Work-out how to work small parts of the bigger contraption and eventually, perhaps one day, figure-out how to use it all together to bake a loaf of bread.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nA tricky puzzle for sure, but don't panic, relax. TraptionBakery is intended to amuse, baffle, perplex and interest you for weeks.<br/>\r\nYou don't have to do it all in one go... half an hour here, 10 minutes there...have a ponder and come back to it, sleep on it maybe.<br/>\r\nAnd don't feel you have to be in puzzle solving mode all the time: this is a curio too, every now and then just zoom-in, zone-out, look around and marvel at all the crazy things.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTraptionBakery can be played full screen, or in a smaller window.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T02:16:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b9/8b9a16074002544a0f270b83a8828bb6.jpg", "website": "https://www.properbostin.co.uk/traption_bakery/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 49, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jon Prestidge"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ProperBostin Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
