{"id": 549248, "slug": "t-rocket", "name": "T-Rocket", "name_original": "T-Rocket", "description": "<p>You play as a remote controlled rocket encased in an enclosure resembling that of a T-Rex. Put the T-Rocket through vigorous training missions to test its durability and flexibility. You will fly over, under, and through obstacles; either avoiding or destroying positioned enemy turrets. Blast through destructible walls, obtain keys to unlock gates, and pick up items to replenish fuel and missile ammunition. Successfully land the T-Rocket on the green landing pad to complete each level. As you progress through the levels, more obstacles are introduced; consequentially increasing the difficulty.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T09:02:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43b/43b8f6cb4f9037f7411b0abba1263a0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["weRthem"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
