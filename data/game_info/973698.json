Blocks will appear from 4 different directions. The game gets harder as you destroy more blocks.<br/><br/>The player has 10 health and the game will end once it drops to 0. If a block is placed at the spawning line, you will take 5 damage and nearby blocks will be cleared. If a block falls off the board you will lose health depending on the number of blocks the piece has (Bombs will always deal 5 damage)<br/><br/><strong>Scores:</strong><br/><br/>    10 points for each block placed<br/>    10 points for each block destroyed<br/>    1st layer = 640 points<br/>    2nd layer = 2560 points<br/>    3rd layer = 5760 points<br/>    4th layer = 10240 points<br/>    5th layer = 16000 points<br/>    6th layer = 23040 points<br/>    7th layer = 31360 points<br/>    8th layer = 40960 points<br/>    9th layer = 51840 points<br/>    10th layer = 64000 points<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Special blocks:</strong><br/><br/>Once there are at least 20 blocks on the board every 5th block will be a bomb. The more blocks there are, the more powerful effects you will get.
