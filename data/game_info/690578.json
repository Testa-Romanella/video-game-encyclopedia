At least, I think that's a normal person thing? All the characters in those mobile games seem to enjoy doing it.</p>\n<p>Walls exist can exist in either the human realm or the ghost realm. If this hurts your head... <strong>just avoid the semi-transparent walls and you'll be fine!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Your score's in the top-left corner, and it doesn't get saved, so you'd better have a good memory.</p>\n<p>Made for\u00a0Halloween Jam 2021.\u00a0Yes, I ran out of time.\u00a0 :)</p>\n<p>Takes a minute to load on slow devices; a few seconds on everything else.
