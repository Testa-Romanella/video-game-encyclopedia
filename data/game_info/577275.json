Tis more of a slideshow than a game, but you do need to press Z on the keyboard or A\u00a0on Game Boy sometimes haha.<br/></p>\n<p>Not all the images worked though. I need to mess around with the contrast for a couple and some were too busy for the engine. Can usually fix that by making the image a lil smaller though. Will try and fix those issues between workin' on my late entry into the theme haha.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Anyway, hope ye enjoy and great stuff y'all.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T08:28:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e4/7e4c8713e4b9163c610018dc44bcbe3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Game Buoy Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
