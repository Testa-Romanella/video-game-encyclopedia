Let's see just how long you can last! &gt;:3</p>\n<p><em>This game can only be played on a multitouch-screen device!</em><br/></p>\n\n\n\n<strong>Directions are simple\u00a0</strong>\n<p><em>(something even a simple mind like yours SHOULD be able to understand):</em><br/></p>\n<p>Keep the cogs spinning the right way by throwing the bothersome nuisance out of the system and turning them the right way with your weird fingers.</p>\n<p>Occasionally unlock the computer by touching ALL of the required pink points on the screen at the SAME TIME! (the last guy just couldn't get it!)</p>\n<p>Turn the lights back on by tapping the switch if it has turned off. Duh.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sign into the computer using the paper code on your desk (DO NOT LET THE CATS TAKE IT AGAIN)\u00a0</p>\n<strong>See? Simple! Just don't fail ANY of these tasks :3 OR ELSE</strong>\n<p><strong>And please....last as LONG as possible. I don't want to hire another noob!</strong><br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Created in a 4 day game jam, students at Warren Tech Central (in the Game Development Program) scrambled to make their very first touch screen game!
