They bunkered themselves inside a small house on prairie and hoped to live happily ever after. Unfortunately Lady Justice is unforgivable. They have been discovered by police and their love nest is currently under siege.</p><p>Will they be horribly slaughtered or will their love prevail? Their fate is in your hands!</p><p>Game features asymmetric cooperation: <br/></p><p>Female character provides a cover fire and can medkits. Each one allows us to use next ammo round to heal her partner. Be careful though, she is extremely vulnerable.</p>Male character is melee fighter. He can grab ammo from corpses of fallen enemies and throw them through house window to resupply his girlfriend. If his health hits 0 he enters agony mode. During this mode he moves slower and has 10 seconds to be healed before he gives up the ghost.<p>Watch out for friendly fire!<br/></p><p>Play in 3 game modes:</p><p><em>Till Death Do Us Part</em> - Fight off police attack. You need to stay  alive for 5 minutes.</p><p><em>Copper Love</em> - You're dead anyway. Might as well take as many of them with you as you can.</p><p><em>Make Love Not War</em> - or the other way around. Prepare for trying times while concentrating on collecting ammo.</p><p><strong>Intructions:<br/></strong></p><ul><li><strong>Highly recommended to be played by two people!</strong></li><li>To throw an ammo crate through window simply get close to it.</li><li>To heal male character pick up medkit and shoot in his direction. Hopefully healing bullet will do the rest.</li><li>You win when you achieve your goal (different for each mode).</li><li>You lose when one of your character dies or your house is destroyed.</li></ul><p><strong>Default controls:</strong></p><ul><li><em>W, S, A, D</em> - move male character</li><li><em>Spacebar</em> - male character melee attack</li><li><em>Arrows</em> - move female character</li><li><em>Mouse</em> - aim female character's gun</li><li><em>Left Mouse Button</em> - shoot from female character's gun</li></ul><p><strong>Development Team:</strong></p><ul><li>Melchior Moroz</li><li>Piotr Gryko</li><li>Jacek \"Asterix\" Kozieja</li><li>Miko\u0142aj Ciesielski</li><li>Daniel \"Dante\" Lewi\u0144ski</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>Game made during Warsaw Film School Game Jam 2016.
