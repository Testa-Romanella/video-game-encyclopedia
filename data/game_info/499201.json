Collect items from behind</p>\n<p>You are the owner of a unique store and you have very particular customers who are very picky about what they want to buy....\u00a0</p>\n<p>Interact with the customer and find out what they require. Search your store for the item(s) (<strong>GO THERE</strong>) and bring it <strong>BACK </strong>to them. Be careful not to take too long filling the order these customers have limited patience...\u00a0</p>\n<p>Keep collecting items and see how long you can last shopping for picky customers!</p>\n<p>Made for VimJam - Theme:\u00a0 There and Back</p>\n<p>Music - Audionautix.com</p><p>I wanted to make it procedurally generated so that it would add a bit of variety but\u00a0I didn't get the chance. So it is a bit repetitve.</p><p>Known Issues: You can only collect the item from behind it.
