I submitted it on time but some weird internet things happen, so anyways it's called\u00a0Continuous. Why is it called that? Let me explain.</p>\n<p>You move continuously horizontally unless you're over at a stop point. That's it.</p>\n<p>Well there's more actually. The only things that you the player can do is change which direction the player is going and jump. You must use the combination of your abilities in order to complete all 10 level and collect as many as you can (it's optional but it's fun). All that with one touch or one button.</p>\n<p>Hope you have fun.</p><p>While I can update the game or add new updates I refuse to do so\u00a0until the jam voting ends. No reason to do that really but I've gotten this far didn't I?</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS<br/></strong>Left Mouse Button / Touch<br/>\u00a0- one click: Jump<br/>- double click: Change Direction</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T03:42:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/890/890ad9b42902e8e0e3505772ea8acbff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Rafael Ignacio"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
