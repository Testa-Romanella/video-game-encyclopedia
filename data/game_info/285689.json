They are not grade A students, in fact, they don't know any spells really. The only magic they have is a scroll allowing them to resurrect each other if they are accidentally killed bumbling up a spell during their studies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They are not necessarily made up of the\u201d stuff of heroes\u201d, but they are the only hope humanity has. After a thousand year pact, an order of wizards have decided to upset the balance and destroy all other magic in the world in an ascent to absolute control and power.<br/><br/>REZPLZ Is a an underdog tale for one or two players (Local Co-op) where you must rely on being clever and resourceful instead of being overpowered wunder-mages. The game features traditional platforming with a unique blend of death-driven puzzles and cooperative game play providing a unique puzzle platrforming experience. <br/><br/>In true old school fashion, everything can kill you in one hit, and there are tons of hazards, traps and monsters that want to kill you and keep you dead. As the brothers progress, they will unlock new spells that they haven't quite mastered yet, but do allow them some new tricks in order to progress in the game.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:49:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/017/017a664289467a314c37b22c6f6ed06c.jpg", "website": "http://rezplzgame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 49}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 26, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 290, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Long Neck Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Long Neck Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
