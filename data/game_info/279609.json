Uninhabitable planets and a far superiour alien race from which they hide on m00ns. Your only chance at survival is to protect the three devices that make your m00n inhabitable. Cube alpha gives energy, cube beta gives food, cube gamma gives oxygen. If you lose one, you lose your life\u2026<br/><br/>The last humans, forced by the uninhabitable environments of the planets, to commute from m00n to m00n.  <br/><br/>Is it time for you to die too? Like all the millions humans their bodies are still aimlessly moving around and nameless in space...<br/>... where once the earth was - and now only a few rock chunks.And what if...What if... if you could slow down the time itself?<br/>What if... if you could nearly stop the time, for the whole galaxy but not for you?<br/>What if... if you could generate a \"Sphere\" which stay in place for a short while and protects everything in it ...<br/><br/>And what if you could combine all these things?<br/><br/>Can you be everywhere at the same time?<br/>Can two simultaneous points be protected at the same time?<br/>Can you just catch up with a laser that you shoot yourself?<br/><br/>And by the way: how relative is \"short\" if you can manipulate time?<br/><br/>In final m00n, with the art of manipulating time, this and much more becomes possible.<br/><br/>Could you survive and reach final m00n?<br/><br/>In one way or another - One m00n will be your final m00n.And never forget: - You are not alone. The \"highest form of life\" is never far<br/>- Her technique, her thinking and her entire civilization are a million years ahead of you.<br/>- And you will not be undetected for a long time even on the smallest m00n...Are you up to it?  Can you reach final m00n..?<br/>Oh, and if you meet a survivor: Think better of you and your survival.<br/>Believe me- d<strong>on't try to be a hero!</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:49:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f96/f96e5264073a2e9eac3d505a4d0cc0e9.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/Final-m00n-1251010501607599/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 515, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Frank Gallinsky"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Frank Gallinsky"], "esrb_rating": null}
