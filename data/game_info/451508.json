{"id": 451508, "slug": "ferret-frenzy", "name": "Ferret Frenzy", "name_original": "Ferret Frenzy", "description": "<p>This game centers around a Ferret that wants to ruin the morning for his very<br/>occupied owner, Gerald. The player's goal is to find your owner\u2019s morning routine items and completely mess up his day so he can't get to work on time. These items being his Cell Phone, Wallet, and Keys. The player will be given a chance to locate and take one asset at a time to any spot within the room accessible to the character. This is important because the player\u2019s goal is to make the NPC ultimately fail at finding his<br/>keys.</p>\n<p>The owners\u00a0job will be to thwart the player\u2019s actions through three separate actions. The first being determined by the visibility of the item and distance hidden from the NPC. The second being the NPC takes said objects and places them in key areas harder for the player to traverse. The third being that the owner will periodically pick up the ferret and place them in a cage. Through these actions, maybe, just maybe. The owner will make it on time for work for once.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T07:00:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0c/d0c42f8471fab3f52f72dc52ecf6d830.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 223, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KevinGordonCG", "gregex419", "DylanFx", "dyoung0513", "forestmice"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
