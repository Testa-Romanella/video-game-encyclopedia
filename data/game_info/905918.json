And now they've come to reap their harvest.</p>\n<p><strong>Directions:</strong></p>\n<p>The aliens are here to harvest the entire human race, and you are the only one who can stop them! Destroy the UFOs to defend your cities.</p>\n<p>Cities can be upgraded with gold. Larger cities provide more passive income.</p>\n<p>Defensive buildings can also be purchased with gold:</p>\n<ul><li>Shield: The shield protects buildings from being harvested. They can also protect the player from incoming enemy fire.</li><li>Anti-Air Turret: The AA Turret shoots at nearby enemies.</li><li>Missile Silo: The missile silo launches missiles. Missiles have a very long range and deal a lot of damage.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>[W], [A], [S], [D]- Move, jump\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Left Click - Shoot\r\n</li><li>[Space] - Use jetpack\r\n</li><li>[E] - Upgrade city\r\n</li><li>[1], [2], [3] - Place defensive buildings</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>As usual, I ran out of time before I was able to add all of the features and polish I wanted, but the end result is fun enough.
