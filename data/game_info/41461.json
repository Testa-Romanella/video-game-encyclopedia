You play as a deadly assassin, Agent 47, overlooking the roof of the next building. Your goal is to eliminate Richard Strong Jr. and his security detail in no longer than fifteen minutes using a sniper rifle. It is also possible to fake out an accident thanks to the location scenery. </p>\n<p>The game features a ranking system which estimates player&#39;s performance and puts the result on the public leaderboard. Players can complete special assignments or go on a headshot streak apart from killing in order to get points. It is also possible to earn new sniper rifle upgrades such as extended magazine capacity or fire rate increase.</p>\n<p>The game was initially released as a pre-order bonus but as of 2018, it comes bundled with an Elite edition of Hitman: Absolution.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2012-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-22T16:27:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/949/94983507a9ef5869910bd19cf9059ae9.jpg", "website": "http://www.hitmansniper.com", "rating": 3.14, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 73, "owned": 1220, "beaten": 132, "toplay": 20, "dropped": 43, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 178, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 178, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox 360", "PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["IO Interactive", "Nixxes software"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Square Enix"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
