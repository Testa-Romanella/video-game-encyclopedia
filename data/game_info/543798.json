There is no way of winning so when you feel done with the level you can open your menu and click yay to go to next level. There are 3 levels so if the yay button does not work it is probably because there is no more levels.\u00a0<br/><br/>Controls:<br/>You can move the camera with your mouse, you shoot hooks with the keyboard button W and you can get the menu by clicking escape.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T07:40:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f4/7f4b073c8f64863b426b673a3af67ca0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RhapSody_Deluxe"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
