Players will come back to the Tang Dynasty of China in 8th century AD, and build the Chang'an city in an 1:1 ratio gameplay map. <br/><br/>From the entire city arrangement to each small Dou Gong in the building, the game design is based on deep research work. I spend years in researching history, culture and architecture of Tang Dynasty and actually travel to Xi'an(which Chang'an is called now). <br/><br/>During the game play, you can create your buildings in each \"Fang\"(A large square zone that premade by the city), unlock famous wonders like the Great Wild Goose Pagoda, the Qujiang Lake when you reach a certain milestone, and even build the imperial palaces as the bonus content.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h3>A game play map of 81.3 square kilometers. </h3><br/>Different from other city building games, \"Chang'an the capital of Tang Dynasty\" is more focus on the \"Authenticity\". The gameplay map is the same scale of the city in the reality. which means a 83.1 square kilometers play map. <br/><br/>From camera control to game UI, many efforts has been made to streamline the gameplay in such a huge map, but when you build the great city in the 1:1 ratio map, the unique experience will worth them all. <br/><br/><br/><br/><h3>Historical sites reconstructed in the map.</h3><br/>Although players can create buildings of residences, commerce and public facilities, in the game map there are still many architectures stand as doodads. Most of them do not actually effect the gameplay, but they contribute to the theme that most important \"Build the real Chang'an city in history\". <br/><br/>For example, there are numerous city gates in the capital, Someones are huge and famous like Dan Feng gate, Zhu Que gate, while other smaller ones like Chun Ming gate, Guang Hua gate. Their appearances, positions are referenced by academic materials.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h3>3 imperial palaces in Chang'an.</h3><br/>There are 3 imperial palaces in Chang'an: The Da Ming Palace, the Tai Ji Palace and the Xing Qing Palace, I spend much time in their reconstruction, especially the Da Ming Palace, which still stands its ruin in a historical park. <br/><br/>For the Da Ming Palace, there are plenty of pictures and even 3D models for me to reference, and the Da Ming Palace is the most satisfying part of all reconstructions in the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>------------------------------- Developer Note 2020.9.30 ------------------------------- <br/>Version 0.70<br/><br/>In the first released version, all main functions are implemented and tested.
