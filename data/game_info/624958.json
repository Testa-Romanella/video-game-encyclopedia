I created all the\u00a0assets and art during the jam period, with the exception being the font which I made for my previous game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also there is no sound or music in this game,\u00a0I did not get time to create/ learn to\u00a0implement them in a way I felt good with. I may come back after the jam to update it with sound though.</p>\n<p>Because I personally love knowing how long someone worked on a project, this game took me about 2-3 days of work.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>You control a space ship navigating its way through an asteroid field. Your goal is to last as long as possible and collect as many carrots as possible. As a last resort, you're able to use your carrots as projectiles to destroy any oncoming Asteroids, but be warned, this will lead to less carrots when you die and thus a\u00a0lower score.</p><p>Score do not\u00a0save between sessions. Refreshing the page/game will wipe the high score</p>\n<p>Ratings and comments are greatly appreciated :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T05:10:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/144/14443bd07362a563502d4b3767ef53b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TolbiNox"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
