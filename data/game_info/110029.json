The only things you're able to see are the objects that have the same y-position as your player. This means, as your player jumps and falls, the entire view you have of the world shifts up and down. Move around the world and try to mentally map the levels as you play :)<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>TIP:\u00a0</strong>The point of this game is to figure out the level and learn how to manoeuvre around it.
