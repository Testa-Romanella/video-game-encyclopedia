Added 3 levels in total with varying difficulty. There are more enemies with more health and abilities (fast shooting and more health).</p>\n<p>2.\u00a0 Replaced the game background, and game music (spent a lot of time on this).</p>\n<p>3. Changed the entire UI with a different font and added instructions that make the game have an objective.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Further Modification that I tried but didn't work:</p>\n<p>1. Having earth behind the asteroid layer. The asteroid layer breaks and you have to protect earth before the aliens destroy it.</p>\n<p>2. Making custom models using Photoshop.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>All assets, music, etc taken from Unity Asset Store</p>\n<p>Created by: Rajmeet Singh Chandok<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T10:40:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d79/d79c062e209d2f00291492673b60859a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["rajmeetchandok"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
