During night and during day, there are different platforms. This means you have to be smart, know what you are doing, and be fast! <br/><br/>In addition to that, Skafos is made with speedrunning in mind. Can you finish the levels fastttt? Then you can get the A+ Rank! (Who doesn't want that) <br/><br/>Can you reach the finish in the 4 extremely difficult levels (and a tutorial level). The further you get, the more deep you get into the underground with the final level being hell. And we don't talk about the visuals being in hell, it's so hard you might think you actually are in hell.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T08:49:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af7/af751e32583ce1deb791f6677ed62896.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["keeperofhonor"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
