Both persist in conflict, maintaining the constant balance to be healthy.\u00a0Your light side generally prevails, but what if your dark side finally wins...<br/></p>\n<p>This was a short game made in a 48 hour game jam at Warwick Game Design Society. This is an improved version with a few extra days of work added for itch.io upload.\u00a0I worked with two other people with the\u00a0theme \"Reflections\". This game requires two players to battle, unless you just want to view the small endings. It's a 2D platformer fighter, where two players with different objectives are opposing each other in battle, and victory of one can change the outcome entirely.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-21T05:51:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fa/3fa5e17818bdf3413864b371c23e16d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Joseph28"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
