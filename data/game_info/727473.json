Build, mine resources, grow crops, manufacture equipment, trade, and advance science on your own or by delegating tasks to your people. Greedy bandits will regularly raid your settlement, so you'll have to rally militia troops and repel the enemy.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n  Key features \u2022 Manage peasants \n<br/>\nEach peasant can have one of ten available professions. Once you assign them to one, they'll start following orders and carrying out tasks related to that profession \u2014 you won't need to keep track of each individual inhabitant. However, if you think ordinary peasants with the most basic education won't be great at tactics, you can directly command individual units or groups of units in combat.\n<br/>\n\u2022 Develop infrastructure \n<br/>\nStart by processing stone and lumber, then make advancements in technology to unlock new ways to grow your settlement: manufacturing, trade, lighting, comfort, equipment, defense. Your character and peasants will also be able to grow and improve their skills while they do useful work.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\u2022 Settlers \n<br/>\nTo make a village attractive to new settlers, you need to make sure the inhabitants are comfortable. Peasants need cozy houses and good food. However, for particularly lazy peasants, you'll have to use the whip along with the carrot.\n<br/>\n\u2022 Battles \n<br/>\nBandits, wolves, and bears will regularly attack your settlement. You can lead the militia or stay out of combat by letting your people defend themselves. To reduce casualties, you can hide behind powerful walls or lure the enemy into meticulously placed traps.\n<br/>\n\u2022 Agriculture\n<br/>\nHunting and gathering will only solve the problem of hunger at the earliest stages. In a highly developed settlement, you'll need to start growing various crops and raising animals.\n<br/>\n\u2022 Trade \n<br/>\nMerchants will regularly visit your village. They'll offer their goods and buy things you produce. With time, you will be able to send trade caravans to other locations.\n<br/>\n\u2022 Events \n<br/>\nRandom events will require you to make important decisions: choose weapons or food, gold or goods for your peasants, \"one egg today or a hen tomorrow\".\n<br/>\n\u2022 Seasons \n<br/>\nTo survive the harsh medieval winter, you'll need to build campfires and houses, and stock up on provisions, making sure you prioritize non-perishable food.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\u2022 Cooperative multiplayer \n<br/>\nBuild your village together and fight shoulder to shoulder with your friends. The game supports multiplayer for up to 6 players.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T04:27:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e27/e27013ee479855fd99774e5a3b0dd68e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 28}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 366, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Harpoon Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Gamera Game", "Harpoon Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
