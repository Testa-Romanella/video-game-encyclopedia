One of the changes is I adjusted the monster spawns to scale with time and how many players are in the game. Monsters were also rebalanced to make them easier to deal with, and also stronger monsters spawn faster. I also made some adjustments to the games economy to account for how outposts contribute to victory. Plus I changed the terrain generation rules to allow for slightly more variation in maps.</p>\n<p>There probably still are some issues, but for the most part it should all work just fine!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T05:57:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7a/a7af3542733f9476889cec10972117fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BzGame"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
