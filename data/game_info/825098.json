They used to live together peacefully as Corgies until a galactic explosion tore apart their home and shattered their world into 7 dimensions. The injured Corgis were cyberfied and must now settle in the dimensions to secure their existence.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In contrast to conventional city-building games, buildings are not placed on common construction grounds, but in mutually overlapping dimensions. This innovative mechanic makes the game Cycorgs unique among city builders. Since some buildings appear simultaneously in several dimensions, the result is - if the player does not think about a placement strategy - an immense space problem in the dimensions, which leads to the loss of the game.\r\n</p>\n<p>Therefore, we recommend the game primarily to players who like to be challenged and to practice finding solutions. In a relaxed slow-paced experience, you can lose yourself for hours in the idyllic and charmingly designed game world and dive into the world of the Cycorgs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T19:29:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/876/876c914cb2c96f28b09784162d5e71a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["7 Dimensions Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
