It was my first time using Godot for something and I had to Google quite a bit during the 3 hours. I think it turned out alright for a first attempt. The scope creep monster was sitting on my shoulder the whole time and I\u00a0wanted to add soooo many things. Perhaps I'll do that post-jam.</p>\r\n\r\nUpdate:\u00a0I totally forgot about the fact that the jam has a theme and I completely missed the mark on that, so I've decided not to submit this for the jam and instead write it up as a learning experience :)\r\n<p><strong>Mission</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Rescue as many lost spelunkers as you can.
