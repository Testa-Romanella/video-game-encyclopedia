Unfortunately, in doing so you awoke a giant scary octopus monster, and now its pissed at you for ruining its nap. Fortunately, you have an experimental energy weapon (secret lab perks), a lance of pure light and colour purpose-built to fight off the darkness. Banish the evil spirits sent your way, sever the portals linking the realm of darkness to yours, and escape the mildly annoyed eldritch octopus demon. Or don't, but then you'll lose.<br/></p>\n\n<p>I developed this game in 48 hours using Unity, Aseprite, and Bfxr. Music and fonts were sourced from online,\u00a0 I created everything else during the jam.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Music from https://filmmusic.io<br/>\"The Descent\" by Kevin MacLeod (https://incompetech.com)<br/>License: CC BY (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</p>\n<p>Font: Klein Headline - Manfred Klein</p>\n<p>Font: 8 Bit Operator - Grandoplex Productions<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6c/b6c2f332f39845ffa73898d78736de2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["NeptunianEclipse"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
