As a teacher and a father I made this game for my daughter and students.</p>\n<p>Children can listen to the story and read along. The text is highlighted as it is read and there is a pause after each section.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is also interactive, so children can also take part in the game and make choices. This allows them to influence what happens in the story and it also tests comprehension and understanding as there are mini games and quizzes built into the story.</p>\n<p>There are educational puzzles, so children can learn about shapes, reading the time, animals, and more. The quizzes also test reading ability.<br/><br/>This app contains the story of the Tortoise and the Hare with more stories to come in future updates. If you would like to see more games like this, please support this app. :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T03:13:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d9/0d9ebf36d90052180bef1382ce2230fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ComputerArtClub"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
