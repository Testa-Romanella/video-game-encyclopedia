It was much different from what I\u00a0intended and from what I was seeing during development because I keep my monitor brightness low. You can find the original web version here.</p>\n<p>You find yourself in a dark and unwelcoming building. Disturbing blood-like organic growth can be seen everywhere you look. You feel a wicked presence around you... will you survive the encounter?</p>\n<p>Desktop build is highly recommneded for a more immersive experience. Note that I could only test the windows version.</p>\n<p>Due to a known unity bug on webgl, spatial audio does not work in the browser (meaning sounds coming from the left will be heard equally on the right). The game is fine otherwise but feels a little worse.</p>\n<p>The game is rendered at 64x64 and upscaled at whatever resolution necessary.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Development and game design by @Jackaljkdan.</p>\n<p>Pixel art by @still_niki.</p>\n<p>Music by @LightBluePianist.</p>\n<p>Sound design by\u00a0@Jackaljkdan and\u00a0@LightBluePianist.</p>\n<p>Many sounds were taken from\u00a0https://opengameart.org/\u00a0and\u00a0https://freesound.org/\u00a0and used as is or rearranged.</p>\n<p>In particular we credit the following sounds:</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/25-cc0-mud-sfx</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/MrAuralization/sounds/184569/\u00a0by\u00a0MrAuralizatio</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/8-wet-squish-slurp-impacts</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/growth-spell\u00a0by qubodup</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/impact</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/random-sound-effects\u00a0by HaelDB (Brandon Morris)</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/rockmetal-slide\u00a0by Varkalandar</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T23:36:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f32/f3233b395febf17923b7c3b70f42c4ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Jackaljkdan", "still_niki", "LightBluePianist"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
