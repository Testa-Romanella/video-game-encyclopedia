And like all creators you possess and use a certain gift not many people on the planet have...Creativity. And some people think that gift should not be wasted. A man with the name of Scott runs an organisation called T.C.O.T.S. His plan is to create a perfect world, a perfect future, and perfect people. Their ways and beliefs are very much illegal and for that reason, they do all their tests and studies on a submarine/boat like city called No Land City. With the help of his team and the creators they test on called Actives, Scott will create his perfect world where no one skill is wasted.</p>\r\nDisclaimer\r\n<p>This horror game contains frightening scenes, loud noises, and flashing lights.
