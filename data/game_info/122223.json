Beware of the Swarm is a Space Dogfighter in Room Scale VR. <br/></p>\n<p>In the full game you progress through a single-player campaign defending humanity from a powerful alien foe \u00a0known as \u201cthe Swarm.\u201d Beware of the Swarm is being designed for players using the HTC Vive or the Oculus Rift with Touch controllers. You control the direction and movement of your space ship using these motion controllers. These special VR controllers also operate your offensive weapons and your mineral collecting ability which is one of the core functions of your spaceship. It is highly unlikely you have ever played a game like this before. It is designed specifically for VR and the controls are adapted to fully engage you.<br/></p>\r\nGameplay:\r\n<p>We wanted to rethink the way you would control a spaceship. You\u2019re \r\nnot bound to your cockpit. Like a child with an active imagination, take\r\n hold of your spaceship with your hands. Control your turrets by \r\npointing at your targets. <br/></p>\n<p>In this early demo, you fight an alien threat in an asteroid field circling Saturn. <br/></p>\r\nFeatures:\r\n<ul><li>Room Scale Virtual Reality</li><li>Full Dual Motion Controllers</li><li>3rd Person Spaceflight</li><li>RPG Elements, and Mission System</li><li>Rich story line based game play</li><li>Lasers in Space</li></ul>\n\r\nSetting:\r\n<p>Sol System in the year 2150.

Among all this fuss, a small mining outpost in the outer \r\nreaches of the solar system came across a strange drone mining an \r\nasteroid claimed by an aggressive mine owner.</p>\n<p>Mistakes are made, and we are pulled kicking and screaming into first contact with a galactic empire.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/138/138ef8cdcd7c8f0e1e6766847b543eb9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Man On The Moon Studio"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
