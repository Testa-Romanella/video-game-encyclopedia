Its come a long way since development, and I'm excited for people to try it out. The game is in a basically finished state, save for testing.

Any and all feedback is welcome!</p>\n<p>Regardless, thanks for checking out my game, and visiting the weird world that lies behind that door.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-18T04:24:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94b/94b6910308bc30dd34cbaef7bf49a159.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dan Ryan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
