We're currently in Alpha stage, gradually acquiring time/funds for additional assets.\u00a0</strong><strong>Our Kickstarter is planned sometime next year.\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Unique to Zeta Wolf Chronicles are the perspective theme and the primary focus on internal communication. With <strong>insight points</strong> (point and click gameplay) you can temporarily gain the perspective of the inner thoughts of a certain character. Later with <strong>reflection points</strong>, you can trigger additional thoughts from Rayen, and be faced with choosing between either when they appear simultaneously. This can make each playthrough unique, with your choices altering the flow of the story.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Much care was spent in planning Zeta Wolf's story and overall plot. Realism was a central focus, and having believable character interactions and romance timelines. A large portion of our background and setting\u00a0are inspired by real-life events.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>While or demo is just the tip of the iceberg, we wanted a story that could inspire and educate others in the world of romance. As our demo portrays, <strong>being a guy in a similar situation as Rayen, is no easy task</strong>. It's important to us that we can show rather than tell, how Rayen navigates his individual situation with girls\uff0dunder extreme desperation and anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>As such, our project lead <strong>Zanthos</strong> set out to create a visual novel<strong>\u00a0</strong>different from many eroge/BxG of today. Where the path to the heroine\uff0dand your girlfriend, is believable, logical and rooted in realism.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\nDemo Features\r\n<ul><li><strong>~90</strong> <strong>Minutes</strong> of Gameplay</li><li>Over <strong>14k</strong> Word Script</li><li>Partial Voiced: <strong>~4k</strong> Words\u00a0Spoken Dialogue</li><li>Multiple Choices and Endings</li></ul>\n<p>Thank you so much for visiting our page and trying our demo!\u00a0</p>\r\nSupport us?\r\n<p>We're currently working on our assets for the next build and our eventual Kickstarter for next year.
