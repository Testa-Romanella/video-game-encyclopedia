This game contains maths.</p>\n<p>This charming little number was made as an educational maths game aimed at kids. While the screenshot tells you everything you need to know about the graphics, it's done its job in the fun department. The game follows agent Tan trying to track down the evil twins Sin and Cos who have kidnapped a bunch of numbers (presumably for multiplication purposes). He goes off on a tangent in order to rescue the numbers and to help him you must solve a number of maths-based problems. I actually got one wrong and am now considering reapplying for primary school.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-25T03:59:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a11/a11dbbba709744744d7ed68b1b0d73cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["CaptainD"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
