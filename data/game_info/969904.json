New matter springs into existence and breaks down the old rules in order to forge new ones.

All matter indiscriminately spreads, consumes, replaces, regenerates, and dominates the fragile fabric of reality in an attempt to rebuild it in its own image.<br/>A brutal arms race ensue, as many types of matter toil in a cosmic dance of destruction, seeping through the bonds of reality, in an attempt to become the dominating matter, the only matter... truly Perfect Matter.<h3>A SOLO DEVELOPMENT PROJECT</h3><br/>Wrought Interactive consists of one person, who built perfect matter from the ground up over the course of four and a half months. The music was sourced from the insanely talented 'Sunlight Defect', and some of the sounds featured in the game were developed by my good friend 'James Helliwell', who also offered his support and feedback throughout the project.<br/>PERFECT MATTER started out a small personal project, but after the encouragement received by the wonderful a supportive people around me, I became motivated to push it as far as I could, so that it could be my first commercial game. This game gave me a purpose during a difficult time. It was my motivation to get out of bed every morning.<br/>Countless people offered their time to play and test the game, giving their valuable feedback all along the way.<br/>PERFECT MATTER was a solo development project, but it was the product of countless people, and their love and support.
