Not sure if that's allowed, but I was able to upload it. The desktop version was submitted on time.\u00a0This contains no sounds or music. I also would like to suggest to play the desktop version instead because it is sort of more visually appealing - despite my large amounts of empty space. It is only a tiny bit better, really. I just prefer playing with a gamepad on 3rd person types\u00a0 of games. I wasn't able to figure out how to get the triggers to work for WebGL.\u00a0If you download the desktop build, I don't have a pause menu system or exit button. Sorry about that!</p>\n\n<p>### CONTROLS ###</p>\n<p>(Leep - Red Shirt / Bownd - Green shirt)</p>\n<p>KEYBOARD CONTROLS:\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Mouse - Rotate Camera</li><li>WASD - Movement</li><li>Left Mouse Click - (Projectile\u00a0 Fist\u00a0/ Damage Stone)\u00a0 ---<em> SKILL 1</em></li><li>Right Mouse Click-\u00a0 (Bed Spring / Damage Shields) -----<em>SKILL 2</em></li><li>Left Shift - (Invulnerable Dash / Attack / Roll )<em>\u00a0------------SKILL 3</em></li><li>Q - switch to other character\u00a0\u00a0</li><li>E - Interact With Cat ***</li><li>Spacebar - Jump</li></ul>\n\n<p>GAMEPAD CONTROLS<strong> : (TRIGGERS DON'T WORK IN WEBGL and assumes windows build)</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Left Analog Stick - Movement</li><li>Right Analog Stick - Camera Rotation</li><li>A - Interact With Cat\u00a0***</li><li>X - Switch Characters</li><li>Right Bumper - Jump</li><li>Right Trigger\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0(Projectile\u00a0 Fist\u00a0/\u00a0Damage Stone) -----SKILL 1</li><li>Left Trigger -\u00a0\u00a0(Bed Spring\u00a0/ Damage Shields) ----------SKILL 2</li><li>Left Bumper -\u00a0\u00a0(Invulnerable Dash Attack / Roll ) -----SKILL 3</li></ul>\n\n<p>*** When interacting with the cat, even though you can move around, you have to exhaust his messages. To know he's done, if you hit Keyboard(E) or GamepadButton(A), his message doesn't change. In order to advance the quest line, he gives out onions. I can see why implementing it the way I did can be a problem.</p>\n\n<p>There are four blank circles on the screen. They are not intentionally blank. I just ran out of time and never made sprites for it. They represent cooldowns for the skills. Left To Right is Skill 1 to 3 respectively. The skill to input correlation is noted above in the controls.<br/></p>\n\n<p>There's a bug where I beautifully hand crafted a\u00a0race condition where you start out with 0hp. I fixed it on my end, but I already uploaded a build past the due time, so I won't up load another build. You don't really start with 0hp and\u00a0isn't game breaking anyways. Just a minor visual buggy.</p>\n\n<p>### ABOUT ###</p>\n<p>The cat is itchy. You need to find the villain that's causing this to him! If you die, you return to the title screen and work your way back to the main level.</p>\n\n<p>I haven't tested the game as a whole much, so there may be performance issues that I am not aware of. I didn't make the toon shader, so I have zero clue how it performs, but it looks cool!\u00a0The guy who made it is this guy :\u00a0roystan</p>\n\n<p>This was made by two people.</p>\n<p>I did the programming of the ability system, movement, custom character controller (that I made to\u00a0show off walking up cool steep jagged slopes smoothly, but never got around to implementing it in the levels\u00a0T_T), and something else.</p>\n\n<p>Jessie did the animations and 3D models. I made the\u00a0<em>houses </em>and <em>fences</em> in the game, though. They are very supremely detailed.</p>\n\n<p>If you are interested in delicious spaghetti code that violates every coding principle known to Hum4nS, you can download the whole project on my \u00a0githubz. I tried my best to stick and apply S.O.L.I.D principles, but the nature of game jams kind of prevents due to time contraints.\u00a0Anyways, any\u00a0 mean/nice\u00a0comment is welcome, but I would rather prefer critique on my code architecture because my whole project is available. I know the gameplay is...you know. I know you know, you know? The game works.\u00a0I know I\u00a0broke a lot of programming\u00a0laws because I\u00a0was on a 30+ hour crunch streak at the end.\u00a0At that point,\u00a0I\u00a0was a man with nothing to lose. I almost considered drinking coffee to stay up, but it is not this day.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T05:07:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8e/c8e32f5d04bf61b24f45cec7dd985fac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["drw"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
