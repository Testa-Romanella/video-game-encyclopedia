Help Mario and Luigi \n      collect more coins than ever (POW block anyone?) while they run through \n      a variety of stages. Gather enough coins and you'll be treated to \n      another scene bound to bring back fond memories for many. Mario Clock \n      includes both analog and digital clocks that use the system's internal \n      clock or allow you to offset the time however you like. Program up to \n      three alarms (with snooze functionality for those that need it) and \n      assign them a Mario-related sound or use one created in the Nintendo \n      DSi\u2122 Sound application. You'll find yourself thinking \"Just a few more \n      coins...\" in no time!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d79/d7982563cb527f0973569fdfbcaa15dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
