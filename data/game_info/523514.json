Other times it is better to keep\u00a0a slow ghost occupying a lane than to risk it coming back faster.</li><li>Watch out for the cool-down period after a beam's energy is fully depleted.</li><li>Ghosts that go past the top of the screen can still be caught if they have not gone too far.</li><li>The A/S/D keys can be used in place of LEFT/DOWN/RIGHT.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T05:39:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0f/c0f6ed52aeb862ea8d3c52df7c1882f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nucron"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
