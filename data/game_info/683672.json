When you have found all of them, you have solved the game! No explosions or anything, and just one controller:\u00a0the rotation sensor. Twist it left a little and you go left, right a little and you go right. Twist it all the way to go up and down. Kind of like an Etch-a-Sketch! When you stop, your radar is activated to discover the mines. They stay shown on the map once you have found them.</p>\n<p>Made using\u00a0 MicroPython for\u00a0an M5Stack device - info at\u00a0m5stack.com</p><p>Interested in the platform?
