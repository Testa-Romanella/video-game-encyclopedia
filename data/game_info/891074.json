Designing a 3d map was extremely tough, even when I had a good idea in mind. Also, making a \"damaged\" map,\u00a0stage 2, was hard, hence why it looks so rough, I couldn't figure out a way to make it look more \"clean\" even if it's a destroyed stage. I\u00a0also wanted to have a cutscene in-between stage one and two showing the station losing it's \"shield\" and getting hit by asteroids, but I never got around to doing that.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Changes:\u00a0Two fleshed out levels, though level two is pretty similar, it just has a different route with significantly more \"platforming\" and much fewer keymaster fights (though there are still plenty of enemies in level two!)</p>\n<p>Addition of Gravity Switching mechanic</p>\n<p>Addition of enemies \"dropping\" items (keycards, and score orbs)<br/></p>\n<p>Minor Change: added \"keymaster\" enemies\u00a0that drop keycards needed to progress, though they function very similarly to normal enemies, just stronger.</p>\n<p>Minor Change:\u00a0added a \"cutscene\" for beating the game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T16:09:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/667/667f5422040fb9cef5381df39c19acc5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["SaltyLily"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
