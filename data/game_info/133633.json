{"id": 133633, "slug": "gunfighter-death-wish", "name": "Gunfighter: Death Wish", "name_original": "Gunfighter: Death Wish", "description": "<p>Gunfighter: Death Wish is a non-stop action top-down shooter game. In the game the player character engages in a lone assault, shooting large numbers of enemies while dodging their attacks. Thus, the player\u2019s goal is to take out as much hostiles as possible. This game calls for fast reactions and for the player to memorize levels and enemies\u2019 attack patterns.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>You will have an entire arsenal at your disposal from simple handguns to deadly rocket-launchers and fire-throwers. Also, in order to survive the player will have to collect separate power-ups and character upgrades dropping from the hostiles. Powers-ups add extra abilities to the player\u2019s character. For instance, a riot shield, an ATV vehicle, a mech vehicle, etc.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>You will be faced with the smart, armed to the teeth hostiles. There are eight kinds of the enemies in the game. Enemies try to avoid bullets of the player character, take cover while reloading their weapons, etc. They can also hear a sound of gunshots, a thunder of explosions, a clatter of glass windows having been shattered. However, not all kinds of enemies follow this behavior pattern. Each of them acts in conformity with their own behavior patterns, so, you will have to learn you enemies\u2019 behaviors and figure out their strengths and weaknesses. \r\n  </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\u2013 Fight your own way through three arena-like levels filled with the armed to the teeth enemies to achieve the best score.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u2013 Use your constant slow-motion ability if you are trapped in the difficult to survive situation.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u2013 Collect the power-ups and use it with the different weapons to find the most powerful combinations.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u2013 Learn your enemies and figure out their strengths and weaknesses.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Tips for the player:\r\n  </p>\n<p>1. Before playing, go to \u2018Options\u2019 to learn about the controls.\r\n  </p>\n<p>2. Don\u2019t forget to use your slow-mo ability. That\u2019s the key to survive in the game.\r\n  </p>\n<p>3.
