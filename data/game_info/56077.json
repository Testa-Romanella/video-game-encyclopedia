A sequel, Intellivision Rocks, was released in 2001 that includes third-party games originally published by Activision and Imagic as well as Mattel Electronics Intellivoice and ECS games. Versions of Intellivision Lives! were then released for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Nintendo GameCube by Crave Entertainment.
