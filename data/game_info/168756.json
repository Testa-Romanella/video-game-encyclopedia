Use the mouse to aim and shoot, the arrow keys to look around, with mouse scroll to zoom.  Made using Unity a long time ago, source code lost but found this prototype on my hard drive. </p>\n\n<p>*Update - Uploaded multi player build</p>\n<p>Launch two versions, one windowed to use as a server.  Clients can then join via connect to server but the host must start the map manually by clicking start on the server window. **Hamachi recommended. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b49/b49f0b3cce03f5b0912443c5cb28284e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DevOwl"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
