XBoxOne/360 works for Win/Mac, but I've found that only PS4 controller works on Linux, but that could be just how my systems' drivers are set up.<br/></p>\n<p>GearVR version is an experimental extra. It requires a bluetooth gamepad, not the GearVR controller. I\u2019ve only tested with GameSir.</p>\n<p>One purchase should allow you to put the game on multiple computers.</p>\n<p>Sign up for the mailing list for a reminder when it's released.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T05:12:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/014/0142610929d2a0ea4525e3e5cdf48387.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["AaronOldenburg"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
