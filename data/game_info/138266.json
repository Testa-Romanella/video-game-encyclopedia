As players see the story unfold, they are presented with a choice in various parts of the game; the choices may involve Jason narrowly surviving or dying.</p><p>Developer's Notes:</p><p>Created in less than 24 hours, the game is rough around the edges.  The game, however, does express the message that I was trying to convey and therefore does it's job.</p><p>I recommend you analyze phrases, environments, and items.  In doing so, you will be able to fully understand their meaning and message.</p><p>Enjoy the game.</p><p>~ John \"Jason Wanderer\" Ingram<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fc/8fcf20a188685beb1ba82f88c4919c31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jason_Wanderer"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
