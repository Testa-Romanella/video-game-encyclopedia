These are detailed on the Character Select page (from clicking the New Game button) and the Character Info page. (They also have different \"hurt\" sounds).<br/>- Created <strong>two</strong> completely new and unique levels (both of Mya's levels). This means, each character gets two levels to themselves.<br/>- The first level of the tutorial (Etan's first level) was upgraded to be more unique. Both of the tutorial levels were made more visual with props (both of Etan's levels).<br/>- Fixed the pistol with a reskin from provided assets and various other minor changes. For some reason in the assets package provided, the default pistol was super buggy.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/>Created by Elex McCoy<br/>Assets provided by MSU<br/>Character art by Erika Chee</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T05:02:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8a/b8af9a65d29283fa9ce907deca64dc01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["ElexMcCoy"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
