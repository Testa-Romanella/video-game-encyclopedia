It is up to you to make your way to the arena and defeat the kings minions to free your friends.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(This is a very short demo showcasing the current features of the game. In the demo you have to kill the king to win. There is a secret extra life you can get if you find your way to it, if not you have to start demo over. In this game I concentrate on more classic gameplay style where you have x amount of lives, you run out\u00a0 its game over so lives are essential.)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb0/fb07a8eaee7baee113ce15b6ca87211a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["onimike"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
