Once all 15 cards have been flipped the game will simply end.</em></p>\n\n<p>Play a game of cards with a Demon.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong>\n</p>\n<p>- You and the Demon will take turn flipping cards on the board, the value of the card that is flipped will be added to your power and same goes for the Demon. The value of that card will also be added to the winnings, the number on the left in the middle.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>- Once all 15 cards have been flipped, the game will check who has a higher power. The more powerful one will win the round and take all the winnings to their side. The loser gets nothing.\u00a0<em>(not implemented)</em>\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tokens</strong>\u00a0<em>(not implemented)</em>\n</p>\n<p>- If a row of cards have been flipped, the token adjacent to that row of cards will be unlocked and you may use that token now.\u00a0<em>(not implemented, you can still click on them though, but they won't do anything)</em></p>\n<p>- There are two types of tokens.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>- Normal tokens\u00a0which are white with a plus sign, you can put them onto a single unflipped card and it will tell you the value of that unflipped card.\r\n</p>\n<p>- Demons tokens which are red with a skull icon, you can put them onto a single unflipped card but it may or may not\u00a0lie to you the value of that card. But if you flip a card with a demon token on it, you will get winnings passively earned onto your side.\r\n</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits &amp; Additional Thanks to</strong>\n</p>\n<p>- ArtDynasty13 for hosting this Game Jam\r\n</p>\n<p>- High Stakes by Krystman for Inspiration\r\n</p>\n<p>- Inscryption by Daniel Mullins Games for Inspiration\r\n</p>\n<p>- These two images on Pinterest (I traced them)\r\n</p>\n<p>https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/292734044790404086/\r\n</p>\n<p>https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/1000221398470765377/\r\n</p>\n\n\n<p>Made on Scratch\r\n</p>\n<p>Made for the 2023 Mac Game Jam\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T09:29:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63e/63ed66b2e6ca8c22362f71271f370672.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TavinH"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
