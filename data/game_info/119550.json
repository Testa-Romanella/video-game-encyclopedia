Please don't expect anything playable :')</p>\n<p>Main inspiration was my concern about privacy.<br/></p>\n<p>Secret rain included! It activates itself, when you type the number, which is in windows on yellow building.<br/></p>\n<p>I've made this game as my very first bigger creation. I started working on it somewhere about winter 2016 and finished it on may 2017. After that, I published it on deviantart under my older nickname and after several months, deleted that post.</p>\n<p>And a year after first release of this game, I released it again . . please don't try to understand this release/delete drama.</p>\n<p>If you like what I do, you can support me. Easiest way to do so is to write a comment or buy some of my games.<br/></p>\n<p>That's all, please enjoy your stay.<br/></p>\r\nChangelog\r\n<p><strong>1.1 - May 2018</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Chosen option of secret is now\u00a0<strong>not</strong> based on player's operating system, but on a pure randomness.</li><li>Mouse speed increased.</li><li>Just a little touch of optimalisation.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>1.0 - May 2017</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Game was made, yaay.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/075/07537185380673b52333617a1d921cad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["The Rain Project"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
