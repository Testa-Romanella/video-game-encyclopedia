If they get one answer wrong they fail the category and must choose another.  Three strikes and you're out! There is also a challenge mode that endlessly shuffles categories until the strike limit is reached.</p>\n<p>The game treats each correct answer as a point and stores the time remaining for every correct answer as the player's speed. Scores are submitted to the leaderboard sorted by questions correct and then by speed.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Thanks to my wonderful wife Carina for help with design, playtesting, and research</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-15T05:16:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e88/e8861f6b3605ef8700b5e76814ce068d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["bearlikelion"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
