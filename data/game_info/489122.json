The art style has a fantastical medieval feel with striking characters and environments. As the player, you get to select one of three classes, each with their own set of unique abilities. The player must then utilise these abilities and gear up with random weapons bought in the hub in order to fight waves of enemies, defeating bosses and searching for treasure along the way within the different levels.</p>\n\n<p>Control Keys<br/></p>\n<p>WASD -\u00a0 Movement.</p><p>Shift - Sprint.<br/></p>\n<p>T - Opens the task window.</p>\n<p>Control - Character Special Ability <br/></p>\n<p>F - Picks Up Weapon.</p>\n<p>G - Drops Weapon.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T06:53:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f5/3f52b70370c54d227575811a01750a35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 199, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BladestormStudio"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
