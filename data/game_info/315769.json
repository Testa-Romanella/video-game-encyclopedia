Follow HAMilton's\u00a0 journey through the kitchen and battle the chefs trying cook our portly porker before he gets all the truffles they have! Our pig is constantly on the move and needs the truffles to stay alive, the skinnier the swine, the faster he's determined to get his snacks. But watch out, don't be too greedy or our bloated boar will slow down, making it easier for tonight's dinner to be a luau!</p>\n<ul><li>Controls:<ul><li>Enter: Start the game</li><li>Arrow Keys or WASD\u00a0: Move the pig around</li><li>Space: jump</li></ul><ul><li>F or Shift: attack</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>The team</strong><br/></p><ul><li>Bryan</li><li>Jack (he wrote the music!)</li><li>Kameron</li><li>Max (he did the art!)</li><li>Zack</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e22/e22d2a3e3b470cc9a3fff8d00e12c6ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["kamkranse"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
