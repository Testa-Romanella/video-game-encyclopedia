Theres nothing else to this game, its probably very bad so don't play it...</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Please Don't</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jokes Aside, this game is still in development, stuff might be broken, all the enemys are not in the game yet, I may consider turning the water in the middle of the map into lava, I may add random map generation, and I may add in new weapons, either way.
