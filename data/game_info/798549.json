One of our three main members sadly couldn't be here, otherwise we might have been able to hit the deadline! As it stands, we took 3 hours and 50 minutes, which is still a personal record for a finished game . Maybe next time, we should skip the procedurally generated flower pots :).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Engine<br/></strong>As always, we build everything in raw JavaScript.
