Some of the levels are quite simple, yet some are harder than others.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>Use \"A\" and \"D\" and \"SPACE\" for simple movement. Also if you wish to go back to the main menu and lose all your progress then hit \"R\".<br/></p>\n\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<p>Everything made by me. I used BeepBox for the music and Bfxr to make the sounds in the game.</p><p>This game also features a full tutorial and up to 10 different levels! Each (hopefully) getting harder as you go.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-25T04:09:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/793/7935e93179f73cc407e4dd48824f01dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lex R."], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
