Click on a yellow square to start solving the puzzle and find the hidden pixels. Solve puzzles to reveal more of the hidden picture. Any sections of the picture that are all one colour are already revealed. You're welcome!</p>\n<ul><li>TIP: If you want to start with some easier levels, choose sections around the edges. These usually have fewer pixels to solve.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Solving a Level</strong></p>\n<p>Solve each level by finding the coloured pixels hidden under the blue squares.</p>\n<p>At the start of each level, some pixels are already solved.</p>\n<p>Press <strong><em>m</em></strong> to open the colour menu and select a colour. The pencil cursor will change to the colour you selected. You can also use the <strong><em>SPACE</em></strong> key to quickly change colours.</p>\n<p>When you change colours, numbers will appear on squares that have been solved.\u00a0The numbers\u00a0tell you how many neighbouring squares are hiding pixels that\u00a0have the colour you selected. A neighbour square is any square that is touching horizontally, vertically or diagonally.\u00a0If you don't see any numbers, try changing the colour.</p>\n<ul><li>TIP: If you solve a square with eight neighbours that are all the same colour, all the neighbours will be automatically solved.</li></ul>\n<p>Click on a shiny blue square to draw a pixel in the selected colour. If you got it right, the hidden pixel will be shown.</p>\n<p>Be careful! If you draw a pixel with the wrong colour it will explode.</p>\n<p>\u00a0When you find all the hidden pixels, the level is complete and you can choose another from the Level Selection screen. If you solve a level with less than three explosions, all the pixels in the level will be revealed and you will see a little more of the hidden picture. If you solve a puzzle without causing any explosions, you get a gold star.</p>\n<p><strong>Completing the picture</strong></p>\n<p>Solve all the puzzles\u00a0to see the complete picture. Get a gold star for every puzzle and you win the game!</p>\n<p><strong>GRATITUDE</strong></p>\n<p>The picture in this game is by\u00a0leon sandstone.
