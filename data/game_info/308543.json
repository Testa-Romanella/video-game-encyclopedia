It was developed as part of a 3 months long group class project in which the objective was both highlighting Marjane's work and the work of other Iranian Illustrators and Designers.\u00a0Currently, it is only available in portuguese.<br/></p>\n<p>Kept here for portfolio purposes<br/></p>\n<p>This is a fan made game, entirely unassociated from the graphic novel, the movie, or its creator Marjane Satrapi, and it is only intended\u00a0as a homage to the original work.
