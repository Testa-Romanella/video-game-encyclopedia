You look at the wall from one side \u2014 it exists. You look from the other \u2014 you can go through it. But you have to open and close them for your own purposes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, you can't stand on open walls, and you can't jump away from them. During maneuvers, you will have to both open and close many walls.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Easy to learn \u2014 hard to master.</strong> The controls are straightforward and standard \u2014 relative to the camera. Just to keep the direction of movement, you will have to change controls on the fly. <br/><br/><strong>A puzzle and a platformer.</strong> Before you make a jump, look around and think. Understand the correct sequence of jumps and camera turns.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If you are a fan of hardcore platformers, then in CaS-Puz you will definitely find a new challenge for yourself.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-12T07:56:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73b/73b5acb7aedce79a165e3c1204101751.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pomegranate Game Studio"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Pomegranate Game Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
