The game has a few bugs to iron out but we hope this doesn't affect gameplay much.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T07:05:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b86/b86fc39dc6a8a5b9d2739de88e099d56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SeanAnastasi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
