Utilized your tether to rewind back to anchor points to help Ariadne solve puzzles and navigate a subterranean world.\u00a0</p><p><em>The rocks shifted under Ariadne's each footstep. Faith scaled this hill hours earlier after the argument they had. Even with her gear bag she was still fast. Ariadne pushed further along the slope, she had to get to Faith before she did something reckless, she wanted to make sure she was alright.</em></p>\n<p><em>Forty minutes later and Ariadne was standing in the shadow of the cliff face. Boulders of massive scale littered the old quarry. Centered between what seemed to be two dilapidated pillars was a large crevice. The shatter in the sheer slope was deep enough that light couldn't grasp onto anything. It was dark, deep, dooming even. It was also just large enough for someone to squeeze into, someone the size of Ariadne or Faith.\r\n</em></p>\n<p><em>Ariadne was amazed by the quarry and its magnificent stone, though quickly became transfixed on the orange duffel that laid next a fallen pillar. It was impossible to mistake Faith's gear back with all its various patches from national parks and climbing competitions. As Ariadne approached the orange bag, she noticed that it was opened and rummaged through. Ropes littered the ground around it with various other climbing tools. A rewinding winch was rigged to the fallen pillar with a single rope tethered to it extending into the crevice that Ariadne noticed earlier.\r\n</em></p>\n<p><em>With a sigh of relief, Ariadne collapsed next to a jagged boulder. Faith was just climbing around the crevice, she needed a way to blow off some steam. The hard rock poked her in multiple places on back and arm. The rocks here were supposed to be the reason she was here. Writing about the history of local rock quarries was her latest assignment for the magazine, and since she hadn't spent much time with Faith the past few weeks, she invited her to come along. She knew that there would be plenty of natural features for Faith to climb while she was working.\r\n</em></p>\n<p><em>Suddenly there was a loud crack, and the rewind winch began spinning violently. Ariadne jolted up and felt a rumble beneath her hands and feet. Thrashing cracks and whips sounded from the cave as Ariadne clamored to her feet. The winch jammed to a halt, bringing back the frayed end of a defeated rope.\r\n</em></p>\n<p><em>Ariadne held her breath. Faith was hurt, if not dead. Her knees hit the ground as she scrambled through Faith's gear. If she could find a harness she could go in after her. The sleeves of her jacket seemed to catch on every piece of velcro as she reached the bottom of the bag. Finally she lifted out one of Faiths harnesses. She stepped into it and buckled the safety lock. Ariadne was nowhere near as experienced as Faith, but she had to go in after her. She had to find her.\r\n</em></p>\n<p><em>She sized up the crevice, giving her safety rope one last tug to make sure it was secure. A cold, damp draft emanated from within the rockface.\r\n</em></p>\n<p><em>\"You can do this Ari, you can find Faith\", she swallowed deeply, sliding her left foot into the darkness.</em>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T07:22:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af1/af188a1dac5bc5f1b09cabea8acc0ccf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheArcherZero"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
