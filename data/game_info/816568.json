Going with the theme of Heal, I was given the idea to make a game around the Nine Herbs Charm, an Old English poem that is one of two representations of the old Scandinavian gods in that language. The charm contains prose instructions on creating a herbal healing salve, preceded by a poem about the virtues and properties of the reagents.</p>\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to look at my game!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T07:00:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07c/07c92f25c851141f87a0e93cc401ded4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["nenmyx"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
