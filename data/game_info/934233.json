Unfortunately, as your relationship gets more deep and meaningful, the commitment also increases, and it becomes harder and harder to stay afloat.\u00a0See how long you can last by working together.</p>\n<p>Test the buoyancy of your relationship!</p>\n<p>You are given tasks at random. When the prompt comes up, press the interact button (space bar / right shift)\u00a0 to initiate a task. For clarification on how to do a task, hit escape to view the instructions in the pause menu. If you pick up something by accident you can put it in the finished box to get rid of it.<br/></p>\n<p>Once a task is fully completed, it will be reset. After this you will be given a new random task</p>\n<p>Leaks can appear at random throughout your hull. You must retrieve wood planks from the top level of the ship to</p>\n<p>Fix these holes, otherwise the ship will start sinking even faster. Once the water reaches the top deck, you may or may not be completely screwed :) Try and see how long you can survive for and post your time in the comments.<br/></p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy our game.</p>\n<p><strong>- Ashton &amp; Ethan</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T16:06:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fe/2fe81ff9e988aa69332672a242b7e39e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ashton video game", "Ethan D"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
