Events were rewritten and scrapped from books as people turned their battle into a \u2018sport\u2019.<br/><br/>The rich would gamble their money as the poor only hoped to win the grand prize. Teams would enter and leave as enemies. Alliances between Towers were formed, only for friendships to end. The power of money convinced anyone.<br/><br/><strong>Gameplay</strong><br/>Battle of the Four Towers is an online 1v1v1v1 game that is best played with friends.<br/>Take command of a tower as you battle 3 others in a game of strategy and wits.<br/>Each round, pick up to 3 actions, either attack another tower or defend from another tower. If you manage to attack a tower, then they lose 3 Life Points (LP), but if they defend they lose nothing.
