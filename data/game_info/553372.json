Our nameless protagonist has dedicated\r\nhimself to a collection of retro Japanese computer games, with a\r\nparticular fondness for early visual novels. Although decaying in a\r\nslovenly existence to the untrained eye, his retreat into digital\r\nlife is enriched by the scripted interactions with various charming\r\n2D girls. His one purpose in life is to chronicle his thoughts and\r\nreflections on each of the digital worlds he immerses himself in.\u00a0However, one day while pulling out the box of another visual novel to review, a girl leaps\u00a0straight out of the cover art and begins interacting with him face to face. And perhaps most shocking of all to him, in a completely unscripted manner.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T05:12:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aad/aad0c9742dc2674419b29488281cc363.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Zalor"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
