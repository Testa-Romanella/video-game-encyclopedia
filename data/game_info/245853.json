The ladies will love you forever, but heck, you\u2019re just doing it cuz you need to kick your Saturday morning hangover. Yeah, you have that cool looking suit, but that\u2019s just because there was a sale at the local thrift shop. The guns are just a perk of the job. And OH, did we mention wolverine blades and deadly grenades... things are gettin\u2019 interesting. If you\u2019re looking for a traditional, run of the mill zombie shooter, then this ain\u2019t your game, but if you want a retro-styled, zombie-crushin\u2019 experience, look no further. THIS GAME HAS GOT U COVERED.<br/> <br/>Game Features:<br/>- Dope arsenal of weapons to upgrade and choose from. Why stick with a pistol when you got a flamethrower?!<br/>- We got more levels than wrinkles on your grandpa\u2019s face. Talk about some good content.<br/>- A plane full of snakes sounds pretty ridiculous, but you got a laboratory of nurses stabbing with their tongues, egg-dropping zombie birds, and knife wielding butchers to name a few. In case that isn\u2019t enough, good luck with those 8 bosses.<br/>- And if you\u2019re one of those \u201cgo-getters\u201d, we have that late night lovin\u2019 you be lookin\u2019 for with missions, achievements, and leaderboards galore.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:40:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce3/ce3172c767f62d04fb4ad143e1bbcec1_8aZ0dS9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Yodo1 Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Yodo1 Hong Kong"], "esrb_rating": null}
