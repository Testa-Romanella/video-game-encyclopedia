If you are overwhelmed, chill and mosh with the crawlers until many powerups have spawned, they can't hurt you if you have no presents.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58b/58b82cf4305d8ef3c9c322484d18760f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Elrobo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
