It is a follow-up to 1997's Slayers Royal but is a standalone story in the Slayers franchise and not a direct sequel. The game sold well, but its reviews were mostly only moderately positive.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1998-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e4/8e4aff1893b528742467560ea5650b4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 341, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation", "SEGA Saturn"], "developers": ["Onion Egg"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Kadokawa Shoten", "ESP"], "esrb_rating": null}
