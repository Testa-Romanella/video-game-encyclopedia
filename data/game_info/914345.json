I must give a warning that this game has very shallow gameplay with the only requirement to keep the number of circles on screen to below 10. Within the settings, there are various customizable options for the player's enjoyment.</p>\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to check out this game and I hope you enjoy it! This is my official first game that I've published. I plan to continue to develop more games in the future when time allows (university is time consuming).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T12:51:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42a/42a5146e1266ee126ead2bbb9b038784.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["alwynT"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
