Mannequins are along the way to the end, with some being alive and wanting to stop you. The only way to tell which mannequins are villainous is by the subtle (and not so subtle) clues when you're not looking in their direction. Some may move, look, and change their pose as you use your observational skills to get through the game. Move from mannequin to mannequin in a frightening walking experience.<br/><br/>Currently, there is no story in the game as of now.<br/><strong>Features</strong><br/><ul><li><h3>A tense, frightening experience you can play at your own pace:</h3>No time limits, no need to rush, just observation and patience to get through. <br/><br/></li><li><h3>Randomized placement of evil mannequins: </h3>No stage will be the same.<br/><br/></li><li><h3>A leveling system to unlock more in the game:</h3>You need to play to unlock stages, difficulties, and achievements.<br/><br/></li><li><h3>Customise your difficulty:</h3>Five different difficulties across the Map and Mannequins to be unlocked.<br/><br/></li><li><h3>Twelve stages with six themes:</h3>Six themes stages with a small and larger variant. <br/><br/></li><li><h3>Hidden Items to find:</h3>Each stage has a hidden jewel that unlocks new cosmetic skins for the mannequins.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T03:36:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d98/d9814b0a481184b98a4a09c8ba9a8791.jpg", "website": "https://robotlegsgames.weebly.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 334, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Robot Legs"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Robot Legs"], "esrb_rating": null}
