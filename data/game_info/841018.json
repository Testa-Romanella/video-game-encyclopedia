We've reworked the game a lot to make it way more fun, visually appealing and scalable.</p>\n<p>This Technical Alpha\u00a0includes two maps, content up to level 20, monsters to fight, shops, a bank, item upgrades, etc. It's meant to test our infrastructure and\u00a0how the engine performs with actual players. If everything goes smoothly, we'll continue updating this version with more content and features until we reach an Open Alpha stage in late September.</p>\n<p>In order to play, you'll need a character. You can create your character within the game by clicking the \"New Character\" option in the main menu. Accounts created during the Alpha period might be deleted at any time. If you had an account in the previous version of the game, you'll have to create a new account for this one. No characters have yet been migrated from the Eterspire:\u00a0Return of Salgaraak, nor will be migrated during the Alpha stage.</p>\n<p>There's a <strong>Feedback button</strong> on the bottom right corner of the screen, next to the minimap. Please use it to give us feedback, report bugs, etc!\u00a0You'll be helping us make the game better! This is just the start, there's a lot of room for improvement!</p>\n<p>We recommend you download this game using the Itch.io Launcher, so it's constantly kept up to date with any new updates we might release.</p>\n<p>Also, please do\u00a0join us in the Eterspire Discord Server!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Click somewhere to move.</li><li>Click a monster to attack it.</li><li>Click an NPC to talk with them.</li><li>You can chat by pressing Enter.
