A prototype, for a game themed like the old MegaMan Battle Network series. This demo is one of my oldest experiments from a while back that\u00a0I\u00a0made to test out assets, thus it is buggy as all get out</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls for showcase demo:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move around</li><li>Shift increases movement speed</li><li>\"E\" interacts with the crates to pick them up</li><li>\"ESC\" opens and closes menus (The only menu connected is Protocols, and it's bugged as all get out). You can use\u00a0the Up and Down arrows to go through the menu list once it's open</li><li>Mouse scroll wheel Zooms in and out</li></ul>\n<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: The HTML export seems to have issues with the mouse conflicting and causing trouble after starting the game. Once you click start, move the mouse out of the game window (unless you want to Zoom in and out with the scroll wheel)\u00a0and press the arrow key(s) in the direction(s) the character seems to be stuck moving in to reset it</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tools used:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>(Art)\u00a0<strong>Clip Studio Paint</strong></li><li>(Art)\u00a0<strong>Pyxel Edit</strong></li><li>(Game Engine)\u00a0<strong>Godot</strong></li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Assets used in this prototype are available for download:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>~160 Tiles</li><li>~15 GUI elements</li><li>6 Backgrounds</li><li>2 Minor animations (Teleporter and interact sign above the crates)</li><li>1 Splash art</li><li>1 Basic character with animations (24 sprites. 8 front, 8 back, 8 left which can\u00a0mirror to get the right movement)</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>License for the download:</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li>\u00a0You may use and modify the contents to your needs for commercial and non-commercial projects, just don't redistribute or sell the asset pack or assets by themselves</li><li>\u00a0Credit is not required, but always greatly appreciated!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T08:33:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/556/556ca4c812013373625fbcaa34174de7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Silivar"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
