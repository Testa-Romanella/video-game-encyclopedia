{"id": 203444, "slug": "blood-of-dragons", "name": "Blood of Dragons", "name_original": "Blood of Dragons", "description": "<p>At the earliest point in recorded history, around 10000 years ago, the land was populated by magnificent creatures each unique and immensely powerful, there were serpents, phoenix but above them all were Dragons. These huge, scaled winged beasts were not only powerful but intelligent easily becoming the dominant race and creating civilisations of sorts. However there was one problem, all the dragons were intelligent and powerful with none being classed as the strongest, there was no one to rule and no one to rule over.<br/></p>\n<p>That was until around 1000 years later where seemingly from nowhere, the first human was born. At first the dragonkind believed them just to be another race, a weak one at that, but as many years passed the humans continued to survive and spread. Some dragons believed the humans to be a threat or unworthy to become rivals of the dragons and wished to wipe them out. But others saw the potential of humanity and believed that one day they could live alongside each other. Inevitably this argument split the dragons into two factions, the supremacist dragons kingdom known as Draconia and the equalist dragons kingdom known as Paz.</p>\n<p>The two kingdoms warred for many years until eventually it seemed as though Paz were to be wiped out. Realizing what would happen the Paz dragons understood they couldn\u2019t win alone, they began gathering more humans for their army finally treating them as equals as they had promised to do so many years ago, the humans were riskily armed with magic designed to kill dragons and managed to turn the tide of the war.</p>\n<p>After 1000 years the war was coming to a close but after all the bloodshed both sides had begun to fear what humans were capable of. Due to this fear of humans and because of the many beings that had lost their lives in this war, a deal was struck. The war would peacefully end and the humans would be allowed to live but they would not be treated as equals, they would live under the remaining dragons, and would not be allowed to have too much power. Enough of the Draconian forces agreed to the terms in order to end the war, yet the most savage of the Draconia dragons refused and were put into eternal slumbers.</p>\n<p>Another 1000 years passed in peace, the humans had become for the most part content with their position yet there were a few who wished to overthrow the dragons but there were not enough humans with this mindset to be a real threat to the dragons. Until one day out of nowhere many of the remaining dragons began to fall under permanent sleep with no explanation. This would continue for many years, till less than a hundred dragons were left. Many humans began to realize they now outnumbered the dragons \u00a0greatly and attempted to overthrow them, most of the dragons managed to escape however and went into safe hiding to wait for their slumber.</p>\n<p>So began the age of man for almost 5000 years, humans began to spread and become more powerful, unrivaled. But 1000 years before the present, the remaining dragons of Draconia had begun to break their seal and had awoken, seeing what had become of the world they began to plot their return. However the humans now confident in their abilities did not consider the dragons a major threat and didn\u2019t focus much on their return. But this changed when the draconian dragons took great great measures to create an army. First in order to assure the survival of dragons in some form they began crossbreeding with other species resulting in cousin races like Wyverns and Hydra. Next they began awakening the remaining sleeping dragons and convinced them to combine their forces against humanity. So the great human- dragon war had begun, a battle between two dominant races, with no signs of a winning side or of peace.</p>\n<p>Until now. You are the first of your kind a sign of hope, born the first ever human- dragon hybrid you belong to neither side. You are the key to the future, you are the first of the two races in years who could decide the war, will you bring peace, will you send the dragons back to extinction or will you take revenge on humanity? Only you can decide the fate of this world.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/297/29713a8327f11e19e09ff99c30ae2a57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["40096710@uxbridge.ac.uk"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
