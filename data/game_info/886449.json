The win condition is dependent on the score that the AI has, which is achieved by gathering or snatching the food from other players, where the name of the game comes from. AI\u2019s use the same base script, which every developer inherits, and then can decide if they want to edit the parent script from their child scripts. Each AI starts with a score counter of 0 and equal move speed. However, every AI has its own unique ability, which it can use to protect itself or to engage with others better.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T04:58:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/141/1414a5a07b762a68ea6d270ccf120be0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alexei Dubarenco"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
