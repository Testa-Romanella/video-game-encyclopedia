Yeah... This game won't help you cure it.</p>\n<p>This is a simulation of how bad a person reacts to isolation. It may be scary, it contains horror elements, but the point is to experience a mind going wild in the isolated space.<br/>This is only a prototype, not a full vertical slice of a game. The whole thing should take you no more than 20 minutes, you may experience weird noises, anxiety and mirages.</p>\n<p>And one thing more, the experience can be different for each individual. Do not panic.<br/>If you feel dizzy or you experience rising heartbeat, please turn off this game by simple tapping Escape button.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-18T04:49:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c4/9c43f60025f639b98675e1c0ee3ef03c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mega Zeal Studio"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
