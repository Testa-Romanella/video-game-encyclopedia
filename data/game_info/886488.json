East Dawson creek, the map is based on a true elevation map, sat view, and some modifications coming from my inspiration. The map is composed by 93 fields, from small to very big sizes.</p>\n<p>- 5 farms full equiped</p>\n<p>- Dairy, hogs, feedlot, 2 grain farms</p>\n<p>- 6 sell points:</p>\n<p>- 3 grain sell points, roots, milk, hay..., manure...</p>\n<p>- You can buy everything in the industrial zone: gas, animals, herbicide, ....</p>\n<p>- Canola swath, anhydrous, customized crops, trafic, light, season mask, decofoliage compatible w. season, multiangles.</p>\n<p>- You start your career without vehicules, however I let you a gift, on your bank account. It should represents a good starting point.</p>\n<p>- Not a 4x, 16x, 64x, something different, never released on FS19. The map is 10km large, which is an unconventional size. For that reason I modified the Season mod script. I received the agreement of Realismus to integrate the modified season mod directly to the map.<br/></p>\n\n<p>WARNINGS:</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Unselect Season RM mod in your mod list</p>\n<p>- The map is based on half pixel resolution. It is not in line with the Giant garantee. The map is by the way not optimized and probably\u00a0required high PC performances.</p>\n\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<p>- NEFG for the crops, EMR, JS MAPPING, TPF for the placeables</p>\n\n<p>THANKS:</p>\n<p>Robin, for the many hours spent to test all the fields, days and nights!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T05:17:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/120/12099749ffd4b2fec2260f0d53aab297.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Camil Canuck"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
