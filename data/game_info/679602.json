{"id": 679602, "slug": "pros-and-cons-quest", "name": "Pros and Cons-Quest", "name_original": "Pros and Cons-Quest", "description": "<p><em>Pros and Cons-Quest</em> is a choose-your-own adventure style game designed by The-Fairytale-Four: Jonathon Dominguez, Cheyenne Gluckle, Leigh Hillegass, and Heather Parker, who are all students at The Ohio State University. In <em>Pros and Cons-Quest,</em> the player is faced with a series of choices, all along their way to save a princess from a tower guarded by a dragon. The player must be aware, however, as you are only given a certain amount of energy points, and some choices will cost you more than others.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>While this game may appear to be a typical hero\u2019s journey game where a brave person saves a damsel in distress, and they live happily ever after, we made it our goal to disrupt this cliche. As you may notice after a few playthroughs, there is no way to truly \u201cwin\u201d the game. Each path, no matter which you choose, leads to the very same ending each time. However, you are prompted to play the game again at the end of each run through, in addition to the offer to move on to the afterlife. The player\u2019s inability to change the ending no matter how many times they may try serves as a statement on the very human nature of overthinking. Just like in the game, no matter how much we think of what we could have done differently in the past, the ending won\u2019t change. Our hope is that the players of the game will recognize this in themselves, and turn their focus from what could have been, and look to what <em>can</em> be in the future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T08:30:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/869/869cb8ba79ae2493d5b387e92bdd445f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The-Fairytale-Four"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
