As one of the few pure-blooded humans capable of using magic, Sable is hopeful that he\u2019ll find common ground with the demi-human population at the school, and that the next few years of his life will be as productive as they are enlightening.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for Sable, his first day at Amadronia quickly proves to him that this will not be the case. The students in his class are unruly, there\u2019s a pyromaniac dragon girl running around, his \"teacher\" has no interest in teaching, the principal wilfully breaks academy rules, and it seems like everywhere he turns, Sable finds one more reason to doubt Amadronia's proud legacy.<br/><br/>Will Sable manage to survive at this clearly dysfunctional academy? Or will he, like so many others, leave Amadronia feeling utterly disillusioned?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li> 5 main monster girl heroines with 4 divergent routes<br/></li><li> 350k word count with dozens of choices to be made<br/></li><li> 13 different endings influenced by your choices<br/></li><li> Contains a route map for visualizing your choices and the path you've taken<br/></li><li> Checkpoints on the route map let you restart the game from key decisions, even if you didn't save<br/></li><li> All original artwork and music made specifically for this game</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T14:16:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f01/f0147585b95da4146afddb44775c815f.jpg", "website": "https://zetsubou.games/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 8, "achievements_count": 81, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 499, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Zetsubou"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Zetsubou"], "esrb_rating": null}
