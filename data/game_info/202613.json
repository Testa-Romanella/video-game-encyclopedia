{"id": 202613, "slug": "fenced", "name": "Fenced", "name_original": "Fenced", "description": "<p>Fenced is a MOBA-Inspired stealth game where two teams of thieves attempt to steal the same objects from a museum. This is an early prototype of the game with controls and core mechanics established. There are two playable classes, Hacker and Picnher, which are assigned based on when you join the lobby (class selection will be available in a future update). Hackers can hack cameras and set falser alarms. Pinchers can steal objects and grapple on walls. This game is very much in early stages/first pass levels and still contains numerous bugs. Controls forthcoming.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7a/c7a1e234848bfa3f6cb25b86e0019295.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jarory"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
