Help Harry as he travels around the world putting a stop to the mushroom gang!</p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY:</p>\n<p>Walk - arrow keys</p>\n<p>Jump - Z or C</p>\n<p>Lick things - X</p>\n<p>GOAL: Find the portal at the end of each level. Harry will get hungry over time, so make sure to eat enemy mushrooms as well as berries you find sitting around the levels.</p>\n<p>TIPS:</p>\n<ul><li>Blue mushrooms are tough and can't be licked normally. If you eat a spicy pepper, Harry will turn red-hot for a few seconds. Use this time to eat the blue mushrooms.</li><li>If you lick while in the air, Harry can get a little extra boost. By licking on the ground and then jumping soon after, Harry can jump extra high or extra far, depending on whether or not you are holding a direction key down.</li><li>See if you can find every present in the game! You can get lots of berries from presents by licking them.</li></ul>\n<p>PROTIP!!!</p>\n<p>Is Harry too easy for you? Press ENTER and choose hard mode for a real challenge!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6e/b6e7067b26a563188d57492083c016b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Paloblancogames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
