So this is a bit of a different upload as it is a project that I recently found on my old laptop while my current PC was being repaired. It should be 7-8 years old by now? But anyway, I really liked how it held up, and so I added in some QoL features and chose to release it\u00a0here.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>The goal is to survive 10 waves of enemies + a small boss in the middle. Every wave consists of a random pattern of small enemies with one big enemy layered on top. From time to time, different weapons will drop, allowing you to equip the one which suits your current situation better.</p>\n<p>Small enemies will release energy that will charge up your bomb, a powerful attack that can easily bypass any wave. Big enemies will release orbs that grant you an item when you collect enough of them. Items provide short-term benefits upon use.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Hold down <strong>Left Click</strong> to shoot, <strong>Right Click</strong> to use item (if available), <strong>Shift</strong> to lock aim and <strong>Shift+Space</strong> to release bomb (if available). Move around with the cursor.\u00a0There are 8 weapons, 3 bomb types, 2 items and 3 different stages, each one with its own simple gimmick.</p>\n<p>You can press <strong>F</strong> to enter full-screen mode.\u00a0To visit all 3 stages, press <strong>1</strong>, <strong>2</strong> or <strong>3</strong> on your keyboard. This will reset the game and set you on a different stage. Pressing <strong>A </strong>will fully heal you.</p>\r\nMusic\r\n<p>As the soundtrack when I found the project\u00a0were just songs ripped from Touhou, I composed 3 original tracks in a Touhou-ish style in order to replace them in this release. Link to the tracks is included below, but you can also stream them on SoundCloud.</p>\n<p>Everything else in the game was made by me when I was like... fourteen? Wow.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T11:21:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11f/11f664e370d8ba41062a1f080ff64650.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ThanielPIN"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
