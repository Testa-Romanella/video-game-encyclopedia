The Zen version provides 144,000 puzzles, 48,000 in each of small, medium and large sizes. The goal of each puzzle is to determine the placements of images within the honeycomb (up to 37 different cells on the large puzzles) and to determine the exact path that runs through each cell of the honeycomb.  You're provided with sufficient clues (presented graphically) to determine all of this using clear, cold, precise logic.  Are you up to the task, or are you too buzzy?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T02:48:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f02/f02edb33b2f152dd819718ca71aaf855.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Everett Kaser Software"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Everett Kaser"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
