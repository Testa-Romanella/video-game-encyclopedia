Key features include popular face-tracking and AR technique, that lets the player eat food (or not) by opening and closing their mouth and drinking water by turning their head, all while keeping the tolerance meter in check. In this frenzy of goofy animations and spicy food extravaganza, players compete for the ultimate championship.
