Or, so he thinks. But as life throws him hurdles and challenges in the form of a rival group and a looming deadline for the auditions for an international game competition, Jun realizes that he has to adjust to this terrifyingly new stage. <br/><br/>Will he manage to solve all his problems using this \u2018ability\u2019 of his, or will he be forced to accept that perhaps everything he has ever believed in has been nothing but a lie?About the Developer<br/>Tamaya Kagiya is a new, independent game studio specializing in visual novels.
