Enjoy.</p>\n<p>This was originally meant to be a much bigger project but being short on time, I had to cut a lot of ideas. I've always liked fishing games but I've wondered why there aren't any games where you fish up fantastical creatures. That's where the idea for this game came from, but as you can see, there isn't much on display. I would like to continue this project but without forcing myself to make the entire thing in like 1 1/2 days.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Enter to pull fishing rod<br/></p>\n<p>Left and Right: Control Lure</p>\n<p>Click buttons to attack<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T07:37:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c55/c55e557c5f43cd3b11f7c564a918030c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Loogi"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
