{"id": 56135, "slug": "naruto-clash-of-ninja", "name": "Naruto: Clash of Ninja", "name_original": "Naruto: Clash of Ninja", "description": "<p>Naruto: Clash of Ninja, released in Japan as Naruto: Gekit\u014d Ninja Taisen! (NARUTO -\u30ca\u30eb\u30c8- \u6fc0\u95d8\u5fcd\u8005\u5927\u6226!), is a series of 3D cel-shaded fighting games based on the popular manga and anime series Naruto by Masashi Kishimoto. They are developed by Eighting and published by D3 Publisher and Tomy. Various installments of the series have appeared on both Nintendo's GameCube, Wii and a pending platform. Four games are available for the GameCube, seven for the Wii and one speculated for the Wii U though its platform has not been confirmed yet. Naruto: Clash of Ninja, Clash of Ninja 2, Revolution, Revolution 2 and Revolution 3 are available in the US. Naruto: Clash of Ninja 2, Revolution and Revolution 2 are available in PAL regions. Naruto Shippuden: Clash of Ninja Revolution III was released in Europe on April 9, 2010. All installments, excluding the Revolution series, have been released in Japan.</p>\n<p>Each installment of the series has had numerous methods of play with varying types of modes. New games have introduced additional modes that appear in subsequent games. The player directly controls a character taken from the Naruto series, and uses their unique abilities to battle and defeat an opponent. New games in the series include more of the Naruto plotline in a \"story mode,\" and it tends to stay true to the source material. As a result, the character selection increases with each installment due to the inclusion of more of the Naruto plotline. With the newer games incorporating Naruto: Shipp\u016bden, the second part of the Naruto series, many of the characters have been substantially redesigned, and the selection correspondingly limited. Reactions to early installments were mixed, while later titles have been received more positively, with many praising the simple and easy-to-learn fighting system while others lambasting the fighting system, and the lack of significant unlockable content.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2003-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-11T10:18:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/035/035ef317447d5862ec56d5dffbd806ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.25, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 3, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 5, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["GameCube"], "developers": ["Eighting"], "genres": ["RPG", "Fighting"], "publishers": ["Bandai Namco Entertainment", "D3 Publisher", "Tomy"], "esrb_rating": null}
