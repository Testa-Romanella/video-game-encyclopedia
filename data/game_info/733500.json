While on areal view can switch between planes but cannot change between colours. Press \"SPACE\" to change perspectives. \"Q\" to place markers and \"E\" to remove them. You start in a monochromatic, multilayered maze and your goal is to reach the middle and grab a heart. Afterward, the world gains colour and you need to solve the maze with the newly added colours. In this game you are on the hunt to bring the colour back into your life. Sometimes life can seem dull and gray but through persistence and flexible thinking you can turn it around and live colourfully. In this game, you can explore a brand new perspective based mechanic and puzzles that require outside the box thinking.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T06:47:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ba/8ba100e6c760b5ef09ba049022249d4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Francisco Costa"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
