All voice clips are from the Electric Playground/Judgement Day show. I personally made all the music.\u00a0\u00a0In this game you click spheres that give you different points based on what color sphere you click. Teal spheres give 1 pt, red spheres give 5 pts, and black spheres give 10 pts. If you get a score high enough in 30 seconds than you make it to the next level. There are a total of 5 levels in the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Made with the Unity Engine with C#.</p><p>Email me at jbchmbrs@gmail.com if you have any questions or just want to contact me</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/924/9247f12117655612b94ffd9362c970c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JacoTimothyLeo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
