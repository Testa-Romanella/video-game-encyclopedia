{"id": 62587, "slug": "bearhammer", "name": "BearHammer", "name_original": "BearHammer", "description": "BearHammer will make you feel strong, like <strong>BEAR</strong>.  In BearHammer you can absolutely smash enemies with giant hammers, sending them flying throughout Bearonia with powerful ragdoll physics.  You can also <strong>THROW</strong> these hammers and return them, simply by holding the trigger.  <br/><br/>BearHammer is an action RPG arcade game, a unique mix between a wave based arcade game and a story-based RPG.  <br/><br/>For fans of quick action &amp; <strong>difficult</strong> challenges, there are 20 waves featuring different varieties of monsters and different objectives, ranging from taking down powerful bosses, surviving onslaughts of enemies with unique attacks, to defending the village of Bearonia itself.  We hope this arcade style gameplay appeals to people looking for quick satisfying and especially <strong>challenging</strong> gameplay, making it a fun game to show off to friends.  <br/><br/>For fans of story, immersion, and exploration, BearHammer features the beautiful island of Bearonia to explore with a rich backstory and voice-acted characters and several unlockable story sequences in the game, where you'll get the opportunity to ride a bear, ride a dragon, and challenge some of the ultimate villains of Bearonia.  <br/><br/>You are tasked with defending Bearonia and its inhabitants of bears, turtles, and rabbits from the invasion of the evil armies of the Toad King, who summons evil StabRats, Crabbos, Dragon Beasts, Battle Toads, and more to spread his Power of the Frossst.  <br/><br/>This isn't another wave based game where you don't move and everything just comes at you--to win at BearHammer you must plan your attack and move throughout the level to stop different boss monsters from spawning more enemies.  <br/><br/>The game features teleport controls and free motion controls, which have given very few players dizziness due to the game's level design that features mostly flat ground and far views of the horizon.  <br/><br/>In the coming months, we plan to add online multiplayer to the game, to support both co-op modes and a 4-player domination mode where you'll have the ability to summon monsters to attack your opponents in addition to swinging the game's namesake BearHammers.  Further out on our road map, we'll also be adding additional maps and single player challenges.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3df/3dff9147d8edc2db0b025acc7aa7812e.jpg", "website": "http://www.bearhammergame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 433, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BearHammer Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["BearHammer Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
