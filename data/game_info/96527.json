Please test whether the game runs on your computer by downloading the free tech demo archive first.</p>\n<p> The game has a few screen modes, if the default one renders incorrectly (at the start of the level there is a thin gap between tiles in the middle of the screen, or other tiles render with a gap between them etc), switch the video mode by pressing F10 (this also resets the game!).</p>\n<p>Some controllers get a slight delay or do not get registered properly - please use keyboard if this happens on your computer.</p>\n<p>This package comes without any DRM or \"steam keys\" or anything similar. Please see readme.txt for additional information.</p>\n<p>Links:<br/> Homepage (includes a video of the first level)<br/></p>\n\n<p>Review:<br/>Destructoid 9/10<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2e/b2e1f8a3b8e62ecd2bf33ef67a7c88e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nekomuragames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
