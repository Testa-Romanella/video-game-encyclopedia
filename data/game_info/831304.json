It's been hectic, but quite rewarding.</p>\n<p><strong>1/8/2022:</strong> This game is being developed for the IGMC 2002 game jam. Although I originally thought I would make it, real life has slapped me across the face. As stubborn as I am, I've worked hard to at least deliver a demo. I think this is a fantastic game worth showing to the public, even in a demo stage. I will be uploading the executable in the following days.</p>\n\n\r\nPlugins / Engine<br/>GraphicsAudio<br/>Yanfly Engine<br/>RPG Maker FES Pack \u00a9 (C) KADOKAWA, INC.<br/>Published by: Degica Co., LTD<br/>Resource creators: KADOKAWA, INC<br/>\"Anomaly\"<br/>Galv's Plugins<br/>RPG Maker DS Pack\u00a0 \u00a9 (C) 2012 Gotcha Gotcha Games Inc.<br/>Artists: Archeia, EvilEagles.<br/>\"Big Band Man\"<br/>SRDude (http://sumrndm.site)<br/>Animations Sheets \u00a9 (C) 2015 Kadokawa Corporation<br/>\"Big Band Swinging\"<br/>HudellIriana Jim\u00e9nez (uwu) / All artwork.<br/>\"Bog Creatures on the Move\"<br/>Quxios (Emilio Islas)<br/>---<br/>Left Behind<br/>Victor Sant<br/>---<br/>\"Chasing Villains\"<br/>Thor Damian / Galenmereth<br/>---<br/>\"Country Romance\"<br/>Moghunter---<br/>\"Game Menu\"<br/>Fogomax---<br/>\"Inner City Remixed\"<br/>Tsukimi---<br/>\"Lost Jungle\"<br/><br/>---<br/>---<br/>\"Magic Clock Shop\"<br/>------\"More Freaky Things Come This Way\"<br/>------\"Mystical Journey\"<br/>------\"Puzzle Game\"<br/>------\"RPG Theme\"<br/>------\"Thumbing Accross Alaska\"<br/>------ALL OF THE ABOVE BY: Eric Matyas www.soundimage.org<br/>------RTP Music by \u00a9 (C) 2015 Kadokawa Corporation<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T15:32:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1eb/1eb174e402e1558e9b254e5e9acbbcda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 286, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Faye"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
