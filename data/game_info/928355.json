{"id": 928355, "slug": "pong-walterwhite500", "name": "Pong! (WalterWhite500)", "name_original": "Pong! (WalterWhite500)", "description": "<p>Pong is a classic 2D arcade game that was first released in the 1970s. The game is played by two players, each controlling a paddle on opposite sides of the screen. The objective of the game is to hit a ball back and forth between the two paddles, with the goal of making the ball pass the opponent's paddle and score a point. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.\r\n</p>\n<p>In this version of Pong, the game is still in beta and is built using the Unity game engine. The game is played by two people on the same computer, with one player controlling their paddle using the W and S keys and the other player controlling their paddle using the Up and Down keys.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game features a minimalistic design, with a simple green background and white paddles and ball. Each time the ball hits a paddle, it changes direction and increases in speed, making it more challenging for the players to hit.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game includes basic sound effects for when the ball hits a paddle or a wall, as well as a simple score display at the top of the screen that updates in real-time as players score points. The game ends when one player reaches a predetermined number of points, and a winner is declared.\r\n</p>\n<p>While still in beta, this version of Pong is a fun and engaging game that harkens back to the early days of arcade gaming. With its simple but challenging gameplay and minimalistic design, it's a great way for two people to pass the time and compete against each other in a friendly and competitive game of Pong. As the game continues to be developed, it may include additional features, such as power-ups, new levels, or online multiplayer capabilities, to make the game even more exciting and engaging for players.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T22:18:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae6/ae64d5dee88fe61ff07343855e0a0d96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["WalterWhite500"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
