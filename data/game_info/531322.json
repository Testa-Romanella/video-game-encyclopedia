You as the player have been trusted to deliver a little girl to the safe zone by her parents. Taking place over many years, you will see the world around you change. Characters will age or grow up, cars will rust, buildings will crumble... As you progress through your lifelong journey, you will bond with your passenger, creating a father &amp; daughter bond. Now of you go. You might have come a long way but you are not there yet.<br/><br/>At first there was a bright light, as bright as the sun. It engulfed the horizon. Fires raged consuming the landscape for weeks. There were no firefighters, all were drafted. There was fear. A deep, animalistic fear. Many perished within a month. The remaining fought for scraps over the dead landscape. Some built communities. Her parents were a part of such. They are gone now. I took care of the girl. Fed her, sheltered her\u2026 But this land cannot sustain us no longer. Rumors of a place still breathing is heard through the wastes. Sometimes a whisper, a note, a map. They all point to the same direction. It might just be a light to grip onto. But we must push forward. For these lands have died.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T05:39:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c54/c5429a792784d8d5fbbe5df7cfe356a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Baturing", "Khorheal", "Chainsanity", "ErdinyoBarboza"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
