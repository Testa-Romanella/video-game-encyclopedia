It is still in prototype level, but playable and I think quite fun. Thanks to Michael and Ruoqi for their help in developing, writing, and creating this game.</em></p>\n<p>Three friends all are all talking about their romantic partners but no one wants to be the first to get so vulnerable. So they take turns guessing at how each of their friends got their hot and heavy romantic start. Win by making someone else's love story add up to 20, but be careful, because if you overshoot, then their story will get scrambled and they\u00a0 get a fresh start from square one!\u00a0\u00a0Such is life on the battlefield of love.</p>\n<p><em>Love is a Battlefield</em> is a game where players get a secret card at the beginning that determines their romantic start. The rest of the game unfolds as players try to figure out the full picture as play continues. Did your friend start out by meeting them at a bar? Then go on a walk on the beach together? Maybe they had a secret vacation together? Only by playing can we find out what our friends got up to with their partners.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-04T03:26:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5bc/5bcc681cf7f68f4d14a306efa77a03a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jason L"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
