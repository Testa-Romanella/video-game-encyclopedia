The theme of the jam was '<strong>repair</strong>', and I decided to make something with a musical slant.</p>\n<p>The game introduces the player to\u00a0one of the fundamental principles of <strong>ear training</strong> - the ability to hold a pitch in your mind and recognize that pitch when you hear it again. The difficulty lies in keeping the original pitch in mind while also hearing and evaluating a host of\u00a0other pitches.</p>\n<p>As a former music teacher, I found it <strong>very </strong>interesting watching this game being played at my jam site.\u00a0Some players got the hang of the game\u00a0quickly and cruised\u00a0through the three levels, <strong>while others found it <em>extremely </em>hard</strong>... If I find time to return to this game I plan to add a difficulty option\u00a0and have the\u00a0levels generate procedurally.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T17:26:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbb/fbb385705f657d5a6d1f0753554bf209.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Adam Frost"], "genres": ["Educational", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
