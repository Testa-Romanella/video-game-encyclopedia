Also you can impulse when canceling an evasion with attacks and approach the enemy efficiently.</p>\n<p><strong>\u25a0 Fight based on physics and launching.</strong><br/>The attacks have levels of impulse and direction affected by the position in which a player or enemy receives an attack, with the goal of creating a game that does not depend on fixed combos. Instead, requires the observation and experience of the player with the different angles that can result when an attack collides toward the enemies which as the playable characters, they have weight and unique gravity that modifies the way everyone reacts to attacks.</p>\n<p><em>* The current version of the game has bugs and incompatibility with certain devices, it is expected to improve the game experience with constant updates.</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>* The game contains optional advertising with bonuses for the player.
