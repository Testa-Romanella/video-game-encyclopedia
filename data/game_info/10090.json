{"id": 10090, "slug": "beholder", "name": "Beholder", "name_original": "Beholder", "description": "<p>If someone has to live in the totalitarian society, that person has to work not to become a victim of it. Carl, a state-appointed landlord, has to spy on the tenants and to receive orders from the government. But to follow them or to dismiss them is up to the player, controlling Carl. Players will have to eavesdrop, bug the apartments of tenants, search through their personal items and complete quests, given to them by the higher ups. The moral choice system will take note of every action players will make, and every decision will have consequences. Much like in a similar in spirit game \u201cPapers, please,\u201d a government worker has to report any suspicious activity or anyone involved in suspicious activity. Beholder has multiple endings, and each of them is a compilation of player-made choices over the course of the game. Each tenant has their own personality, distinct appearance, conditions, and issues. It\u2019s up to the player, to empathize with the lives of the tenant, or to follow orders.</p>", "metacritic": 75, "released": "2016-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-19T07:48:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/40a/40ab95c1639aa1d7ec04d4cd523af6b1.jpg", "website": "https://beholder-game.com/", "rating": 3.8, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 359, "owned": 4050, "beaten": 363, "toplay": 103, "dropped": 309, "playing": 32}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 60, "ratings_count": 678, "suggestions_count": 346, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 681, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "iOS", "Xbox One", "PC", "macOS", "Linux", "PlayStation 4", "Android"], "developers": ["Alawar Entertainment", "Warm Lamp Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Alawar Entertainment", "Alawar Premium", "Creative Mobile", "Osauhing Creative Mobile"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
