The rest came up during the thinking phase.</p>\n<p><strong>Important Note</strong><br/>I need your support! The balancing of the game is provisional.<br/>Since this is a very resource-heavy strategy game, and I didn't have much time for balancing, we have to start with bad balancing. I'm open for any kind of feedback.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I will be also active on the discord server for good conversations!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Object-Oriented at the moment, but...</strong><br/>If the response to the game is good, I will convert parts of the game with the Unity 3D DOTS. This will help us to get incredible performance and increase the graphical performance. There will be no judder when firing 200 rockets at the same time.</p>\n<p><strong>Time</strong></p>\n<p>I wrote this game in 70 hours.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Source Code</strong><br/></p>\n<p>https://github.com/LegoFighter/DestructionAvoid</p>\n\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p><em>LegoFighter</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-09T07:07:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/264/2643392920103a77c7dcc94eca3cb67a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["LegoFighter"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
