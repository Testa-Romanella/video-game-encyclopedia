Players take turns to switch control sides and can only move one square diagonally forward. When the chess piece moves, and there is an enemy in front of it but there is no chess piece further away, the enemy chess piece can be captured and crossed. If you encounter an enemy piece that can be passed after eating, you can skip and eat the enemy piece continuously, that is, eat continuously. If there is a chance to eat continuously, you must eat continuously. When a chess piece enters the deepest part of the enemy's camp, it will evolve into a king.
