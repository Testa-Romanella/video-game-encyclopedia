You're the blue wizard on the left side of the screen, trying to defeat the forces of evil. Each level has a purple crystal on the right side of the screen. <strong><em>Every 10 seconds</em></strong>, this crystal spawns a new enemy. When it's your turn, three cards (from a selection of bolt, lightning, and heal) appear at the bottom of the screen, providing you with offensive and defensive spells to cast at your enemies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you manage to destroy the crystal, you'll progress to the next screen. If you destroy the crystal on *The Villain's Lair* level, you win the game.</p>\n<p>The game is essentially turn-based. The timeline (at the top of the screen, not fully implemented either) would show who was going to go next, while the clock at the left of the timeline shows what \"time\" (in seconds since level began) it currently is. Time skips ahead to whoever's turn it will be next. The crystal <em>always</em>\u00a0gets to go every 10 seconds and spawn a new enemy.</p>\n<p>Once again, time management and being unable to say \"No\" to people were my biggest hurdles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The graphics are mostly programmer art, but to spare you a completely awful experience, I've used one of Vimlark's graphics packs for the characters in the game.</p>\n<p>There's no sounds, so don't worry if you don't hear anything.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T16:39:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d20/d2095272de063c1811e182718787c7be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["digital bacon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
