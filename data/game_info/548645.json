I personally created the Enemy AI, The Boss, and level 6 and 7 as well as\u00a0 some weapon interaction and physics. We only had a botu a week and a half\u00a0 to create it, and many of the other team memeber were not able to contibute very much due to scheduling or other constraints, so it was not nearly as polished as I would have liked. However, I think it is interesting nonetheless. Hope you\u00a0 enjoy out garbage fire!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T06:28:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a29/a29a0b4c3c490ef286d1f2f1612ea797.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CaffeinatedLemur"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
