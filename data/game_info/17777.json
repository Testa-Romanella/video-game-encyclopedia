{"id": 17777, "slug": "anno-2070", "name": "Anno 2070", "name_original": "Anno 2070", "description": "<p>This is the fifth game in a series of Anno games.</p>\n<p>The game genre remains unchanged - this is a real-time strategy with a variety of elements from other genres included in it: from the city construction and management simulator to submarine battles.</p>\n<h3>Time, situation, character</h3>\n<p>The game takes place in 2070, when the ecological situation in the world has become so serious that it cannot be completely ignored and the attitude to the environment becomes a key point in the development of corporations, on whose activity the well-being of humanity is based.</p>\n<p>The game has implemented some of the gloomiest predictions about global warming: the world ocean level has risen so much that the continents have gone under water, and people have only to swim between the remaining islets on huge floating ark cities.</p>\n<p>You control the captain of such an ark - and this means that you will have to explore, discover and colonize islands, build trade routes, build cities, meet the needs of the population, mine and mine food, build all kinds of enterprises, mines and fleets.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The entire Anno series is characterized by a general scheme - the player has to develop unpopulated but resource-rich territories, adjusting their economies, and then move on in search of new undeveloped territories.</p>\n<p>In the Anno 2070 there is the same scheme, but its concrete implementation this time focuses on maintaining the ecological balance during colonization.</p>\n<p>Various approaches to this problem embody the main actors in the game:<br />\n- the classic industrial tycoons from the Global Trust Corporation - rely on coal and nuclear power plants<br />\n- the environmentally-minded governing bodies of the Eden Initiative Corporation - these people rely more on renewable energy sources, wind energy or falling water.</p>\n<p>The magnates, if you go their way, provide a more rapid development, but the population is dissatisfied with the deterioration of living conditions.</p>\n<p>Environmentalists are developing more slowly, but the situation becomes softer.</p>\n<p>But not everything is so primitive - both the magnates and the environmentalists have no ready answers to all the questions. Environmentalists also have to deal with environmental pollution, and the magnates, if they wish, can build waste treatment plants and make their strategies more acceptable.</p>\n<p>In addition, the game has a third force - scientists who can significantly change the balance of forces with their technologies.</p>\n<p>It is technologies, a powerful factor that can change a lot, became the second significant difference in the game setting after the need to preserve the ecological balance during colonization.</p>\n<p>In addition to these three main factions, there are many other actors in the game: pirates, free traders, mercenaries, an oil baron named Sukhov, a Japanese oceanographer and others. You can interact with all of them - trade, negotiate, ask for help, carry out their tasks, receiving scarce licenses for the purchase of technologies as a reward.</p>\n<h3>Multiplayer</h3>\n<p>Multiplayer mode allows you to bring into the game a lot of interaction in social networks. Players can form alliances, choose each other in the Senate, and then vote in the Senate for certain laws.</p>", "metacritic": 83, "released": "2011-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-15T23:58:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/9ae/9ae37c55143614798f919ce8e8eb94aa.jpg", "website": "http://anno.ubi.com", "rating": 3.83, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 57, "owned": 970, "beaten": 73, "toplay": 28, "dropped": 93, "playing": 5}, "playtime": 11, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 152, "suggestions_count": 491, "game_series_count": 14, "reviews_count": 154, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blue Byte", "Related Designs"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Ubisoft Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
