Players should do their best to become the last one alive. Matches are held on 3 main maps of a large size (Erangel, Miramar, and Sanhok). Each match has 100 participants fighting for themselves. The battle begins with players making the leap out of the plane to spread out across the map and to gather all possible equipment required for survival. Then, after a while, game intelligence randomly sets a circle shape safe zone, which gamers must reach to stay alive, and marks it on the map. Gear and resources are scattered throughout the map, so players can grab everything they need while running to the zone. Therefore, the main action comes out of the players\u2019 collision on their ways to the circle. You can join the fight either alone or in a team (up to 4 people). Due to the customization system, lots of clothing items and weapon skins could be both bought on the marketplace and found in crates. However, in-app purchases don\u2019t actually affect the gameplay.</p>", "metacritic": 81, "released": "2017-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-20T07:03:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/1bd/1bd2657b81eb0c99338120ad444b24ff.jpg", "website": "http://www.playbattlegrounds.com", "rating": 3.27, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 132, "owned": 7555, "beaten": 419, "toplay": 73, "dropped": 1357, "playing": 252}, "playtime": 31, "achievements_count": 113, "ratings_count": 1885, "suggestions_count": 479, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 1905, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Krafton", "Bluehole", "PUBG"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["KRAFTON", "Bluehole"], "esrb_rating": null}
