Freedom was lost when the Coalition defeated the United Independents and took control over the entire system.  But something from before the conflict still remains.  Release from the iron-fisted Coalition may still be possible... but where could it be found?  Who has the ability to overcome the indomitable? </p><p>Play Dexter Stardust, dashboard hula-girl salesman and son of the famous Bayard Alexander Stardust, in this traditional <strong>point and click adventure</strong> as you discover the hidden wonders of the solar system and unravel the mysteries of the HOLLOW MOON! <br/></p><p>... Of course this is just the demo... so you won't be doing all that just yet...  you only get to play the beginning of the story.  But rest assured adventure seeker!  <em>A Kickstarter campaign in the near future will offer you the opportunity to fund the completed game and lend a hand in saving the human race!</em></p><p>-----------</p><p>Demo includes cinematic cutscenes and classic point and click adventure mechanics we grew to love.
