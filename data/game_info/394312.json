If police gets called don't worry you've got a bunch of bricks to your right ;) <br/><br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Rules</strong>:<br/>Make combos to multiply your score by spitting onto people with same clothes.<br/>If someone makes it to the other side of building without getting spitted on, you'll lose 50 points, <strong>except</strong> for ones with brown suits.<br/>If someone runs for the phone, spit on them once more before they finish the call to police and they'll run away.<br/>If police climbs building, throw brick to stop them temporarily.<br/>Everyone has chance of calling the police so be on guard to prevent them from calling too many police because you've got a limited amount of bricks which kind of represent your health bar.<br/>People with brown suite will always call the police but they earn you twice the points. <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>:<br/>Make noise to spit (simply blowing into the mic works too). <br/>Motion Controller trigger to pick up and throw bricks.<br/>Motion Controller shoulder button to calibrate your position. (<strong>calibrate at launch</strong>)<br/></p>\n\n<p>Just get as many points as possible before you are caught. Have fun spitting!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-25T05:27:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f4/6f48bc1eb9cdef303cf2d20fb5a2b969.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nicat"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
