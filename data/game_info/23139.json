Play Stunt Island as a campaign, where you compete 32 challenging stunt flying assignments. Or let your imagination run wild as you create your own action-packed films!<br/>\r\nStunt Island was developed with the assistance of top Hollywood producers, stunt coordinators, set designers and pilots. It's the only flight simulator offering you a \"crash course\" on Hollywood! <br/>\r\n\u2022 Do things you've never done before with a flight simulator - land on moving trains, play \"chicken\" with a truck on a crowded street, or pluck an escaping convict off a tower on Alcatraz Island.<br/>\r\n\u2022 Choose any of 45 carefully crafted military and civilian aircraft, beautifully rendered with Gouraud shading.<br/>\r\n\u2022 Fly in the stunt competition, or create and fly your own stunts.<br/>\r\n\u2022 Position up to 8 cameras to capture all the action. Place cameras on moving cars or even in a spotter place, using your pan and zoom to stay right with the scene.<br/>\r\n\u2022 Choose the location. Stunt Island is a huge self-contained 3-D world featuring 34 pre-built sets (large cities, small towns, a castle, LAX, a canyon, and more). Or build your own set from an inventory of more than 800 objects, famous landmarks and vehicles.<br/>\r\n\u2022 Set vehicles in motion, trigger explosions, fire missiles... you have complete control over all the action.<br/>\r\n\u2022 With film footage in hand, head for the editing facility, where you'll cut and splice the best camera angles into your action-packed film.<br/>\r\n\u2022 Add music, sound, optical effects, credits, even your own voice-over (requires a compatible sound card).<br/>\r\n\u2022 Existing stunts come with an auto edit feature to help you learn the ropes.<br/>\r\n\u2022 Then, set the date for your Hollywood premiere!", "metacritic": null, "released": "1991-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:46:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11b/11bfc7386a760b0983691488107ffe0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 13, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 274, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["The Assembly Line"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Disney Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
