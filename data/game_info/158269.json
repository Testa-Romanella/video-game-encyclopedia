And that week's prompt is personal. My prompt is A game made in PICO-8\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis is basically a roguelike infinite runner. I love the concept a lot and think this can be expanded to a more elaborate commercial product. In order to play the roguelike game, you only need to make a simple decision jumping or not. You can kill a monster to gain more experience or skip to the next stage and challenge for a faster level clear time. By the way, PICO-8 is really fun, you can do sprite, music, and program at the same time. Which is amazing, because I never get tired of making a game anymore, I would work on sprites for a little bit and work on a little bit music and back to code whenever I want.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ba/7bad417b1fbb9b98e039f3e35dcd0e5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Erenyx"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
