You're a tribute, fighting intelligent AI in a \"battle royal\" to be the last person standing. Inspired by the novels by Suzanne Collins and the movies by Lionsgate Films. This is a turn based combat game in 1st person perspective, with Roguelike elements. The randomly generated arenas feature a central \"Cornucopia\" filled with melee and ranged weapons along with food and other gear, surrounded by wilderness in which one can hide or forage. You may form alliances with the other tributes, and backstab or be backstabbed by your allies. In the cover image (from the audience standpoint) you can see the semicircle of 24 tributes on their platforms, the central golden Cornucopia, gear in front of and within it, and surrounding landscape containing mountains and waterways.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/832/8321384e996f898e207f6921927fc7f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cruiser1"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
