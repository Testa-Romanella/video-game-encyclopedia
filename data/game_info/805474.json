The closer the defense is to the crystal the more energy it costs but it also increases it's attack speed.<br/>So you have to decide whether you want multiple small defenses and keep some energy or if you want to go all-in and risk your crystal to be crushed easily by the enemies because you don't have enough energy left.</p>\n<p>We really wanted upload a WebGL version as well but the build took too long so please bear with us and give our game a shot even tho you have to download it^^\"</p>\n<p>P.S.:We're currently working on a\u00a02.5D tactical RPG where you can build your own maps to explore and you can\u00a0<strong>join our mailing list</strong>\u00a0to support us and get updates on our progress =D<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T15:37:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ed/8edc99171aec426a0d593d3adee584af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MiniMelonStudio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
