It's not very difficult but it is rewarding as long as it lasts.\"</p>\n<p>\"For a MAGS entry this is a really good effort\u00a0and shows huge potential for development. I played the game to kill 5 minutes. An hour later I was overlord of a huge rat empire. But alas, greed got the better of me and things fell apart very quickly once the humans upgraded their traps. Give it a go- very simple concept that is easy to pick up and play and the balance feels just right!\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Oh, so much fun!!!\u00a0</p><p>The rats' voices jumpscared the hell of of me the first time they popped up but I got used to it and they added so much fun and many a laugh to the game!\u00a0<br/></p><p>I won it on my second try. It was perhaps a little easy once you know what to be careful of. In a future version maybe EASY, MEDIUM, HARD, IMPOSSIBLE difficulty levels could be added? I know it's hard to get balance just right in these kinds of games, especially during a MAGS, but with a bit more time I think it would add a lot to the game's replay value.<br/>Nevertheless, the game provided the fun of slowly growing in power until the things that terrified you before became just minor annoyances. This is the main fun of any RPG/Sim game: feeling that your power and abilities are growing, and that you are overcoming harder obstacles because of this, and this game does it well!<br/>The random events were just frequent enough to affect the gameplay a bit but not so frequent that they become annoying or eclipse the main, central strategy play.<br/>Wonderful game!!!\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Looks like a good idea and a lot of detail to the simulation. I spent some time trying to work out an algorithm that will keep me alive more than a few rounds but at some point I felt that it just was not compelling enough to persist to the point where I have 1000 rats\"\u00a0 <em>(Yes I'm including all feedback whether positive or not )</em></p>\n<p>\"A game about playing with variables to obtain a successful outcome of a family of rats. This game has a single screen and is quite self explanatory. Getting a good balance and moving on was good fun. However, the mouse disappearing was game breaking and quite annoying and MUST be sorted as I would have liked to have gotten further than I had.. Effort went into coding the variables.<br/>All in all a fun game that I could play more of given a fix of the mouse vanishing. I found it quite enjoyable and could spend quite some time playing around with it. Good effort for a nice game. \"</p>\n<p><em>(Sorry I can't fix that bug but it won't be in the full version I promise!)</em></p>\n<p>\"First time round, took me less than a minute to die... and wonder \"what the hell happened?\"... Second time I was in a roll and was progressing nicely, until I got a bit carried away... Maybe killing the entire colony before the food reaches zero is a bit unintuitive.\u00a0<br/>Not really my kind of game, but still nicely made and worth playing. That is if one likes the gender. \"\u00a0 <em>(I think she means genre! :-D)</em></p>\n<p>\"Pretty fun. I made it to turn 101 before my rats all died. The graphics are crude, but get the job done. Otherwise I can't think of a single thing that should be changed.\"\u00a0<em> (There will be pretty graphics galore in the main game!)</em></p>\n<p>\"It's an interesting turn-based strategy game that was fun, though the font was hard to read. I also think that there is some room for improvement, like having some illustrations for the different events and more visuals to go with the text, but for a Mags game it was decent and the strategy was entertaining even if I never came close to 1000 rats.\"\u00a0 <em>(I hope / think the font is easier to read at the higher resolution in the full game)</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b85/b8544666e30139ce12a3a03abcea903d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CaptainD"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
