However <strong>the frogs</strong> won't let you pass. So you have to break the Fly Cage to distract the frogs. However, breaking the fly cage could also mean blocking your way, because Vines will come down and block your way this time instead of the frogs. Unless.... you have the <strong>ability to rewind</strong>. Yup! <em><strong>use the rewind ability to solve puzzles and get that sweet Nectar!</strong></em></p>\n<p>*<strong>You can't get past the frogs and vines</strong>\u00a0just by flying through</p>\n<p>*<strong>You can only get past them by using\u00a0<em>Rewind</em></strong>,\u00a0<em>tracing your step back</em></p>\n<p><em>Plan your way\u00a0before you move!</em></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></em></p>\n<p>W, A, S, D = Move</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button = Grab/Drop Rock</p>\n<p>Right Mouse Button = Rewind/Stop Rewind</p>\n<p>R = Restart</p>\n<p>ESC = Pause/Hints</p>\n\n<p>NOTE:</p>\n<p>I'm pretty much new to Unity, with\u00a0two weeks of learning how to code, then hearing about<em> Brackeys Game Jam</em> and I decide to enter this Jam, looking for experience.</p>\n<p>This is my first game jam.
