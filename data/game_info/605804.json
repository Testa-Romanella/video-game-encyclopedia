They plead their innocence as the Guards of the Frozen North drag them off to the Ice prisons of Kergus. No bail is offered to them and in the morning, they will be sentenced to a quick death. Break them out or mourn them at dawn.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A free official scenario for Forbidden Psalm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This scenario was created in support of Slug Wizard Spring 2021, an open event inviting all scale modelers to create a slug wizard miniature. Donations made during the event benefit The Bail Project, a USA-based charitable organization that combats mass incarceration through their National Revolving Bail Fund.
