However, enemies are varied in behavior, and may require out of the box thinking to destroy them all. Just as well, rather than being in a fixed place, the player has a form of traversal, allowing new angles when dealing with levels. All wrapped up in an apocalypse flavored package.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T03:52:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ff/0ffe552e2690d70ca99738882f9fb8a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blienk"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
