It currently only has Easy mode and you can't lose. Higher difficulties will have more eggs to take care of and I'm aiming for a couple more features such as different egg types and minor obstacles. Also more apparel for the chicks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T08:36:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/842/842aa2645b0d76f11916ffd7388f3a03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ninjaboi8175"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
