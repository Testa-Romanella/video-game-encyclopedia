Or maybe just sit back and watch a vintage Christmas movie or two while Santa takes a much deserved cookies &amp; milk break!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWarm up in this cozy little Christmas wonderland any time of the year!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-23T02:31:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f59/f599be1b1f3a83bd7327c3fda2404444.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 267, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mad Bee Studios"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mad Bee Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
