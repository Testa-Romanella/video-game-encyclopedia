Ares' Rage, damage up</p>\n<p>2. Pandora's Box, extra life, though since you can't die, it isn't very useful</p>\n<p>3. Talaria, boosted speed</p>\n\n<p>Current Issues:</p>\n<p>- Too much is in comic sans</p>\n<p>- The UI (coin display) Doesn't scale with screen resolution</p>\n<p>- Chance for dungeons to generate without an entrance</p>\n<p>- Bullets don't despawn when hitting walls</p>\n\n<p>Future Goals</p>\n<p>- Implement AI for enemies</p>\n<p>- Implement more items</p>\n<p>- Implement more enemy types and the final boss</p>\n<p>- Implement player death, revival, and natural healing</p>\n<p>- Implement item descriptions, variable shop prices, and UI for all players<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-20T04:44:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f3/5f31a7b9bd519b36acef94041d87eaec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Providence Cooperative"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
