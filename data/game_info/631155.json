You are a lil pink guy who's tasked with hugging people who look a lil run-down to help spread some love! This is the second game that I've ever made, and the first one that I've made entirely on my own! It's not nearly as polished but it was also made in a fraction of the time so I hope you all enjoy!</p><p>Art by -\u00a0https://v3x3d.itch.io/retro-lines</p><p>Text by\u00a0-\u00a0https://datagoblin.itch.io/monogram</p><p>Music by - playonloop.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T04:38:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0c/a0c3db85785fec4646867efe46a731b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["beep_boop125"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
