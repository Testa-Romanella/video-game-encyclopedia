Road traffic is nonexistent. Yet there remains a large number of enthusiasts, people still love older gas-powered cars. These antiques, these relics of a different time are collected by many, and the only thing left to do with them is race!   </p>\n<p>\u00a0-----Gameplay-----</p>\n<p>Earn money by picking up money packs during the race. Bonus money is awarded for 1st and 2nd place finishes. If you <strong>get stuck</strong> or find a way to jump the track, then simply <strong>exit the race</strong> from the pause menu and restart the race. Sometimes the position system isn\u2019t perfect, sorry about that.</p><p>The AI isn't very smart, they'll mostly just be obstacles in the game, they get stuck alot.</p>\n<p>-----Controls-----\r\n  </p>\n<p>W or Up Arrow \u2013 Forward acceleration\r\n  </p>\n<p>S or Down Arrow \u2013 Brake and reverse\r\n  </p>\n<p>A or Left Arrow \u2013 Steer left\r\n  </p>\n<p>D or Right Arrow \u2013 Steer right\r\n  </p>\n<p>Tab \u2013 Pause menu\r\n  </p>\n<p>A steering wheel controller or gamepad may work.
