To escape, you need to collect all the <strong>Animal Powers</strong> scattered across the land, in mysterious blue boxes.</p><p>Once you collect an Animal Power, you can <strong>shapeshift </strong>into that Animal for 10 seconds maximum. Some animals destroy enemies, some are invulnerable, some are scary, some can ride through lava, other can fly, some are invisible, and other are, well, surprising.<br/></p><p><strong>There are 20 different animals to collect, will you catch them all ?<br/></strong></p><p><strong>Shapeshifter Biker</strong> was created in less than 72 hours by Renaud Foresti\u00e9 for Ludum Dare #35, which theme was \"Shapeshift\".
