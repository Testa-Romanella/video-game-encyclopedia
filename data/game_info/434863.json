( changeing between these has a cute little animation I'm really proud of. :3 )</p>\n<p>keyboard controls:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Menu:<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Z - enter/select<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Up/Down - move selection up and down</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0InGame:<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Left/Right - Move UFO Left and Right<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Up/Down- Rotate Block<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Z - Drop Block<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Enter - pauses the game</p>\n<p>Mouse controls:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Menu:<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Left Click - enter/select<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Swipe up/down - move selection up and down</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0InGame:<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Mouse Movement - move UFO Left and Right goes under your mouse<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Left Click - Drop Block<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Right Click- Rotate Block<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Pause button on the top right - pauses the game</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Universal: (are on the keyboard but i couldn't fit them onscreen, but doesn't effect toggling)<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 R - Restart<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Space - speed up game speed (doesn't effect blocks)<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 M - Mute game (has a cute little animation I'm proud of btw)</p>\n<p>as you can likely tell from the graphics of this game I spent a lot of time making things as clean and nice as i can expesaly with all the small little details, think of it of almost a vertical slice of a real game, its more quality than quantity.</p>\n<p>Overall I do hope everyone who plays has a nice time with it.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>LadyLeia - Art/Level Design/Code/Design/Ect</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T10:50:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b0/6b052a48ec554697f290f9d8d19f4b23.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RedDashGames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
