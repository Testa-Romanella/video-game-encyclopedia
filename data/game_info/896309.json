Chunky and deliberate ranged and melee combat mixes with run-based gameplay and semi-permanent unlocks to bring this fantasy adventure to life.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Storyline</strong></p>\n<p>As a newly promoted member of the Wulves, a widely-respected mercenary company with ties to the Royal Family, you\u2019ve been given a small unit of fresh recruits to take on a training mission. You\u2019re a tough and capable fighter, your superiors have marked out your skills, and now you\u2019re in charge of all the hiking, orienteering, and specialist combat drills out in the mountains near the border - your mission is to turn the fresh faces into a fighting force worthy of the Wulves name\u2026 your base of operations is a small provincial capital, and you\u2019re resting up between fortnight-long training forays into the surrounding wilderness. It\u2019s quiet here, the ale is fine and the food fresh. Even the beds get new straw every third moon. All in all a nice break from the boredom and bloodshed of mercenary life\u2026</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0...but nothing\u2019s ever that simple. An unknown aggressor attacks the town, and you\u2019re stuck with no option but to take charge of the defences. Not the test of your skill of command you\u2019d hoped for, nor one you\u2019re sure can even be passed!</p>\n<p>This project was created by an amazing talented team of third year students at Abertay University by the name of Sinbad Studios!</p>\n\n<p>The game was built as a response to\u00a0a game brief and regular development feedback written by us here at Spilt Milk Studios.</p>\n\r\nJoin our Discord!<br/><br/>Follow us on Twitter!<br/><br/><strong>Supported platforms:</strong> <br/>Project Wulves is playable on PC - it only supports controller.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>Specifications required:</strong><br/><strong>RAM: </strong>8GB<br/><strong>CPU: </strong>Quad-core Intel or AMD processor of 2.5 GHz or faster<br/><strong>GPU: </strong>NVIDIA GeForce 470GTX or AMD Radeon 6870 HD Series card or higher<br/><strong>DirectX Version: </strong>DirectX11 or DirectX12 compatible graphics card<br/><strong>Storage: </strong>1GB minimum\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>Credits:<br/></strong> <br/><strong>Concept, Publisher &amp; Client Brief<br/></strong>Spilt Milk Studios<br/><br/><strong>Team Lead<br/></strong>Iain Wedge<br/><br/><strong>Lead Programmer<br/></strong>Edwyn Mckie<br/><br/><strong>Programmers</strong>Kieran Milne <br/>Max Campbell<br/><br/><strong>Lead Artist<br/></strong>Sam Sheppard<br/><br/><strong>Artists</strong><br/>Connor Campbell<br/>Duncan Skene<br/><br/><strong>Production<br/></strong>Rhys Drysdale<br/>Iain Wedge<br/><br/><strong>Sound<br/></strong>Sound effects courtesy of       Mixkit and Freesound:\u00a0<br/>https://mixkit.co/<br/>https://freesound.org/<br/><br/><strong>Music</strong><br/>Trouble Is Brewing by David\u00a0Fesliyan (map room)<br/>Courtesy of Fesliyan Studios<br/>https://www.FesliyanStudios.com<br/><br/>Action and Adventure by Shane Ivers (level music)<br/>Courtesy of Silverman Sound Studios<br/>https://www.silvermansound.com<br/><br/>Epic Game Music Best One Done On Keyboard By Kris Klavenes (main menu)<br/>Courtesy of Freesound<br/>https://freesound.org/people/klavo1985/sounds/474214/<br/><br/><strong>Assets</strong><br/>Paladin W/Prop J Nordstrom (player character)<br/>Courtesy of Mixamo<br/>https://www.mixamo.com/#/?page=1&amp;query=paladin&amp;type=Character<br/><br/>Paragon: Rampage (Sinbad)<br/>Courtesy of Epic Games<br/>https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/paragon-rampage<br/><br/>Brute, Man at arms and Ninja       Infinity Blade: Warriors<br/>Courtesy of Epic Games<br/>https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/infinity-blade-characters<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T20:33:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ce/9cef0c1edfc803152946f6a31a89f01a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spilt Milk Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
