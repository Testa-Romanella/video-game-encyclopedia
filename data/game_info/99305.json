Among a glut of mass privatization, corporations begin contracting private military security firms to protect their assets. Setting a controversial precedent, defense contractor Grand Robotics Inc. deploys a private security firm to be their \"Mergers &amp; Acquisitions\" arm.</p>\n<p>After a failed attempt to buy out competing Bartleby Automation, Grand Robotics turns to their security firm to execute a \"hostile takeover\" of their competitor. The firm storms into Bartleby's corporate HQ and locks the building down.</p>\n<p>In Turnover you play Clea Holden, a Bartleby worker who becomes caught in the middle of the crisis. Coming to the conclusion that the situation is too volatile, Clea hatches a desperate plan to escape. She must find freedom, armed with only her determination to survive.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a67/a6727ed12746de7474ab91b0b3f376f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Long Division"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
