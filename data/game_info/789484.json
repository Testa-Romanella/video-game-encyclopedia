First he must retrieve the ball while dodging the card hungry refs, pitch invaders and other assorted characters. Then knock over a flag or shoot the ball at a switch to remove the goalie and then finally shoot the ball into the goal. On some of the levels the ball has been locked in a cage and a plunger must first be pressed to release it. The final level sees Moritz trying to score at the Kop end to complete his dream of joining LFC. Watch out though, if he receives more than 8 yellow cards he will see red, be sent off and his dream over.<br/></p>\n<p><em>The 48K version has 10 levels of football fun as well as in-game beeper music.<br/>The 128K version has 20 levels plus AY tunes and extra graphics.</em></p>\n<em>\n<p>Look out for cameo's of the developers, ZX Spectrum scene heroes and even Jurgen himself who makes an appearance to check on Moritz's progress!</p>\n<p>Default Controls</p>\n<p>Left \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 (O)</p>\n<p>Right \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 (P) <br/>Jump/Up\u00a0\u00a0 (Q)</p>\n<p>Shoot \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 (SP)</p>\n<p>Music On\u00a0 (T)</p>\n<p>Music Off (Y)</p>\n<p>NB: To shoot press left/right and shoot together</p>\n<p>Kempston and Sinclair Interface II joysticks are supported.</p>\n<p>Have fun.</p>\n</em>\n\n<p>Rest in peace my friend!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T22:17:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bae/baeb29b61399dc156625073be9fc3606.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZXAMAZE"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
