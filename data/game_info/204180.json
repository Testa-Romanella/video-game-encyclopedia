You have to keep pace with error messages, pop-ups, and other warnings to prevent your system from crashing abruptly. Random pop-up ads are out to get you as well, so stay focus to avoid the dreaded blue screen of death.</p><p>WinSmash is a true arcade game, with quickly increasing difficulty. Smash as many windows as possible to make it to the top of the leaderboard!</p>CREDITS<p>Music and sound effects used in the game have been kindly provided by https://www.freesound.org/ under the Creative Common license:</p><p> - Main game theme: https://www.freesound.org/people/joshuaempyre/soun...</p><p> - Unclickable windows beep: https://www.freesound.org/people/anthonychartier20...</p><p> - Window closing effect: https://www.freesound.org/people/kianda/sounds/328...</p><p> - Game Over background sound (modified to be made looping): https://www.freesound.org/people/DarkoZL/sounds/18...</p><p> - Window pop-up: https://www.freesound.org/people/GabrielAraujo/sou...</p><p> - Window minimization: https://www.freesound.org/people/Streety/sounds/30...</p><p>Link to the licence: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>Development<p>Winsmash was designed and developed by R\u00e9gis Blanc, and is implemented in Scala with a custom game engine.
