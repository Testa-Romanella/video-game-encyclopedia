Two unlikely friends must run, jump and swing to the top in this grappling-platformer created in 48 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>:<br/>Playing with Controllers is supported!<br/>Walk - Left Stick, WASD<br/>Jump - X, Space<br/>Throw/Catch - Square, Left Click<br/>Restart from\u00a0Checkpoint - Triangle, Backspace<br/>Menu - Escape, Start</p>\n<p><strong>Tested on <br/></strong>-Macbook with a PS4 Controller<br/>-Windows 10 on Parallels Desktop<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Thank you so much for playing!<br/></strong>Special thanks to my family for coming up with ideas and playtesting, as well as Yuna and Chilli for ideas.\u00a0There are currently no options or sound, but after the Jam is complete I will release a quality-of-life update. All Assets have been created by me in 24 Hours, except for the background graphic which was released under Public Domain on opengameart.org.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Known\u00a0Bugs:<br/></strong>Sometimes, when returning the second player, he can glitch out and fly just somewhere. Try returning him or restart from the last checkpoint. I couldn't figure it out in time but I think it has something to do with the hit detection of triggers so I'll try to fix it up soon.<br/></p>\n<p>The Game is finishable from beginning to end! There might even be some shortcuts, too...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T03:03:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab3/ab32866ec018e7e8cfaf0bc2c5839e54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["LucaBGT - Zorc Media"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
