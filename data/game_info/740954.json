Unfortunately even though it went further than most - it finally came to the point where the project has been left for a while, I came back to it and the story repeats.</p>\n<p>At the moment I am working on a different more ambitious project and I hope that one will work out as I have huge hype and plans for it. The game you are looking at right now is nothing more than an old project that just has been left in hopes that maybe one day you would feel motivated enough to finish it (as you can see I wasn't even able to think of a proper name for it :p), although that is also a bit unlikely as I am very unhappy about some developments paths I have taken in this project and that game is definitely not the type of game to absorb players for long hours and keep them engaged so I am unsure if there is any reason to put a lot of work into it anyways.</p>\n<p><strong>Enough of rubbish talk, what about the game?</strong></p>\n<p>Well... The game as said before is in no way finished. It has couple of bugs, missing features and does lack a bit of gameplay but its a game inspired by old flash games like Epic War series which I had ton of fun playing as a kid, so maybe couple of people that come pass this project will like it a little bit :)</p>\n<p>P.s. I am aware of couple of balance issues ;P</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T09:53:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97d/97db4eb2de819de2895c4a2bd61e1cf5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Velox"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
