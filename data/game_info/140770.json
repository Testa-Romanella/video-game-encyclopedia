In your military unit, you will be sent into enemy territory to attack and destroy all turrets, tanks, and host vessels in the area. Once doing so, my squadron will lead you to the next area. We've pinpointed ten areas of interest for you, and we may find more later. We will escort you to the areas in order of danger, to give you a bit of training with your new tank unit. Good luck out there, soldier. Your country salutes you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/479/4790dc493329e59e6e04822d544d4b38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VoxFrame"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
