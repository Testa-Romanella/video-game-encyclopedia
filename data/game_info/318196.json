When playing <em>RUN</em>, players will race in <strong>procedurally generated</strong> levels trying to pull ahead of their competitors. The winner of a race is the one who leaves their opponents in the dust. Once a player wins a certain number of races (<em>chosen ahead of time by the players</em>), that player wins the set. Based on their performance in the set, players can unlock <strong>cosmetic customization items</strong> to personalize their very own runner. With customization options tied to particular profile, friends will be able to <strong>show off</strong> to each other the trophies of their own personal victories.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T09:19:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6c/e6c1266b90e4375a755b059b77487dc7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team Three"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
