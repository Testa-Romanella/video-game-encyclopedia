But not for free, he is to retrieve an ancient artifact from the ruins in the moon known as Durgokh Frak.</p>\n<p>From the developer:<br/>This project was done for the spacebunnyjam, which I didn't manage to finish on time. I added more things than what was initially decided, but not so much as to be a full on game. Its pretty much 5-10 minutes long so I think about it more as a prototype. In any case, Its the first video-game thing I publish so I'm more than happy about it. Give it a shot and tell me what you think, opinions are more than welcomed.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94b/94bd65f890e929b24e27a68f566ba883.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Mr.Olgoth"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
