The styling mode offers you a variety of options:<br/><ul><li>Multi-stage lowering of the vehicle<br/></li><li>Various tire types and sizes<br/></li><li>Huge selection of rims<br/></li><li>Many colors for your vehicle and even for most rims</li></ul><h3>Full control</h3>Various gamepads and steering wheel systems are supported. Even in menus you don't need a mouse or keyboard. Gamepads allow you to fine-tune the throttle and brake and give you better control over the steering.<br/><br/><br/>Absolute control you gain using a steering wheel system. In addition to various automatic transmissions, you can also choose manual gear shifting. The gears then need to be engaged and disengaged like in a real vehicle. When starting off, be careful not to stall the engine (perfect exercise for novice drivers: 'Hill starting').<br/><br/>Do not worry! All missions, timing and scores were prepared by us specifically for each system (keyboard, gamepad, steering wheel automatic and manual).<br/><br/>* <strong>Please note that some of the features described here are still under development.</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T06:44:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/952/952d9d4976d9003a878e213d56e13bf4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Waldschrat Studios GbR"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Waldschrat Studios GbR"], "esrb_rating": null}
