This is one of our very\u00a0first games, featuring a similar gameplay to Flappy Bird. It's pretty fun tho, at least for us. So I decided to remake it (and hopefully more of my old projects)\u00a0into a Pico-8 cart, as a commemorative project. <br/><br/>Hope you enjoy it!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T12:59:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6c/b6cba4656be10c8868de086a968c3766.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Krad"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
