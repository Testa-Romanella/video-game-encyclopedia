{"id": 929033, "slug": "battle-lines", "name": "Battle Lines", "name_original": "Battle Lines", "description": "<p>Battle Lines is an autobattler/autochess game about managing your resources to compete with your opponent to buy unit cards, then placing those cards on the map in the right positions and directions to destroy their armies and their castle while defending your own!<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Step 1: Harvest resources from the map. The more Peasant units you deploy onto resource nodes, the more resources you are able to harvest from them. However, you can only make a limited number of harvests per turn, so choose carefully!</li><li>Step 2: Purchase a card. Will you invest in Peasants to boost your long-term economy, snag a cheap military unit to defend your flanks, or save your resources over several turns\u00a0to invest in a devastating Fire Mage?</li><li>Step 3: Place your new unit and choose the direction it faces. Once set, a unit stays in its position and direction for the rest of the game until it dies, so every move has permanent consequences--especially with friendly fire. Think several turns ahead in your placements so you don't end up shooting your own units in the back later on!</li><li>Step 4: Watch the action play out\u00a0 in real time\u00a0until the beginning of the next turn!</li></ul>\n\n<p>This game was initially conceived and prototyped as part of Ludum Dare 51, in which the theme was \"Every 10 Seconds.\"</p>\n\n<p>Installation Instructions:</p>\n<ul><li>Download the .zip</li><li>Extract files</li><li>Run the .exe</li></ul>\n\n<p>Battle Lines is in Open Beta/Early Access. 1.0 release is targeted for this spring and will also include a Steam release.
