Here you control two characters at the same time, EXCEPT for the jumping, with <strong>Z </strong>being the jump button for the Red one, and <strong>X</strong> the jump for the Blue one. This simple modification will prove to be an issue bigger than what you would expect if you come to play this game!</p>\n<p>\u00a0It is very short, so consider giving it a shot :)<br/></p>\n<p>Had a lot of fun developing it, and got to learn a bunch of things, given that my first \"game\" can't even be really called a game! Still, there's a lot of room for improvement in my TIC skills.</p>\n<p>\u00a0The source code, once again, can be seen by pressing Esc, exiting the game, and pressing F1.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe4/fe4d8e67e7f04d2c006cf57bab14d9b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Delta Key"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
