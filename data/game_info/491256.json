The goal of the game is to make me mone... to take on a challenge! What's the challenge? Watch a video of me dancing for 1000 hours nonstop! There are gameplay features to be sure you are not cheating. Such as holding the ''w'' key during the whole duration of the game and small QTE events randomly happening. Will you be able to take the challenge? Might sound impossible... But who said you had to do it alone? Maybe you can be a group of people taking turns... Be imaginative! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nHow far will you get?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMusic made by: SparrowRayne", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T00:59:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d78/d78f1888abe88e048c35d07a1bbcbf4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 330, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bmc Studio"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bmc Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
