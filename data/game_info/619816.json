Anticipating that the most likely ideas would be joining together characters or movable blocks, I wanted to give something else a try. I wanted to figure out if joining parts of the level together could make for a fun experience.</p>\n<p>In SLAM! your world consists of at most 3 adjacent rooms. In order to navigate the entire level, you'll have to strategically separate and join rooms together. The primary goal is to\u00a0find the exit, but grab all the credits you can on your way out.</p><p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p><ul><li>Move/jump:\u00a0WASD</li><li>Swap room:\u00a0X (you must be near the edge of a room)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T16:18:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca0/ca0a6fb729706af988f613cc372209a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["michaeldejong"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
