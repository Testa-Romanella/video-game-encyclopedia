It should be noted that it was a work in progress prior to the jam. You can use an Dev Kit 1 model of the Oculus Rift to play it. However, there is a version for those who don't have a rift. The music used is \"Satellite Anthem Icarus\" by Boards of Canada. I do not own the rights to the music, it belongs to its rightful owners.
