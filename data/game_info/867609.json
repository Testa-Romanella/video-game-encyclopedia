If you have feedback, questions, or want to follow future development of the game, please find me here: https://yogatorademebitch.tumblr.com/</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>18+ </strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>View from The Wastes</strong> is a horror/sci-fi VN in active development! <em>If you are a fan of BTD, Stranger Things, Bandersnatch, Brave New World, BNHA, or Xmen, you may\u00a0enjoy VFW!</em><br/><br/>In VFW you play a newly discovered <strong>mutant</strong> hunted by two opposing groups. The story hinges around your choices, your loyalty to its characters tested, rewarded or punished. Will you join Whitehorse Tech in its race to overtake what's left of a torn and tattered world, or will you team up with the shadowy <strong>Nemesis</strong> to destroy Whitehorse from within?<br/><br/>In VFW, you'll have the opportunity to meet many characters, some of which are romanceable... if you survive. <br/><br/>Will you join forces with Nemesis? His ultimate goals are unclear, but he promises you a better world.<br/>Will you follow Ratt, the Conduit, and learn more than you ever bargained about the shadowy underbelly of Whitehorse?<br/>Or will you join Ander, and have your eyes opened to the truth?<br/></p>\n<p>The demo features no major CWs, includes minimal jumpscares and language. It is currently SFW. VFW's demo was created during @ffishstickks 2022 fall Ren'Py course. Thank you to Fish and everyone who participated!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T15:54:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/941/941b70afc0131a54f1d29faf9a318f3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["pax"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
