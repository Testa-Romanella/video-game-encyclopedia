Launch Rockets, Make money. Create the worlds first Global Satellite Internet Service... I guess you might call it a link in the stars? Or maybe some sort of Star Link? Not sure yet, obviously the name needs work.<br/><br/>Your job as CEO will involve many challenges.  Every satellite you launch enables more customers to choose your internet service, but bad latency will drive them away, so don't make your orbits too large... but also, don't put them so close that they crash into each other... its a real balancing act.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Space is dangerous</strong>, rockets crash, Asteroids are big, Fuel is expensive, and the EPA will fine you for polluting the atmosphere with Rocket debris.<br/><br/>Luckily for you, Your Uncle was also a little eccentric so has designed the rocket/satellites to be mounted with Point Defence Cannons in order to shoot down anything that might cause a disruption to your internet service. Whether that's Asteroids, Aliens or even your own Rockets.<br/><br/>Orbit-X simulates a <strong>tiny little planet</strong> that provides a simple entry into rocket physics, with <strong>no need to study rocket science to play</strong><br/><br/><strong>Within seconds</strong> of starting you will be <strong>flying rockets</strong> and putting them in orbit. Once you enable the Antenna on a rocket it will start connecting people to the Interwebs and you start making money! But be careful not to charge too much for slow internet.<br/><br/>You might lose a rocket or two if an asteroid comes along, but once you upgrade your facilities you can load up your rockets with Ammo and start shooting them down. Let's be honest if anyone was going to put <strong>Machine Guns on Rockets</strong>, it was going to be your Uncle, Alon.<br/><br/>When you see your rocket fleet dancing around the planet, making beautiful shapes with their trails, you will smile... Then when two of them collide and three more get taken out by an asteroid, you will cry... But if you have managed your funds well, you can just launch more!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T02:58:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d64/d646f99beab342f1e4f9242862acf4b4.jpg", "website": "https://www.differentgravity.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Different Gravity Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Different Gravity Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
