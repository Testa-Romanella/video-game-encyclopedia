Namely, how players always find a way to do something stupid and mess up the DM's world.\r\n</p>\n<p>(For those of you not familiar, DnD is a role-playing game, where players take on the role of an adventurer on a quest, and have great flexibility in choices while the DM- \"Dungeon Master\" creates the story for them.)</p>\n<p>While it is possible to play through this game seriously, it isn't the point! There are plenty of silly options and random generated results to go along with the theme and lead your character through a wacky adventure. Beware rng, though! Some options are much more difficult to pass than others.</p>\n\n\n<p>This game includes:</p>\n<p>- Adult language</p>\n<p>- Themes such as; murder, really bad murder, failed stat checks, infuriating characters, spam saving, semi-replay-ability, sexuality and last minute quality!</p>\n<p>- Easter Eggs! (gotta find em all)</p>\n<p>- Random number generator dice rolls for stat checks (where applicable)</p>\n<p>- Multiple possibilities per choice as per rng</p>\n<p>- Comedic fun as best written in a crazed rush</p>\n<p>- Tears, free of charge</p>\n<p><em>The game contains 1,898 dialogue blocks, containing 15,783 words and 83,787<br/>characters, for an average of 8.3 words and 44 characters per block.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>The game contains 35 menus, 203 images, and 26 screens.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c08/c08630b1db5e721e4e12cfdf85377881.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Pacermist"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
