In the service of M.O.T.H.E.R you will hunt indiscriminately while using your talents to complete the job you were uniquely born to do.<br/><br/><br/>SKIPCHASERS are a secretive group of gunmen scattered throughout the known universe. Combat ready and rapidly deployable, they have a reputation as ruthless paramilitary soldiers. Little is known about their origins, and less about their employer, the corporation know as M.O.T.H.E.R.<br/><br/><br/>Contracts will send you all over the planet from salted wastelands to the bowels of the element mines long since abandoned. Here you will encounter all manner of human, alien and robotic brutes, making sure to keep your trigger finger ready at all times. With procedurally generated enemies it could be hours before you encounter the same one twice.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>A SKIPCHASER's best friend is his weapon, so it should be completely customizable. With thousands of possible combinations you can use the smithing system to create just the right ordnance for any enemy or situation. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>SKIPCHASERs and enemies deal damage in three different types: fire, bio and cryo. Each damage type has a counter and can be applied to guns and gear.
