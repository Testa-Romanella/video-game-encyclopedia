The game is based in a high-fantasy world called Tamrul, and features a ragtag bunch of heroes who, due to some unfortunate circumstances, can only return home by catching the train. Unluckily for\u00a0them, every time they reach a new stop along the route, they realise that the rest of the carriages in the train are filled with monsters! The heroes will need to battle the rest of the train on the platform in order to get back onto the train and continue on their journey home.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T04:55:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13f/13f2ca194cca77ac1a124f988b3a6327.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ryukawastaken", "sarateh"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
