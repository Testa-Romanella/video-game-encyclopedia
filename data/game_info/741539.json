{"id": 741539, "slug": "action-fist", "name": "Action Fist", "name_original": "Action Fist", "description": "<p>Action Fist is a side-scrolling, 2D platform game with a graphical style reminiscent of titles from the late eighties, early nineties. It can be played alone or cooperatively with another human player using the same computer. Initially two characters are available, Domingus and Ina, but later on two additional ones can be unlocked. The aim of the game is to rescue the girl Rita Mae who has been kidnapped.</p>\n<p>Levels contain typical elements such as platform jumps, gaps, timed movement and a large variety of obstacles and enemies. There are different themes for the areas and they are played as a side-scrolling game with free movement, but there are also a few levels where the screen scrolls at a steady pace, a racing level, and an area that is vertically oriented. Next to movement three keys are used, to shoot, jump and switch weapons. Firing is always done in the direction the character is facing. It is possible to aim upwards, and downwards while jumping. Characters are able to double jump and perform wall jumps. There is only a single weapon, but three main types of ammo: red, yellow and green. Players can only carry two types at all times and new ones can be picked up by destroying crates. There are also two modifier slots for each type of ammo, to alter the bullet pattern, speed or strength. Health is restored by picking up blue pluses, but there are also regular checkpoints and an unlimited amount of lives.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-19T02:18:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e02/e0222d8c101b0f9802ba74a01f166f77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
