Players navigate a 'drone' that can scan cities to collect tools that can be applied\u00a0to transform the 'transformable city' to improve the liveability level of the city. The game comprises of abstracted versions of various global cities including London, Los Angeles, Tokyo and Copenhagen. The players constantly switch back and forth between scannable cities to collect tools and transformable cities to apply those tools, within a given time-frame.\u00a0The player who proceeds by modifying the transformable city to adjust its visible spatial metrics is presented with an annual liveability report at the end.\u00a0The game emphasises the need for redefining the criteria for ranking the liveability level of a city by focusing on the spatial and social metrics as well as the need for considering the contextual implications of the strategies before applying them onto the city.</p>\n<p>Note: PC Game.
