In this game you find someone crying on the street in the pouring rain. You must find out why they are refusing to seek shelter, and convince them to do so!</p>\n<p>The game is 90% complete but I will admitt it has stopped just short of a complete submission. I hope you will treat it kindly regardless.</p>\n<p>Notes on playing: <br/></p>\n<p>Make note of each item chracters give you if you want an easier time completing the game. The item interface sadly didn't make it into the game, you can tell which item you are receiving during a conversation if you observe carefully.<br/></p>\n<p>The menu is fully working,\u00a0 there is no pointer to the begin and quit buttons; they both work as intended though!<br/></p>\n<p>The game is complete when the crying person shows a happy face at the end of a conversation, I truely wish i had had just a short while longer to implement the actual win condition!<br/></p>\n<p>The game has a 2 min time limit but time is paused during conversations. The time is unfortunately not represented. If the game freezes and you have not experieinced the above win condition then hold esc to go back to the menu to retry!<br/></p>\n<p>Controls: WASD, Space, Hold ESC to return to the menu!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T06:59:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/212/21287b215fbf84b005a309bb07ef432d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shatteraura"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
