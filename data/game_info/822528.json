Try playing without fullscreen in such case.</p>\n<p>Made by a solo-dev in 48h for GMTK 2022 GameJam.</p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY:</p>\n<p>The Dice Knight will roll his die every 2s (1,5s in Blitz mode and 3s in slow mode) and perform the action corresponding to the result.<br/>Change what actions are available by clicking on actions falling on the left-hand side then click on any action slot to replace it.<br/>SPACE to pause the game.</p>\n<p>IPMPORTANT NOTE:</p>\n<p>You CAN still swap actions when the game is paused. This started as a bug\u00a0but I decided to keep it as it can make the game less frantic and more strategic and accessible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T16:45:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06f/06f00433d2f3db6bdf32f36613b768fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Filtrax"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
