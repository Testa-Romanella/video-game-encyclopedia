Every four beats, a random\u00a0number between 1 and 4\u00a0will appear on the Disco Die. You must press <em>and then release</em> the space bar in time with the beats to make your Beat Count increase. Make your Beat Count match the Disco Die number and wait for the Rhythm Count in the top left to reach its fourth beat and a new number will be generated on the Disco Die.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT:</p>\n<p>This game is <em>very</em> rhythmically\u00a0demanding and\u00a0will get faster as you play, so keep to the rhythm and don't get distracted! To make sure you don't miss your cue, be ready with the space bar <em>as soon</em> as the Disco Die is about to prepare a new number!\u00a0Release the space bar\u00a0too early, too late, too many times or not enough times and you lose a Chance (tallied in the top right of the screen). When you run out of chances, the game resets and you'll have to try for a new score.</p>\n<p>FUN FACT:</p>\n<p>This was my first game I ever made using GDevelop5 as a branching off point from Unreal Engine, go me! (Didn't quite have time or knowhow for a permanent save high score system tho lol)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T11:43:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1b/b1b637c36d5edf307db4f877f3680909.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["The Bonsai Treehouse"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
