The game is themed around toys, blocks, Seuss inspired rhymes and illustration, and everything else we remember loving about childhood. For players of Chip's Challenge the game will be both familiar and fresh. For fans of the puzzle genre the game has some of the most hardcore sokoban challenges ever devised. The puzzles are wacky and make you think about problems you have never thought about before. You are a block seeking the flag, but along the way you will have to learn and master the laws of a totally foreign universe.<br/></p><p>We all start life in a bizarre world and have to learn the weird rules. PUSH asks you to do that all over again in a totally different world.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4eb/4ebf037a171f50acd7f3aba6a20cfdd4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Overreact"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
