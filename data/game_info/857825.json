This wasn't the original plan, though.\u00a0The plan was\u00a0to take my time and\u00a0spend the whole of 2022 developing the game for a Halloween release. But unfortunately, after eight months,\u00a0the only progress made was a very vague story\u00a0outline and a folder full\u00a0of background image reference\u00a0scoured from the internet. <em>Fortunately</em> though, this meant the pre-preparation restrictions for the Spooktober hadn't been breached. When I\u00a0realised this, motivation kicked in and I got to work.</p>\n<p>The previous \u00a0game, Waterborne\u00a0was entered in the 2021 jam and\u00a0was shortlisted among 35 other entries with highly positive reviews from those that played it. Hopefully this sequel will be equally\u00a0well received.</p>\n<p>Comments and feedback regarding the game are\u00a0welcomed. Feel free to link any\u00a0<em>lets plays</em>\u00a0or reviews etc. Very interested to see/hear/read reactions to the game.\u00a0If you'd like updates to this game or other lazytiger projects, you can follow here or on\u00a0twitter.\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\nFEATURES\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Mysterious and thought provoking storyline\r\n</li><li>Unique watercolour/mixed media\u00a0art style\r\n</li><li>Multiple puzzles to solve</li><li>10k word count\r\n</li><li>Estimated 60 mins of playtime</li></ul>\r\nCREDITS\r\n\r\n<p>Made by\u00a0lazytiger\u00a0using\u00a0Ren'Py\r\n</p>\n<p>Full credits can be found in game.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T07:03:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72d/72d18db801b1cb505e0b019859f9a5d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["lazytiger"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
