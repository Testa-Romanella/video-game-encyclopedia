With this feedback, we decided to pivot our gameplay concept so we could focus solely on improving the gameplay which resonated most with our audience. We heavily expanded the top-down twin-stick shooter aspect of our game. In this expansion, we implemented novel mechanics that build on one another and allow the player to make interesting decisions. We added set objectives for the player to defend, which gives the player purpose beyond their own basic fight for survival. We began theming our game with basic art and began working with an artist to add more professional art in the future.\r\n</p>\n<p>Moving forward, we plan to implement a variety of features. This includes features that aid the player\u2019s understanding of game mechanics, features that expand the choices the player can make, and features that link our initially planned story with current gameplay. We look forward to our next testing session, which will help us balance our gameplay and conceptualize additional features.\r\n<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T14:44:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/326/3265b83b81c2b28b74cc89c412f32bc5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["shady-lobster-games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
