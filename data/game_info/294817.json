Where did I pull that fact from? Out of my ass, of course- but that isn't the point. The point is- love is pretty fuckin' cool, and has been around for the forevers.</p>\n<p>Anyway, since Valentines Day NEVER gets any romance games, why not have a dating sim for this particular day of celebrating said\u00a0romances? Oh wait, the game wasn't released on Valentine's Day? This ruins everything. BUT WHO CARES!!!! IT IS\u00a0A DATING SIM that has 3 DIFFERENT GIRLS (one of them is a dude) CALLED\u00a0LOKAMS!!!</p>\n<p>You might ask, what is a LOKAM? Ha! What a stupid question! Moving on!</p>\n<p>Play as a cool person\u00a0who is in the spirit of... romanceful love! Flirt with the loves of your dreams, which are (un)coincidentally LOKAM!!! LOKAMS!!! LOKAMES???</p>\n<p>Do you have what it takes to be the ULTIMATE LOVER? Or are you just some BRAINDEAD LOSER who SITS AND PLAYS WEIRD ASS INDIE GAMES ALL DAY? YOU PROBABLY\u00a0MIGHT BE BOTH!</p>\n<p>Have fun.</p><ul><li><strong>Programming, Writing, and Misc. art by Konami Kode</strong></li><li><strong>Art by SpaghettiiWithJuice</strong></li><li><strong>Music by about-blank</strong></li><li><strong>Logos, Banners, Misc. by\u00a0Liaxao</strong></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-18T04:07:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cba/cba27af79a517953dc6ed2b0dd1b9224.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Konami Computer Entertainment Kobe"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
