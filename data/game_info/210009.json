It was mostly for my sisters and I to play. It was local multiplayer on the keyboard, and each soldier was in a war, of course, with a lot of weapons at disposal. It almost had a sandboxy feel, because a lot of things could interact. It was a testament to pre-Yoyogames Game Maker's flexibility. The assets were all from free asset packs from the Game Maker website from way back then.<br/></p>\n<p>It was the most complete first game I made that I have not released at all in any capacity. So this is a remake of it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e36/e36706569d654fc618de2260fd5c8a04.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gmx0"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
