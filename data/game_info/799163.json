It's no wonder why he is so wanted. Yet no matter how well known he is, no one can seem to even catch a glimpse of his face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And tonight is no different...</p>\r\nGoal\r\n<p>You will be playing as Rogue Star and trying to gather treasures while not getting caught. Your small figure helps allow you to get into small nooks and crannies but unfortunately, it's a disadvantage against the brutes that tower over you so fighting is no option. You can only avoid them and hope you won't make a scene.\u00a0</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Bryce Deshotel - UI (start, pause, win, lose), Level design</p>\n<p>Woodrow Crawford - Camera,\u00a0 Player sound senses, Player Controls</p>\n<p>Cailey Bianchini - UI (stealth), Enemy AI, SFX</p>\n<p>Devin St. Germain - Environment, Enemy Voice Lines</p>\n<p>River Reigns - Animation, Modeling</p>\n<p>Nathan Aytona -\u00a0 Character/Enemy Blockout and sculpting</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T17:59:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3c/c3c06b29ee2daba4fbf2de46601c18f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Liquid Moon Productions"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
