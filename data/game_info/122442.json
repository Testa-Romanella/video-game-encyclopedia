Our task was to make a game expressing an emotion (fear,love,hate ...). The game is about fear (of heights). I got help programming this game, I have also used sounds from god knows where and the fps controller is a free download from here.</p><p>I really wanted to add some fog on the bottom of the level and more wood screeching sounds so there is that. Also you can't exit the game and will need to alt tab to get back to your desktop and kill the application from there.</p><p>I might upload some more old (and or broken) projects in the future. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/260/260c6b82a86613d9e784e2e5af29e9e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Rabbit"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
