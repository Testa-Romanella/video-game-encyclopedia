It's been fun but quite a challenge as well. I used Unity and had to use a few assets from the Asset Store that I had already purchased in the past. Pretty much everything has been used from others except for the main game logic. I have learned a lot from this and am hoping next LD I will be able to use everything created by me :)</p><p>Hope you enjoy the concept of the game at least. Cheers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b96/b96ed479b43c0ca8e927debb12421df4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Leuthil"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
