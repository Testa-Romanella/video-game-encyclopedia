To win, you need to break all the bricks in the level, and this is not so easy to do. Bricks do not stand still and move, making it difficult to hit them. Simple controls and nice neon graphics will not disappoint you.</p>\n<p>The player keeps under control a small racket platform, which can be moved horizontally from one wall to another, placing it under the ball, preventing it from falling down. The impact of the ball on the brick leads to the destruction of the brick. Subsequently, such as all the bricks at the provided level are destroyed, there is a transition to a future degree, with a fresh set of bricks.</p>\n<p>You can get in the Google Play.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T04:50:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23d/23dda50a96f9a1417ea0116c97dcce66.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Just Another Game"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
