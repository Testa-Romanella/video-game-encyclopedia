People occasionally ask me if it is still available, so here it is. </p>\n<p>There are two versions, Mk III and Mk V. They each have a different feel. In both you can press 'n' and type in a title, it will generate a song from that string.<br/></p>\n<p>I also don't remember why they were called \"Mk III\" and \"Mk V\", when there's only two of them, except to say that I was quite fond of Steve Jackson Game's OGRE.</p>\n\n<p><strong>MK VI</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This is is a newer work-in-progress that I started in 2016.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Mk V</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\"Mk V\" was written in Blitz Basic (I've made the sourcecode available too).</p>\n<p><strong>Mk III<br/></strong></p>\n<p>First of all, thank-you to Gunship_Mark_II at the Vinesauce Reddit for making this available, as I had lost my original. <br/></p>\n<p>Mk III's claim to fame is that Stuart Ashen used it to make the \"Ashen Theme Tune\". It was written in, good grief, Dark Basic, and I cannot honestly remember how it got on the internet in the first place. Since people still upload videos of it to YouTube, it must be circulating out there somewhere.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e34/e34b9aebf8b4f884e0d5827ace9b5826.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Marasmusine"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
