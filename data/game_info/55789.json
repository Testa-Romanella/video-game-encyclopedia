The Game Boy version of Pitman was rereleased on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console in October 2011. The word 'Catrap' refers to the frequent amount of times the player is trapped and needs to reverse their movements and the two anthropomorphic cats the player must manoeuvre to advance through the levels. The game is credited with having originated the time-rewind mechanic, which later appeared in titles like Blinx: The Time Sweeper, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, Braid and Pullblox.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1990-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:00:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b88/b8898d73667d639992582519dc1737fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 191, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Game Boy", "Nintendo 3DS"], "developers": ["Asmik Ace Entertainment", "Asmik"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Asmik Ace Entertainment", "Asmik"], "esrb_rating": null}
