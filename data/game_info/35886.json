These saucers are under the control of the evil Brain Aliens who are abducting helpless human beings and taking them away to strange alien worlds to become slaves of The Giant Brain. Luckily for the human race there exist the Otto Matics, robots who police the galaxy in name of all that is good and decent.<br/><br/>You are Otto Matic, the robot who is given the job of saving Earth from the clutches of The Giant Brain from Planet X. You must rescue as many humans as you can while defeating the Brain Aliens and all of their evil followers. Your mission will take you to strange and fantastic alien worlds which are often treacherous and will require Otto to perform amazing feats.<br/><br/>Your rocket ship will take you to each of the planets, starting with Earth. While on each planet you must save as many humans as you can, but be careful because the Brain Aliens will try to abduct the humans before you can save them. When you save humans, they are teleported to your rocket ship. To escape the planet you must also collect rocket fuel. Once The Giant Brain has been defeated and peace restored to the galaxy, you will return to Earth with your human cargo where they will be freed.<br/><br/>In Otto Matic...<br/><br/>\u2022 10 levels on strange alien planets!<br/>\u2022\u00a0Battle 25 different alien creatures!<br/>\u2022 Attack with 7 different types of space-age weapons<br/>\u2022\u00a0Fight off giant radioactive killer vegetables!<br/>\u2022 Ski behind giant metal beasts on a sea of toxic ooze!<br/>\u2022 Ride soap bubbles across noxious lakes of slimy goo!<br/>\u2022 Get shot out of a cannon!<br/>\u2022\u00a0Smash alien clowns in hovercraft bumper-cars!<br/>\u2022 Drink radioactive potions to grow to 50ft tall!<br/>\u2022 Ride a zip-line to escape mutant radioactive robots!<br/>\u2022 Pilot a flying saucer and lay waste to an alien fortress!<br/>\u2022 Battle the Giant Brain from Planet X<br/><br/>And much, much more!<br/><br/>View the Otto Matic Instruction Manual Here:  http://pangeasoft.net/otto/instructions.html", "metacritic": null, "released": "2004-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T01:18:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/149/149b873009973497b70eaf2dc3b75365.jpg", "website": "http://pangeasoft.net/otto/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 380, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "iOS"], "developers": ["Pangea Software", "Ideas from the Deep"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Pangea Software", "Ideas from the Deep"], "esrb_rating": null}
