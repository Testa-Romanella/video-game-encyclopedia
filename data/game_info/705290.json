You woke up in a forest and lost your memory. The only thing you realize is that you can now control the most important law in physics, gravity. Traverse all the levels altering gravity to your advantage, avoiding enemies and solving puzzles. In the end you\u2019ll know everything about your past life, death and why you woke up having this power.<br/></p>\n<p>In Grave-ity, your only action is to alter gravity, which will affect all your surroundings. You can reverse it, make it stronger or lighter.\u00a0Create your own playstyle to complete your journey, combining gravity alterations with your movement abilities.\u00a0You can't fight and you don't have weapons, so your only option is to avoid enemies and obstacles. Gravity is your only friend...and at the same time\u00a0your worst enemy.\r\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>- Arrows/WASD</strong>\u00a0to move.\r\n</p>\n<p>-\u00a0<strong>Space</strong>\u00a0to jump (Hold to jump longer).\r\n</p>\n<p>-\u00a0<strong>Left Shift</strong>\u00a0to dash.\r\n</p>\n<p>-\u00a0<strong>CTRL</strong>\u00a0to grab objects.\r\n</p>\n<p>Gravity has\u00a0<strong>three intensity levels</strong>:\r\n</p>\n<p>- Lighter.\r\n</p>\n<p>- Normal.\r\n</p>\n<p>- Heavier.\r\n</p>\n<p>Use<strong>\u00a0F key</strong>\u00a0to make gravity lighter\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>R key</strong>\u00a0to make it stronger.\r\n</p>\n<p>Use\u00a0<strong>E key\u00a0</strong>to reverse gravity.\r\n</p>\n<p>When you alter gravity, you consume your \"Gravity Resource\",\u00a0 it is restored over time when you are in Normal Gravity state.
