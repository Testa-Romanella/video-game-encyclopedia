But who knows, everything depends on it. What will be the interest in the project =]\r\n\r\nIs the game paid [?]\r\n- No. And you will never have to pay for it. The game is published in a free version from the very beginning and it is only up to you. Whether you will voluntarily make some donations. They will always come in handy for the development of my other projects, which in the near future, I plan to release.\r\n\n<br/>\n<p>Greetings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I would like to present to you t<strong>he demo version of the game Astromid</strong> , which is made entirely in the style of GameBoy Classic.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<p><em>An astronaut sent by Earth's space station. traverses the galactic paths to find a planet. On which, in the future, human settlement will be possible. During the journey, unfortunately, he hits a rain of asteroids, destroying the Conestoga 1620 rocket.</em><br/></p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The game is divided into different types of challenges, each of which has several arenas to go through:\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>[1.] </strong>Avoiding enemies and collecting points.</p>\n<p><strong>[2.] </strong>Places that can be entered only once, with no way to return.</p>\n<p><strong>[3.] </strong>Moving boxes to designated locations (random boxes to a random location and specific boxes to a specific location).</p>\n<p><strong>[4.] </strong>Collecting oxygen cylinders to survive to exit the underground.</p>\n<p><strong>[5.] </strong>Skirmish with the Boss, consisting of three different phases during the skirmish.</p>\n<p>After passing all arenas - the player unlocks<strong> time trials.</strong> - Where he can pass all the arenas from scratch, except that instead of earning a certain number of points, he must fit in time by completing the arena.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>To make the gameplay not boring. I introduced skins that will allow you to change the appearance of the player so that only one cosmonaut charset does not run.</p>\n<p>For each skin there are specific guidelines that must be met to use it. And you can check the whole list in a special \"task log\" in the game options.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Tell me about any bugs or problems in the comments or report \r\nthem to me by writing to rubin.maker@gmail.com  \r\nand I will fix them as soon as possible!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T14:31:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac0/ac09453a1bbff94441ac726490d50c3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rubin"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
