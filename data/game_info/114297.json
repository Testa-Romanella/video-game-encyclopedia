And because of this, I have knocked over my fair share of glassware and liquids that get in the way of my physical talking. No discussion ends dry, shatter-less or unstained. \"Mano Italiano\" is an interactive game created with Unity and Leap Motion, where the player can talk and see just how destructive their hand gestures can be.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fdd/fdda25b6dbfc320dccd378d6882d94f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["angelaitp"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
