Popular unrest is coming to a flashpoint as the insurgent tribes gather their supporters to again depose this puppet.</p>\n<p>Durrani chiefs gather their supporters and march on the house of Alexander Burnes, EIC agent in Kabul. Can Burnes' hold out until relief can arrive from his allies?</p>\n\n<p>Kabul 1841 is a short, 5-10 minute wargame exploring a small siege that kicked off the insurgency that would briefly drive the EIC out of Afghanistan. Kabul is a turn-based, worker placement game. Each turn, roughly corresponding to 15 in game minutes, you must choose how to marshall your forces to stem the tide coming at you. Help is close, but help is not easily forthcoming. The forces stationed at the Bala Hisar fortress, and the army camp outside the city, are reluctant to come to your aid if circumstances do not require it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Languages</strong></p>\n<p><em>English</em></p>\n<p><em>Gaeilge</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T09:39:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9a/e9a4116bd8c839eb580893d0240d6d7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pucalab"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
