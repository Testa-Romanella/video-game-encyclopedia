{"id": 792017, "slug": "sync-beat-prototype", "name": "Sync-Beat (Prototype)", "name_original": "Sync-Beat (Prototype)", "description": "<p>Rhythm games normally require touch in some form to hit the beat, but what about using your voice? Sync-Beat is a voice-based rhythm game where you\u00a0 sing to the rhythm, while also using the spacebar to hit to the beat!</p>\n<p>To download the game: Simply download the ZIP file and right-click to extract. Then click on Syncbeat.exe to launch the application!</p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY:</p>\n<p>To play this game, you need access to a microphone. Spacebar for main gameplay. Mouse for menu navigation.</p>\n<p>To start the level (have the notes falling down), press any key or spacebar.<br/></p>\n<p>Depending on the chosen difficulty, you will see 1 to 4 circles on the bottom center of the screen. <br/></p>\n<p>Circles represent pitches for the notes to fall on, from left to right: low pitch, middle pitch, high pitch.</p>\n<p>Use your microphone and voice to hit the note at the right pitch. You may need to test your microphone and try singing in different pitches to see what it detects. <br/></p>\n<p>Rectangles represent the beat, use the Spacebar to hit to the beat.</p><p>In the hard difficulty, there is an added mechanic that involves speech recognition. This requires you to repeat the word said on the screen when it lands on the note, regardless of pitch<br/></p>\n<p>Note that the pitch detection is very sensitive, so you may need to sing higher or lower than expected for extended periods of time (this is especially the case for the hard difficulty). Speech detection is also sensitive to pronunciation and seems to work best when enunciated clearly.<br/><br/>--------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>This was a very ambitious project that I worked on in university. As this was required to be a prototype, this will remain a prototype for the time being.<br/></p>\n<p>This project is for educational purposes, so I won't be accepting any donations.<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0Energy - Bensound.com</p>\n<p>HUGE thanks to GameDevStev's reply in a reddit post for basic voice recognition:\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/49wuld/best_way_to_implement_microphone_input/) <br/></p>\n<p>and theguywhodreams' forum on Unity for the main bits of detecting voice pitch. Couldn't have achieved an amazing result without them:</p>\n<p>https://forum.unity.com/threads/detecting-musical-notes-from-vocal-input.316698/<br/></p>\n<p>(^The basis of the code comes from these, the rest is just tweaking it properly.)<br/></p>\n<p>UI by me. We weren't meant to make any UI other than just a set of start and quit buttons (or whatever is necessary) but I love making my own art assets and implementing them somewhere :) <br/></p>\n<p>Made in Unity.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T10:18:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27d/27d61207735b11ee5fe8b224e6ee9c22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fallgazer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
