It's a point and click adventure game with two different endings! I\u00a0meant to make it within a week, but it ended up taking almost up to a year to complete it all. (Wow, talk about underestimating the amount of work goes into making a Unity game, haha!)\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can play this game in your browser, no download required!\u00a0Or if you prefer your games offline, you can download a desktop version as well. For the desktop version, click download and then unzip the folder. Open the folder and click on \"Secret spy game that is also an angel game.exe\", that should start it up!</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy! Let me know what you thought of the characters, and who you liked the most. :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-06T03:00:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ae/9ae16fa4245de5b6933bdaf6d0ba77dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Heiden"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
