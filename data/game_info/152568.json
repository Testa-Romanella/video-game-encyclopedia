These resources can be kept, to eventually contribute to the rank, or\u00a0spent for upgrades\u00a0to\u00a0get\u00a0more\u00a0resources.<br/></p>\n<p>All the controls are mouse based. Use left click to select Units and right click to have them do a job, such as mining or walking. Hovering your mouse over the homebase (the shed-looking thing) will allow you to purchase upgrades.</p>\n<p>There are three possible ranks for you to get. Below 90 resources, you get no medal. Above 90, you get bronze. Above 270, you get silver. Above 720, you get gold. <br/><br/>Shoutouts to the folks making and contributing to Godot. Glad to have this be my first project in that engine. Credits for other used assets are in the \"Credits\" screen accessible through the main menu.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e47/e472ea5368eca24d875e1c68489d0e20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rokato"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
