I want to create a piece that shows\r\nmore of a narrative element in game design. Integrating small mechanics to\r\nenhance the experience of the story. What I hope to achieve with this project\r\nis that the player will experience what it is like after its all over, when\r\ndeath has come. They don't really know who they are as they are feature less. I\r\nwant it to be like they are discovering who they are.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sleeping/ Waking-up:</p>\n<p>Through my design, I\r\nwill be able to play with colors and transitions to simulate a mechanic of\r\nclosing your eyes and waking-up. This plays an important role in the story as\r\nthe player relives memories, trying to figure out who they are.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Setting:</p>\n<p>Art is one way that\r\nwill help provide context as to where the player is without long descriptions.\r\nIt helps them focus on what is being said rather than having to read about the\r\nsetting and then what the other characters say. The color scheme is black and\r\nwhite to keep it minimalistic and simple.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T06:30:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd0/fd0c57bcfd64c0b980fe37860d2a091c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mahrens1"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
