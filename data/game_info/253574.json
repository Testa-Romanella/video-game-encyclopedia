With over 100,000 downloads, Eugene is one of the most popular Chess apps on iTunes. Can you defeat him? Download Eugene now and find out.<br/><br/>HOW SMART IS EUGENE?<br/>A good chess player should be able to defeat Eugene with a good game. He starts out with a difficulty of 2, but you can increase it to 3 if he isn't challenging you enough. This will slow Eugene down a bit, especially on devices older than iPhone 4.<br/><br/>Eugene isn't programmed with any pre-set openings. This makes for some interesting and non-traditional situations right from the start. Obviously, this also means that Eugene might get into trouble early since his vision isn't as deep as other engines that play by the book.<br/><br/>Eugene's brains are basically javascript, the language that powers the web. Apple continues to improve the performance of javascript with each new phone so Eugene will continue to get faster.<br/><br/>An actual rating of Eugene is a bit hard to calculate. If someone would like to calculate his actual ELO that would be awesome and I will update this description accordingly. If I had to estimate it I would guess it is maybe 1600. That is really just a guess, however.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:09:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54e/54e1ceb69cba5aa7f130fa57a41f98ed_kgEXrc4.jpg", "website": "http://adrian3.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Adrian3"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Adrian Hanft"], "esrb_rating": null}
