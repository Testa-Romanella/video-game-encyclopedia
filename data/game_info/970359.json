Everything you need is to connect circles by drawing red lines. Not green, not blue, just RED. And follow numbers inside circles, by the way. That\u2019s it. No more rules.<br/><br/>The game contains 4 modes. Each mode is available after completing previous one.<br/><ul><li>A mode (7 sets of 7 levels)<br/></li><li>B mode (7 sets of 7 levels)<br/></li><li>C mode (7 sets of 7 levels)<br/></li><li>Extended (thousands of levels)</li></ul><br/><strong>A mode</strong> we described above.<br/>Levels in <strong>B mode</strong> have excess lines, so you will need just to remove them. It is supposed that you can\u2019t draw new lines in this mode.<br/>In <strong>C mode</strong> numbers in circles will reduce after drawing each line. Also you aren\u2019t allowed to clear lines.<br/><br/>In <strong>Extended mode</strong> you can select complexity (S, M, L, XL) and play all possible levels. Yes, there are lots of levels.<br/><br/>Interested?
