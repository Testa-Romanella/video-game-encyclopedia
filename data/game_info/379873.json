There's a wrinkle though -- if time runs out with anyone having zero acorns, they win and the fat-cat acorn hogs lose! <br/>So be sure to chase your friends around throwing acorns at them after you've stolen too many of theirs.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: \"Nuts to You\" is a jam game, and as such the submission build is pretty rough! It's only currently playable with controllers.
