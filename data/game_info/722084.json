GIVE ME A BREAK GUYS!!!\r\nNOT BASED ON DREAM SMP. IT IS A STORY I BASED ON MY REAL LIFE GROUP OF FRIENDS AND HOW WE ACT, JUST NOT NAMING THEM OR I IN THE STORY!\r\n<p>You take on the POV of Wilbur. (A character that is based on myself, just with Wilbur Soot's name. It doesn't sound right calling the main character Kenny alright) Taking on the final school year as it comes. Somehow fitting in time to revise when he has to worry about his relationship no one knows about.</p>\n<p>The first chapter (this one), is basically an introduction, Part 2 is more choice based and let's you decide on what goes on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>ALSO NOTICE: ALL UPDATES ARE FREE. When I decide to attempt a release on GOG.com or Epic Games Launcher. Part 4 will be released. While not necessary, donations are always appreciated. The game may not deserve to be paid for in my eyes but there is probably someone out there that would think otherwise!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T08:27:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd8/fd8299ae6958c8ad8249edf2c140c98a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheWildDev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
