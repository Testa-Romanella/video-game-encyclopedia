You're the green ship on the left, bad guys are the red, err, ships, on the right. Build up the highest score you can. Your hitbox is 1 pixel, so no excuses! :P It's possible to cheese since there's no AI, but it's slow and definitely not fun.</p>\n<p>The game was created in an afternoon and uses all 560 available characters as per the jam rules. If you are a PICO8 owner, try the code out for yourself :)</p>\n<p>Hope you like it, feedback welcomed.<br/></p>\n<p>Laxaloffle BBS Page:<br/>https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=34221</p>\n<p>Twitter post:<br/>https://twitter.com/DaleJ_Dev/status/1128433534836903936</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-17T06:37:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ee/5eea3cb1873e7b16c21bbc1a1ae2c1da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lafolie"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
