Whoa, crazy! The challenge? Simply, the deer. Now, in these most rigorous parts, the deer are unfortunately sick in the head, which is very unfortunate if you\u2019re a Michigan driver. Sorry little Michigan driver, the deer don\u2019t care if they are hit, in fact, there's a parasite wedged in their frumpy herbivore brains, but that\u2019s a lot of science nonsense that doesn\u2019t matter and won\u2019t keep you alive. All you need to know is that your blue car, ole reliable, is the only thing standing between you and the killer deer of Michigan.
