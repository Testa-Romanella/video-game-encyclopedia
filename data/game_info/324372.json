We are a group of veterans of the gaming industry, having worked on projects like Mafia, Vietcong, Mad Max or Witcher III in the past. With each of us having dedicated 15+ years of our professional careers to game development, we thought it was about time we started making games under our own flag. We love horror and sci-fi movies, good action, and cheesy one-liners. Our goal is to create entertaining games which combine fast-paced action with gore, humor, and lots of fun.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-29T20:33:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2a/f2a87f726e52e151ece90e9d19db1506.jpg", "website": "https://youtu.be/fTezQcF5xtY", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 298, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Dualcarbon"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Asim Ahmad"], "esrb_rating": null}
