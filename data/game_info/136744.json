The game is a simple concept I was working on where you have other players fly around trying to get the asteroids you are also trying to get. It is kill or be killed. If you die you lose your points. If you kill another player its negative points. Perhaps when I get the time I will fix a few of the bugs. The entire game was made in 5 or so days. I hope everyone enjoys the game, to get into space simply fly straight up from the landing pad. Press 0 several times to get some speed built up. I only had 1 computer to work with so I wasn't able to test if the multiplayer actually works. I used unet for it thought so maybe? I also do not have enough experience with programming for network to really know if my concept will even work, but who knows. I hope to see some other players some day.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f0/9f0a776fd811ef2dd8f643da34d93eda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Snownebula"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
