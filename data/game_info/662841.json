The cursed place is called \"Timber Views\" and you follow the narration of the fellow journalist - Tim Manson, who might or might not survive this trip.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This short experience was made especially with the use of Power-Point and for the game jam, which had the requirement to use only black and white colors. The project, with it's design, sound and story was created in less than 2 hours.\u00a0<br/><br/>In the future, there might not be any updates, but if you are interested, please, be sure to comment down below, ask some questions or maybe find out more about the lore. Thanks for checking out my work. Deeply appreciate the feedback.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T05:15:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2be/2be3d7f443fcb65f39e15b74f1ee4a5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Niven Hedinger"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
