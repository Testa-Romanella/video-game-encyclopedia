In Snaaake each pill (apple) you collect has a chance to mutate the game state, which can eventually lead to you losing control.<br/><br/>I would have added music but i'm not very music-savvy, enjoy!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Mutations</strong>:\u00a0</p>\n<p>- <strong>Time </strong><strong>warp</strong>: The speed of the game can get faster or slower.<br/>- <strong>Double </strong><strong>time</strong>: Every time you collect a pill, 2 more spawn.<br/>- <strong>Break walls</strong>:\u00a0Random sections of the map will break, allowing you to wrap around.<br/>- <strong>Glitch</strong>:\u00a0The screen becomes fuzzy and difficult to see<br/>- <strong>Change places</strong>!: Swaps a single axis of controls, Left becomes Right and Right becomes Left!\u00a0This is <em>hard</em> to balance and you very much lost control instantly, a bit unfair! Good luck!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Z: Start / Begin game<br/>Arrow keys:\u00a0Move</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T05:04:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c2/8c21b81cd9a7d5e431aa6b4c5e84aaa8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Syphonx"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
