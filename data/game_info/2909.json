Who sent it? And why? Impossible questions, but in them lie the key to humanity\u2019s survival.<br />\nNow, millions of miles away from home, a micrometeoroid storm has left us with a severely damaged ship, two deceased crew, and the sneaking suspicion this trip was doomed from the start.<br />\nTharsis is a turn-based space strategy game. With dice. And cannibalism. It puts you in control of humanity\u2019s first mission to Mars, just as it\u2019s struck by a micrometeoroid storm. You must guide your crew through disasters, food shortages,  and the unforgiving nature of space \u2014 all while maintaining your sanity amidst cryptic signals and warnings from Mars.<br />\nDefy the odds, make the difficult decisions, and embark on the most important mission in human history.</p>", "metacritic": 61, "released": "2016-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T12:03:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d8/3d815a4e2166a4abb2395b856dee33f2.jpg", "website": "http://www.tharsis.space/", "rating": 2.93, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 95, "owned": 940, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 21, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 36, "ratings_count": 44, "suggestions_count": 370, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 44, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "iOS", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Choice Provisions"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Choice Provisions", "QubicGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
