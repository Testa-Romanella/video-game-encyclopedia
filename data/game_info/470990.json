The player will be tasked with keeping themselves calm as they match notes to the beat. As the day progresses the notes will become more erratic, but if the player misses the notes the notes will become even more erratic simulating the overwhelming nature of anxiety. As players match notes they are able to help calm down and the notes become slightly less erratic. If players are able to complete the song without having a panic attack which is induced from missing so many beats they win.
