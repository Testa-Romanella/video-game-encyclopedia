Your goal is to collect enough glowing pumpkins or shoot enough glowing zombie hands to win!

Some objects aren't glued to the ground and with a little motivation from your left click, they will fly.</p>\n<p>Things I'd like to improve upon: more consistent lighting, better and more filled out levels, and utilize mechanics like alternate firing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T10:50:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f38/f38707f9a82cd2ad273b80554c3445f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["broomen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
