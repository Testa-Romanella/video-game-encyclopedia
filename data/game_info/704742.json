Here you have to build an economy and various defense towers to resist hordes of skeletons.<br />\nTo do this, you can choose various strategies, such as abandoning the economy to quickly build defenses, building up the entire map with simple but cheap towers, or building several, but very strong and strong improved towers.<br />\nWhen the towers cannot cope with the hordes of the rebels, or some cunning necromancer was able to slip through, then you can use various elemental super-strikes.<br />\nIn the game you will find many different levels, both in construction and visual, from steppes and glaciers to hell! And also plunge into a pleasant, but sometimes tense atmosphere, accompanied by a cute soundtrack.<br />\nGood luck to you, to prove to the rebels from the earth that we do not just live above them!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T14:33:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/120/1200a21d76a6b69798a73b163064ac12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Piece Of Voxel"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Piece Of Voxel"], "esrb_rating": null}
