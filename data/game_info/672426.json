For that reason, we decided to make one ourselves \u2014\u2014 That is why \u201cTouhou Monster TD\u201d was made.<br/><h3>A Tower Defense game with a Controllable character</h3>The classic tower defense game as a strategy game, in my opinion, is lacking immersion. It is boring that you can only click the button but cannot walk around the map and feel the world. In Touhou Monster TD, you can not only control the character to go anywhere in the TD world, but also jump everywhere, build everywhere, and carry around the combat unit. You can even use skill at the important point to finish extra mission for reward. <br/><h3> Unique Graphic Art Style</h3>Once exploring the artistic style, we found adding simple light effect with 2D object and 3D terrain is interesting. This \u201cPaper Cutting Style\u201d provides game a nice 3D effects, preserves 2D animes style and also presents\u201cKawaii\u201d feeling.  It is fun to watch our cute character carring other cute towers around. (Of cause, it can also save budget!)<br/><h3> Large variety of levels, enemies and towers</h3>Story Level + Extra Level + Challenge Level, meet the needs of all type players.<br/><br/>60+ enemies with different skills and attributes, want to break your defense \\:<br/>15+ combat units with different features, will unlock unique skills and effects when level up.<br/><h3>Travel the Gensokyo</h3>Every battle scene is designed carefully by heart, Hakurei Shrine, Magical Forest, The Human Village, Mist Lake, Scarlet Devil Mansion, Waterfall of Nine Heavens, Moriya Shrine, etc.<br/>Enjoy the wonderful environment of the Gensokyo is also a nice experience in the game, isn\u2019t it? <br/><h3>Touhou Project Fan Made Doujin Game</h3>This is a Touhou Project Doujin Game. Original by ZUN, developed by MyACG Studio.<br/>We make this game not for profit but for the indie game community we love.<br/>Considering the gameplay, the story of this game is independent from the original story, and we add some personal understanding of the Touhou Project into it. Therefore, you do not need to fully understand Touhou Universe before you play this game. <br/>We also add some popular memes from Touhou and Indie game community into the game, hope you can enjoy them.<br/>If you like our game and want to know more about Touhou, please support the original game by ZUN.
