What can you do ? Well, make them believe that your house is haunted of course !<br/>Small problem, you're just a regular human\u2026 So you must not be seen !</p>\n<p>You have 2 actions at your disposition :<br/>You can kill an ennemy when you're close to him, You just need to press \"A\" and he will be dead and once his body will be discovered, the intruders scared score will increase, but careful, it will make noise that attract them !<br/>Then, you can also vandalize a room, (shown by the room borders switching from green to red)  which also make noise and scare the intruders (orange circle), with \"E\".<br/>If you pass on the line of sight of the ennemy, game will be lost, so be careful !\u00a0</p><p>And to move, use your right click.<br/></p>\n<p>Known issues, too tired to correct them sorry :(<br/></p>\n<p>I had trouble with the pathfinding and colliders, objects may get stuck on wall and unblock themselves after a few sec.<br/>Another bug, the victory bar is fulled to some extent at the beggining.<br/>Another visual bug : The ray from line of sight go through the obstacle (but doesn't detect) . (Idk why it happen only on build, maybe something linked to raycast).<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0Also when it is game over, you need to restart the game.</p>\n<p>Made with unity and Inkscape for some basic sprite.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-16T03:38:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d86/d86c948f36e5bf41a11db66d7ffa359a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jonathanTIE"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
