Additionally, you can collect extra lives by grabbing <strong>four </strong>of any of the items which accompany these friends, namely:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p><em>L1 - Cups of Tea</em></p>\n<p><em>L2 - Towels</em></p>\n<p><em>L3 - Petunias</em></p>\n<p>But watch out for the three different types of Vogon who will seek to destroy you in the most unpoetic ways possible.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>JUST SURVIVE OR SEEK THE MAGIC 42!</strong></p>\n<p>This is a Shmup which is about tactics as well as blasting. If you seek <strong>the ultimate answer of 42,</strong> you'll need to avoid lasering your friends while keeping the Vogons at bay.\u00a0 Every friend lasered means <strong>points deducted from your final total</strong>... save <strong>10 friends</strong> and collect <strong>four bonus items</strong> on each level for a potentially perfect score.</p>\n<p>Each of the Vogon enemies (green, red and blue) has <strong>distinct attacks, behaviours and hit point totals</strong>. Learn these and you'll be halfway to an almost infinitely improbable victory over Life, the Universe and Everything.</p>\n<p>ALL feedback - positive and negative - very welcome...\u00a0 but\u00a0no Marvins please!</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p>Thanks to Lexaloffle Games for\u00a0Pico-8, a brilliant fantasy console for making retro games like this one:\u00a0https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php</p>\n<p>Big thanks to\u00a0Krystman's (https://krystman.itch.io/) amazing Shmup tutorials on the Lazy Devs YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/c/LazyDevs) and the community on the Lazy Devs Discord server.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to the Buchanan clan for playtesting and my wonderful wife for her patience - Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters are on me...</p>\n<p>*********************************************************</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T15:09:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8a/d8a67b2287fba20d2e854ec24b8f4608.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["notacious"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
