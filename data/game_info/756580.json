It is a frenetic party game set in a madhouse. Mix of point and click mechanics and use of cards. Real time strategy is vital to win as mental agility and reaction time will be tested to have any chance of winning at this game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn the asylum of \u00a1Arre Unicornio! nothing is what it seems. There are different ways to win depending on the role card being played at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe mentally ill will try to escape from the asylum, the doctors will try to arrest all the mentally ill to keep them well controlled, and the rest of the asylum staff have existential problems. Each player pursuing their own goal until they change sides.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBut to have any chance of winning you have to move fast, be very smart and be attentive to many things while the rest of the players drive you crazy with an arsenal of diseases and dodgy treatments they can throw at you, among other things.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCourage! And do not lose your mind in the attempt.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T03:31:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15d/15d95c2cd472308e914c8d4ac1763493.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Clygames"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Clygames", "Cerebrer Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
