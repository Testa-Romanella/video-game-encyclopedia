Fight monsters, acquire gear and find your way out of the prison in this exciting dungeon crawl.</p>\n<p>This is the first game I have developed using my revolutionary pixel art game engine, developed to emulate the look and feel of old console games, mainly for the easy of creating content for it. All the art and music was done by myself, and the contents of the assets folder are under\u00a0CC BY 4.0. The source code is open source. Visit the Github project to access it:\u00a0https://github.com/prdepinho/simple-rpg-engine/tree/flee_or_fight</p>\n<p>This game is based on the board-game Fight or Flee from Fabio Medeiros, also known as Master Peroxido. The annexed PDF contains the original rules, which I have followed as close as I could, allowing for creative freedom. Please, follow Fabio's Youtube channel:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy3zb3S_7jv274Y1NacgO6A</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T04:54:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed8/ed8b359f5c804b18fbe1cb0ffbe6aa79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["paulo.pinho"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
