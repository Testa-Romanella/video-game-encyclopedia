Thanks to PICO-8 for a great development environment :)<br/></p>\n<p>You pilot The Orville to fight one Krill ship after another, each one shooting faster at you than the one before. X or Z to fire, up and down to move your ship. Try to see how many levels you can make it through.<br/></p>\n<p><em>-----------------<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Note: This is very much a fan made game. I don't own the rights to The Orville which is why I have the \"purchase\" set to none at all. I just want to share a game I made and that I've also had fun playing. Hope you all enjoy it as well. :)</em><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-28T05:29:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5c/d5c76b11fdccbcf007c6339c50250c0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Phillip J Rhoades"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
