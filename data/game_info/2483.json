{"id": 2483, "slug": "table-top-racing-world-tour", "name": "Table Top Racing: World Tour", "name_original": "Table Top Racing: World Tour", "description": "<p>Table Top Racing: World Tour is a racing simulator with the emphasis on its cartoon-ish style of toy cars. The genre is already well-established, and the game continues to use ordinary mechanics for entertainment and replayability.<br />\nThe player can choose between different upgradeable cars, and compete in four different championships. Each map is a racing track in an utterly non-racing environment, such as a kitchen table, children\u2019s playroom and so on. Different race types make the player consider his car of choice, as well as the upgrades, for the challengers are vicious and always tries to utilize every card in their sleeve against you.<br />\nThe game also features a multiplayer mode, where up to 8 racers can compete with each other on various race tracks, for glory or fun. The soundtrack and the graphics style gives the game the look of a real racing simulator while keeping the setting of toy cars, which allows the players to immerse themselves in the high octane world of Table Top Racing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-10T15:36:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/097/097f489f2bea1b5e77aebfc487cec647.jpg", "website": "http://www.ttr-worldtour.com", "rating": 2.58, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 76, "owned": 1472, "beaten": 37, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 147, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 176, "ratings_count": 243, "suggestions_count": 397, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 243, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One", "iOS", "PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["Playrise Digital"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Playrise Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
