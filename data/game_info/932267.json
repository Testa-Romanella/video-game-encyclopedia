The item collection theme for the jam was revealled at kick-off!<br/></p>\r\nCollection Item: The Western Front Violin\r\n<p>The Great War brought many tragedies and horror across Europe, and many lives were lost in the destruction. Despite the destruction, there is still hope, there is still life. War can be crafted into peace whilst never being forgotten. </p>\n<p>Memories in melody is a jam game about carving a violin while revisiting memories of world war one. This game was inspired by The Western Front Violin (\u00a9 IWM EPH 709), crafted in 1983. Its wood was carved from trees growing on former battlefields of the Western Front in France and Belgium. The trees were found to be more than 80 years olds, their roots surviving the devastation of the First World War. </p>\n<p>This instrument was inspired by Kenneth Popplewell, a professional violinist and was used as a memorial to those who died during the war. Lent to the Imperial War Museum, the violin was frequently played at commemorative events at the museum, including on Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday. Following Popplewell\u2019s death, it was donated to the museum.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>Click Mouse (LMB)</strong> move the mouse while clicking to carve<br/><strong>Middle Mouse Button</strong> to rotate the wooden block<br/></p>\r\nCredits  \r\n<p>Cam - Game Design &amp; Narrative<br/></p>\n<p>Robyn - Production &amp; 3D Art</p>\n<p>El - UI Art<br/></p>\n<p>Rosia - UX Design &amp; 3D Art <br/></p>\n<p>Lars - Audio <br/></p>\n<p>Ross - Game Design &amp; Programming</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T15:54:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c45/c4530b248d8d63e887ef547f1d223428.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Robyn", "Rosia", "Cameryn", "roseygoold", "caesarinohs", "Lars Betting"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
