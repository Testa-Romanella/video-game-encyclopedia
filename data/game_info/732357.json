You will have to make a word from letters you picked up and use that to deal damage to your enemy while also dodging their attacks.<br/>To save the game in Campaign Mode, you need to go to the settings, copy the level's code and save it locally on your computer (Maybe save it to a .txt file). Later on, if you want to continue the game, press the \"Load\" button and paste that code in.<br/>The green flag will RESET your game, it's NOT a go to menu button. Use it only after you won your current game or you saved the level's code.\u00a0 The resume/play button is self-explanatory. The red stop button will just stop the game and you will have to reset it using the green flag.</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<p>BinDat: Programmer &amp; Vector Graphic Artist</p>\n<p>KhiemGOM: Programmer &amp; Story Writing</p>\n<p>timdoodle: Primary Artist</p>\n<p>anasianboii: Sound Producer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T15:29:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/297/2972b8c3999806e322d5f691abe3db72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KhiemGOM", "BinDat", "anasianboii", "TimDoodle"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
