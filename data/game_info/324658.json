Select a celloplant with the number keys (1-6)\r\nand click on a soil patch to plant it. \"Water\" it with\r\ncello sounds using the Music Beacons (they look like trees). Left\r\nclick on a Music Beacon to start the growing process. Right click to\r\npick up and right click again to drop it.</p>\n<p>Use WASD to move and the mouse to look\r\naround. Use the number keys, scroll wheel, or the arrow keys to\r\nselect an item. Press ESC to open the menu.</p>\n<p>Use the information tool (7) and click\r\non something to get more information about it. Use the shovel tool\r\n(8) to remove a celloplant by clicking on the soil.</p>\n<p>If you're having problems with planting make sure the reticle in the middle of the screen is lined up with the object you want to interact with.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Info</strong></p>\n<p>Created using Unity and Wwise.
