You are a small cave nymph on a mission to stop\u00a0 the crustacean invasion that threatens your fairy homeland. Explore the island's randomly generated maps and drive the crabs out by challenging them in demanding turn-based battles. Interact with your environment and the characters you meet to obtain randomized loot, upgrade your skills and equipment, and ultimately learn the truth behind the march of the crabs.</p>\n<p>Featuring an original soundtrack\u00a0 by music producer Ben Quadnozzles with \u00a0over 70 compositions in  styles ranging from minimalist techno to explosive hip hop beats.</p>\n<p>This project is very much a work in progress, and some features are sure to be broken or incomplete. It may be best to think of it as a fully-featured demo in the game's current state, but the build posted here is completely playable and in active development.<br/></p>\n<p>You can find more gameplay videos and information on Crab Battler 2's Twitter page, and I've put together a playlist of short videos showing off some of the game's features and music on YouTube.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T18:23:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37f/37fd67ff1c30f65621a1232c924279e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ari Waggener"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
