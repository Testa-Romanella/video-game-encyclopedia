Currently the only thing stopping it from being ported, is ALL the ui needs the motion controllers and there is nothing to control the camera. But the gameplay controls themselves still function as I tested a ton on my laptop.<br/><br/>This game is a parody of the game Tetris, and our spin off is that it's 3D, I won't lie to you, the game itself is very easy, I had ideas how to fix that, and maybe with another week I could have, but with only 1 programmer(me) who had 0 experience with VR. I'm still proud I made something playable.</p><p>Noted,\u00a0there are ton of bugs, and timings and things I wanted todo, but never got around to doing them.<br/>\u00a01. The VR version is massively darker than the viewport and preview, no clue how to fix<br/>2. Animations and timings are wayyy to long.<br/>3. The game quickly becomes boring, since tetris in 3D is way easier. (Solution found, but never got a chance to implement)<br/>4. Many more features and animations I wanted to add.<br/>5.
