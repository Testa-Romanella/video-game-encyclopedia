Armed with his trusty, year old santa hat, he embarks on a rampage against anything winter, in hopes to send a message to the gods of retail.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Prinplup hasn't been very cautious with his life savings, so he only has one coin to work with. One measly coin. So he must be frugal with what he buys. Will it be an extra santa hat, for protection? A clock to slow down time? A snowball cannon? Who knows? It all costs one coin!</p>\n<p>Also, watch out for the devil penguins. Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-06T00:01:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/876/87658a9b3e2b10a141c39aa3a5ed86cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["FlashViper"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
