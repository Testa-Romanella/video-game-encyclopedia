With what time I had to work on this, I dedicated most of it to coming up with a smaller HP and damage based battle system, along with learning and experimenting A LOT with action sequences in RMMV.

Either way, I hope that you enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T18:04:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5de/5de0d4c462ffb64f68fb39617a1a2581.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["raptor9999"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
