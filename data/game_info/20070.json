Each army attacking you has its own strenghts and weaknesses, you have to know them to succeed!Strategy:Choose carefully which Island to invade, spy on the enemy to evaluate his forces. In Yrminsul, your opponents try to reclaim the islands you control. You will have to defend your territory from your enemies' sneaky attacks. At the same time, you will invade their Islands.

The infamy is your potential evilness and allows you to build defenses, to research new towers and spells, to spy on your enemies....
