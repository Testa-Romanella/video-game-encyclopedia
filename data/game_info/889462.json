Well, it's quite simple. You are a construction worker trying to climb your way to the top of the ladder. The catch is that this construction worker <strong>reaaally</strong> loves birds. And birds love\u00a0him too. That's why you need to avoid them at all costs. Good luck!</p>\n\n<p>Everything you see and hear in this game is made by me. You can show me some support by taking a minute and following me on my socials, listed in the <em>Community</em> menu. Thanks.</p>\n\n<p>Game made for Tailfeather Studios' Game Jam, and\u00a0maybe I will update the game in the future, who knows?<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T18:45:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d1/0d1cde3e17d7dd583fbdb0478cc8840b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["foxgamer201707"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
