It sports a playfield dotted with holes, simulating the bubbles of a big glass of frothing, ice cold beer. On each stage, one of the holes will light up, and using a joystick on either side, you tilt a metal bar to maneuver a ball into the right hole. If you hit the lit hole, you move on to the next stage.\u00a0To see the old arcade in action, check out this youtube movie:\u00a0</strong></em></p>\n\n\n<p>Today, in 2019, Megastyle proudly presents a digital version of this great classic, especially made for the Commodore 64 Personal Micro Computer. To enjoy this game, you will need either two joysticks in each port, a joystick and keyboard, or you can play it using the keyboard only.</p>\n<p>Tilt the bar back and forth to nudge the ball into the lit hole, while avoiding the others. When the ball is deposited, the ball and bar return to the bottom of the playfield, and the next target lights up.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>Press SPACE to start the game<br/>Joystick port 1 or keys Q+A controls the left side of the bar<br/>Joystick port 2 or keys\u00a0 P+L controls the right side of the bar</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/>Ice Cold Beer c64 was made by Jamie Fuller.<br/>All graphics and music made by Roy Widding.<br/>Developed by Megastyle in 2019<br/><br/>The game is our contribution to the RGCD 16k Cartridge competition in 2019.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-01T04:34:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8f/f8f7c209dd01695a0de58258cfc757a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Megastyle"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
