So I put it up here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I no longer have the original project files and I only found the Mac version on the drive... sorry, macs only.<br/></p>\n<p>To the 9.57 of computer\u00a0users who use macs,\u00a0<em>(yes I looked it up)\u00a0</em>keep in mind that this game is short, stupid, buggy, lacks an incredible amount of polish, and was made around the same time that I made the nightmare that is The Very Hungry Snake.</p>\n<p>...but at the same time, it's <strong><em>free</em></strong>.</p>\n<em>Do you have Catalina and it's not letting you open the app?</em>\n<p>Well here's how you can run the game:</p>\n<p>1. Right click on the app and click \"Open Package Contents\"<strong>.</strong></p>\n<p>2. Open up the folder titled \"MacOS\".</p>\n<p>3. Open up terminal and type:\u00a0\"chmod +x \"</p>\n<p>4. Drag in the file from the MacOS folder into terminal after the line you typed.</p>\n<p>5. Press enter.</p>\n<p>6. The file in MacOS should now be an executable file and the app should open normally now.</p>\n<p>If Catalina is still giving you trouble and saying that this is from an unauthorized developer...</p>\n<p>1. Open System Preferences</p>\n<p>2. Click \"Security and Privacy\".</p>\n<p>3. Click \"Open Anyways\" at the bottom.</p>\n<p>Hopefully Apple fixes these issues in the next OS.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T05:08:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c0/9c0470265e37ba44b286e7c84806c5a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["datoneguy246"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
