But be careful! The same ghosts and monsters will prevent you from finding the cherished dolls.<br/><br/>The gameplay mainly consists of finding dolls in an abandoned city, inside its houses. The dolls will appear randomly each time, so the game can be replayed many times.<br/>But ghosts and monsters will change their location not only with each restart, but also throughout the game, which somewhat complicates the search process. Since the ghost may appear in the most unexpected place.<br/><br/>However, ghosts are not as scary as monsters. The main thing is not to come close to the ghost and not look at them for a long time. But the monsters will chase you until they catch you!<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T02:09:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/405/405a545fa7c0c967e738a1adf12c75a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 272, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Soer Game"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Soer Game"], "esrb_rating": null}
