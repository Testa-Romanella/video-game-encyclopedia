Jump from platform to platform to reach the teleporter at the end of the 3 levels, and if you can, collect the coin on each level, either hidden or hard to reach. Once you've done that, do it again!</p>\n<p>This was a small project i worked on for about 4 days just to see what i could do with the Unity game engine. It turned out just how i'd expected, however i've decided to build upon it just a bit more before i leave it alone.</p>\n<p>Huge thanks to the youtube channel Brackeys for his videos that got me started on making unity games!                                              www.youtube.com/brackeys. And, of course, Unity for allowing me to make games and providing the skyboxes.</p>\n<p>(And no i didn't download his game and edit all the textures).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9f/d9f43ac81c497f1946896ff5593bfbca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["geebee299"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
