Activate the failsafe and escape the sponge before you're microwaved and die!</p>\n<p>My first \"completed\" game, for the Random Wikihow Jam. My prompt was \"How to Clean a Sponge\" <br/></p>\n<p>CONTROLS: Arrow keys to navigate. I to open inventory. Click and drag items from the inventory to solve puzzles.<br/></p>\n<p>Made in Construct 3. Less than 5 minutes to beat. Features (poorly) hand drawn art by yours truly.<br/></p>\n<p>I wasn't able to get the key and lightbulb to display in the inventory for some weird reason and I ran out of time for the jam before I could fix it - just picking them up is enough to solve the puzzle/unlock the door.</p>\n<p>Bubble sfx by snottyboy, Microwave sfx by SPANAC.
