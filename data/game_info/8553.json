Are you smart enough to outwit a giant snowman? How about a half-witted ogre? Along the way, you'll meet a host of colorful characters, from Stumpi the treasure-hungry dwarf in the Fortress Underground to the bossy Mr Chow in the Mystical Pagoda. They will all have plenty of advice - some of it might even be helpful!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou will discover hidden paths with a magical lantern and create your own with a well-placed bomb or two. In one moment you'll be dodging between boiling lava and Fire Golems, and in the next sliding perilously over sheets of ice \u2013 just be sure not to fall to your doom into the bottomless abyss. You will need to transform into a troll to move heavy objects, a bat to fly across deep chasms, and a frog to squeeze through tiny holes. But how will you avoid the deadly gaze of the Eye-Spy that can turn you to stone in a blink? Drink a handy potion to shrink to a fraction of your size or perhaps sneak past by possessing a nearby ghost.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour options are only limited by your genius.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:15:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/200/200954d72e585b06f4d2d2b4896df6a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 8, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 25, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 317, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox One", "macOS"], "developers": ["Runestone Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Runestone Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
