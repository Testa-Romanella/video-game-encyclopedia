Or it would be if I'd finished, at the moment it's just pawn&gt;rook&gt;knight&gt;bishop&gt;queen&gt;king&gt;repeat.</p><p>You get points for taking pieces and clearing boards.</p><p>===</p><p>Anyway I suffered a pretty wicked allergic reaction yesterday and this game lacks AI + a couple of other features so this is an unfinished game uploaded for prosperity's sake.
