Divorce is unfortunately, quite pervasive throughout modern American society. In 2020, the amount of divorces that occurred was nearly 40% of the amount of marriages that year.\u00a0While the rate for first marriages is 40%-50%, second marriage statistics show this increases to 67% for second marriages and a whopping 75% for third marriages.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Growing up in a divorced household, there was always tension amongst my parents. There was also contention and worry about money around my house. I wanted to create a game that takes you through this journey growing up as a young kid in a divorced household. I want you to not only experience the implications of financial hardship, but emotional hardship as well. Different choices you make which determine your parent's actions have varying emotional and financial implications amongst your parents and how you and they interact with each other.\r\n</p>\n<p>I did research involving divorce statistics, emotional implications that divorce has on child development and familial development, financial implications of divorce, and long term impacts. All of these topics helped to inform the creation of my narrative from both an emotional standpoint and chronological story standpoint.\r\n</p>\n<p>Navigate through to see the different familial outcomes based on your parents decision making.\r\n</p>\n<p>Enjoy!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T05:59:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a92/a925f40668dcece6536475f1c1ed9b93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["zachshec"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
