Created for the GMTK Game Jam 2020 under the theme \"Out of Control\".\r\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Forward (<em>automatic - out of your control</em>)</li><li>Face towards the left (left arrow)</li><li>Face towards the right (right arrow)</li><li>Jump (space)</li><li>Gotta go fast (up arrow)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>General Aim and Help</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You spawn as a new waiter ready for your shift. You're facing the stern (back) of the ship. Your aim is to pick up the cakes in the food hut at the stern of the ship (by going close to them) and take them to your customers sat at tables towards the bow (front). Walking (or falling) behind or on your customers will place a cake in front of them. In exchange they will grant you tasty points. But it looks like the sea is getting a little bit agitated...</p>\n<p><strong>Other Information</strong><br/></p>\n<p>While I thought it would be a rather simple concept to explore, physics interactions took a fair while to get right. Thus polish time was cut down. Presented here is a raw, \u00a0but somewhat functional game.<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0Thanks go to the following for providing free art to make up for my inability to draw:</p>\n<ul><li>Aniket Chowdhury from Pixabay</li><li>Digital Designer from Pixabay</li><li>\u00a0maja7777 from Pixabay<br/></li><li>DarkWorkX from Pixabay<br/></li><li>Clker-Free-Vector-Images auf Pixabay<br/></li><li>Icons made by Pixel perfect from www.flaticon.com<br/></li><li>Ron Porter from Pixabay</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0Thanks also go to various creators of free assets in the Unity Store.</p>\n<p>This game's code was created entirely by myself and is my third attempt at making a game. While I thought 48 hours would be plenty, when one is not a game designer it is a little bit tricky.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T03:07:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a43/a432f20cf149144ef316562d8faf360b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mjpcollins"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
