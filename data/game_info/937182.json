{"id": 937182, "slug": "pikachu-jumps-and-dies", "name": "Pikachu Jumps and Dies", "name_original": "Pikachu Jumps and Dies", "description": "<p>Hey guys, did you know that in terms of Water-Type Pokemon and teambuilding versatility, Vaporeon is my favorite Pokemon? Not only is it in the Field egg group which allows for an amazing egg movepool, Vaporeon has a Base HP of 130 and Base Special Defense of 95, which means they\u2019re bulky enough to be able to handle special sweepers and with their impressive Base Stat for HP and a comparatively solid Base Defense, this means they can tank rough attacks.</p>\n<p>Due to their singular Water typing, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that a minmaxed Vaporeon would be incredibly bulky. So bulky that you could easily switch on prediction for turns without getting swept. They can also learn the moves Wish, Substitute, Heal Bell, Toxic, and Scald, along with having Haze to prevent setup, so it\u2019d be incredibly easy for one to tank for your team. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover damage with enough strategy. No other Pokemon comes close to this level of versatility.</p>\n<p>Also, fun fact, Vaporeon has the highest HP Stat of all Eeveelutions. Vaporeon is literally built to tank on switch. Rock-solid Defense stats + high HP Pool + Acid Armor means it can take attacks all day, all shapes and sizes, and still come for more.</p><p>It's a good ending, don't check bad one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T11:13:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5bf/5bfb6522b0075eb45c03430bc0be76a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pikachudev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
