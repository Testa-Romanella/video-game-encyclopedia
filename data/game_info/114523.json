Why not? Because everywhere you go, poisonous moss grows!</p>\n<p>There are three difficulties to choose from. Here's what each difficulty setting does:</p>\n<p><strong>Easy:\u00a0</strong>moss only grows beneath you. Not on walls or ceilings.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Normal:\u00a0</strong>Moss grows everywhere that you touch.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Hard:\u00a0</strong>Almost the same as normal mode, except if you touch one side of a block, the entire block gets covered in moss, instead of just the side you touched.<br/></p>\n<p>There are 20 levels in the game. I wanted to make about 10 \u00a0more, but didn't have enough time. Sorry!</p>\n<p>Also, for some reason I decided to make it look like you were playing on a kind of GameBoy ripoff. There is absolutely no reason for this. I just did it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anyways, I hope you enjoy the game!\u00a0 Happy Jamming to all. :O</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>PS: SAVING WILL BE ADDED POST-JAM</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>and a quick edit: fixed a part of the end screen where the text overlapped. :&lt;</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54c/54ca60c8cbc379e03921b939fb8a5c53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Toffie"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
