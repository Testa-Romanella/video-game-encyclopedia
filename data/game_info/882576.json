Dissimilar to that, the pawn here can attack diagonally in all four directions. There will be a shadow to indicate where the next pawn is going to be placed. If a pawn had a chance to attack you, they will do it without waiting for your turn. You have 2 seconds to move every turn</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>Note :</strong>This game was made for 20 Second Game Jam", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T18:41:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04e/04e97c8d10ec52dadf62b623bc7ccff7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ramjing"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
