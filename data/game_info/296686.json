It is my first finished game made entirely from scratch. You play as a wizard trying to escape a tower (which only has 1 floor for now) and you can cast spells to kill the evil ghosts that stand in your way. More detailed instructions and controls are in-game. Enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T04:18:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a2/6a27fda4851914513cdb0d78ad63f6e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["silviu27"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
