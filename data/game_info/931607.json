In this publication the player is steering two heroes simultaneously with common buttons but with different movement speeds. The goal is to collect as many coins as possible in limited characters' lifespan. Characters cannot go too far from one another or otherwise they will hit spikes on screen edge. Once the game begins to feel too easy, try to increase difficulty in game options! Randomly generated worlds in the game are infinite! Good luck with maximizing your highscore!</p>\n<p><em>This game was created for Nokia 3310 Jam 5</em><em>.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T10:48:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f6/4f6c7a6251348bea04a8d5fb35386305.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mikulus"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
