Build world you can imagine and destroy anything you create.<br/><br/>You can throw asteroid into the building, crush it, set it on fire, or smash it with bomb explosions.<br/><br/>Tornado, sand storm, black hole, tsunami, zombie apocalypse, nuclear explosion, and many many more!<br/><br/>Explore open levels or you can build your world. You can import voxel models and create your cube world. Just came across an awesome resource that I wanted to share with everyone. Mike Judge created a GitHub project that contains a set of 400 free voxel models for creating artwork and games. You can check out the pack and the included license by following the link below: https://github.com/mikelovesrobots/mmmm#mini-mikes-metro-minis<br/><br/>Play, destroy, and have fun!<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T03:44:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c6/4c6410c1e147911774a05e10821f7159.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 241, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Zhang Fan"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Zhang Fan"], "esrb_rating": null}
