Enjoy!</p>\r\nGame Summary\r\n<p>In FenMire, you will play as Fen, a small forest spirit, searching through an eerie mire in search of symbols that, once collected, can be use to open gates leading to new levels. These symbols will be hidden throughout the game, blending into the games environment, encouraging you to explore in order to find all of them. There is a set number of correct symbols to collect in each level that increases in amount the further in the game you go. Collecting the wrong symbols will trigger enemies called Wendigo to spawn that you must deal with before continuing.<br/></p>\r\nArtist Links\r\n<p>https://snarknsarcasm96.itch.io/fenmire</p>\n<p><em>A game by Liz Secoy &amp; Cameron Minter</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-03T04:43:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2f/d2fcd498ff34a81836c88b25a2fc7678.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ccadgameart"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
