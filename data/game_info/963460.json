There are also chain combos to clear a bunch of charms at once, and the occasional supernova explosion to blast away even more. Play gets tricky at higher levels and requires quick thinking and reactions. There are 50 built-in levels and a level editor in case you want to add more.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-17T03:16:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ef/0ef163ada621316bd341159c65edc973.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Harmonic Wave"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Harmonic Wave"], "esrb_rating": null}
