The game has a ton of problems that were left in to simulate a child's creation, so please take that into account as you play.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I stole, like, a TON of assets for this game so please look at the README to see what they were and take interest in them instead of my game. And then read further and find my inspirations and please check them out instead too.</p>\n\n<p>WARNING: has some optional sexual encounters that are kind of out of nowhere as well as sexualization of enemies to an extreme degree. The point is to be made from the mind of someone who doesn't understand why they like sex but puts it in the game anyway but if this turns you away from playing I understand.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>Originally on gamejolt:\u00a0https://gamejolt.com/games/santaadventure/309114</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e5/7e574261493b73ad43b92c412999535b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bigbadoneechan"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
