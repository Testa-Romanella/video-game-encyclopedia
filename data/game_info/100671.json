It is going to be used to showcase the modular utility drone and its platform with as much functionality as possible to reflect their potential real-life usage. The deadline for a decent presentation is the 1st of December 2016.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis is WIP in progress work and just meant to test. It's in constant development too. Physics and handling need to be tweaked and more functionality needs to be added. </p>\n<p>Right now you can only fly around and test the <strong>FIRE EXTINGUISHER to</strong> see if you can extinguish the randomly placed (up to) <strong>twenty</strong> red-hot balls (no flying into them any more). \r\n\t<strong>:</strong>3<em>c</em>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe filesize is around <strong><em>68 </em></strong>megabytes now!
