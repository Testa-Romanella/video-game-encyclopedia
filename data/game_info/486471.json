Depending the how much care you give there are 5 different endings:</p>\n<p>Greedy: take all the care and give none.</p>\n<p>Caring: take and give all of the care.</p>\n<p>Full: take\u00a0 all of the care and give some.</p>\n<p>Careless: take no care.</p>\n<p>Misc ending: anything else</p>\n<p>Note: there is a glitch where you get 2 care from one heart if this happens it might break the endings so just press r.
