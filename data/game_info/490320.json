The audience could submit words/ideas which had to be used in the final game. It's full of community in-jokes and other insanity. \u00a0The goal was to \"finish creating a game in one sitting\", which was successful. Between the end of stream and uploading here, a few little Easter eggs were added. Good luck finding them!</p>\n<p>You can either play right in the browser on this page, or download versions for PC/Mac. The browser version runs a little slower but doesn't require a download.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T06:34:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb9/eb9bd445bd7d4acec301732a6d25731f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["stephengeorg"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
