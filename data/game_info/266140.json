You have traveled to the\u00a0mysterious, newly-built research facility, most of the devices and resources are still unpacked in big boxes around the rooms.\u00a0The chief scientist put a strange helmet\u00a0to your head. You have fallen asleep. While you were sleeping, an unidentified object crash-landed near to the entrance of the facility. The scientists managed to seal the door with wooden planks, but the aliens could somehow warp-in the room. They abducted the scientists and patrolling in the rooms wearing a strange electro-magnetic force-field to protect them. Since they only see the brain-waves of humans, they can't see you while your special helmet is on.
