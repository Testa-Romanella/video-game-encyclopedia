There is a barricade that will show a binary code when near, once you are near it just write the code either with numpad or normal numbers and hit return/enter once you are finished with it to check if it is wrong or right. If you want to reset the input you can also hit return/enter. Also, every bullet counts because you will start each level with the same amount you had from the previous one.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Audio\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li>OQLQO / \u00a0https://www.instagram.com/lucasmdla/\u00a0\u00a0</li><li>Kinemusic /\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/pablosekine/</li></ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Programmer\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li>KilThrall /\u00a0\u00a0https://kilthrall.itch.io/\u00a0</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Artists\u00a0\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Suniyun /\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/_suniyun/\u00a0\u00a0</li><li>SwimmableBee912 /\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/swimmablebee912/</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-22T02:36:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/540/5404ad5024ec0069d9358daccfa45e48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SwimmableBee912", "KilThrall", "Lucas Mar\u00e1ndola", "Suni Yun", "Kinemusic"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
