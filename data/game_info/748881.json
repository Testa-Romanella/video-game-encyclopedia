The first signs of damage will appear when\u00a0the durability decreases under 25%. After enough use,\u00a0a\u00a0weapon\u00a0will break completely (until a weapon's destruction, its durability\u00a0 won't change its performance/behaviour in any way).</p>\n<p>- destroying enemies with weapon shots will trigger a\u00a0damage buff for a few seconds. The effect\u00a0can be stacked.</p>\n<p>- enemies will be stunned for a few seconds (depending on the amount of damage received)\u00a0when hit by a thrown weapon or grenade. Stunned enemies will not follow the player and won't\u00a0explode if near the player.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T05:36:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/314/314bb7a37c0d74d0752b36c46bb76791.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thelegendofpit"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
