By doing this **all villagers benefit of the experience of the sacrificed villager.** Sacrificing strong warriors keeps your society strong and healthy. This is the only way to defeat the Demon Lords, which are permanently threatening the village.\r\n</p>\n<p>**Avoid loosing experienced villagers in fights against the demons!** By sacrificing them all of the society can benefit! And the sacrificed villagers will live on in the experience they pass to the other people. And once again new villagers will see the light of the day.</p>\n<p>**We made all assets by\u00a0 ourselves.**<br/>We used the **Unity Engine** as game engine and our small **recording studio** to create the music and the sound effects. We also used **Paint.net** to create the sprites.</p>\n\n\n<br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["SirMichel"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
