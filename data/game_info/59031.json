It changes due to the person's actions and affects his/her rights and liberties. Citizens with higher rating have more benefits, and zero rating means forced liquidation of the person.<br/><br/>Because of a technical error you have received a rating that was even below zero: -0.01. Theoretically, this is simply impossible, and now you \"do not exist\": electronic devices do not identify you, officials and public services refuse to deal with you because of a system error. Now you can't even buy food or pay for treatment.<br/><br/>Trying to obtain justice is useless, and the only way out is to hack the government server where the rating base of citizens is stored and edit the data on it. It's very difficult because the server is controlled by a quantum computer, and huge processing power is needed to overcome the quantum encryption. Your home computer is definitely unable to do this, so you need something more powerful.<br/>Features:<ul><li>Expand and develop a network of computers, decide when it is powerful enough to crack the quantum server;<br/></li><li>Use the power of your network to mine cryptocurrency, earning funds for further upgrades and improvements;<br/></li><li>Beware of the police and Cyber Control that can track down your suspicious activity and confiscate (or even burn) your equipment;<br/></li><li>As the story goes, it becomes even more complicated: you thought that its only your own fate that depends on your actions, but it suddenly turns out that everything is more global...</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce0/ce0169492d121f55b0c0eac2348e8047.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Dreambakers"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dreambakers"], "esrb_rating": null}
