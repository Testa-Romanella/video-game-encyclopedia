Also allow the use of certain orbs in specific places without the menu opening upon each use, should make it less annoying. Also, the face/Amelia.png issue has been fixed.<br/></p><p>v 1.2 - Pathing issue found in the final zone where the player is able to walk off the \"invisible path\" (how ironic...). The problem should now be fixed!
