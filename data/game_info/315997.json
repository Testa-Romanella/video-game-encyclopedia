A god of old, forsaken for centuries, reawakens to a future of neon wonder and vending machines. Drawn together by a dream, the two of you search for adventure and home in the city. But the world is a daunting place -- rogue spirits roam the streets at night, and a certain company will demolish anything that is a nuisance to their vision. Yet maybe, for the two of you, and for anyone who truly seeks it out; adventure, unlikely friends, and a beautiful view awaits around every corner.<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/><ul><li>A coming-of-age story about curiosity, home, and finding beauty in the world<br/></li><li>Action-packed combat system<br/></li><li>Optional side quests with lasting impacts<br/></li><li>(Approximately) 30+ unique mini bosses<br/></li><li>\ud83d\udc4c TIGHT \ud83d\udc4c platforming mechanics<br/></li><li>Gates<br/></li><li>Explore a gorgeous pixel art world<br/></li><li>Lots of potato chips and vending machines  </li></ul><br/><strong>A Message from Us</strong><br/>Alight is our first game made with a lot of love, punted psets, and Double Chin. It\u2019s a passion project that started as a spur-of-the-moment idea, but quickly grew into some much, much more than that. Everytime I see a new sight, or hear some new philosophy, all I think about is how it connects back to Alight. Working in between classes and across the country has been such a fantastic and hard time, but if you do something you love you\u2019ll never work a day in your life. Especially if you do it with friends you love. Alight tells a story that we really can\u2019t convey in anything else that a game, but it\u2019s one that really does mean a lot to us. We hope our game inspires you to adventure, be curious, and draw lots of fanart. We\u2019ve put our all into making a good-ass game, so we hope you\u2019ll give us a shot as we develop Alight!!<br/>-- Brickhouse", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:45:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/874/8746def84ba4c2ed0c22571e530dab1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 237, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Brickhouse"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Brickhouse"], "esrb_rating": null}
