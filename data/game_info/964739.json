With Man with Apple", "description": "You are a young robot athlete from the ghetto who wants to escape poverty and save your dog from hungry rats.<br/>In this game, you'll need to reach the top of the world using parkour. And then, you'll find yourself questioning, does this world even have a top?<br/><br/><br/>The realm of absolute absurdity and parkour! The world has taken a nosedive into complete madness, not that it was ever sane to begin with. But hey, this is your golden opportunity, right? Embrace the chaos, because who needs normalcy anyway?  In times of crisis, people talk about taking bold actions and decisive steps. But let's be real \u2013 that's terrifying!

Here, every object plays a crucial role, and only your knowledge of the world will help you uncover the truth. Or, you know, you can just play the game, damn it!<br/><br/>Attention! This is a tough game where you can lose all your progress. The average passing time is 40-100 minutes.<br/><br/>By the way, here's a set of dots (...............)
