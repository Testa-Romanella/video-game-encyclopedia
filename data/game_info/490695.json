Why am I here? Where do I go from here? <br/>The spine-chilling eerie spaces and your imagination will fuel your fear leading you to the realization that something horrible has happened here. <br/>Trying to hide from the undead will make your heart race and take your breath away, because you cannot kill what is already dead.<br/>In creating Deadness the emphasis was on the game looking as realistic as possible, <br/>including intuitive controls, naturalistic graphics and horror atmosphere.<br/>Just like in reality, on the wheelchair you can only move using your hands which control all the movements which makes the game feel even more realistic.<br/> <br/>You are going to feel utterly helpless. This game will give you nightmares...<br/><strong>This is no game anymore!</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-10T19:15:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f39/f392a5be3eddacd3284e249bfb3afdcf.jpg", "website": "https://deadness.sk/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 333, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ALIEN studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["ALIEN studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
