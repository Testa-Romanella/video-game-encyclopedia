This game is a mashup of ideas from our four programmers. Play as a metaphorical spaceship shooting their \"feelings\" to their waifu.\u00a0 Avoid the attacks coming from their inner consciousness and don't let your waifu's words hurt you. <br/><br/>The \"Out of Control\" aspect comes into play with this game in the following ways:<br/>1.\u00a0 When you shoot you lose control of your ship and take control of your bullets.</p>\n<p>2. The shot you shoot is randomized each time. Make sure to use the correct shot on the correct targets.</p>\n<p>3.\u00a0 The rules of the game change every couple seconds with \"laws\" that will appear on the top of the screen. A total of three \"laws\" can be active at a time. Laws can change how bullets work and can even change your control scheme. <br/></p>\n<p>4. Waifu is randomized each play-through &lt;3<br/></p>\n<p>Choose your ending by shooting out the specific \"feelings\" you have for your waifu!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T08:27:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af3/af3a98a5a117f62cee50c29d70fe3e81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["M0liusX"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
