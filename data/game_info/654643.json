One morning a note is passed under your door, and, after the disinfection procedure, you read it. \"Reggie\", a neighbor you've never met, is holding a competition to create the greatest collection of all. Welp, you haven't got much else to do.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Scavenge items, talk and trade with your neighbors, and form the greatest collection ever. You only have seven days to finish (note: we didn't program the ending. You can keep playing. It will eventually break. But you can have up to 4 chats with each character and they're fun folks.)<br/></p>\n<p>Amanda Rivera Stahlschmidt\u00a0- Art\u00a0 //\u00a0Website //\u00a0\u00a0Itch.io\u00a0 //</p>\n<p>Lily Connor - Story\u00a0 \u00a0//\u00a0 Website\u00a0 //<br/></p>\n<p>Lea Detlefs - Sound &amp; Music\u00a0 //\u00a0\u00a0SoundCloud\u00a0 //\u00a0 lea@stringwavstudios.com\u00a0 //</p>\n<p>Jonah Pulsipher - Programming\u00a0 //\u00a0 Website\u00a0 //</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T13:33:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac5/ac5abf1ccd668063bc05abade5e092f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jonah Pulsipher", "Air.Artist", "lilcelestial", "Lea_D3T"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
