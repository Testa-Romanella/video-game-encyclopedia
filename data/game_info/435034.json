During this time, the crowd\u2019s excitement level should not drop to zero. We have infiltrated our men into the bar\u2019s security detail. At your command, they will get rid of any upset fans. But don\u2019t overdo it! If you get rid of too many listeners (especially those that actually like your concert), there won\u2019t be any left, and you will be entertaining the pigeons.</p>\n<p>As the concert continues, your musicians will grow tired. Remember: a tired musician is a bad musician! Follow the audience\u2019s reaction closely. Some people may start complaining if they don\u2019t like how a certain musician plays. This is a perfect opportunity to send the tired band member to get some rest.</p>\n<p>Finally, remember the most important thing: Keep the concert alive!</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Control musician by clicking on his portrait.</p>\n<p>Click on comments to get rid of\u00a0listeners.</p>\r\nTeam\r\nNameRoleLudum Dare profileMatvey PoletinDevelopermatthewpoletinSevoush VinichenkoGame design\u00a0&amp; Technical artistsvinichenkoEvgenia KarovaPromo art-Vladislav ShelepenkoLocalization-Artemiy LeonovNarrative design-\r\n<p>If you would like to hear more from Andy Triffet and his quartett, subscribe to our twitter.</p>\r\nAssets\r\n<p>Art by\u00a0Evgenia Karova</p>\n<p>Animation by Dayana Fatkullina</p>\n<p>Audio by bensound.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T11:36:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7a/d7a4be3757b17ae511de496bd05f5cc8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Matthew Poletin", "svinichenko"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
