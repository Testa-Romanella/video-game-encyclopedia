After a knight destroys your village, it's up to you to avenge your people's death. Fight through persistent\u00a0grunts who are out hunting weak monsters. Prove to them that you are not just any foe. Your journey ends only when you kill the knight who crumbled your life. With simple knockback combat, the orc wields a short spear and a throwing spear. Utilize both of these weapons as you traverse across pits, spikes, and other obstacles. Maybe your weapons can help you platform as well.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T04:38:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33e/33ea09a1e8196aa0acd90f09f8faf23c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Baddie1350"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
