We weren't able to finish it but it is playable. It was going to feature an open world to fight your way through, interesting level design, and hacking mechanics, but we ran out of time and weren't even able to balance what we have or finish adding all of the animations/effects. To be fair, we started the jam with only half of the time left, and didn't spend every waking moment on it.</p><p>We may still finish this project at some point, possibly in a different form.</p>\n<p>The yellow bar at top of screen is your energy (HP).
