{"id": 784974, "slug": "brooklyn-brawl", "name": "Brooklyn Brawl", "name_original": "Brooklyn Brawl", "description": "<strong>What is Brooklyn Brawl?</strong>\n<p>Brooklyn Brawl is a game where players control rebellious teen wizards in magical free-for-all battles. With the recent illegalisation of magical practices in America, teens who enjoy flinging themselves around the city have been forced to limit their activities and hide their brawls behind a concealment spell, or risk being found by the cops. Being teens, it didn't take them too long to figure out how to throw a fireball, and after they reailsed how much fire hurt, magic shields also came about. The combination of a desire for destruction and a way to not die while causing it, brought about the game which <em>you </em>can now play: Brooklyn Brawl!</p>\n\n<strong>What do I\u00a0do?</strong>\n<p>In the game itself you participate in PvP fights where the goal isn't to shoot your opponent until they die, it's to launch them into the stratosphere using a variety of spells and skills. Each Wizard comes with their own pair of \"Agility Sneakers\u2122\", allowing them to stick to walls, run along them and double jump with ease. Players can chose the three spells that they go into combat with at the start of the match, allowing them to find what fits their playstyle and discover spell combos.</p>\n<p>Currently the game has\u00a0two distinct maps in which players can duke it out in: the Rooftops or the famous Brooklyn Bridge, with more coming in the future.</p>\n\n<p>The game demo also comes with a tutorial level where you can get accustomed to the controls and experiment with the power ups that are scattered about the maps.<br/></p>\n<p>At the moment there is only one game mode: Free for All. In Free for All, it's every wizard for themselves! Shoot fireballs and lay traps to increase everyone's knockback multiplier before blasting them out of the arena. Last one standing wins, or whoever has the most lives at the end of the time limit. Once the game is complete players will be able to change the game settings of their room before a match begins.</p>\n<strong>How do I do?</strong>\n<p>To get into a game, you can either host a match or join a friend's. (The demo version of the game requires devices to be on the same Local Area Network to connect to one another.) Once you're in, use the controls below.</p>\n\n<strong>Who made this?</strong>\n<p>We are Fat Cap, a student game development team from Falmouth University. There are only 6 of us who worked on this game, but we're happy with what we've managed to achieve.\u00a0 We wanted to create a casual, party shooter in the same way that Smash Bros. is a casual, party fighting game, which we hope you enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T14:59:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e98/e98506e57cd33ffc75e7ae7bf92731aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FatCap"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
