Other players in game also have the same goal, and probable malicious intent towards seeing another armed player on the battlefield. The winner is not the killer, but the savior. Find and take care of\u00a0the wounded soldier!</p>\n<p>Inspired by the \"Trench Fever\", also known as the Spanish Flu that rampaged across Europe during 1918, this game attempts to portray the dread felt in the deep, wet, maze-like trenches as combat medics had to heal their wounded, all while keeping in mind the necessity of safe distancing practices to avoid contracting the flu.</p>\n<p>It is a work in progress due to a large hiccup, but we plan to update soon!</p>\n<p>We hoped to add randomly spawning wounded and enemy\u00a0soldiers, and base the main mechanic of the game on how many soldiers a team could heal in 5 minute rounds. Unfortunately, we lost some progress in the last few hours and had to scale down. GitHub good, but sometimes GitHub hard.\u00a0We plan to add this functionality soon and will be updating it.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T07:28:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fdf/fdf590f40c8dc2214ce6a517d967e794.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pootpootpoot", "PootMoop Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
