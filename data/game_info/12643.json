It is a competitive skill based game that requires long term planning in order to achieve success.  90 Minute Fever is all about enjoying the experience and fully immersing yourself into the football management world that\u2019s been created for you, rather than subjecting yourself to a mundane daily routine to grind your way up a never-ending pyramid.  It is being developed by people who genuinely love football and football management games, and wanted to design and build a game for users to enjoy, rather than to bleed money out of them.  It is philosophically the polar opposite of the browser and mobile based online football management games that saturate the market today.\"<br/><br/><strong>Important note:</strong> This is an Early Access title that is still in development.
