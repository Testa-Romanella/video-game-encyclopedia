All is not lost, however, as you make your intention known to become the queen. It's not an easy path, and you will have to maneuver politically between the royalist Summer Party that support your cousin, the duke, and the Winter Party that seeks more power to the common noble. Not only this, you'll have to balance your influence among the general populace, the military, and even the church, if you are to win the coveted throne and become the heir.<br/><br/>Your trump card is the elf princess that was captured during the war and sent to you as a gift. Your goal is to train her and make use of her politically, as she may hold the key to making the difference between failure and success.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But all is not peaceful in the kingdom. If you make poor decisions, you may doom your kingdom to defeat by the vicious orcs that threaten the southern border. You may even end up as a prisoner slave in one of their camps, where you'll be paraded as a trophy and worse. In such cases, you will have to use all your ingenuity and skill to make your escape and change your fortune.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, if you're politically savvy and make good decisions, you can defeat the orcs and even enslave one of their leaders. Training a powerful orc to be your slave could raise your prestige and may offer your unique opportunities, both financially and politically.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>But again... if you make the wrong decisions, you may have the tables turned on you and find yourself becoming enslaved.<br/><br/>To sum, \"Mistress vs Slave\" is a mix of political sim with visual novel elements, coupled with role-playing, and sexual content.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T06:30:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a24/a24974dd7be5c1f9b4dd85efae24cbb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 309, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Noxurtica"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Noxurtica"], "esrb_rating": null}
