The mouse scroll allows zoom in/out.<br/>No guarantees on bugs fixed in this game because, like I mentioned, it was made in a day. Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/372/3722376e9b5fa765099c08cc73dd6111.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["speakupgames"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
