Unfortunately, the game was discontinued by it's creator during it's peak of popularity, leading to the rise of new fan made versions, many of which failed to translate the aspects that made this game so beloved while simultaneously exacerbating it's worse flaws.<br/><br/><strong>Zumbi Blocks: Revamped</strong> has the goal of bringing back the qualities of this popular game and trimming down it's main issues. The game has been made by only 2 people who were fans of the original game and dreamed of\u00a0creating a new version of it that could continue on the main creative ideas of the original while adding our own ideas, as long as they follow the spirit of the game. The game was also made completely <strong>open source</strong> so you can take your own look at the inside workings of it and use it to make your own version if you desire! Check the game's source code here:\u00a0https://github.com/Minhoquinha/zumbi-blocks-revamped<br/><br/>While we are definitely excited to show this game to you, we have been a little bit late as the creator of the original game, Adrian, has came back to create <strong>Zumbi Blocks 2</strong>! The game is still on the alpha stage and, just like it's prequel, has a very promising development start. To our luck, Adrian has chosen to diverge significantly from the path he planned for the first game, creating a new experience that is very different from the one we made for\u00a0<strong>Zumbi Blocks: Revamped</strong>. We have no ties to the development of that game, but we are none the less happy to see him coming back and wish him the best of luck.
