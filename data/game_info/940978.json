The corruption is thickest near the Great Stygian Abyss. It has been centuries since the Avatar rescued a maiden from its depths. Now the Barron of the land has put out a call to find the one who lives the Eight Virtues of the Avatar.\u00a0 Who will be brave enough to adventure through\u00a0the Stygian Abyss and discover the source of its corruption.</p>\r\nInstructions\r\n<p>You start at the entrance to the Abyss where you are safe and can familiarize yourself with the controls.\u00a0\u00a0You can find around you a light source, a weapon, and a bedroll, and some food. Each as important as the other.\u00a0Light sources will burn out over time making traveling the depths of the abyss harder.\u00a0Use the weapons you find to defend yourself. Bash, Slash, and Stab at your enemies as you make your through the abyss.\u00a0</p>\n<p>From your inventory [ <strong>Z</strong> ] use food to satiate your hunger and the bedroll to rest and regain your energy.\u00a0You will recover health if you are fed while you rest.\u00a0You will drain energy faster if starving or overburdened. Use [ <strong>X</strong> ] with an item selected in your inventory screen to drop it.\u00a0\u00a0If you are exhausted you are more likely to miss your attacks against enemies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Use Look Mode with [\u00a0<strong>V\u00a0</strong>]\u00a0to Look at yourself by clicking on yourself with the mouse.\u00a0The game log will display information about your current state.\u00a0 User [ <strong>V</strong> ] again to exit Look Mode</p>\n<p>You will come across Ankh Shrines on your adventure, stop at them and meditate to increase you skills.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you get lost you can open a map with [\u00a0<strong>P</strong> ].\u00a0 You can close any screen with the same button you used to open it.</p>\n<p>Defeat the Corruptor at the heart of the volcano on the 8th level of the Stygian Abyss to beat the game.\u00a0 Good Luck =D</p>\r\nOpen the menu from inside the game with <strong>F1</strong> or <strong>? </strong>to get to the help instructions, restart the game, or change settings.\r\n[Items]\r\n<p>Look around the Abyss and you will find items.\u00a0Grabbing any item will equip it, replacing the already equipped\u00a0item with the new item.\u00a0Armor includes light, medium, and heavy. Each tier increases protection without any detriment. Be sure to always pick up better armor when you find it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Weapons include blades, axes, and bludgeons.\u00a0Use your intuition when choosing a weapon and attack type. For example War Hammers have devastating bashing attacks, but have no stab or slash damage.\u00a0Use your intuition when choosing an attack on a creature. The Reaper is made of solid living wood, bashing won't be as effective as slashing and chopping. A Dark Knight in full plate will shrug off slashes.</p>\r\n[Magic]\r\n<p>You entered the Abyss with your rune bag and the right combination to cast a little light to help in your adventure. Search the depths of the Abyss for more powerful runes.\u00a0Throughout the abyss you will find notes and hints about more powerful spells you can cast.\u00a0 The deeper you go the more powerful runes you will find.</p>\n<p>To cast a spell open your Rune Bag with [\u00a0<strong>b\u00a0</strong>]\u00a0and use the mouse to select runes or type the first letter of the Rune on your keyboard to put them on the Rune Shelf.\u00a0Press the [CAST] button or [<strong>Enter</strong>] when you have a valid Rune combination to cast its spell.\u00a0To quick cast a spell from your Runes Shelf use [ <strong>n</strong> ].\u00a0You can have up to three active spell effects.\u00a0 On the right side of your Runes chart is the list of spells and rune combinations for this Abyss.<br/></p>\r\n[Movement and Camera]\r\n<p>The controls are more like a third person mouse look game than your traditional grid roguelike.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Movement and combat is still turn based and aligned to the grid but direction is important and you must \"walk forward\" with your character.\u00a0 You can aim the direction of your character with the mouse and press [ <strong>W</strong> ] to move forward and [ <strong>S</strong> ] for backward.\u00a0 [ <strong>A</strong> ] and [ <strong>D</strong> ] strafe like a regular mouse look game.\u00a0 If you want full keyboard control [ <strong>Q</strong> ] and [ <strong>E</strong> ] will snapturn left and right.\u00a0 You can wait a turn with [ <strong>X</strong> ].\u00a0</p>\n<p>You must be \"looking\" at an enemy to attack them. You can bump attack by walking into the enemy, or you can control your attack type with [ <strong>J, L</strong>] to slash, [ <strong>I</strong> ] to bash, [ <strong>K</strong> ] to stab, and [ <strong>M</strong> ] to shoot / reload your missile weapon.\u00a0 You can use [ <strong>U</strong> ] and [ <strong>P</strong> ] to snapturn to near\u00a0targets.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Use [ <strong>F</strong> ] or [<strong>Left Click</strong>]\u00a0near an item to pick it up or\u00a0while looking at a Shrine to meditate and level up your skills.</p>\n<strong>[7DRL 2023 Notes]</strong>\n<p>Down to the last hour I got a magic system in!\u00a0 The intention was to have the player learn the spell runes through the world by finding notes with the rune combinations but there wasn't enough time.\u00a0 So, the new rune combinations are printed beside the runes chart in the rune bag screen.</p>\r\n[Default Keys]\r\n<p>Walk forward with [ <strong>w</strong> ]<br/>Walk backward with [ <strong>s</strong> ]<br/>Walk/strafe left with [ <strong>a</strong> ]<br/>Walk/strafe right with [ <strong>d </strong>]<br/>Quick turn left [ <strong>q</strong> ]<br/>Quick turn right [ <strong>e</strong> ]<br/>Wait a turn with [ <strong>x</strong> ]<br/>Pickup items with [ <strong>f</strong>\u00a0]<br/>Bash with [ <strong>i</strong> ]<br/>Slash with [ <strong>j, l</strong>\u00a0]<br/>Stab with [ <strong>k</strong> ]<br/>Shoot &amp; Reload with [ <strong>m</strong> ]<br/>Quick cast spell with [ <strong>n</strong> ]<br/>Open Inventory Window with [ <strong>z</strong> ]<br/>\u00a0- Drop selected item while in inventory [ <strong>x</strong> ]<br/>\u00a0- Look At selected item while in inventory [ <strong>v</strong> ]<br/>Open Character Sheet with [ <strong>c</strong> ]<br/>Open Map with [ <strong>p</strong> ]<br/>Start Look/View with [ <strong>v</strong> ]<br/>Open Menu [ <strong>F1, ? </strong>]<br/>Zoom [ <strong>Mousewheel / Scroll </strong>]</p>\r\n[Acknowledgements]\r\nArt:\r\n\r\n<p>https://www.oryxdesignlab.com/home\u00a0Tiny Dungeon and Tiny Galaxy\r\n</p>\r\nEngine:\r\n<p>https://www.babylonjs.com/\u00a0BabylonJS</p>\n<p>https://ibgoge.itch.io/cobblestone-grime-arena-of-might\u00a0Codebase based on the improved 2022 7DRL entry.
