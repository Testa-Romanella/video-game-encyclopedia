However, as you were clearing out the last of the chicken invaders and were looking forward to a double chicken burger special at the space burger bar, the true scale of the problem became apparent: the first invasion was simply a precursor to the chicken's main assault! Their master plan now becomes clear: to invade each planet in the solar system and make sure that it is inhabited exclusively by chickens!<br/><br/>The time has now come to don your egg-repulsing helmet and make the biggest omelette you've ever made as you continue your adventure in the second chapter of Chicken Invaders: The Next Wave. Only you can make a difference. Will you succeed? Will the future of chicken burgers be secure? Or will you end up as part of the menu in a galactic chicken restaurant?<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Steam exclusive:</strong> Choose between original (chiptune) and remastered (orchestral) music<br/></li><li><strong>Steam exclusive:</strong> Unified analogue &amp; D-pad joystick support<br/></li><li><strong>Steam exclusive:</strong> Capabitliy to reassign mouse buttons</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-27T00:16:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/251/2518bea44d394e546efb82b040a5e3c9.jpg", "website": "http://www.interactionstudios.com", "rating": 3.78, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 41, "beaten": 14, "toplay": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 4, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["InterAction studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["InterAction studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
