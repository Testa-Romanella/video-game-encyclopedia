How far can you go?</p>\n<p>Pipe Dream is our first \"published\" game and\u00a0was created in two days as part of a private game jam. It is therefore highly unoptimized, in no way balanced and probably full of bugs and untapped potential. There are no options for visual quality, so your framerate might suffer on a low-end machine. Both macOS and Linux builds are untested &amp; experimental but they should work.</p>\n<p>Have fun, feedback is welcome!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T08:09:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/021/021ecadd067516675c328d516bc0f770.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Tadpole, Esquire"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
