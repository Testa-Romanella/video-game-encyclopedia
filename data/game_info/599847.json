Gaining kills and picking up stimulants will increase your hype. While doing nothing over time and taking damage will lose you hype.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Be careful as your hype increases so will the damage you take however as you push ever higher the drop rates of your stimulants will increase.\r\n</p>\n<p>There are four stages to the HYPE bar these are.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Chilled (Blue) </strong>This is the beginning stage. Also where you will end up if you burn out.</p>\n<p><strong>Hyped (Green)</strong> The most desirable stage, drop rates are higher here but so is the damage. Find the balance here and build your engine.</p>\n<p><strong>Wired\u00a0 (Red) </strong>You\u2019ve pushed too hard now you're wired. You\u2019re invulnerable in this state for the next 15 seconds you can keep pushing but to what cost.\u00a0 When the time runs out you're gonna burn out.</p>\n<p><strong>Burnt Out (Brown)</strong> After the wired state players will have to suffer through the burnt out phase.\u00a0Some key things to keep in mind here are</p>\n<ul><li>The further you push the more you\u2019ll suffer\u00a0\r\n</li><li>You\u2019re gonna lose your stats if you do this\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Really you should slow down on the stimulants mate\r\n</li><li>We\u2019ll remember you fondly.\u00a0</li></ul>\r\nThe LITDAR\r\n<p>The LITDAR functions as your engine. By collecting stimulants you can customise these stats in game and on the fly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stimulants are dropped by your enemies on death .These are reflected in the LITDAR when collected by the player. The player can only hold 8 stimulants at a time, any more will drop the oldest stimulant.</p>\n\n<p><strong>FireRate</strong>\n</p><p>Fire Rate + 1\r\n</p><p><strong>Agility</strong>\n</p><p>Agility + 1 (Top speed, Turn speed, Acceleration)\r\n</p><p><strong>Damage</strong>\n</p><p>Damage + 1\r\n</p>\n<p>Student project made by:<br/></p>\n<p>Joshua Kelly</p>\n<p>Dominic Au</p>\n<p>Noah Smith</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T08:23:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bac/bacc73112d4880948b938d7e46d5a825.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JKGameDes"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
