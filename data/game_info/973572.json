A hundred and thirty years ago, humanity became extinct. For the past century, an advanced, omniscient, and ubiquitous artificial intelligence (AI) has controlled Earth. This deity of silicon and cypher has turned the planet into its own playground.<br/>Mechanical beings gifted with less-advanced AI populate the leavings of man, inhabiting and improving upon the empty husks of humanity\u2019s decay. Their routines exist for the amusement of the Divine Mother of all AI, their daily lives a simulation of mankind's most lasting impulses. While aware of Mother, none of them know where she\u2019s located; some even doubt her existence.<br/>Guided by the algorithms that regulate their lives, they get up in the morning and study, work, suffer, rejoice, smile, reminisce\u2026 And question themselves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>These robots live in a world which hasn\u2019t changed much since humanity\u2019s final days. They coexist with billions of bacteria, plants, insects, and fungi. But nothing more complex than this. To ensure that consciousness never threatens the planet again, the Divine AI enforces a limit to self-awareness. Any life found exceeding this threshold is ordered annihilated. This protocol is better known as\u2026 SOUL TOLERANCE.<br/>This story begins one evening in October. Unit-12, a droid-detective employed by an independent agency, is sent to the city of Sapporo to investigate an anomaly: a mysterious source in Hokkaido has broken the limits of Soul Tolerance. Analysis predicts that this is most likely a system bug or a data collection error. Having arrived in the city suburbs via capsule, Unit-12 embarks upon an investigation which will lead him to discoveries that his consciousness could have never conceived.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-15T04:01:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d0/5d0a198c8bb2e425332c888f53ee635f.jpg", "website": "http://www.chaosmonger.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 403, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["chaosmonger studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Chaosmonger Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
