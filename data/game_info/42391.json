The project was closed in 2016, two years after the release in Steam Early Access, because of the lack of players. The story was set several years after the events of Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver ad followed the confrontation between men and vampires for the lands of Nosgoth.<br />\nThe gameplay was focused on class-based combat, where vampires, as a rule, used melee techniques and superpowers, and humans relied on guns, crossbows and other weapons. Additionally, every character had their own special abilities that determined their role during the match. There were two modes of the game. In Deathmatch one team needed to kill more enemies than the other. At the same time Flashpoint mode was focused on humans capturing certain points and vampires, trying to stop them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T13:09:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9d/c9d3512ecdc11a2da63dc8f6d5af1f80.jpg", "website": "http://nosgoth.com/", "rating": 2.51, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 33, "owned": 1124, "beaten": 20, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 68, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 80, "ratings_count": 120, "suggestions_count": 726, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 121, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Psyonix"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Square Enix"], "esrb_rating": null}
