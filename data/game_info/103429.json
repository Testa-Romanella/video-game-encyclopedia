{"id": 103429, "slug": "azusa-online", "name": "Azusa Online", "name_original": "Azusa Online", "description": "<p><strong>Introduction:</strong><br/>Hello, this is a\u00a0 game project I have been working on for years; Azusa is still in early open beta, but my main goal is to someday take it to steam; meanwhile everyone is free to test and get the game's experience; thats why I am inviting you.</p>\n<p>Azusa's universe was inspired by an old classic anime called Saint Seiya, however it has alot of it's original lore, basically its a world where humans and gods fight for the future of earth, humans wearing magical armors from Olympo that gives them super power enough to war against the gods and save or destroy the world. These humans are called \"Guardians\" and they are gifted such powers after competing in elemental arenas spread around the world. Hades rules over the underworld and with his army of Reapers (players that died and is now wearing the underworld armors) always try to come back and destroy the world as we know.<br/><br/><strong>How Roleplaying Works:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game was basically built to deliver the best roleplaying experience to its players, (roleplaying as in table top games)<br/>Where you first develop a character and everything your character says or does, really becomes a part of the global game story,<br/>giving the roleplayer a huge freedom to interact with eachother;<br/>The players can build cities, destroy them, customize npcs, and even become a new god!</p>\n<p>You can pick your character's starting age and basic background story, and as the time goes by your character will age and eventually die;<br/>Once your character have played for 60 years, (1 real life day = 2 years) you can play as a new generation, basically a descendant from your character,<br/>starting over with some few advantages;<br/>The game has a great catch up and roleplay rewarding systems, so that you can progress while roleplaying with your friends.</p>\n<p>The game's chats are seperated between OOC (out of character) and IC (in character;) the global red chat is always OOC (space to talk there) and the green one are what characters are saying, aka, IC. You can however use bracklets to separate IC from OOC aswell in the green chat. When you create your character it will be asked for a first impression description,<br/>which is basically how others will see you, but when you find out another character's name, you can double click him and set his contact and the name you think he is. That is pretty much how the game will display said character to you.</p>\n\n<p>Pressing B you can write down a roleplay emote which is basically a third person description of your characters action. This is to give freedom to the players to do things the basic game mechanic doesn't let you. (Like scratching your nose.) Usually roleplay emote is used for more important and exciting actions.<br/>As your character interact with others your roleplay log will increase, and every hour there are roleplay checks that distribute roleplay points to the best roleplayers, and those points can be used to get almost everything in game.</p>\n<p><strong>Classes and Trainings :</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Azusa relies alot in battles as its a game about wars between humans and gods, however its not limited toward only fighting. There is a huge civilian mechanic gameplay and you can also dedicate your whole gameplay experience as a master, teaching and training young ones prepairing them to become guardians. The way you play can vary completely depending on how you are developing your character.<br/>Classes are separated in a way to promote even more the player-to-player interactions as one class will depend on the other sometime. This promotes commerce and further interactions between everyone. Like for example, civilians are the ones that are able to create, craft, cook and build. This makes it so they are insanelly usefull in keeping the world progressing.Fighters on the other hand have better status gains rates which causes them to get stronger much faster. As for Masters, they can help others to grow stronger by increasing their status rates, also masters are capable of developing fighting styles that can boost their pupils critical, counter or combo rates.</p>\n\n<p>When you start your adventure, you will only know the very basic training methods, such as sparring other players, fighting animals, etc. and thats probably how you will progress for a while, however as you roleplay and interact with the other players you may learn a new training method from them. Alternatively you can spend 10 roleplay points to learn someone's method just by watching them using it. There are alot of training methods to be discovered/unlocked in game, and this opens a huge variety of possible roleplay and epic experiences while your character grow in this world.</p>\n<p>The training methods are first spread through ranked characters which are positions such as Grand Master of Heracles (one of the towns, it's a sort of priest-king of the city.) Those players starts with a training method and can teach to whoever they want, once someone learn it, that said person can teach to whoever they want too and this spreads fast like that.<br/>Ranks are important positions your character can get if he manage to obtain a certain amount of roleplaying points, and ranks are usually roles with alot of responsability and importance to the story progression.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Battle System :</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I will suggest you read our battle system guide, as I will talk about it very briefly here. It works with a mix of real time battle with turns/strategy, the battles can be really fast and dynamic, at the same time its organized to keep strategy and roleplaying importance; as each guardian armor have its own playstyle, techniques and pro-cons in battles;<br/>The turn ticks will wait a player to finish typing if he is roleplaying, this way the game while having exciting combats also gives spaces for some epical characters moments (like flashbacks) to make the fight experience as exciting as an anime's;<br/>And, at the same time, the turn system was designed to work fast as possible to be possible to have some real dragonball-like fast battles destroying an entire city!<br/>You will understand better reading its guides:</p>\n<p>http://www.azusarp.com/battle-guide<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Underworld :</strong><br/>\u00a0Afterlife is a very important concept in Azusa's universe, your character can, and will die someday, so its a big part of the game. The underworld is huge and you will have some fun adventure through its 8 jails and 16 valleys, based off divine comedy's hell (just inspired.) As your character suffers in the underworld of Hades, its expected for him to reach the nightmare world; (its a dimension experienced people go for trainings) and there, you can kill your good side to cease the sufferings (its a choice your character can make), if you really kill your good side, you will come back as a Reaper, with freedom to walk through the hell's jails and even go back to earth, if Hades sends you to the wars, and fight the ones who have once been your friends!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Final Notes </strong>:</p>\n<p>Before moving on with the project I wanted to invite a completelly diffrent playerbase, thats why I am inviting you guys; Azusa's players been helping me to test and play since the start of the project, and always getting the feedback of the same players doesn't work;\u00a0<br/>Before moving to steam and trying to sell the game, I will keep the free tests going on a little longer. Keep in mind I only covered the surface of the game's depth, theres alot of interesting systems for you to explore and I really hope to see you guys there;So, if you want to join:</p>\n<p>Controls and Interface Guide:<br/>http://www.azusarp.com/controls<br/><br/>Basic Starting Guide:<br/>http://www.azusarp.com/getting-started<br/><br/>Ordinary Guardian Armors Guide:<br/>http://www.azusarp.com/new-armor-guide<br/><br/>Guide to Azusa's Style of Roleplaying:<br/>http://www.azusarp.com/rpguide<br/><br/>Azusa's Discord Channel:<br/>https://discord.gg/FYsMm7g<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/975/975ebadef3d2ec5b5306245da146532c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 190, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Inutaishos"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
