Due to the current world situation, as you might have/have not heard of, we are of course working from home. However, this also means we cannot conduct our experiments at the university, and for that reason we really need your help!\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Remember to have your Quest connected to wifi!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>For this test, there is a minimum required play area size of 1.71x2.28 m^2. So if you have an Oculus Quest at home and enough space, we would appreciate if you would help us out. We also recommend you lower the guardian sensitivity for better immersion :)</p>\n<p>By the end of the test you will be asked in-game to give your consent for us to receive the collected data. We will not collect any personal data, and it will be completely anonymous. We only collect data like your play area size, gender, VR experience, and your answers regarding how comfortable you feel in the virtual environment.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you test it and have some additional comments, you can leave here:\u00a0https://forms.gle/FhMpgxrLurZN5SZ6A</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T07:15:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42d/42d5c8ed783a205162a84765bfd9ab46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mta201032"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
