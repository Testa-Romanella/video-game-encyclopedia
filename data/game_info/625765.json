Move and rotate different pieces to destroy the enemy with your laser!<br/>With a variety of pieces each having different advantages, abilities and weaknesses, use the one move you are allowed per turn to strategically bring you closer to victory. <strong>Enemy mirrors, Disruptors, Portals etc. can be used to your advantage! </strong><br/>At the end of every turn, you must shoot your laser... be careful not to hit your own pieces! <br/><h3>Strategy and rules</h3>To win, you have to destroy the enemy's king. Most pieces can move in all directions by one cell and rotate 90 degrees, which constitutes one move. Advanced pieces such as the Disruptor can disable and weaken nearby pieces, Splicers split your laser into two, and others like the Portals can be used to surprise your enemy from behind!<br/><br/>Green pieces can be controlled by both players, which provides a new twist in your strategy.<br/><h3>Play with friends</h3>Play with your friends in the same room (local multiplayer/same PC) or remotely in the online multiplayer game mode, to show them who is the best!<h3>Play and train against AI</h3>Your friends are unavailable or you want to practice? Don't worry, you can play against the AI in the same scenarios/maps. The tutorial mode will guide you through the rules and useful tactics.<br/><strong>It is possible that the game launches in early access with no AI (feature complete except for the singleplayer mode).</strong><h3>A ton of scenarios/maps to choose from!</h3><br/><br/><br/>Deflection comes with plenty of scenarios which keeps the game interesting.
