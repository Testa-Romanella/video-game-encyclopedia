Titles that have inspired and most influenced its creation are: Bomb Jack (Tehkan, 1984), Ghosts' n Goblins (Capcom, 1985), Baluba -louk no Densetsu (Able, 1986) and Psychic 5 (Jaleco, 1987).</p>\n<p>Thanks to its progressive difficulty curve, and with a path divided into \"worlds\" of 5 levels each one, Eternum is challenging, addictive and an ode to the nostalgia of the golden age of arcade games.</p>\n\n<p><strong>HISTORY:</strong></p>\n<p>Sir Arthur has gotten too old and has lost everything he had and loved. With nothing left to lose he departs for Samarnath, an evil subterranean kingdom (which no knight has ever returned alive) in search of treasures, adventures and the most important: five magical orbs that together provide... the <strong>Eternal youth</strong>!</p>\n\n<p><strong>FE</strong><strong>ATURES:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Awesome gameplay (may cause addiction).</li><li>Memorable soundtrack</li><li>Retro, arcade and platformer 100%</li><li>16-bit aesthetics </li><li>Plenty of different enemies</li><li>25 Levels</li><li>Special levels with final bosses</li><li>Secrets bonus on each level</li><li>Development time: years ;)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:28:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a8/9a8d7d660c158d98e875b403883b0f15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 421, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Radin"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
