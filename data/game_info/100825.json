Peggy Pete decides to go on one final treasure hunt before hanging up his boot. Just the one boot hence the nickname Peggy Pete. Follow Pete on an adventure that no pirate has ever boldly gone on and begin to question why exactly he was once known to be so feared? </p><p>Prequel perhaps? who knows what could be in store for my little Peggy Pete. Perhaps a collaboration with Ubisoft and create Assassins Creed Black Flag 2? </p><p>The game was created as part of a college project which was meant to test our writing skills more so than the gameplay itself. Writing would never have really been my strongest asset when it came to creating games but I now am starting to want to create more pieces of writing after developing this piece of work. I feel like story is key to engaging players into your games. With some more practice I hope to soon be able to provide players with far more engaging story lines which will make them want to push onwards to finally figure out the truth that waits at the end of these games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29e/29e023700ab48b5fe54cd6641237491c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jamalamalamajam"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
