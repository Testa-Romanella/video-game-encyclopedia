You are a cube and your mission is to get to the goal that is on a specific location in the level. Each of the 100 levels have some special quirk to them, but the way you can best them is not defined except from physics (gravity for the most part).<br/>Some levels can be very demanding. Patience, tenacity and luck are imperative, almost like real life.<br/>From my experience with the game: If you get to the goal after 150 attempts. Even if it was pure luck. Uuuuuuh - that feeling.<br/><br/>You can color your cube, if you want to.<br/><br/><br/>And that's it.<br/><br/>Things you will not find:<br/><ul><li> Character development<br/></li><li> Hobbits<br/></li><li> Intricate, thrilling and gut wrenching story<br/></li><li> Penguins<br/></li><li> K/D/A<br/></li><li> Loot<br/></li><li> Guns<br/></li><li> The one ring<br/></li><li> Super heroes</li></ul><br/>Things you will find:<br/><ul><li> A cube<br/></li><li> Rumble tube<br/></li><li> Rubber &amp; Ice<br/></li><li> Darkness<br/></li><li> Floaty zones<br/></li><li> Instant gratification<br/></li><li> The floor is lava<br/></li><li> Character developement</li></ul><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T02:24:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52f/52f5bea1248704235d1d55638991d33d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pit Forest"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pit Forest"], "esrb_rating": null}
