We were tasked to create something for a portfolio that was a thing we have experience in making before. Naturally, we settled on creating a 2D Platformer.\u00a0It's not perfect by any means, but I'm happy with the end result, maybe I'll continue working on this in the future.</p>\n<p>Web version is functional, but PC Build might be better to use.</p>\n<p>The game centers around a little circular robotic buddy who has to explore a laboratory in order to stop some rebellious robot experiments from rampaging! There 10 levels in total to complete, each ranging in length and difficulty. But the game can get addicting when you get into a groove!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T10:22:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/471/47162f706eda38d7087f368e7ad9d323.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["MaximumFlyer"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
