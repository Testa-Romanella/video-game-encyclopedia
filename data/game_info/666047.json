You can change the style of certain items, change item colors, and even toggle items on and off. If you would like you can also\u00a0change the characters pose.\u00a0</p><p>As of right now there's no in-game way to save your creation. I\u00a0just didn't have the energy to figure out how to make a screenshot/download utility. For now, use your screenshot tool of choice. :)</p>\n<p>This was made in Godot, and was a bit of a learning project for me.\u00a0 Although this might not seem super impressive to you experienced game makers out there, I'm still proud of it. It was fun to make and gives me confidence that I\u00a0can eventually do something more complex!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T08:51:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a89/a894aebd76fc1654164072661746edba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SpiggieCode"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
