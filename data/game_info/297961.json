When I first played the mini-game I loved it, and thought that it would work really well on PICO-8. This is my own version of the mini-game with some slight modifications.</p>\n\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>The goal is to connect 4 or more of the same coloured piece. There are two ways you can do this, by either picking pieces up and putting them down in a different location, or by swapping two pieces, either the two above you, or the one you're holding and the one above you. The game takes some getting used to so it might take a few rounds before you're comfortable with the controls.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>[\u25c0] [\u25b6] : Move EXA left/right<br/>[\u25bc] : Fast drop<br/>[X] : Grab/drop piece<br/>[O] : Swap two pieces</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2d/a2dbe2093a4f343fac70470e16741624.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["deadpixl"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
