Back in 1978 it swept the world and became a first \"killer app\" for video game consoles. The game was so successful that in Japan it was attributed to the shortage of 100 yen coins and in 1982 it grossed 3 times more than newly released Start Wars movie. It has been ported to numerous platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of the game in a tiny download package.<br/><br/>Waves of colorful, funky-looking aliens are descending on Earth, and your mission is shoot them down before they can land. Tilt the phone to move defender ship from side to side, shielding your ship behind the brick-wall defenses. The longer you take to eliminate the aliens, the closer they get to the ground. Shoot down the extraterrestrial spaceship at the top of the screen for extra points.<br/><br/>Don't forget to check our Game section for other fun games...", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:15:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fe/5fefd3a76f590c293d26ed9274793446_woqMmj5.jpg", "website": "http://www.gaspmobilegames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["GASP Mobile Games"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["GASP Mobile Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
