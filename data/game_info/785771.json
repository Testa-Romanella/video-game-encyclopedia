Borne is set in the future where remote controlled robot free-for-all fighting events are now a billion dollar business. These robots are dropped into a battlefield where they compete to destroy as many of their opponents possible before the time runs out.</p>\n<p>You are a pilot for your team and you are competing against fellow pilots for both glory and a position in the world championship. Will you come out victorious or end up sweeping up your own nuts and bolts?</p>\n<p><strong>Game Mechanic:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game is a First Person Shooter (FPS). (For\u00a0 those that do not already know) In an FPS, you control your character's view with the mouse/joystick and move with the keyboard/gamepad. You can fire your weapon with the Mouse Click. If you hit another player with your shot, they will be damaged. If a player loses all of their health, they will be destroyed and respawn after a delay. The player to shoot the killing blow will be awarded a kill.</p>\n<p>The goal of this game is to destroy as many enemy robots as possible within the given round time.</p>\n<p>The Unique mechanic is that you are only able to fire your weapon while you are airborne. This means that you cannot shoot unless you are not on the ground. Also, you have a limited amount of shots that will recharge while you are on the ground.</p>\n<p>There are several powerups to pickup throughout the area that enhance your robot and can give it the edge it needs to come out on top. Unfortunately, they don't persist through death, so make use of them while you can.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This game and many more made by students will be complete and\u00a0released for free\u00a0at the Florida Polytechnic University Game Expo on\u00a0April 23, 2022.
