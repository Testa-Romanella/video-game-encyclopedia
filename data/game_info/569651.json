Either eliminate your opponent by shooting them or knock them off of the map. Simple right? There are also many tools to help you achieve this. But be careful. You're in space and so you never know when a meteor may hit you. And you need to beat your opponent before the time runs out. So, good luck.</p>\n<p><strong>Featuring</strong><strong>:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Platforming</li><li>Unique Powerups</li><li>Meteors</li><li>Portals</li><li>And a friend</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T06:40:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/207/20734dc9384c35c4617a24c2104b9b88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shadectre"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
