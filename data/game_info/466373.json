However, there are enemies looking to take away your control. They will take away LEFT, RIGHT, UP and DOWN until you have none of one of them left. You lose if they take away all controls under one direction. You can pickup additional controls. When you lose a control, a new one will take its place i.e. under UP [W, 3] is set, losing UP will set 3 as your new UP.<br/><br/>Improvements:<br/>- Using the cursor as a movement point rather than normal directions<br/></p>\n<p>- Having enemies and controls fly in from different directions (think asteroids but confusing)</p>\n<p>- Better UI</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T12:27:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/784/784be6186a49b8d89e538f2c3c90ae57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["catonice"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
