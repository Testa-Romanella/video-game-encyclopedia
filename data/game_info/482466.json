{"id": 482466, "slug": "xenotown-demo-page", "name": "Xenotown (Demo Page)", "name_original": "Xenotown (Demo Page)", "description": "<p>Demo Page for XENOTOWN - A\u00a0small RPG where you play as an alien in disguise, on a mission to brainwash the people of Earth, one person at a time. Join up with an Earth child and a germaphobic toilet on your quest to control the planet.<br />\nCONTROLS<br />\nSelect the red icon that says &quot;Game&quot; in your downloaded folder to start the demo.\u00a0Press &quot;z&quot;\u00a0and &quot;x&quot; to interact with objects, and the arrow keys to move around. Vending machines can be used to buy health items or weapons.\u00a0Gamepads should also work when connected, but we haven&#39;t tried that many models out.<br />\nDETAILS<br />\nThis demo is a rough, streamlined\u00a0portion of what we want the\u00a0full game to be like. After this section, the suburb area will be fully unlocked, with every house and building open for exploration. The small suburb area will be 1 out of 3 larger &quot;overworlds&quot; that you will fight through on your mission to conquer the secluded town of Pineville, with additional sections in between.\u00a0 The content in this\u00a0demo is just the opening of the game, and while nothing else has been made fully playable yet, we do have large portions of the project roughly mapped out.<br />\nLet us know what you thought of the demo! There are 2 people working on XenoTown (Made in Wolf RPG editor)\u00a0who have no prior experience in game development, art, or\u00a0alien invasions.<br />\nThe full game will likely cost $4.99. We are planning on a play time of at least 10 or more hours, with multiple endings. Feel free to donate on this page if you&#39;d like to help us pay for publishing fees, or for shrinkwrapped sardines\u00a0to eat when we&#39;re working on the game.<br />\nCheck out some of the soundtrack below, and follow us on Itch or Youtube!

Let us know if you find any so we can fix them in the full release, whenever it gets finished. Audio levels and the combat system will also be balanced better in the final version.\u00a0Warning: Features explicit language and some violence.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-20T21:05:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a50/a50c2f6bae4fccfde50c7282f4f49174.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aleque Sivelle", "BoatmealBros"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Aleque Sivelle"], "esrb_rating": null}
