{"id": 393295, "slug": "gluttony-wip", "name": "Gluttony (WIP)", "name_original": "Gluttony (WIP)", "description": "<p>A small game I made in the past 2 weeks. You play as an immobile slime monster whose objective is to grab as many crowns as it can to score points. Beware, bombs would fall down that would wipe out one third of your max health in one hit. Health packs can also be grabbed to replenish a smaller amount of health, and shields (although rarer), provide immunity from bombs for a short duration.<br/></p>\n<p>Some buttons are faded out because those features have not been implemented yet. All art was obtained from OpenGameArt.org, Itch.io and GameDevMarket.com</p><p>The game is currently built for android and browser. The user interface might differ based on the platform but the game is still the same.<br/><br/>All feedback is welcome. Please let me know of any bugs you encounter and if you have any suggestions for improvement in the comment section of this game. Thank you and I hope you have fun or at least look at it and go \"Hmm, interesting.\" XD<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T08:22:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3e/a3ee60c7f9e6a22ae529599a8b814b74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Web"], "developers": ["incer7am"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
