{"id": 940670, "slug": "loose-spirits", "name": "Loose Spirits", "name_original": "Loose Spirits", "description": "<p>Cleanse a haunted house by fighting ghostly spirits and closing all the rifts\u00a0on each floor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Spirits start out only partially manifested (denoted by lowercase letters). In this form they are rather harmless and you can even switch places with them by moving into them, but every turn they remain within line of sight they will get closer to fully manifesting. Once fully manifested (denoted by uppercase letters) they will gain troublesome abilities specific to their spirit type. If you do enough harm to a spirit by damaging it with your spells then you'll temporarily banish it, but it will eventually respawn at an open rift. You can close a rift (denoted by ~) by moving into it.</p>\n<p>You can power your spells by\u00a0drawing upon the house's echos of otherworldly energy, but doing so is not without risks. Once used, the echos you collect will fade and disappear over time, and using them to cast spells will make this happen faster.\u00a0Each echo is tainted by the house's corruption and contains unknown curses which will hurt or hinder you when using them. Specifically, each collected echo has two random curses. The first curse scales with the cost of the spell, but will only trigger if you hit at least one spirit. The second curse has an echo specific chance of triggering per spirit hit, so effectively scales with the number of spirits hit. The game tracks how often the on hit effect triggered, but the exact chance of triggering is hidden.\u00a0You'll generally want to\u00a0identify what curses an echo has before risking using it with more powerful spells.</p>\n<p>Along the way you'll also find\u00a0some single use magic scrolls (denoted by\u00a0?) which might help you out in an emergency.\u00a0Good luck, ghost hunter!</p>\r\nStatus Conditions<p>There's two status conditions which can be inflicted by curses or spirits. They can't directly kill you, but they can place you closer to death.</p><ul><li><strong>Bleed</strong> -\u00a0Causes harm equal to bleed amount when moving. Bleed is reduced by half when resting.</li><li><strong>Pain</strong> -\u00a0Temporarily reduces current health. Pain is fully removed at the end of the turn if no fully manifested Flayed Ghosts are visible.
