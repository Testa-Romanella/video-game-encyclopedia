During these 4 days, you will have to gather the mental strength needed in order\u00a0to overcome your anxiety and finally go outside of your comfort zone. Art and self-care\u00a0will help, but depression will make it difficult to complete those actions.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>WASD, Mouse\u00a0 \u00a0</strong>-\u00a0 \u00a0move<br/><strong>Space, Q, E, R, T, K\u00a0 \u00a0</strong>-\u00a0 \u00a0interact (also suggested in-game when needed)</p>\n\n<p><strong>3D Models, Materials,\u00a0Textures\u00a0 \u00a0</strong>-\u00a0 \u00a0Unity Asset Store, TurboSquid, Sketchfab<br/><strong>Sounds</strong>\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Freesound<br/><strong>Drawings &amp; Artistic texts\u00a0 </strong>\u00a0-\u00a0 \u00a0unnamed author<br/><strong>Testing &amp; Feedback</strong>\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0 \u00a0Ina, TFphoenix<br/><strong>Programming, Design, Icons</strong>\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0 \u00a0Amethyst Lynx</p>\n<p>Shoutout\u00a0to Rockgirl702, who created the music that was used in the making of this game.
