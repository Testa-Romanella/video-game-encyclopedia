Lively games, lived a virtual world, some of the archaic needs of man remain in this world.<br/>Our virtual world has three spaces:The ice forest of Alaska, The Mexican green canyon, The hot valley of California. There are diffrenet hunters who attack bears, but they fight each other also, because of the desire for personal triumph. Each bear that is shot down brings a trophy in the form of honey. Let's try to win as many trophies as possible and let's sweeten ourselves with honey! Let's shoot weapons, change and improve our experience!<br/>Types of bears: American black bear, Asian black bear, Giant panda, Sun bear, Polar bear,Ursid hybrid, Sloth, Spectacled bear and Brown bear.
