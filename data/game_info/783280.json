Everyone in the class used the same asset pack, and we worked individually from each other to create our levels. The goal was to compile all that we have learned this semester into one project. We also included sound effects and animations, which were not included in our previous projects.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This level is called Willow Farm. I've always enjoyed simple, slice-of-life farming games such as Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley, so I drew a lot of inspiration from these games. I do hope that you enjoy my level!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T11:52:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c57/c572ea99d666701bd20d34eb267f7808.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 279, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["munchoz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
