There are no borders or restrictions for player-movement.<br/>\r\nThe planet features full day/night cycle with one sun and two moons along with a variety of biomes, including: Desert, leaf-woods, pine-woods, arctic, lakes and more.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPLAYER SKILL<br/>\r\nAll players have the same amount of stats, what matters is how you allocate them to suit your playstyle.\u00a0<br/>\r\nDepending on your allocation of stats your character gets adjusted traits such as movement speed, jump height, cooldown time, status effect duration, etc.<br/>\r\nThis together with choosing your spell-elements wisely during gameplay to accommodate your own personal playstyle is what gives you the edge in battle.<br/>\r\n\u200b<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSPELLS<br/>\r\nThe vision with spells in Ghostly Horizon is that there shouldn't be two spells that work exactly the same. There are many types of spells: Projectile, Bolt, Spray, Slash, Ray, Instant, Self-targeted. All of these types have a number of spells in them and each one is unique. There are 7 different elements with 4 spells each. A player can have 2 elements active at one time, each element has its own style and which ones the player chooses will alter the playstyle of the player.<br/>\r\n\u200b<br/>\r\nThere are plans on synergy-spells that will arrive in an expansion after release. The player then gets a unique spell that is a merge between the two elements chosen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCOOPERATION<br/>\r\nA large part of Ghostly Horizon is cooperation, some game-modes require cooperation to be able to take objectives, others don't enforce it. But nonetheless working together will give your team the upper-hand.<br/>\r\n\u200b<br/>\r\nHealing-spells are designed mainly to be used on your friends, your survivability will most likely raise if you work together and heal each other, before it is too late. You can also work together by casting a boost-ray on your friend to make his spells do more damage, or cast a boost-AoE to make all your allies damage more while inside the area of effect.\u00a0<br/>\r\n\u200b<br/>\r\nFast travel with teleports that are created by 3 or more players casting boost-rays on each other in a circle to conjure up a teleport. It might be risky though, there is a hidden science behind teleports and you might end up popping out of the enemies teleport if you don't know what you are doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGRAPHICS<br/>\r\nGhostly Horizon is presented in a low-poly style with a mix of hard and soft gradients in textures.
