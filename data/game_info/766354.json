Collect samples (glowing blue objects), and avoid crashing into asteroids and junk!</p>\n<p>This game is an entry to Ludem Dare 50, my first Ludem Dare (not my first game jam though). My project can be found here.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>WS / Flight stick Up/Down \u00a0- Pitch</p>\n<p>QE / Flight stick Twist - Yaw</p>\n<p>AD / Flight stick Left/Right - Roll</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys / Flight stick analog - Look Around</p>\n<p>Shift &amp; Control / Flight stick speed setting - Flight Speed</p>\n<p>If you see a \"TURN BACK\" text on the right side panel, you must try to fly back to where the asteroids are. Despite the title, you don't actually <em>enter</em> Delta Blue, but rather you are flying <em>near </em>it.<br/></p>\n\n<p>The game was made using Godot 4 Alpha 5, so expect <strong><em>many</em></strong> bugs! For example, there is <em>was</em> a bug involving the renderer, causing harmful flashing blue lights.<strong> </strong>This\u00a0is\u00a0fixed\u00a0in\u00a0Version\u00a01.1.\u00a0<strong>Please\u00a0play\u00a0that\u00a0version\u00a0instead.</strong></p>\n<p>There are also features that I would have liked to add, but ran out of time to do.
