It is rumored there is a secret message\r\nwaiting for the one who succeeds.</p>\n<p>But how to start?  There is a login prompt, but no information on what accounts are\r\nvalid.  You'll have to guess!\r\nOnce you get in, there are programs left on the various nodes of the OMNISTAR by previous\r\nattempts, but no information on what each of them does.  Will they help you on your quest,\r\nor hinder you?</p>\n<p>A member of the resistance has been assigned to each node to monitor your progress and help\r\nwhenever they can.</p>\n<p>You do know a few commands:  LOAD <program> will load a program into your workspace.  SAVE\r\n<program> will save it into the node directory.  And EXEC <program> will execute it so that\r\nyou can try to figure out what each program does.\u00a0</program></program></program></p>\n<p>The command TIME will display how long you have been logged in.</p>\n<p>GO <node> is the command that accesses one of the nodes adjacent to your current node.</node></p>\n<p>The goal is to damage the OMNISTAR so that SYSTEM STATUS is 0%.</p>\n<p>But if you are attacked\r\nsuch that USER STATUS goes to 0%, game over!</p>\n<p>Each of the nodes and programs also has a percentage, and once that percentage goes to zero,\r\nthey will not operate.</p>\n<p>You will see automated processes moving from node to node, in service to the OMNISTAR.  They\r\nare MILBOTs, MEDBOTS, and SPYBOTs... what do each of these do?  The names may provide a clue.\r\nAnd they have percentages too, so can you knock those down?</p>\n<p>Hints: Use the up-arrow to repeat a command.  All commands, program names and node names\r\ncan be abbreviated to two letters.  Some programs don't need to be EXECuted but instead have\r\nan effect merely by being present in your workspace.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n<p>PS: Any similarity to the name of a certain large corporation is purely coincidental.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T14:02:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ff/9ff669627b87cec89fe1ace97309676c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rick Adams"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
