The game mechanic is really easy. You control the character in two places at the same time. Your movement is replicated in both scenarios (top and bottom -&gt; as above so below).</p>\n<p>There are 5 missions to complete. Everything that you learned in the previous mission needs to be used in\u00a0the next one.</p>\n<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>\n<p>- Move the cube to the goal before time runs out</p>\n<p>- Your top character cannot fall to the bottom level</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Movement: WASD</p>\n<p>Enter: Skip intro</p>\n<p>Escape: Quit game</p>\n<p><strong>Development story</strong></p>\n<p>It took me 2 days to decide what I could do with the theme of the jam, but my son said \"you can't be in two places\u00a0at once\" and the idea was completed! Sadly, we didn't have electricity the day afterward but I used the time to create the levels in my mind. Then development begins... Every day after my work I took 3 hours to develop my game.</p>\n<p>- Monday: Game mechanic</p>\n<p>- Tuesday: Level design tools</p>\n<p>- Wednesday: Level 2-5 created, fixing bugs and start screen</p>\n<p>- Thursday: Packaging, uploading and writing this :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T08:43:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/205/205f7b31520114f80c5d744630890af8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tonylattke"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
