It is meant to educate and prepare students to practice viewing an event from multiple sides; though at its basest level, it should intrigue, invite questions, and provoke independent research. The creative approach to this project is the use of a tactile, visual, and auditory experience for the stimulation of learning, accessible to the widest possible range of students. Visual elements include text and images with appropriate scaling to various devices for physical limitations and visual strengths, audio recording and sound effects for those with auditory strengths, and the tactile element comes along with being able to click through and explore at a comfortable pace. The creative elements also play into the critical approach to this subject. Behind the scenes there is an analysis of the work explored and additional research into topics and subjects mentioned, while the output for that information follows a Universal Design for Learning model as closely as possible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Imagine Falling Through the Sky as a brief exploration through a lens unlike your own and in order to glean new information and a new perspective on a moment otherwise described in one point of view. It is the artist's intent to include creativity in teaching and spark a delight in learning that will encourage your path toward knowledge to be with cheerful steps rather than drudgery. They thank you for your time in exploring this world and sincerely hope that curiosity and a desire to seek knowledge continues to fuel your education. Happy exploring adventurers!\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Plagiarism Statement:</em> The artist understands fully the meaning of plagiarism, defined as the practice of taking another person's physical or intellectual property and passing it off as their own.
