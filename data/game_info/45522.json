Experience one of the world's favorite games of strategy in a beautifully rendered fantasy world where magic is the norm, wielded with just a flick of the wrist.

Featuring numerous levels of difficulty, this game will pose a challenge for players of all abilities, from beginners to grandmasters. With graphics rendered in Unreal Engine 4 and AI powered by the Stockfish Chess Engine, Magician's Gambit provides plenty of eye candy for casual gamers whilst still providing a real challenge for serious chess players.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af1/af1c287c2806b1a2dbc4e56d7d103742.jpg", "website": "http://www.codingcaveman.com/magicians_gambit/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 293, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Coding Caveman"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Coding Caveman"], "esrb_rating": null}
