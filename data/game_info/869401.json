Whether you are a medical student, professional, or whoever, learning about Human Anatomy with scientific terminology and accuracy is now easy. I used Light ship ARDK to develop an Immersive learning experience. <br/><br/>You can view each of the Human Anatomy systems and the scientific names of each part. Tap on the button to view/hide the systems. Focus on any part to view its scientific name. <br/><br/>With the help of the new palm-tracking feature, you can use your hand to interact with the menu. Place your hand on the name of the system to view or hide it.<br/><br/>You can grab and inspect the parts of the skeleton system.  Place your hand on the name of the part and press and hold the screen with your finger simultaneously to grab and move the part.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Credits:\u00a0<br/></p><p>3D Models :\u00a0Open source 3D | Z-Anatomy</p><p>Some 3d models\u00a0are used from this repository without any scripts:\u00a0</p><p>LluisV/Z-Anatomy: Z-Anatomy app Unity project (github.com)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T15:06:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34c/34c37016fab43436b40d3a7f4a1e60fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Irfan"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
