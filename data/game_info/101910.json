All of the victims were found with their bodies putrefied, even though they shouldn't have died more than a few hours ago. This, however, stopped as quickly as it had come, only to be replaced by a series of strange disappearances. The government tried to hush it up, because they had no leads \u2013 to no avail. The powerful Wilshire Corporation continued to keep tabs on the case, while at the same time a secret private detective group went on a manhunt for the perpetrator. These cases closed upon the unfortunate deaths of said group in an accident. Years passed. All was well.</p>\n<p>All was well, until the decaying corpse of Mikaela Lane turned up at the back of an abandoned church.</p>\n<p>This story is set a year after that \u2013 about a young female corporate mercenary, Sho Reilen, who is skilled in the use of swords.

I'm a murderer, you see?\"</em></p>\n<p>Kaison Voltaire is a 17-year-old boy whose father was a fencer.
