This game collection was created by Divine Knight Gaming as a playable game for the Super! BitCon gaming convention. Since then, it had been updated to fix several bugs and add additional content.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tWhat can be found here?\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>DK Adventure</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis is the prototype we created as we work on developing a Zelda styled adventure game. It is a complete dungeon with events based on clearing rooms with monsters and an end boss.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis game also acts as a prologue to our future game. It tells the story of a mysterious soldier who saves an island nation from an evil wizard.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Amazing Mazes</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis is a simple maze game. Originally created with only four mazes, we added four new and much larger mazes for this release.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe game is simple. Select a maze. Find your way through the maze to the flag at the end. Beat your best times.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Space Battles</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tA vertical shooter in which you must defeat an onslaught of alien ships. Beat your best scores.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tEach of these games were well received by those who played them at Super! BitCon and we wanted to share them with everyone.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe ManlyBoy collection is playable on Windows and Linux and we are looking to add Mac support soon.\r\n</p><p><strong>New Updates</strong></p><p>The latest version of the game (version 1.5) adds controller support for XBox 360 and PS3 controllers. It also adds a couple of new features as well as some bug fixes. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/899/89989a04aff42e5f36a4509cdf0b92a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Divine Knight Gaming"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
