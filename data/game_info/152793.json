{"id": 152793, "slug": "timelock-pixelballoon", "name": "TIMELOCK (pixelballoon)", "name_original": "TIMELOCK (pixelballoon)", "description": "<p>Timelock is a simple little puzzle game developed for Ludum Dare 32. My main goal was to do something small I could complete in a weekend so I don't distract myself too much from my main project. I didn't want to do anything with violence, so I struggled a bit with the theme 'An Unconventional Weapon'. I decided that the 'weapon' was a combination of the players lack of skills, and the limited amount of moves the player gets to complete each level. (In reality I actually went with the second place theme - Companion...) <br/><br/>The gameplay revolves around moving a number of cubes through a level, where each one moves simultaneously. You have to guide them all to the exit with a limited number of moves. <br/><br/>I would have liked to get 20 levels created, but I ran out of time, so there's just 17. Various mechanics are introduced gradually throughout. I believe they do get pretty difficult towards the end though, so good luck! <br/><br/>The game was written in Unity, SFX were done in LabChirp, and the music was done with cgMusic combined with Reaper and some VSTs for rendering the MIDI output. <br/><br/>Thanks for looking - I hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/735/7355764aa71f2824291b1c2e1e106eba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pixelballoon"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
