Each mission attempted increases the difficulty as does each loop. Killing enemies and completing missions will award currency, which can be used to purchase extra life after the point of failure. Currency is also used to buy upgrades for the loops to come. Purchasing extra life will provide access to the next loop. Progress can be saved after extra life purchased. If there is not enough currency for the extra life, game over. Shop upgrades carry over loops, but items received do not. Items will be automatically sold on death to provide some more currency. After starting a mission, it is possible to flee to a new unknown mission through the mission screen. The new mission will start as soon as the flee timer has run out.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T06:18:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1bd/1bdb75e5f7b8c53eeb794c7fa47b390c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MikaV"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
