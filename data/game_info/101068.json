It was made over the course of 39 hours during HackNYU and doesn't yet have a discrete ending.<br/></p>\r\nUrban + Dominoes\r\n<p>\r\n\tUrbaniminos explores how a city building game, like SimCity, might function when the people, the businesses, and developers of a city have a stake in their home. By using a voting system, Urbaniminos introduces an element of organic unpredictability to simulating the growth of a modern urban environment.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tI've loved the game series SimCity for the longest time. The way it presents the modern metropolis as a garden waiting to be composed upon was a wonderful experience. Yet, what SimCity presents is not a Democratic American city, but a dictatorship. By giving the player the power to instantly clear swaths of land and evict citizens from their homes with no consequence is totalitarian. Urbaniminos explores the role of a modern urban planning committee and how cities are shaped not by dictators but by many people trying to envision what they want in their city.\r\n</p>\r\nInspiration\r\n<p>Molleindustria's MultipliCITY was a really fascinating board game interpretation of a city building game designed as a multiplayer role playing experience. I ended up using the idea of special interest groups and their scoring system into this prototype. <br/></p>Development Blog\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abd/abdfc0d1ad0bb74c12b0a8cdc1f484aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Matthew Conto"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
