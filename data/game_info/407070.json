Will you be able to get the proper ones into the center? This is not an easy task and it is not getting any easier as you go. Try to dispose as many as you can for a high score before you get stuck. Try to drop the green boxes in a consecutive chain to get even better scores!</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Kenney.nl for the graphic assets! Even though my skills in this department are obviously lacking I think they helped a lot - this would not look even remotely like this without them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T02:20:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/656/656ba8aacd10258570960313cf779f64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Abducted Piggy"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
