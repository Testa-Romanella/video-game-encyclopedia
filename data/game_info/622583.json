All of this is displayed as the desktop wallpaper so you can an eye on your fox. We are probably the only one presenting a similar project.<br/><br/>The fox reacts to your commands, asks what to do when it sees something interesting. You can call him, stroke him and throw balls.<br/>The fox grows over time. You will start with a little fox that will grow and get bigger over time.<br/><br/>We had a lot of inquiries about the possibility of taking care of another animal. The fox seemed perfect so we planned this sequel by building a new bigger world with new stories to discover. \"MY FOX\" also allows you to transfer to the magical world.<h3>Main features:</h3><strong>The game is displayed as wallpaper.</strong><br/>Everything happens in the background while you are working on something else.<br/><br/><strong>Interactive little fox that will grow up.</strong><br/>Take care of a little fox that will grow with age to discover new possibilities of the wild and magical world.
