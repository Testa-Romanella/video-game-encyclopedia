I worked on this for about a week while balancing between work and free time, but it came out as something far better than I anticipated. I'm adding the sound effects and the BGM I intended to put on the game as bonus files, you guys can use it on your projects however you please :)<br/><br/>Donations are appreciated as a form of support, but everything I make is available for free!<br/><br/>Critics are more than welcome, since I'm trying to improve on each project that I work on!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-12T03:47:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/302/302c87c514fb6ad96f3656c48fda928a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wobbumash"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
