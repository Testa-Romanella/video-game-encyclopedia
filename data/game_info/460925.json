You don't need a multi-million dollar design budget or advanced realtime bullet physics to make something scary. You just have to have an idea that is raw, and the honesty to execute it.<br/><br/><strong>P.T.</strong> perfectly illustrates this point. It takes place entirely in one hallway. It didn't have complicated AI. There weren't a dozen characters to design and model. Hell, there weren't even that many scares. And it was absolutely terrifying. It distilled the concepts of the ill-fated <strong>Silent Hills</strong> into a dense moment of terror. It was its own compact experience, and a glimpse into something much more.<br/><br/>Many games have tried to imitate <strong>P.T.</strong> in content. A million spooky hallways with a trillion collectible notes. Some of these are fantastic. But what about that concept? To distill your dream project into something condensed, raw, and real?<br/><br/>That was the question posed to 10 brilliant creators. Make a <strong>P.T.</strong> for the horror project of your dreams. Both a game on its own, and a window into a much larger world. Make it raw. Make it real. Make it a reflection of your own fears. Make it in just 7 days.<br/><br/>And they did.
