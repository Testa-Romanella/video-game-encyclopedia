In a new century on a new device, looking for new fans to confuse and confound!<br/><br/><br/>Spread joy in the Addled Universe by bringing friends together. You \u00a0can drag the dodgy denizens of Addled left or right until they meet up and leave for a better party. But be warned, gravity is your enemy. Drag someone off a ledge and they'll fall, and you won't be able to lift them back up again. Careful forward planning is required to get everyone to their buddies.</p>\n\n<p>There are\u00a0200 levels of increasingly diabolical puzzles to solve, with not just gravity getting in the way. Teleports and fans move blocks around in sometimes useful, but just as often disastrous ways. This is not for the faint hearted!<br/><br/><br/></p>\n\n\n<p>\n<strong>WARNING !</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Addled is not your average puzzle game. Although it looks like a version of those old classic match-em-up puzzles like Puzznic or Plotting / FlipPull, it's much more difficult.</p>\n<p>As some of the toughest levels actually have very little blocks on them\u00a0 many people mistakenly assume those\u00a0levels are impossible. They're not, they're just very\u00a0<em>very</em>\u00a0sneakily designed, so if you're stuck on a level with only 7 blocks in it please do not complain to the developers!!!</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>All levels are possible, we promise!</strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>Note: Addled does not need the crank so it should be playable on Playdate simulators as well as the real devices.</p>\n\r\nAre YOU up to the challenge of the most difficult puzzle game on Playdate yet\u00a0?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T10:25:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f3/1f3f58c234c87184938ba29bc541348f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 231, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["playdateStephen"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
