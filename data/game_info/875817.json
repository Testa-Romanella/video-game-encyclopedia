I was struggling all Halloween night to force this into an HTML5 export but I just cannae get it to work: there seems to be a WebGL error involved that I don't have the know-how to solve right now. That and the illustrations will have to be a very \"I'll fix it in post\" matter.</p>\n<p>If you're on Chrome, you're meant to be able to play this in browser. If you're on any other browser you're meant to be able to right-click the frame into a new tab to circumvent the SharedBufferArray error. It will run like this but <em>will not show any graphics! </em>So we'll see how to solve it. For now, the download .exe works just fine!
