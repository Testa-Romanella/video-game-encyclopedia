Use 1 button (space) to navigate around the world so that you can find parts to repair your ship. Press Space to move. Collect blue dots to shoot for a limited time (you shoot when not moving). Shoot purple planets in order to collect pink dots. 4 pink dots fixes your ship and wins the game. Beware the planets, they look cute but will kill you :)</p>\n<p>Made by me (@kirsty_lee0) with cute sound effects and hardware assistance from Jerry (@j3rrytron). <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T04:16:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de3/de366197b03ace78a6ae2cbec2c698ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kirsten-Lee"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
