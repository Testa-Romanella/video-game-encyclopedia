Within a simulated patient encounter, you will experience the short-term and long-term impact of your clinical choices.</p>\n<p>This case is centered around office worker, Amy Johnson, who just needs a physical. In this clinical simulation, you will make choices as Ms. Johnson's primary care provider and experience outcomes based on the choices you make. You will be challenged to:</p>\n<p>~ Develop a trusting relationship with Mrs. Johnson<br/>~ Discuss her personal health habits<br/>~ Identify and treat any medical problems you uncover.</p>\n<p>You will complete typical steps of a patient encounter and receive feedback after each step:\u00a0</p>\n<p>~ Review case history<br/>~ Complete an evaluation, diagnosis, and brief intervention<br/>~ Make a plan of care for your patient</p>\n<p>Feedback is color-coded to let you know whether you made the best selection, a less than ideal selection, or an incorrect selection. With the ability to retry a section or continue down paths to see impacts of different decisions, you will learn by doing without causing real-world negative outcomes.</p>\n<p>Who We Are:</p>\n<p>The Clinical Encounters: Alcohol suite of cases were developed by Clinical Tools, Inc. through an NIAAA grant (#R43AA020456 / #R44AA020456).
