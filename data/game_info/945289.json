Something I face as a disabled person is having to take the longer routes due to inaccessability or not go anywhere at all. I feel like Wisp allows me to explore those frusturations in a kind hearted way.</p>\n<p>Art style follows monochrome style, heavily influenced by the Limbo platformer.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T07:11:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a44/a44f7addf7adeb59a9ca64790b4f8afe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LeonThorn"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
