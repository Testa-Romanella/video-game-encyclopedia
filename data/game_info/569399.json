I choose the smallest scope I could think of and made a procedurally generated addictive Flappy Bird / Helicopter style game.</p>\n<p>Despite the core gameplay itself being rather simple, I still wanted to make a\u00a0\"complete\" game in order to practice a wider\u00a0range of game development. You'll find particle effects, foliage, score shake and pitched sound effects\u00a0among many other tiny additions. Also, fireworks at 250 points! Please let me know about the difficulty\u00a0curve =)</p>\n<p><strong>Translations</strong> are done automatically so please don't be offended. I'll happily accept improvements. I did CJK translations as well but the required fonts increased the file size unjustifiably.<br/></p>\n<p>Even <strong>\"Monetization\"</strong> was included and you can restart from two thirds of your best score if you click the link to my website in the game.</p>\n<p>The game was made with the Godot Engine, using CC0 assets found on OpenGameArt, and ended up being over 700 lines of GDScript code. I spent about 7 days working at least 10 hours a day to complete it, and I had to give up on further polishing some things because of the time constraint. Nevertheless, I hope you find it mildly acceptable as a \"complete game\".</p>\n<p>The HTML5 version does not work in\u00a0Firefox on Itch because of issues with HTML Headers. I have not tested the Mac version.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T05:38:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/423/4231ee8124017578319f44f5f0d33ec1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["xix_xeaon"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
