Although you still have the choice to start over if you so wish...</em><br/></p>\n<p>Paths vary in length, requiring 4 to 20 choices\u00a0to reach a conclusion!</p>\n<p><strong>Some examples of the adventures you can expect in this game:</strong> rule over an underground cat community in\u00a0France, become a Messiah's mascot as he spreads his message across the desert, save humans from the plague by killing the rats responsible for spreading the disease, find your soulmate and have baby kittens together, live at the court of the\u00a0English king, follow a time-travelling historian from the future as she tries to convince the world that cats should not be eradicated, get abducted by aliens and travel to\u00a0a different planet, become best friends with a fennec fox/a snake/a barn-owl/a little girl/a rat (what?)... and much more!</p>\n<p><strong><em>This game can be played for free, but please consider donating if you liked it, so that I can continue to write more stories, my goal in the future being to publish quality games monthly or bimonthly! Any support is greatly appreciated :)</em></strong></p>\r\nA $50 prize awaits the first player to discover all 34 endings and list them in the comments\u00a0(please only provide the titles to avoid spoilers).\u00a0The prize has already been\u00a0claimed!
