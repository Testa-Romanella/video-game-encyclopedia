This is a little project that I'm working on, after getting the idea from looking at a fox plushie on my desk. From there, I thought of the natural setting of a forest, and after more expansion of the idea, here we are!</p>\n<p>Play as a little fox wandering around in the forest for food at night. But you're not alone- you need\u00a0to escape hunters that set traps around the woods. You'd better find your way\u00a0back to your den before they find you!</p>\n<p>While the full idea is much more refined and larger than what is currently up, I hope you enjoy this little project as it keeps on expanding to my full vision!</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>AD or arrow keys: movement left and right<br/>Spacebar: Jumping</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T05:05:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce3/ce382c50b2a4c2d969d081c8bfec5208.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["T-Wolf"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
