It features a brutal one-button combat system, like its predecessor Barbarian Onslaught. Crows follow the Barbarian around, swoop down and feast on slain enemies.<br/></p>\n<p>A sequel to Barbarian Onslaught: The Secret of Steel has been on the drawing board for a long time. It will stay frozen while we work on Superfighters Deluxe, however. Barbarian Odyssey will contain lots of sword-and-sorcery goodness, old-school platforming and exploration, huge monsters and some Lovecraftian horror stuff. <br/></p>\n<p>This a 11-year old Flash game!!
