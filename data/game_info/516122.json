She\u2019s, well... kind of a garbage person. Likes: Her S.O./producer, \u201cP-chan\u201d; psychotropics.<br />\nOMGkawaiiAngel-chan:<br />\nAn \u201cinternet angel\u201d. Ame-chan\u2019s alter ego, used while streaming. Pretends to be really nice and sweet. Constantly flirts with otaku types.<br />\nAs Ame-chan\u2019s beloved (???) \u201cP-chan\u201d, offer daily commentary and guidance to help foster her into a top-tier streamer. She\u2019ll start out getting few comments and even less followers, but under your direction and guidance she can amass more and more devoted listeners/obsessed fans, turning her into a super-popular streamer \u2013 and thus allowing you to squeeze stupid amounts of cash out of her donation-happy otaku followers.<br />\nIt\u2019s not all about streaming \u2013 sometimes you just need to take a little break, too! Take Ame-chan on dates, serve her up a little bit of naughtiness once in awhile, provide her with a little something-something to take the edge off when she needs to release some pent-up stress, and use online dating apps to send her on dates with other dudes to help keep her happy and mentally healthy. *NOTE: This is actually a perfectly wholesome game, containing absolutely no explicit sexual references or expressions nor illegal substances.<br />\nYou can see the results of your daily actions and behavior via social media, where Ame-chan will use both public and private accounts to talk about you. People have a tendency to act supportive and friendly on the outside, while talking loads of smack and spreading rumors privately. You\u2019ll sometimes receive long-winded, tedious criticisms and insults, but that\u2019s just par for the course when dealing with a cute girl streaming on the internet. Be sure to take proper care of her.<br />\nThe game features multiple endings, and your streamer will do things like become weird and emo for various reasons, subject her trusty P-chan to harm, and generally get messed up in the head. Begin your adventure and see for yourself whether a happy ending is really even possible for a cute yet disturbed girl on the modern-day internet.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-16T14:04:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/eaf/eaff56855947026b6d311a2d751cbdad.jpg", "website": "https://whysoserious.jp/needy/", "rating": 4.17, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 29, "owned": 224, "beaten": 52, "toplay": 39, "dropped": 15, "playing": 11}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 33, "ratings_count": 52, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 52, "platforms": ["PC", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Why so serious?", "xemono"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Why so serious?"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
