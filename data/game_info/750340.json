It&#39;s just a normal town as everywhere, but (consciously) without any name. Why is the town empty? Well think about it while playing the game ;).<br />\nBy the way: neither it&#39;s a Silent Hill fan project nor is it a David Lynch game ;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-05T22:37:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e41/e418994fcc33abc7f4db88a57bd6320b.jpg", "website": "https://rpgmaker.net/forums/topics/587/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
