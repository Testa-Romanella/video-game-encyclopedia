{"id": 698908, "slug": "pomodoro-wine-maker", "name": "Pomodoro Wine Maker", "name_original": "Pomodoro Wine Maker", "description": "<p>A productivity game to \"play\" while you \"work\". The timer system is based on the pomodoro method of working, which is to work in 25 minutes intervals\u00a0while taking\u00a05 minute breaks in between. This game times these intervals for you and notifies when it is time to take a break or get back to work. All the meanwhile you are making some wine!\u00a0There are also some simple upgrades to increase your wine production.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game was made to be a productivity tool that makes work just slightly more motivating and entertaining, while not being a distraction.</p>\n<p>*NOTE: When playing in a browser, the timer alert sound does not play if the game window is minimized, or tab is switched (but don't worry, the wine-making will go on). So if you want the timer alert sound,\u00a0It is recommended to have it\u00a0in a separate window if you are using your browser for other things. Alternatively, the game can be downloaded and played from the itch client*</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T09:42:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/843/8430a2602f5aa9a6a2bd214528fc0e57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["longboy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
