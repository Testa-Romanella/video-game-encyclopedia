Take an 80\u2019s themed joyride down the retro neon Miami scene, as you cruise along to the beat. Swerve between lanes to keep up with the music and avoid hazards as you become more engrossed. Tune in to an original soundtrack and watch the scene transform in front of you. Each song affects the speed and visuals of the environment. Buildings begin to bounce and the sun starts to pulsate to the rhythm of the music<br/><br/>Earn coins by performing songs, completing challenges, and achieving high scores. These coins can be spent in the garage on vehicle customizations. Pick your favorite skin and trail for your vehicle to play the game how you want!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-17T01:59:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66e/66e8c9a51cbe340dc6174ad4a5e45007_lswdwB2.jpg", "website": "https://overdrivegame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["MAGIC Spell Studios"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["MAGIC Spell Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
