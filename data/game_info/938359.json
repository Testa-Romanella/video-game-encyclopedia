However, I\u2019ll explain the game here: (Si hablas espa\u00f1ol puedes jugar el juego ya y leer el tutorial) first: you choose your character, each character has its own creatures with their elements, fire, water and nature, assuming you haven\u2019t played Pok\u00e9mon, fire defeats nature, nature defeats water, and water defeats fire, if a creature defeats another one that is effective against this one will be more resistant for the next encounter, if not, it disappears. If you are not satisfied with my explanation, better go and translate the tutorial in \u201cC\u00f3mo jugar\u201d section.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T09:49:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/273/273a7aea52fc1fa82d498e4f95d5c5c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BazaLaCalabaza"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
