We get together every week for a 8-hours jam to experiment on the new opportunities in educational resources and collective intelligence.</p>\n<p>This time was special. <br/></p>\n<p>We wanted to work on the theme OPEN RECOGNITION, as well as this week's WEEKLY GAME JAM theme \"OH,NO!\", so we made a game with a lot of achievements, and many ways to lose. Open Recognition explores the new ways to validate, attest our skills and achievements to be complementary to diplomas and such.</p>\n<p>In this game, you'll have the opportunity to be greatly rewarded for your actions, but be careful, the thirst of recognition can be deadly.</p>\n\n<p>We made this game in one \"8 hours Jam\". We hope you enjoy it!</p>\n\n<p>Made by Delphin Casado, Lola El Koubi, Tom Rivi\u00e8re, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Urien and special guest Adela Barbulescu. Thanks a lot Ghislain Mirat for creating the sound design in 20 minutes.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-27T10:04:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f16/f16191ab84670a6d57e56bff42bbf925.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Savvy"], "genres": ["Educational", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
