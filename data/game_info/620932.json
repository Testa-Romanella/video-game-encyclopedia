Each turn is 2 seconds long and you can steal the next turn if the other player isn't fast enough.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Player 1 can only kill the enemies that are his color and can\u00a0 only be killed by those same enemies. Player 2\u00a0 is the same way, only kill their color and be killed by that color.</p>\n<p>You win when the other player dies when they are hit by an enemy, so fight for control and turn the other player into and enemy and stuff... and that's it!</p>\n<p>This is literally my first game I've ever made so don't judge (unless that's your job)</p>\n<p>Btw: I couldn't figure out how to display the winner in game so you have to figure it out urself, sorry. haha.
