Some of us have over 15 years experience with game development. Trackday Manager is our first released product, and we are very (very!) excited to have reached this milestone as we hope to create leverage for even larger projects in the years ahead. Our core development team is only six man strong, but do not let that fool you into thinking less of our product - we have worked hard for several years to get things where they are today.<br/><br/>We here at Arctic Hazard feel we have made a game worthy of your time, so please try it out.
