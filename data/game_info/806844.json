{"id": 806844, "slug": "rapid-reentry", "name": "Rapid Reentry", "name_original": "Rapid Reentry", "description": "<p>The aim of this game is to keep a space station in orbit for as long as possible by supplying it with components. You will need to mine ore using drones, build refineries to refine the ore and use the refined ore to create the components for the space station. Every minute the space station will be overhead and in range to teleport the created components to it. You will need to balance creating more drones and refineries with creating components to last as many orbits as possible. The space station will use up its stored components over time and if it runs out of components it will take damage. When it is 100% damaged it is game over as the station will be unable to keep in orbit and will suffer a rapid reentry.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>We struggled to come up with an idea for this theme so decided to try and make an RTS/Base builder for a challenge. Hoped to add more resources and buildings, but spent most of the time learning how to use Unity\u2019s NavMesh system and writing the drone AI.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>WASD = Move Camera\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mouse Wheel / Q|E = Zoom\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Click on the buttons on the bottom UI panel with the cursor to use them.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Left click on an object to select it and left click off the object to deselect it.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>If the drone is selected right click on the terrain to tell it where to go or on some ore to mine it.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>If placing a refinery left click to place and right click to cancel placement.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\nCreated By\r\n<ul><li>Richard Hancock -\u00a0https://www.richardhancock.co.uk/\r\n</li><li>Jamie Slowgrove -\u00a0https://jamieslowgrove.co.uk/\r\n</li></ul>\r\nTools\r\n<ul><li>Unity 2020.3.32f1\r\n</li><li>Visual Studio 2019 + VSCode\r\n</li><li>Blender</li><li>GIMP</li><li>Inkscape\r\n</li><li>GitLab CE\r\n</li></ul>\r\n3rd Party Credits\r\nMusic\r\n<p>Spacial Harvest by Kevin MacLeod\u00a0\u00a0<br/>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4401-spacial-harvest\u00a0\u00a0<br/>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license\u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\nSounds\r\n<p>Error Sound: (CC0)\u00a0\u00a0<br/>https://freesound.org/people/Breviceps/sounds/450616/\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Purchase Sound: (CC0)\u00a0\u00a0<br/>https://freesound.org/people/Zott820/sounds/209578/\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Explosion: (CC0)\u00a0\u00a0<br/>https://freesound.org/people/tommccann/sounds/235968/\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Teleport: (CC0)\u00a0\u00a0<br/>https://freesound.org/people/noirenex/sounds/245731/\u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\nFont\r\n<p>Space Station / Drone Texture Font:<br/>https://www.dafont.com/cut-me-out.font</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-21T01:36:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/275/2755ee16b807abbb2c15cdc2c480ed0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["ygrichman", "PerplexedPegasus"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
