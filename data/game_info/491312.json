Lead your carefully handcrafted teams in chaotic racing events for glory and fortune. Available on PC (Linux and Mac soon). <strong>Drive</strong>, <strong>Defeat</strong>, <strong>Loot</strong>, <strong>Repeat</strong>!<h3>DRIVE</h3>\"A party of adventurers set to explore the dungeon\". Sounds familiar? <strong>The Underground King</strong> is a classic <strong>RPG adventure</strong> disguised as a racing game.<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Driver Types</strong>: Based on classic <strong>RPG</strong> archtypes, we reflavored their background and personality to belong in our world. <strong>Hobo</strong> (Fighter), <strong>Urchins</strong> (Rogue), <strong>Biker</strong> (Paladin), etc. Each driver comes with a unique name, backstory, body type, stats, and a random skill.<br/></li><li><strong>Driver Skills</strong>: Each driver comes with their own activatable ability. These are physic-based actions that will help you surpass obstacles, damage enemies, navigate the track, etc.<br/></li><li><strong>Vehicle Types</strong>: Vehicles have from 1 up to 4 seats for drivers and proportional bonuses depending on the seat count. Like the drivers, each car comes with a unique identity, random paint job, and random stats.<br/></li><li><strong>Team Management</strong>: You are able to assemble multiple teams composed of one vehicle and at least one driver. You can match and sort different combinations to surpass specific challenges (such as building a team to survive a <strong>meteor shower</strong>).</li></ul><br/><h3>DEFEAT</h3><ul><li><strong>Race Tracks</strong>: Procedurally generated terrain designed to challenge you in unique ways. Here are some examples:<br/><ul><li><strong>The Countryside</strong>: (Currently implemented) Race in a dangerous obstacle course against other enemy teams.<br/></li><li><strong>Freefall</strong>: (In development) All teams fall from a plane. Whoever hits the ground first, wins!<br/></li><li><strong>Manhunt</strong>: (In development) Somebody is hunting the contestants. Be the last survivor or become the hunter, to claim the prize.<br/></li><li><strong>Tug-o-war</strong>: (In development) One chain, two opposing cars. Pull your weight or get dragged down.<br/></li><li><strong>Others</strong>: We have more types planned, thematic to classic adventure tropes, such as <strong>tomb raiding</strong>, <strong>fighting armies of orcs</strong>, <strong>slay the dragon</strong>, etc. </li></ul><br/></li><li><strong>Boss Tracks</strong>: (In development) Occasionally, you can challenge a <strong>Boss</strong> in a more difficult version of a normal race track. They might drop <strong>unique Boss Set</strong> items, which when completed, will grant you <strong>special effects</strong> and high stats.<br/></li><li><strong>Obstacles &amp; Weather</strong>: Obstacles are designed to hinder you but you can also use them to damage / slow your enemies. The weather influences your speed and acceleration and some spawn dangers (such as <strong>lightning bolts</strong>, <strong>meteor showers</strong>, etc.).<br/></li><li><strong>Team</strong> vehicles are physical objects that move throughout the level. They can <strong>collide</strong> with each other, activate traps, break obstacles into pieces, etc.<br/></li><li>Domino effects can occur, adding to the <strong>chaotic fun</strong> that is physics-based gameplay! That goes double for <strong>EXPLOSIONS</strong>!</li></ul><br/><h3>LOOT</h3><ul><li><strong>Text Adventures (Happenings)</strong>: Adventures scattered throughout the island for your drivers to explore. Rewards await for those who seek them!<br/></li><li><strong>Shop Opportunities</strong>: Wandering merchants will offer to buy or sell things from you. Some will ask for specific item <strong>types</strong> while others for are only interested in <strong>quality</strong>.<br/></li><li><strong>Loot &amp; Rarities</strong>: We have the roguelike procedurally generated loot, which can drop in a variety of rarities.<br/></li><li><strong>Traits</strong>: Items, drivers and vehicles come with their own set of <strong>traits</strong>. These either add bonus stats or simple percent-based effects (such as \"5% chance for double-damage). We have added a few already and aim to add a whole lot more during <strong>Early Access</strong>.</li></ul><h3>REPEAT</h3><ul><li><strong>World Laws:</strong> 30+ unique effects that change the game mechanics in a fun &amp; rewarding way.<br/></li><li><strong>New Week</strong>: Each week, the island changes, with different <strong>Weather</strong>, <strong>Happenings</strong>, <strong>Shops</strong>, and <strong>Racing Tracks</strong>. A new <strong>World Law</strong> will take effect and influence your experience. This stacks with any permanent laws you accumulated from previous sessions (if any).<br/></li><li><strong>Win a game</strong>: Survive for <strong>30</strong> in-game days. For each playthrough survived, you unlock a permanent <strong>World Law</strong> that will influence your next plays. <strong>World Laws</strong> are stackable, so you can have multiple at once (if you can keep up a winning streak that is).<br/></li><li><strong>Lose a game</strong>: By reaching 0 <strong>Coin</strong> or 0 <strong>Fame</strong>, you will choose 1 driver, lose a previous <strong>World Law</strong> and receive a new one, for your next playthrough.
