What will be the fate of the United States of America?<br/><br/>Create laws, grant and revoke freedoms, become corrupt, and yell at your enemies on Twitter. Oh yeah, and play lots of golf, because what else could a President have to do?<br/><br/>How long can you stay in power?<br/><br/>Note: This game is satire, and is not necessarily 100% factually accurate.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T02:02:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1d/a1deb9e633ef70cb65b235f9673895e3_VJufLMG.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Justin Proulx"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Justin Proulx"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
