The three versions, although they all follow a similar storyline, are each unique, especially the GBC version which is presented in 2D instead of 3D and has an almost completely different story. Each version of the game centers around the protagonist Alleron, who is wrongfully accused of committing necromancy by Master Nola, and is exiled in result. He is forced to wear the Mask of the Accused as a punishment for his crimes, which acts as a magnet to monsters. It is difficult to determine when the events of Warriors of Might takes place in the Might and Magic timeline. However, it&#39;s speculated that it takes place in between Heroes of Might and Magic III and Heroes IV.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-15T04:58:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/403/403d405fc64e6a1ec3f377e2e164ef75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 4, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 298, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2", "PlayStation", "Game Boy Color"], "developers": ["The 3DO Company"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["The 3DO Company", "Success"], "esrb_rating": null}
