The result was Umbrellas. It's messy, awkward, and not much of a game, but it was something that I needed to exist, still need now, and am glad I made. I hope you can find something in this as well. Thank you for playing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/299/299a253a02e6bfa93d2be7f99153dd82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["peppertsuki"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
