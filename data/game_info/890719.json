Bugby is a 3v3 team sport full of hijinks, mayhem and fun. You and your team try to win by scoring more goals than the other team in 5 minutes. Score by carrying the Bugby ball into the goal, all while you run and jump around the arena, tackle other goblins, and pass the ball between your team. Use the environment to your advantage as you move through the arena, such as bouncy mushrooms, pits and platforms. But watch out, that isn\u2019t just a ball, it\u2019s a pill bug! And it does not want to play this game.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T09:43:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf4/cf450b339359a79a10deb79d12e08f87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Klenke7764"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
