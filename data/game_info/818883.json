You're all just not as lucky as me!\"</p>\n<p>Nabbit must help the Gambler rig his game by making sure all dice rolls come out of the \"magic\" box with their\u00a0blue-side facing up. Dice\u00a0rolls\u00a0don't really mean all that much when you're a crab. Personally, Nabbit cares more for the role they play in him getting\u00a0extra Algae with his dinner!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Use WASD or the Arrow keys to move</li><li>Use\u00a0the Spacebar to flip nearby dice over!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>TIPS:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Try to keep dice away from each other. Having too many dice\u00a0next to each other can make it very difficult to move flip them all blue-side up!<br/>\n</li><li>Don't be afraid to push dice back to deal with later., because if just one gets through it's Game Over!</li><li>Nabbit can push two dice at once if you can line it up just right . A bug? No! Crabs have two claws after all don't they?</li><li>The panic button (top right) should only be used as a last resort!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Jay Making hacked the planet</li><li>Tealova made it look good</li></ul>\n<p>This game was made in 48 hours as a part of the 2022 GMTK Game Jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T13:48:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bad/bad3ac78606b6a7b89b982109f273440.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jay Making"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
