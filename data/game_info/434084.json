The digi-bugs are only interested in the slime, who will follow you if you\u2019re close enough and she isn\u2019t busy eating or complaining, and her voice is so distracting, that you can\u2019t fight while she\u2019s talking.</p>\n<p>Your slimy companion will consume any nearby defeated digi-bugs whenever she\u2019s hurt or hungry.
