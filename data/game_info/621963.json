You can choose who invited you and what exactly you want to do. Do you drink yourself under the table, embarrassing yourself in the process? Be a deity on the dancefloor? Lose yourself in a debate, forgetting the party? Or just drink a bit with friends? <br/><br/>You can leave your name in the book of absolute party legends! Right here, right now. You can even choose what to drink exactly. <br/><br/>Warning: Swearing, Alcohol comsumption and some light innuendo. <br/>On a less serious note: A rather weak forth wall. And references.
