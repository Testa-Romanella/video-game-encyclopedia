When the station breaks he needs to quickly find another one and connect himself to it.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>In this game you control an experiment with electric properties that can power certain objects with an electric beam. You traverse through rooms where you avoid parts of your power that need to be discharged for collection. The game includes 6 levels, 2 endings and lots of fun. It's very short and sweet, so you don't need to worry about your time being wasted.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>If you didn't pick them up: use WASD to walk, SHIFT to sprint and SPACE to jump. You can also select a yellow triangle and hold down the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON to activate it. These keys can be changed in the menu.</p>\n<p>Game made by Outgrass</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T17:28:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/723/7231539d15e34b95f12d43d12195e732.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Dock frankenstein"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
