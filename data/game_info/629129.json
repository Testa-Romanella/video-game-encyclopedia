In the Arena, contestants must fight and die again and again (as new technology allows them to be revived as many times as needed) until someone wins by \u201ckilling\u201d the most people. The winner of this show is then granted a \u201cWish\u201d being able to ask for virtually anything. The sheer popularity of the show has attracted a lot of attention from the betting side of things, giving a start to what is now called sponsoring.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Sponsors: After realizing how profitable betting on the contestants of the arena would be, sponsors started showing up as people who had a large investment in certain contestants. With new rules now being applied, each contestant would be able to choose 2 sponsors, each of them giving a blessing.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Blessings: Blessings are a sort of magical spell used to increase the capabilities of the contestants giving them new abilities. This was huge in terms of increasing the popularity of the show by calling the attention of people all over the galaxy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T11:12:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93e/93ef6fcef12281f5c66d58260ef2c386.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Leandro Br\u00e1s"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
