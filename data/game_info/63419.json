This proved to be too difficult for the majority of players and development headed towards an 'altered' gravity, which is in use now. The original gravity mode is where the game gets it name 'Critical Gravity' because some turns required centrifugal force to clear without falling; a loop would be the most simple example. Due to the difficulty of the original, 'altered' gravity is now the default however regular gravity mode will be an unlock sometime in the future.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:56:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd8/dd8debbd01814d5e8d877b7a7f3e16ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 208, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MOGA Creative"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Sports", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["MOGA Creative"], "esrb_rating": null}
