By planting seeds in the right places, they\u2019re able to create small overgrown dioramas of brutalism and beauty, salvaging and repurposing hundreds of discarded objects to create unique structures for nature to reclaim.<br/><br/>Players can dive into a relaxing sandbox mode with no goals, where they are simply left to delight in their own creativity and create beautiful scenes, or take on a \u201ccampaign\u201d of six chapters, where the task is to strike a balance between nature and the manufactured by covering each scene with salvaged objects and lush vegetation.<br/><br/>This is a chill game where the player is allowed to delight in their own creativity. The player's task is to completely cover the scene in plants. As you overgrow the objects, a meter fills to show your progress. You are given objects to expand the scene. These objects contribute energy to the growing of plants, but you will also have to cover them in foliage to complete the stage, striking a balance between nature and the manufactured.<br/><br/>With generative soundscapes by\u00a0<strong>Amos Roddy</strong>, composer of the Kingdom Series.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T08:11:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/682/6829b9decafb6c9abbea4ca26480c8bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Noio"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
