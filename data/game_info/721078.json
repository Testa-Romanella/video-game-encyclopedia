The remastered version is bigger &amp; better than the original - the definitive way to play. This gem is challenging to master, but you will quickly get the hang of it, once you start playing!<h3>A NEVERENDING EXPERIENCE</h3><br/>There is always something new to discover when it comes to this beloved enduro platformer. When you think you have completed all the levels and collected all the goodies, it\u2019s time to go online and compete on the leaderboards, or play together with a friend for a new perspective on old levels. And don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t run out of content - there are more than a hundred additional levels in this version, with even more on the way.<h3>A CULT CLASSIC</h3><br/>The days of floppy disks, CRT monitors and dial-up internet are long gone, but our old school favorite outlived them all - and it\u2019s still going strong. A lot has happened in the past two decades, but this fully formed cult classic is still the same \u201chard, but casual, but hard\u201d retro game we all love. Play it now in its best form!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-30T10:10:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f2/5f2fd412ed67f51122127b19f4262f94.jpg", "website": "https://elastomania.com/index_steam.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 11, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 33, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Balazs Rozsa", "Elasto Mania Team"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Elasto Mania Team"], "esrb_rating": null}
