The Treasure is hidden behind a door and to unlock this door you have to find keys located around the castle. To get the keys you must make it past various obstacles and solve puzzles. <br/></p>\n<p>This game was originally made for our university course where we were tasked with designing a level for a game. To do this we purchased most of the assets used in the game. This allowed us to focus more on the level design and layout.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\r\nMouseLookW,A,S,DMoveEInteract\r\n<p><strong>Developers</strong><br/>Scott Ewing<br/>Chloe Forrester<br/>Ross Derrick</p>\n<p><strong>Assets Purchased</strong><br/>Mana Station - Multistory Dungeons<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/dungeons/multistory-dungeo...</p>\n<p>Catalin Pavel\u00a0 - Low Poly Medieval Kit<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/low-poly-medieval-kit-1555...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T09:18:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e06/e06202f25ca43499bd611ac562f5daab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 259, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Scott-Ewing"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
