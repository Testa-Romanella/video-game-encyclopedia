I'm a young and passionate guy who is on his way to become a game developer.\u00a0 This is my first time ever participating in a game jam, so it was really hard for me, but at the same time, it was rather helpful for improving my skills and was just fun. Enough about me, what about the game? Well, it's a really simple top-down game where there's something wrong with time and warriors from different eras are now in the same place and fight each other. You control two characters: a dwarf and a space warrior from the future. They have their special attacks, so use them wisely to kill as many enemies as possible. I think that's all. I hope you'll enjoy my game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T10:29:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/895/8952e0e3984803b37551336aeed2d859.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vahe2003"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
