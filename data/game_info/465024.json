The theme was \"Out of Control\"\u00a0 and we decided that we wanted to try taking away a different kind of control - not literal control the player has over their inputs, but instead the feeling of having no\u00a0control over constantly-changing objectives - and see how players might react!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is the first time we've ever taken part in a game jam and it's been a LOT of fun! Although we weren't quite able to add everything we wanted (including music/SFX, more VFX polish and more 3D art assets)\u00a0here's our final game - with driving controls, randomly-selected customers and destinations, with handmade menus and UI!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T07:18:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f5/5f55280ff872a7a2376b2f39dac92812.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["trickytwitch"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
