Welcome to the current home of my lil game I'm making here. So what is Operation Grimblaze? Long story short, after finishing a retro FPS made by a solo developer I thought to myself<br/></p>\n<p><em>\"It can't be that hard to make one enemy and a gun that's able to shoot the enemy.\"</em>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>That was March of 2021 and from there that little test has spun wildly out of control. Did the demo really need to have 7 enemy types and\u00a08 whole weapons in it? No! probably not! I could have gotten away with way less but I'm an insane person!\u00a0\u00a0<em>\"Why did I give this so many polygons?\u00a0This is supposed to be a Retro FPS\"\u00a0</em>I keep asking myself. But as a\u00a0 defense against getting stuck in the brainstorming / concept phase like so many of my previous projects, I decided to take the past of least resistance and specifically give myself permission to make something as generic as possible. That way I can focus on asset creation and gameplay instead of trying to conceptualize my magnum opus 20 minutes after I learn what a \"Static Class\" is. Not gonna lie, this is basically just a mashup of all my favorite things about my favorite FPS games mashed together.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>\"Alright so what games?\"</em>\n</p>\n<p>Oh you know. Big hordes of enemies like Serious Sam. Arena-esque combat like that one game with the mick gordon soundtrack and the dashing and double jump that I might have also added. Maybe I put a near carbon copy of the Unreal Tournament Flak Cannon in there. I mean who's gonna stop me? Does the grenade launcher charge like the MK III Grenade Launcher from\u00a0Serious Sam but bounce like the one from Quake? Yes! It does! Is that a Walther P99 pistol as the starting weapon? For legal reasons, No. &gt;_&gt; Does that tall\u00a0guy have shoulder mounted rocket launchers? Maybe. You'll have to download the demo and find out.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>\"Why should I do that?\"</em>\n</p>\n<p>Friend, I made this just for you.\u00a0Yes, you. I've been working hard on this for nearly a year so you can download the game, play it, hop in the discord and complain about the bugs and how the rockets are a little OP with the rest of us.\r\n</p>\n<p>Plus!\u00a0The demo includes and endless wave / horde mode with ever increasing difficulty (mostly by adding an insane number of enemies)\u00a0How many waves can you withstand? I've only managed like 11 I\u00a0think. Bonus prize goes to the first person that reaches a wave that spawns so many enemies that the game hangs or crashes.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>\"Where do I get this demo?\"</em>\n</p>\n<p>Just head on over to our\u00a0DISCORD SERVER!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><em>\"</em><em>Where can I find more info and updates?\"</em></p>\n<p>You're probably gonna want to head over to my Twitter. I'm posting updates and game dev stuff all the time over there. Except when I'm spending like a week doing nothing but coding. Then you can get content like me complaining about how poorly written all the code from early 2021 is and my frustrations rewriting it all :)</p>\n<p>Thank you for your interest.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T04:26:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/218/218e45ba76710f7000c2e292e327914d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 234, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["videomancer"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
