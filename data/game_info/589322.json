While you traverse your path, read each prompt and incorporate it within your body. As you move from place to place, you may feel the need to re-order, re-interpret, fragment or reject individual prompts as they come.</p>\n<p>It is up to you to negotiate how your path will be travelled.</p>\n<p><em>Original text commissioned by Dancehouse Diary, Melbourne, July 2020</em><em>.
