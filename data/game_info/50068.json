The time has come for you and your friends to get rekt while fighting against each other, other teams, or the Evil Computer in Cooperative mode.<br />\nCome join the CLUSTERFUN!<br />\nMake quick tactical decisions, create custom characters with interesting combinations of skills and gear, and dominate the battlefield!TACTICAL ACTION COMBATSneak, aim for bodyparts, use varied weapons and ammo, trick and flank your enemies, set or disarm traps, drive and repair vehicles, and try not to blow up all of your teammates! Seriously, don\u00b4t take that bazooka into close quarters combat.<br />\nA VARIETY OF ONLINE GAMEMODES, COOP OR PVP<br />\nA typical game session is anywhere between 10 minutes and 1.5 hours, strongly depending on which gamemode and map you play. Large Cooperative maps take longer (if you don\u00b4t die), while competitive matches are usually timed at 10-20 minutes.CREATE AND TWEAK YOUR CUSTOM CHARACTERS<br />\nNo fixed classes, no grinding, no unlocking, NO PAY-TO-WIN. Experiment with various character builds without wasting your time. But you only get 10.000 points to spend on each character you make, so spend them wisely to find the coolest combination of skills and gear that suits you personally. Don\u00b4t worry though, you can re-stat or make a new char any time!PLAY AS A DOG<br />\nDogs are great support units who can throw grenades, drive cars, deploy turrets, fire mounted car guns, heal people (bring your DOGtor!), repair stuff, bite enemies in the butt, and more..  The only thing they can\u00b4t do is use (the most) human weapons. But so what? Show those humans how tactical fighting is done! Wuff!PLAY AS A ROBOT<br />\n11010101 KILL ALL... Darn OS update, brb! Powering down :(CLUSTERFUN!<br />\nNothing feels as good as killing your enemy with a toilet plunger fired from your compound bow right at his face.
