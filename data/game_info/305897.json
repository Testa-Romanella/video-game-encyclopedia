Are you ready for the rigors of deep-sea fishing? Can you handle the challenge of Fishing Deep Sea Simulator 3D!?!<br/><br/>Set sail for deep waters and take your ship out into coastal fisheries on the hunt for pro catch fish! <br/><br/>Each level brings new challenges and new fish to catch, swordfish and shark, marlin and tuna, sunfish and barracuda, if it\u2019s in the sea, it\u2019s in the game!<br/><br/>This is no easy shooting fish in a barrel game, these ocean-going predators demand your respect, if you\u2019re going to hook any you\u2019re going to need to bring you\u2019re a game. <br/><br/>Your bait, your rod and your hooks are your only friends out here in the sea, and that\u2019s the way it should be because anything else is just a distraction from the serious business of fishing!<br/><br/>Bait your line and cast it out into the calm seas then sit back and wait for the big one to bite. A good fisherman knows that patience is the key to landing a fish, but you\u2019ll need to be on your toes and be on the lookout, because when the big fish bite they\u2019ll run your line out flat if you\u2019re not ready to pull and reel. <br/><br/>It takes fingertip skill to hook your catch, you\u2019ll need the precision of an expert to wind the hooked fish in. Keep your finger balanced and mix pulling and reeling or risk breaking the line.<br/><br/>Each challenging level gets harder and harder, with bigger and bigger fish, while the time you\u2019re given to hook them gets squeezed. We root out all the amateur fishers as we go through the levels. Are you up to the challenge? Can you make it all the way to the end and call yourself a pro fisherman?<br/><br/>We\u2019ll give you one tip to start you of and then you\u2019re on your own \u2013 different fish will bite if you use different kinds of bait \u2013 but then, you knew that already, right? Because you\u2019re already a fisherman. So come on, show your skills and take up the challenge.
