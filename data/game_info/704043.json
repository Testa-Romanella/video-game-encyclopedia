There are sprite enemies that will float towards you and upon collision you will lose a life. Can you find your emotions or will you give in to evil?</p>\n<p>I apologise for the terrible physics as I challenged myself to not use Unity's physics engine and instead code it myself, this makes for some bugs and issues which I apologise\u00a0for. I hope you can still enjoy the game and give feedback if possible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T12:05:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12d/12dd16c97eda4615d29d2886527f09ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ancient"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
