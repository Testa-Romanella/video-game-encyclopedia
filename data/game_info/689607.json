The goal of the game was to create a tense, action-packed experience that places a heavy emphasis on player interactivity with in-game objects, such as weapons. The player manually has to get a bullet, load their weapon, aim and then fire; all while being horded by intimidating monsters.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T08:11:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c06/c0666a56a4d31fe8d0e88578d03615d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["DelonPrinsloo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
