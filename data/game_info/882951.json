What is not magical is the amount of dead leaves Bear needs to clean from his neighbour\u2019s, in 40 different lawns. But, that\u2019s the job. Rolling them in a bundle and finding a way through stones and logs to push them in a hole.<br/><br/>Yes, there are still many leaves falling, but it's Bear's task for the day to clean these ones. The rest is a problem for future Bear. Don't think about it and just push that bundle.<br/><br/>Logs? Who wants them? Well, maybe you do. Maybe you need to get them out of your way.<br/><br/>Really, there are A LOT of leaves. Work is hard for the Bear.<br/><br/>Clean lawns, bright smiles, job done!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T03:53:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ec/9ec4605ba1cc84f82f4a985073040603.jpg", "website": "https://badkid.games/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bad Kid Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bad Kid Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
