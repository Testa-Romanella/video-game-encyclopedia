Cover image by Matt Seymour https://unsplash.com/@mattseymour<br/><br/>A Rat Is Named takes you through a coming of age ceremony in a rain-soaked city inhabited by rats.\u00a0The inspiration for this story came from several places. The setting is heavily inspired by the city of Burmecia in Final Fantasy IX (2000) for the Sony Playstation. I draw on the Redwall series of fantasy children's novels by Brian Jacques for the characterization of the Little One and Grandmother Rat. Finally,\u00a0\u00a0Alberta's Rat Control Program\u00a0served as inspiration to depict rats as semi-mythical with a culture and history all their own. Suggested listening is \"Burmecia:\u00a0Realm\u00a0of Eternal Rain\" from Final Fantasy IX.<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to play my little game. It's my first published one, and I hope to make many more! Enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T14:08:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dcb/dcb0d9fac8d560375573a11d24521468.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["meissnerd"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
