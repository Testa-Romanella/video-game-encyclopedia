{"id": 499195, "slug": "hurrah-hurrah", "name": "Hurrah, Hurrah!", "name_original": "Hurrah, Hurrah!", "description": "<p>Direct a colony of ants to collect as many crumbs as possible before the music stops.\u00a0</p>\n<p>'Hurrah Hurrah' is a family-friendly arcade game with multiple strategies.</p>\n<p><strong>Who made this game?</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>H. H. Magoo did all of the game design, programming, sound effects, photography, and art. A trio of her friends who wish to be identified only as\u00a0'Queenie and the Drones' sang '<em>The Ants Go Marching</em>'.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>How does it meet the requirements of 8 Bits to Infinity's\u00a0VimJam?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to <em>collect </em>crumbs. Your ants must safely bring the crumbs <em>back </em>to the nest before they are added to your\u00a0score. As for optional challenges, Magoo was inspired by the theme of 8 Bits to Infinity's\u00a0arcade jam, \"swarm\", and each round of the game lasts for the length of the song '<em>The Ants Go Marching</em>'.</p>\n<p><strong>Why is this game fun?</strong></p>\n<p>There is an interesting\u00a0\"it takes money to make money\" tension regarding which of the six\u00a0Enh-ants-ments to purchase and in which order. They all measurably improve performance but not always enough to cover their cost.</p>\n<p><strong>Any strategy suggestions?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>For your first game, I recommend purchasing Olfactovision as soon as you have 5 crumbs, and then Jumbo Ants.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T06:37:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76f/76f5ab0eff83332fb50530a4d24d611c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["H.H.Magoo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
