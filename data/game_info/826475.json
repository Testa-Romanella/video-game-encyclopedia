Also, this is my first time and project using it so forgive me if there're mistakes that I didn't notice during the making session.</p>\n\n\n<p>The game is talking about our hero who died mysteriously and was revived by a mysterious force. If you are used to watching isekai anime, this game will move in that direction. I don't know if this is good or not and this game is still a prototype though, let me know if i should continue this project or not in the comment section.</p>\n<p><strong>Important note:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>I will apologize right now because i don't know if i could make the game update faster or could read any comment that is sent to me because of me still in college,  but I'll try my best to make the game enjoyable.\u00a0</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T12:50:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/331/3311f19cddc1977c6639fbd647b927aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["shadow2231"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
