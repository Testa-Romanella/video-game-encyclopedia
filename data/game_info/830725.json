All of my friends were playing a version of that game at the time, and I wanted to see if I was able to put together my own version. Programmed by a fourteen year-old to impress their friends, Tnanks came to be. <br/></p>\n<p>I managed to write a good deal of lore, and make it at least somewhat playable before giving up on it completely. I originally planned to release it under LantixPro Studios, but obviously that never happened. Now, seven years later, I'm posting it alongside some of my older works that I am proud of. <br/></p>\n<p>Thank you for checking it out.</p>\n\n<p>=======================================</p>\n\r\nTNANKS\r\nWelcome back to the world's favorite competition: Tnanks!<br/><br/>I'll be your host, AVA, or Advanced Videotainment Android.<br/><br/>For those of you who have never heard of Tnanks, Tnanks is a competitive game taking place in space.<br/><br/>Each country, and a few surprise guests, send a soldier to represent them.
