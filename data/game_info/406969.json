It\u2019s you against physics and the tricky levels \u2014 WHO WILL WIN?<br/><br/>All balls have to go into the pipe \u2026 can you remove the pins in the right order and make it happen?<br/>It should be simple: gravity pulls the balls down towards the pipe. But then pins are in the way! Can you help out and flip away the pins and get the balls to where they are supposed to be?<br/><br/>But wait: there is another level of trickery! Sometimes some of the balls are colourless: before they go into the pipe, they need to touch a color ball, so the color spreads to them as well. So simple yet so tricky!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T02:56:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/778/77891fe961bda2844190e9343e1a2d2a_wQQ6cOo.jpg", "website": "http://popcore.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Popcore", "Popcore Games"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Popcore"], "esrb_rating": null}
