It will be a\u00a0deep game full of items to collect, weapons to fire, NPCs to converse with and enemies to vanquish. NPCs will live their own lives independent of your movements and carry out day to day tasks while the deep story-line progresses.</p>\n<p>Combat is party based and real-time.</p>\n<p>The vision for Space RPG is a universe that feels limitless and alive, where every inch can be explored, beds moved, NPCs interacted with, furniture and walls destroyed in combat, ships flown (indeed!) and as much coolness as we can shoehorn in. To accommodate this rich world we are focusing on immersion and game play rather than looks and effects - I come from a gaming era where Countdown to doomsday and Megatraveller were the gold standard for sci-fi RPGs and Ultima set the bar for interactivity.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T10:24:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/796/796ad75950f45c237211875e58e68215.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gavor"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
