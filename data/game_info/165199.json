Yes I know the enemy spawn is not exactly in the right place.</p>\n<p><strong>pistol balance</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I want players to constantly wonder which gun is better between these two:</p>\n<p>The wide starting gun is a .45, should be powerful but not many bullets.<br/></p>\n<p>The small dark grey gun is a 9mm, many bullets but low quality bullets.</p>\n<p><strong>fast fire rate guns</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Originally the game was just going to be 2 pistols but people like variation. These two guns should be equally good as the pistols, just different.</p>\n<p>Uzi (yellow gun) tends\u00a0to jam (not yet), high fire rate but low quality bullets, high bullet capacity.</p>\n<p>Then a similar gun to compete with this one (red gun).\u00a0Maybe higher dmg but slower fire rate. Not sure yet. Or not have this gun.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Turrets</strong></p>\n<p>I want to know what kind of auto fire turrets you like (max 1-3 per level). Each would change how you play the game.</p>\n<p><strong>The game right now</strong></p>\n<p>Right now it's just a test of the physics and guns.
