The longer you stay alive, the more swag points you earn. Collect meme boxes to spawn memes and increase your swag multiplier. Watch out though, if you don\u2019t collect all the meme boxes, your swag multiplier resets. Use your swag points to unlock new characters and unlock achievements. All of the terrain is randomly generated which makes every experience danker. So m8, what are you waiting for, come play and see if you can get OVER 9000 swag points!
