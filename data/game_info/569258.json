This is my entry in the 2021 7DRL. I'm aiming to see what's possible with game boy studio in terms of making a roguelike along the lines of Konami's classic Game Boy hidden gem \"Cave Noire\".\u00a0</p>\n<p>In respect to Cave Noire I'm aiming to create an engine that will:</p>\n<ul><li>produce random-enough\u00a0map generation to be novel on repeat plays</li><li>produce a scaling difficulty for repeat runs</li><li>provide a selectable\u00a0combat or non-combat objective to individual runs</li><li>give players the decision to engage with enemies or not</li><li>enemies move when you move, and you can choose to wait</li></ul>\n<p>I'm changing up things by unlocking movement from a grid, making it play more like Superhot-meets-Link to the Past.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I havent decided on combat yet, though it may involve some kind of diceroll mixed with golf meter type thing, we'll see how far I get this week.</p>\n<p>Info for 7DRL:</p>\n<p>Start time was 8 AM Saturday March 6th<br/></p>\n<p>I'm using some assets from an earlier project, and I did a bit of prep work to get my self setup with tools akin to those available in the python Rogue toolkits.</p>\n<p>To my knowledge this project is 100% my own assets other than the text etc provided by GB Studio.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T05:05:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f9/7f9a7b7c9fdb903f5e2d63c21bca6f46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BBoth"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
