The game will be released in three-four parts (undecided).\u00a0 Once the game is finished, I will open it up for download. Yes, I\u00a0know you can't beat it yet. Remember that this game is still in early development and things are subject to change. This is not trying to be a direct ripoff of the Henry Stickmin Saga, rather more of a fan game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T12:23:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f7/6f706a44e98c3a7ed80c50eb20d1c0f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SplitDevelopment"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
