The deep sea needs your help pulling Mother Ocean from her depression spiral for the water ritual to be complete. You must collect and deliver life energy pearls to the Nucleoid Portal to awaken her. You\u2019ll receive mysterious messages, learn how to astral project and meditate with consciousness warriors as you navigate a fantastic deep sea world full of weird, alien underwater creatures. Will you be around long enough to experience universal oneness?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAstrologically, on December 21, 2020 a great cosmic conjunction will occur: the two largest planetary bodies in our solar system, Saturn and Jupiter, line up in the same sign at the same degree. This event, which astrologers call The Great Conjunction, happens every twenty years\u2014but 2020's event is extra special since Jupiter and Saturn haven't been this close since 1623! We hope this piece of art, released on and about this alignment, helps us all prepare to receive the blessings of change, unity and evolution.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCredits<br/>\r\nConcept and art direction | Paloma Dawkins @Palomadawkins<br/>\n<br/>\r\nProgramming and game design | Kas Ghobadi @theStaticMan<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNarrative and writing | Ashley Obscura @hologramrainbow<br/>\r\nPromotional manager | Camille Verreault @CamilleVerreau1<br/>\r\nSound Effects | Margo<br/>\r\nMusic |  :3lON, Margo, Caila Thompson-Hannat, Devon Hansen<br/>\r\nSpecial thanks to | Ruben Farrus, Flan, Sean Lee, Laura Hirsh, Ken Perlin, Marie Foulston, Aya Avalon, Cody Walker, Kyler Kelly, Michael Johnson, Zach Xavier, Clement Shimizu, BabyCastles <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWith support from | Canada Council for the Arts, Victoria and Albert Museum", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T04:04:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d8/8d81e19546c8d7ccdf371279540050ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 312, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Paloma Dawkins", "Kas Ghobadi"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Apocabliss Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
