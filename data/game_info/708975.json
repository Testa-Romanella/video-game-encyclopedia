However, in a mountanous part of the country, the inverse happened. The Village of Mount Athr\u00e1's economy is based entirely on its paper plant and has built a good relationship with the outside cities because of their optimal production. But, suddenly, they lose contact with the village, yet they continue recieving their products, and so, nothing changes.<br/></p>\n<p>You, however, decided to return to your estranged hometown once you lost contact with your father, your only family after your mother's death. Now, you'll have to explore the desolated buildings and the rusting complexes of\u00a0machinery that upheld the population, all the while, a dark secret seeks to consume you whole.</p>\n<p>Currently, this project is still young, this demo shows a bit of the full game, but changes will occur and new mechanics will be added, it's only a small part of the game I'm hoping to create.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T15:39:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d7/3d735b7a337c758dcf81c7cda5082130.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Icosahedron Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
