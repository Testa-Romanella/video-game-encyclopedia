(With some breaks in between rapid development sessions). I'm happy with what I managed to get done. (Especially not having much experience working with Godot before).\u00a0I think this is a playable and reasonably fun arcade game. I have plenty more ideas for how it could be improved. Maybe one day I'll come back and implement those along with an online highscore table.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions<br/></strong>You play as an alien that is trying to destroy planets as fast as possible. Each time you destroy a layer, you gain some points. Finish destroying the planet completely and you will receive bonus points, an increased score multiplier and the timer will tick down faster.<br/></p>\n<p>Move the alien left and right around the planet with the left and right arrow keys. To destroy a layer, make sure the alien is on top of the flashing section of the outermost layer and press the space button.</p>\n<p>There's no way to win the game but you can try to beat the highscores on the title screen! (They should be fairly easy to beat after a round or two of practise).</p><p><strong>Extra Credits<br/></strong>Godot - Engine used<br/>CT ProLamina - Font<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-24T05:43:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c69/c696ed456caadc281bea57b386467b2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jools64"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
