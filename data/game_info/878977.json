One of my favorites is when he plays horror games. A good friend of mine also enjoys him, so I suggested I make a Slender clone but replace Slender with Conan. It's got multiple references to a bunch of the remotes. This was over a year ago, and I wanted to release it during October of 2021, but it never came to fruition. Even now, over a year later, it's not done. The project file is sitting on a hard drive in my closet somewhere. I'm not going to dig around for it, at least not now, so this version is the almost completed version. Anyway I figured it's better to release this regardless, since art not shared is wasted. And it might be presumptuous of me to call this \"art\" since it really is just a joke, but I hope you enjoy anyway.</p>\n<p>Similar to the original Slender, your goal is to collect 8 stouts and avoid Conan.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/></p>\r\nW A S D<br/>MoveLeft Click<br/>Pick Up<br/>Right Click<br/>Toggle Flashlight<br/>Left Shift<br/>Run\r\n\n<p>THIS GAME IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH CONAN IN ANY WAY<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T12:05:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/432/4329d842306d29147f7d43a8065c6f83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MallleDive"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
