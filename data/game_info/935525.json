You can play as many mazes as you want and never run out of mazes.<br/>I do not yet have a timer working for the levels for online competitive features. (e.i., leaderboards. I am hoping to have all of that available soon.</p>\n<p>Roadmap stuff:</p>\n<ol><li>Pause menu</li><li>Respawn mechanic in case you fall through the world</li><li>Make variations for the mazes so that you don't always experience the same environment. This is currently the largest weakness of this game.</li><li>SKINS!!! Everyone loves being able to customize their marble. This is probably going to be the hardest for me... UI stuff... blegh.</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T15:23:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e4/7e426701c3da6ee5dfc6dcea02182246.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bellok"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
