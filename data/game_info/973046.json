All the corridors will lead to a dead end. <br/>But it will disappear... Only if you manage to look at it under the light.\"<br/>In KAGIDOKO, you are not the one who are expected to hide.<br/><br/>Actually, you <strong>can't.</strong> <br/><br/>Instead, <strong>you</strong> need to predict where the ghost could be hiding, and look right at it... <br/>Before it sneaks up right behind you for a jumpscare.<br/><br/>Once the ghost decides that you can no longer be jumpscared, it will <strong>disappear.</strong><br/>Just to come back later, of course.<br/><br/>Collect all keys, open all doors, don't get jumpscared, and get out of that house.<br/><br/>That's all.
