In this game you play as Korn a robot who wakes up after hundreds of years awakened by a small being of this planet. At the beginning of the game your goal is to open the magic door through a stele which is triggered by an orb hidden in the level. I hope you will like the game, it was made in 6 weeks. The game is still in development and we are still working on it, so some bugs may be apparent during your experience.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T12:45:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/415/415ebaa3d682f6eb247adc8684229fb9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 210, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LeptitLuk"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
