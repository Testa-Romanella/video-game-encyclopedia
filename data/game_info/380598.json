Luckily, the red chef can push the blue chef, and the blue chef can jump while the red chef stands on him, making it easier to reach objects and platforms.</p>\n<p>Tips:\u00a0</p>\n<p>- You can press the down button to restart the game.</p>\n<p>- On one of the levels you need to push the blue chef to the right. Don't worry, the blue chef won't fall to the void.</p>\n<p>- The engine I used has a bug that makes the red chef stop moving forward. If this happens, move backwards a few steps and then try to move forward.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Left and Right arrow - Move the red chef</p>\n<p>Up arrow - Make the blue chef jump (he jumps kinda high...)</p>\n<p>Down arrow - Restart current level</p>\n\n\n<p>By makalski</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T09:20:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/590/59085dc3b77b558935988474c482cd99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["makalski"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
