Now he wakes up in a place that looks like the same city but it is actually of a kind of limbo in which Joseph will have to turn into a warrior to face your worst feelings and sins, and receive a second chance.<br/>\r\nGetting to the end is practically impossible.<br/>\r\nUsing only one sword and needing a lot of skill, the player will need to survive 25 waves to be worthy of a second chance to live in the world of mortals.<br/>\r\nHate Wave is a mix of the gameplay and difficulty of Dark Souls and the wave mode of Call of Duty.<br/>\r\nWith realistic graphics, the player will face several monsters with different skills and artificial intelligence difficult to decipher which his next move.<br/>\r\nFew will reach the end, but whoever succeeds will be properly rewarded.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game is aimed at raising funds to create a much larger and more professional project. All players who manage to reach the end of Hate Wave will receive a free access key for our next project.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T10:28:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38a/38a9613f590cdb29fffac956f003e78f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fiction Fundation"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fiction Fundation"], "esrb_rating": null}
