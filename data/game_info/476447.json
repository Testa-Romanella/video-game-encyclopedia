The player will start each level playing an infinite scroller, collecting power-ups and avoiding the boss that is continually attacking the player. Once the player collects enough power-ups, they can attempt to challenge the boss head on. The stage is considered complete once the player defeats the boss.</p>\n<p>Play with WASD and clicking the icons on the bottom left to use the skills (3rd skill only available during boss phase). Note: The game was originally designed for mobile.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T03:43:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd4/fd431741653d67989b1deb62eac425cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BrandonLeDev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
