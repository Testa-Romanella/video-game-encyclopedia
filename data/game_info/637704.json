Our 2 heroes, <strong><em>Treble</em></strong><em> and </em><strong><em>Casey</em></strong>, unite as they use the once thought lost power of magic to beat the evil out of people.</p>\n<p>In this 1 and only level, the Football Court, defeat mean bullies, snob girls and more in waves to face whoever is directing all of them. Probably someone even <em>more</em> childish.</p>\n<p>Move with <strong>WASD</strong>, attack with <strong>Left Click</strong> and cast your chosen magic with <strong>Right Click</strong>. Magic needs to recharge after use, but an upgrade reduces the time.</p>\n<p>Every wave, pick 1 of 3 upgrades to <em>Treble/Casey</em>, and perhaps sacrifice health to empower it.. It's your choice! Just try not to die.\r\n</p>\n<p>You can find the game's source code on Github.</p><p>Created by Me, RoligtJackson and FalcoTz.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T04:00:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/541/541a72f4863d2eec9fe2f49b98c6e494.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Uneven Prankster"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
