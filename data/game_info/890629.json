This project was done under 1 week. It does not include any complex mechanics or groundbreaking visuals - simply short, atmospheric and story driven.\u00a0<br/><br/>Hope you enjoy the game. Let me know if there are any bugs or if the game has issues, down, in the comments. Cheers.\u00a0<br/><br/>P.S. The game has 2 endings, the bad ending and the true ending. Shout out to those in the comments, who helped me with the bugs.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T09:06:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93e/93e405bd301191777695ca75ed411e0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Niven Hedinger"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
