This original game unfortunately no longer runs, hence my desire to remake it.<br/></p>\n<p>Containment<em> is a single player reinvention of Pong, where your aim is to keep the ball on the screen for as long as you can by moving the paddles.<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Your score is determined by how many times you manage to bounce the ball - your 'streak' -  with the game gradually getting faster with each bounce. </em></p>\n<p><em>For every streak of 20 bounces you achieve, you get a 5-second </em>Time Warp<em> power-up.</em></p>\n<p><strong>New features for <em>Containment (2018)</em>:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Play with a friend with two new game modes: <em>co-op</em>, where one player controls the horizontal paddles and the other controls the vertical paddles, and <em>versus</em>, where each player controls half of the screen;</li><li>Pause menu: you can pause the game at any time, either to take a break if it's getting a bit too hectic for you, or to head back to the main menu or quit the game;</li><li>Improved <em>Time Warp</em> ability: the length of the <em>Time Warp</em> power-up has been extended from 3 seconds to 5 seconds, and whereas previously the paddles also slowed with the ball, the paddles now continute to move in real time;</li><li>Controller support: play using either a keyboard or a support game controller;</li><li>Audio settings: change the SFX and music volumes.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Movement: the paddles can be moved using either the WASD or arrow keys on a keyboard, or using the main joystick on a controller;</li><li>Launch ball/activate <em>Time Warp</em> power-up: use either the 'space' key on a keyboard or the 'A' button on a controller;</li><li>Pause: to pause/unpause the game, use either the 'escape' key on a keyboard or the 'START' button on a controller.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce4/ce4e8743169869367107352c403e13dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["JoshyOshKenoshi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
