Control Alex as he struggles to grasp what has happened in the house on top of the hill, where his grandmother once lived.<br/><br/>As Alex wakes up in his parents' car and finds himself alone, he looks at the house looming ahead of him. There's a weird feeling about it, as if something lurks there and watches, cast in shadows, smiling in the dark. Alex makes way towards the strange house. He can almost see the strings, dangling on the ceiling and over his shoulders. <br/><br/>His parents must be there, no wonder, just waiting for him in the entrails of a beast called unknown. The question is, what else awaits?<br/><br/>Characteristics:<br/><strong>\u2022NON-LINEAR PROGRESSION</strong> \u2013 COLINA: Legacy was developed in a way as to create uncertainty to what player will find in the house on top of the hill. No gameplay section will be like the previous one regarding the suspense-mechanics implemented in the game.<br/><br/><strong>\u2022MULTI-LAYERED STORY </strong>\u2013 The COLINA: Legacy's writing was executed as to convey various layers of complexity. Players can interpret the story that unfolds throughout their gameplay sections in a simple way or analise it and see how deep the rabbit hole goes.<br/><br/><strong>\u2022THIRD-PERSON GAMEPLAY</strong> \u2013 The Samurai Games team opted for bringing a third-person camera for the game to pay homage to the horror games of old, where it reigned supreme.<br/><br/><strong>\u2022CHALLENGING PUZZLES</strong> \u2013 Quest and Game Design thought out the videogame's challenges and puzzles in different ways. The player will experience and understand the different mechanics of gameplay implemented through these challenges. Believe me when I say that even the Samurai Games team had a hard time solving some of the puzzles.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T04:11:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af3/af3aff3c7f893b0370fd454c2bd0a494.jpg", "website": "https://www.colinagame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 23, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 38, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 357, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "iOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Chance6 Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Chance6 Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
