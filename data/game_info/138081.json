{"id": 138081, "slug": "cargo-lander", "name": "Cargo Lander", "name_original": "Cargo Lander", "description": "<p>Cargo Lander (Asteroid Lander) is a lunar lander style game, with asteroid themed levels, mostly. The game has two modes, and two more modes for each. Classic Lander, Cargo Lander, and Classic/Cargo Impossible, and Classic/Cargo Timed mode. In Classic Lander mode the goal is to land on all landing pads in the level to complete it, where the only major skill the player has to rely on is flight, navigation, and landing, while in Cargo Lander mode gameplay is more action oriented from start, the goal is to transport cargo from pad A to pad B, and to do that the player must survive, and solve mini-puzzles to reach the other end. In an Impossible mode you only have one life to finish all 30 levels of Classic or Cargo mode, and in Timed mode each level has a time limit. And beware, space is filled with unknown dangers, and obstacles just waiting for an inexperienced pilot to come their way.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d3/6d39c1a92c6644c53c9091fb7fe6d998.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Damaged Grounds"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
