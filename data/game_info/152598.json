I took that, and spiced it up a bit with a couple of upgrades that make it cooler. Its still in development, and I'm going to be adding updates every week. If you like it, go ahead and donate a couple of cents. It will help me out on a future project that I'm working on that is going to be a million times beter than this. Its going to be a fully fledged game that will be out soon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe3/fe377ea47905f23e306866409c36d947.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["XenonXYZ"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
