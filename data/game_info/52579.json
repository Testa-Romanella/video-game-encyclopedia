Players assume the role of a skeet shooter shooting clay pigeons. There is a two-player mode where the players alternate. It was developed by programmer Ed Salvo in his Iowa home and purchased by Pat Roper for release in December 1981 under the newly formed Apollo. Despite negative reviews, it was a financial success, and led to Salvo's continuation with the company, where he became Director of Development.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1981-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b78/b78fb26681d37f77eaadb169a4e5c9e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Atari 2600"], "developers": ["Games by Apollo"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Games by Apollo"], "esrb_rating": null}
