The question &quot;But can it run Crysis?&quot; is the true measurement of PC power. Designed by the German studio Crytek Crysis 3 continues the story begun in the second part.</p>\n<p>The year is 2047, New York, where evil corporation CELL built Nanodome on top of the city and turned the metropolis into a real jungle. In addition to mundane enemies, the alien race of Ceph threatens humanity who pursues its goals. The player gains control of Prophet - a soldier in nano suit, whose primary goal is to stop the leader of the alien race.</p>\n<p>Turning into a jungle landscape one of the most recognizable cities in the world, allowed developers to diversify the gameplay. Together with the nano suit, they transformed the classic first-person shooter into a vast fast-paced sandbox. It depends solely on the player how to complete each level. In addition to a solo story campaign, the game has a multiplayer with 8 modes and 12 maps.</p>", "metacritic": 76, "released": "2013-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-19T05:11:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/1c6/1c61ef4ce04bce876841118580b03ccb.jpg", "website": "http://www.ea.com/crysis-3", "rating": 3.69, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 123, "owned": 1380, "beaten": 674, "toplay": 94, "dropped": 208, "playing": 8}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 121, "ratings_count": 642, "suggestions_count": 568, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 644, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "Xbox 360", "PC", "PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Electronic Arts", "Crytek"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
