You aren't sure if you will find what you are hoping to find at the end, but surely you're doing it for a reason other than sheer carnage... right?</p>\n<p>It may take a time or two to complete the game, but a full run should take about 10 minutes or less.</p>\n<p>Simple little game I've built to collect everything I've learned building Unity game prototypes\u00a0and custom systems into one relatively complete game. There are still a number of things I could add to make it feel more polished, but I know if I start working towards that, I'll never finish it. :)</p>\n<p>The music volume of the Main Menu can be used to judge the volume of the game. It *should* not be any louder than the main menu music.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Let me know if you run into any issues while playing the game and I'll look into it!
