It's a text-based role play game where you slip into the shoes of a character named Aurthur, who's a peculiar mix of fantasy creatures that's just trying to survive in this world. The demo only reaches up to a certain point and is lacking some visual elements, but you should get the gist of who the characters are and start developing some theories as to what's going to happen. Again, this is my first game so it will be very simple mechanics-wise, and I hope my storytelling prowess will handle the rest. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T13:44:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/687/687c6d0e79a325b0723935d91491346b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pitchspork Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
