If so then that's probably because Mad Pugs is a lot like Angry Birds. There are of course some differences though. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In Mad Pugs you shoot pugs to destroy a fortress. None of the blocks in the fortress are breakable so it's all about hitting the right spot so that the fortress tips over and the enemies die. \u00a0There is also a little bit of strategy since the game restarts 2 seconds after you shoot your last pug.</p>\n<p>Due to me being a beginner i was not able to create a level lock/unlock system and i hope you can respect that. This is - as mentioned above - my first real game after all.</p>\n<p>NOTE:</p>\n<p>I was not able to test the Linux version so it's just a direct export from Unity. Hope it works.</p>\n<p>The game has been tested with the 16:9 aspect ratio. Should work with 18:9 too. 16:10 should work too but not as well.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53f/53f492cfb969b55dc14c06cb167f2806.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Triludum"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
