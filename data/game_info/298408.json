Choose the role you want to play (space warship or space monster or ???)<br/>Discovery the unknown random universe, find treasures, collect cards, and defeat the enemy with your unparalleled wisdom and decisiveness.<br/>What have you failed again? Try agian , don't forget to find the planet bomb and enter the secret space. The treasure inside is enough to make you stronger.<br/><br/>The Starship Helmet is a sci-fi Rogue-Like deck builder game developed by LongGe alone. It combines card games (slay the spire,dream quest) and traditional rogue like games (pixel dungeon) togeter. You need to survive in a completely randomly generated space hexagonal maze, discover secret chambers, collect cards and treasures to improve your strength, and finally find the wormhole to the next layer.<br/><br/>Now, the game has 7 fully randomly generated maze levels, 2 completely different characters, nearly 100 cards, and 50+ different items.<br/>In each game, you need to make the best choice based on the actual situation to defeat the enemy.<br/><br/>The only developer of the game thinks this is a good Rogue-Like game. Even though he played this game hundreds of times with all the game information, he always expect to try gain (expecting the next game will hava a better luck).<br/>if you have already cleared the levels, you can try other card combinations.<br/><br/>Sounds like this game is really good~~<br/>!!!,However, the game has a fatal flaw - all the art skills (Painting, UI, 3d modeling) of the developer (coder) are self-taught. So the game sales are bleak, he is starving ...<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:48:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c50/c50cf49b987c7c0e1757914f3d5ed0a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LongGe"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["LongGe"], "esrb_rating": null}
