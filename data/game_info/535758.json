I wanted to create something that is very challenging to complete. People have spent<strong> 2 minutes up to 2 hours to complete it </strong>(not including bonus room). <strong>It will be very frustrating and impossible at first</strong> but if you take the time and learn how the mechanics work, ace your timing, it will be very rewarding.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The controls, especially jumping have a learning curve and you will have to get used to when to let space go, how long to press it, what speed to press it at. When you master it, it is incredibly rewarding! Can you beat my personal best? (3:40 Glitchless)</p>\n<p><strong>TIPS:</strong></p>\n<p>-&gt; Jump sideways towards a wall to always land a nice wall run, <strong>do not\u00a0</strong>lean at a wall and try to start a wall run, it will not work, you have to jump sideways-ish towards it. Currently this can bug at certain walls so keep distance from walls if you dont want to wall run but jump.</p>\n<p>-&gt; To always ensure your player attempts a wall, jump as frontal as you can towards a wall. If you re high enough the player will vault up.<br/></p>\n<p>-&gt; Learn the patterns of the platforms, it is possible. The bonus room will seem impossible but it can be done.</p>\n<p><strong>Current Issues:<br/></strong>- Wall running will sometimes trigger if a player jumps close to a wall. With good technuiqes this can be avoided however.</p>\n<p>Proof that its possible to complete flawlessly if you learn how it works: https://streamable.com/hqrx38</p>\n<p><strong><br/>Controls:<br/></strong>Space Bar = Jump; CTRL = Crouch-slide<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T04:33:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eee/eee514e9a5c0427cd78d65b03e1f34da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["madpolygon"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Racing", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
