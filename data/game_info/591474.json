Why? Going deeper into old age, yes, but also gaining a deeper understanding of things. You have all the skills and experiences you've gathered during your life at your disposal. That's when I thought about Memories: an abstract game representing life as a collection of memories.</p>\n<p>The main inspiration for this game comes from Rod Humble's The Marriage and Wassily Kandinsky's Composition 8</p>\n<p>I've been learning gamedeving and Unity since April 2020. For me, Game Jams are a great opportunity to just let go and try something new, different. And there's nothing quite like Ludum Dare.\u00a0&lt;3</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>------------------------------</p>\n\n<p><strong>Game Engine:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Unity 2020.1.16f1</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Fonts:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Kuashe by Creative Media Lab</em></p>\n<p><em>Gunny Rewritten by V\u00edt \u010cond\u00e1k</em></p>\n<p><em>Robot by Fortress Tech</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T05:27:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da4/da4de99e77741a43aa7e01d6a1edebda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Namida Sai"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
