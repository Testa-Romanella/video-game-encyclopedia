It's a two lane arcade shooter, but only one ship can fire at a time. Play it with a controller and experience the raw joy of controlling two ships at the same time! The ideal experience is to grab a friend and have them hold one side of the controller while you hold the other. You share a gun and a controller.</p>\n<p>This game was implemented in the Bevy game engine for Rust.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T21:49:33", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Soren"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
