{"id": 754524, "slug": "untitled-running-jumping-game", "name": "Untitled Running & Jumping Game", "name_original": "Untitled Running & Jumping Game", "description": "<p>A game about running and jumping and occasionally moving blocks.\r\n</p>\n<p>This  game was made Over the course of a year, from Early 2021 to early 2022.  It was originally going to be a much more developed, connected world of  Portal-esque puzzles and platforming sections. Somewhere along  development I reached mid development hell, and realized how much work  was truly ahead of me in order to reach the goals I had set for this  project.</p>\n\n\n<p>As a result, this game is in a very unfinished and unpolished state. But it is playable, and the second to second interaction is pretty well polished. But the playtime is around 5 minutes. This is because, again, somewhere along development I lost interest in this project and stopped feeling passionate about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is one takeaway from this project though, and that is that level design is not very fun for me (to put it lightly). It's easy to see now why so many triple A developers have gone the route of procedural generation (Minecraft) and fan created content (Garry's Mod, Roblox, etc). Suffice it to say, my next project will be a rogue like, where I never have to design a single damn level.</p>\n\n<p>This green level, \"Midori Monument\", is probably the only level that even comes close to the level design I wanted. And even it pails in comparison to my expectations for what this project should have been.</p><p><strong>Developer's Note:</strong> <br/></p><p>The screenshots on the sidebar of this page are from the development of this game. As you can see, the game looked very different at many points in development. The detail was to ambitious though, and I simply lost interest in this project before fully realizing those ambitions.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T16:16:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e9/6e9c2db28a2728e3814b37d7af24137c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 246, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alias Donym"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
