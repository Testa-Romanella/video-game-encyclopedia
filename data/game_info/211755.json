The systems are a little bit obtuse, which leaves learning how to navigate them the center of emergent interactions. Every creature is different, every color means something slightly different, and the animals don't always respond.<br/></p><p>Class:\u00a0Pixel Prototype</p><p>Assignment:\u00a0Food</p><p>Postmortem: Very happy with how this came out. I\u00a0think the game feels strange and nuanced, which is what I\u00a0was hoping for. The biggest problem is that the animals don't always do the things they're supposed to. I have literally no idea why, but I guess it makes them feel more like living creatures, which I'm into.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4eb/4ebd6b15679c5eb5d71c0d40a987d631.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JoshMelnick"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
