I mean, you just tap to jump from one little space landing spot to the next and we even provided a little guide thingy to show you where you would land- so how hard can it be? Right?. Wrong! Looks can be deceiving!<br/><br/>Let me tell you how this is going to go down.  You're going to download the game and score a 0 on your first try.  Thats right- a zero!! Are you going to give up? No Way!- You're no quitter! You're going to try again.  This time you may get 1 or 2 points and may think the game is kinda lame, but you'll inevitably try again. So now you're up to 4 or 5 points- not bad, but nothing to write home about.  So you'll try again, and again, and again.  Before you know it, 15 minutes have passed and you're determined to beat your best score. Maybe even obsessed?!?!<br/><br/>You are about 30 seconds away from playing a fun and addicting game that is great for burning a few minutes whenever you get bored.  Simple controls, easy game-play, and very challenging and addicting. ! Just press the little \"Get\" button and see for yourself!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:13:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/407/4073722de298e1a714c9e20434609ceb.jpg", "website": "http://www.grassapper.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Grassapper"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": ["Grassapper"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
