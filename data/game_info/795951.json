Defeat wolves as God, and avoid them as the traveler; better keep up with the pace! You don't want to get eaten!</p>\n\n<p>Tutorial(From the god's perspective):</p>\n<p>I am God. And you are a measly traveler. You cannot survive all on your own, which is why I'm here to help. Your job is to dodge wolves and reach the exit that looks like a green pole. You can move by using the WASD keys. I will help you by killing wolves, destroying trees, and building terrain, but you have to tell me what to do. There is a drop-down on the top right of your screen. Click it and select what you want me to do. Click on a tree to make me do it. Though I am God, I do not have unlimited power. You will see a mana bar at the top of your screen. Every move I make costs mana and requires a certain amount of mana, so direct me wisely. The end goal will appear and disappear randomly, so the text at the bottom of the screen will say if the exit is currently active. Every time that you go inside the exit, you will be teleported to a random place, and your goal is to get back to the exit. The time it takes for the exit to reappear gets longer every time that you go through it. When you touch a wolf, a spell needs to be cast in order to kill the wolf. To cast a spell, type the word that is on the screen into the input field. Press enter to submit. If you didn't type the right spell, you will lose a life. There is a timer for how long you need to type a spell; if the timer reaches zero, you also lose a life. Speaking of lives, you have three of them. Lose all of your lives, and you're dead. But I can revive you if you decide to play the game again. It may take a few deaths for you to get the hang of things. Anyways, you don't have all eternity, so get to it!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T09:17:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fad/fad8a696c58effbc7aed3a851f01b7b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Broco8"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
