You can listen to it below if you wish.<br/><br/>I believe I have ironed out all bugs! Only a minor sprite glitch that bugs me personally exists, but it doesn't affect the gameplay at all.<br/>There are currently a few save flags for this given the amount of long dialogue scenes, and further chapters will have more in. <br/>Brace for future updates and loss of save data per update. Unless your browser cleverly updates while keeping the save file. So on reaching the title screen you'll still get the choice instead of it just restarting from the beginning without asking every update.<br/><br/>Almost 24 hours both on-rec and off-rec. (fixing/tidying up tests and suchlike.)<br/>All scenes done!</p>\n<p>Controls -<br/><br/>Movement - WASD/ Arrow keys<br/>A = Enter<br/>B = Shift<br/>Start = c (Start on Title Screen, nothing mapped to it in-game)<br/>Select = v (nothing mapped to it in-game)<br/><br/>If you'd like to listen to the original audioplay I made for fun, here be - </p>\n\n<p>I attempted to stick to purely recoloured (to the 4 shades of green) Pokemon Yellow assets for this whole thing, minus the Crystal Monorail area an addition to Saffron City and the Mew/Baby Mewtwo pic and Mew skeleton which were kindly done by my friend.<br/>(Yes I know this main page is all Pikachu coloured but...!)<br/></p>\n<p>All canonical Pokemon and Human characters, visual assets (c) Nintendo (1995-2001 for Yellow and Crystal sprites and backgrounds), even if altered by me. <br/>I'm not sure who made the Crystal hack game I got the moving PokeSprites, but thank you for your hard work as well, it's come in very handy.<br/><br/>Mew cuddling Baby Mewtwo pic kindly drawn by my friend Kryptid. Coloured and re-coloured into shades of green by me.<br/><br/>This is a fan-production and made only for FREE entertainment purposes. <br/>May be part of a series so may have more adaptions in the future!<br/>(Chapter 2 is being made later this month so I'll update that as I go, I'll be livestreaming weekly as far as I know. Yes I'll be switching more to de-colouring Crystal for it but...!)<br/></p>\n<p>All voice clips for the hopeful voiced version made in GBS3 (Future vers, likely seperate?) belong to the artists listed in the video description.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T15:24:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b77/b7722e9bf6f15a6bc25f0fdbbe3a1d62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DeafonicsGameStudio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
