No time constraint, no cops to arrest you, and most importantly, no illegal stuff is involved in the making of this game! Walk around and discover weird items sold at Cotton Road!<br/></p>\n\r\nCREATOR'S WORDS\r\n<p>This is my first ever\u00a0experimental game prototype and my first time learning to write my own program in C#. In the next possible updates, the game might have an enemy character, money and inventory system, and more levels!\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<strong>!DISCLAIMER!</strong>\r\nThis game is fictional, made just for fun, and does not provide any connection to the real dark web situation. It is derived from my personal and creative depiction.\r\n\n<p>This game still contains bugs that I can't solve yet:</p>\n<ul><li>To open the\u00a0fridge door, player has to click the door twice.</li><li>Mamalisa's\u00a0 grainy animated texture.</li><li>Typing SFX still plays even after dialogue box is closed.</li></ul>\n<p>If you have any comments or suggestions of how Cotton Road should evolve into a more fun game, please leave some comments below!</p>\n<p>My works can be found and contacted through:</p>\n<ul><li>https://linktr.ee/eggyolkbao</li><li>priska.rafel@gmail.com</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T03:20:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95e/95ec5c9eb9eb127a27126ee09683a400.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["eggyolkbao"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
