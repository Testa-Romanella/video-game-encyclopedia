Their history and culture are essential to know and study. Therefore, scientists want to make some connections between the real world and the virtual worlds, so that they can collect data from them as much as possible. One way to do this is to make a data bridge between the people in the real world and the virtual world, then they can send one\u2019s data message into it. The person who is sent to those different worlds needs to explore the environment, history, and culture of the specific worlds.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Overall:</p>\n<p>In the game project, the world will be set in a modernized style with highly-developed technologies and crowded streets, representing the city's new version. The player's primary mission is trying to collect five pieces of the map showing the world as it used to be (the old view): \"the same identical square with a hen in the place of the bus station, a bandstand in the place of the overpass, two young ladies with white parasols in the place of the munitions factory\" (Calvino, 26). Finally, the game will finish when the player has collected all 5 pieces of the map and synthesis them into a whole map.</p>\n\n<p>Document Link:\u00a0https://docs.google.com/document/d/1swEDLRR89EkUqgLp4r-UI3N1oN6d_GQ2GAEr74BFSkg/...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T07:54:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23d/23d0be618df04f87eae560a2844f794f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 215, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bingling"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
