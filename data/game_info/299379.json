{"id": 299379, "slug": "occupation-itch", "name": "Occupation (itch)", "name_original": "Occupation (itch)", "description": "<p><strong>Warning: this game doesn't have shooting because I didn't implement it correctly like I wanted therefore the only way spawned ships can die\u00a0 is if they die from trying to colonize already colonized planets or toxic planets(which probably will never happen because the planets only deal 5 damage every 1 second). The game perfomance might tank because too many ships might spawn after a couple of minutes(depending on the planet type. It's either 1 minute or half a minute). The game can be won ,but because of this oversight it's impossible to beat it(unless you are insane and want to play at 0.1 FPS while your CPU catches fire).\u00a0 I will fix this oversight after the game jam ends. I wasted to much time trying to figure out how to implement universal shooting to save time and it just didn't work so I thought I didn't have time. I didn't add any music because I wanted to finish the game as soon as I could. Sorry. In the next update I will add a destroy time to spawned ships. I will add shooting and music also after the game jam ends.For now just play it and when the perfomance dips either try lowering the graphics or wait until I actually fix this oversight.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>TL:DR I messed up big time.</strong></p>\n\n\n<p>The year is 2400. Planet Earth has been destroyed by CO2 emmision and pollution. Nobody can live on it. Everything died. Humans have been forced to move into other planets of the Solar System: Mars,Saturn and Jupiter. However these planets cannot survive the growing human population. Humanities future lies in other galaxies.</p>\n<p>You are a fleet commander.\u00a0You found a solar system with many planets. Your job is to colonize them. However space pirates are also thinking of doing the same thing. You must stop them before they take the entire solar system.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ab/0ab9c4c15b30aad0d6547dc8979b0424.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Shiftyhead"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
