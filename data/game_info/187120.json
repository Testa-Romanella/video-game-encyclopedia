As you go through the various flours of the \r\ninfrastructure to turn the power back on and find survivors you will \r\nhave to fight and kill the many zombies that took over it. To do so you \r\ncan buy weapons, health and ammo as well as find them throughout the \r\ngame on the floor.</p>\n<p>The game is still in being developed and the video does NOT represent the end result of this game. </p>\n<p>Light's Out is an indie game that is being developed by a single \r\nperson (myself). The goal is to get it released on Steam Direct once I \r\nfeel like it is sale worthy and have the backup of you guys to upvote \r\nit.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>AWSD - movement</p>\n<p>Mouse1 -\u00a0 fire</p>\n<p>E/F - pick up/interact</p>\n<p>P - Pause</p>\n\n<p>Support the game by:</p>\n<p>donating (on this page)\r\n</p>\n<p>leaving a like at: https://www.facebook.com/Lights-Out-1223707784402589/</p>\n<p>Have fun and enjoy the game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/670/67067ac77092ec2097587c2ff61e783a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Octanes"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
