Every time you use your dice, you gain back health equal to the highest value dice result of the three used. Certain patterns can achieve the following:</p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0All odd-numbered results: Bounce weapon. This weapon shoots two bullets at once in rapid succession at a 45 angle, in opposed directions to the other. They also bounce, allowing you to spread out bullets.</li><li>\u00a0All even-numbered results: Missile launcher. Not very fast, but high damage; the missile launcher creates a blast either on impact or after it stops, which stays for a second or so, damaging enemies that enter its radius.</li><li>\u00a0Ordered results (either regular or reverse order): Plasma ray. Incredibly rapid fire weapon. Each bullets doesn't deal much damage, but the flux of bullets is sure to destroy any enemy in your path.</li><li> Same three results: Gain invincibility for a short time, and gain back all your life.</li></ul>\n<p>Lo-Sumires font by Carl Heavenezer M.
