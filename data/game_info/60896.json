The hard part of the game is the impossibility of making 100 bounces. No one can make 100 bounce in this game. We are prepared bad surprises for you. We are give you bonuses, but for what? You never know what we really want to do. Simplicity is not really what it looks like. It was made for those \"who really wanted to experience winning.\"  This game never look like \"easy peasy lemon squeezy\".<br/><br/>Play a little, or a lot -- there's wanna serious skill, so you can always get better and better. Neoncers is a game that has enough bite-sized gameplay to last you a lifetime.<br/><br/><ul><li>Key Features:</li></ul><br/><ul><li> Level to infinity<br/></li><li> Jump Forever.<br/></li><li> Neon  Design.<br/></li><li> New Traps<br/></li><li> New Mechanic</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa4/aa4c27bb3a411a9a2363e2c314e584a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 39, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cersgame Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Firehawk Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
