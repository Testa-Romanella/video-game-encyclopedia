The theme was: Mini Game.</p>\n<p>You need a total of four players which means you need to find three other friends to play with you. This game requires a computer, a designated line and a lot of space.</p>\n<p>Please remember, you must not reveal which team you have chosen.</p>\n<p>This game encourages violence, even rugby tackles. However, do so at your own risk. I am not responsible for any injuries sustained.
