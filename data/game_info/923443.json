Traverse the harsh conditions of the deadly heated maze before you melt into nothingness and reclaim your place amongst the other scoops.</p>\n<p>Overall this game is just an experiment in camera movement, colliders, and level design. I really like trippy games like Superliminal that break conventional gaming rules so the last level was supposed to invoke a similar level of plot twist. Hope it's intuitive nonetheless.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T07:28:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b9/6b961f0cb62ffdcc688e3c6d6802bd1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["kora"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
