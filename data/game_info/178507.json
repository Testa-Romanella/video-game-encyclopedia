So I'm still very much new at this, but I'm pleased how far I've gotten in this short amount of time.</p><p>I've started to use this site as a blog to show potential employers how I've overcome issues I've stumbled upon. I may lack quantity in my portfolio. but I'm hoping you read something about me that you like. </p><p>The game is being built with Game Master Studio.</p><p>The Assets are temporary.<br/></p><p>The game is free</p><p><strong>2/18/16</strong></p>I designed a temporary level and found that the game would severely lag and get (1 - 3 fps) because of all the objects and particle effects. Which made me think that this version of the project had become dead in the water. What am I to do? Later I discovered that tiles can also be destroyed, so I did a quick test and it works. This would cut down the lag in game severely, but the trick now is to see if I can get the particle effects to work with the tiles.<p><strong>Update: #2</strong><br/></p><p>I had to scrap the idea of the game, it just wasn't going to work. Not on this engine at least. I might try to salvage features I liked into the Side Shooter. Like the burst mechanic and repair mechanic are both something I can bring over into the Side Shooter.</p><p><strong>2/17/16</strong></p><p>So after talking to a friend and discussing potential features and such, an idea came to mind. That is something I believe could make this game into more than a portfolio. So I'm back at the drawing board and rewriting chunks of the code again. The game is now a spaceship that is damaged and you need to constantly adjust it's altitude, it also has a Burst Mode that destroys anything in it's path and a Collection System that helps repair your ship that alleviates it's problems and upgrades it with new abilities to take on the bosses/enemies that await for you.</p><p>What I've implemented so far:</p><ul><li><strong>New Navigation Code</strong></li><li><strong>Different States/ Burst Mode for the player</strong></li><li><strong>Particle System from destroying the environment</strong></li><li><strong>a temporary/working burst meter</strong></li></ul><p>I had a pretty bad brain fart earlier that seriously set me back. Made a rookie mistake accidentally coded for a button press to simulated button press. I had to strip the code to even discover the source of this issue which put me back to square one. </p><p><strong>Update: #2</strong></p><p>The particles didn't look quite right so I painted some shading on it and it looks a lot better, the tone still looks a bit off though.</p><p>uploading the new version right now, with everything listed above.</p><p><strong>2/15/16</strong></p><p>Items from the list I have finished:</p><ul><li>Remaking Assets (Player Ship, GUI, Enemies...)</li><li><strong>Rewriting Navigation Code</strong></li><li><strong>Adding A.I.</strong></li><li><strong>Developing Three Types of Enemies</strong></li><li>Developing a Level Boss</li></ul><p>So I did a complete rewrite of the code and implemented new things I learned. </p><p>(so far it has better controls and Enemy A.I. with different types.)</p><p>The Assets are temporary, I'm waiting to get the code just right before I make them from scratch.</p><p>It took me awhile to add acceleration and friction to the controls. The trouble I had was that the function called for image_xscale, it used the placement of the asset to get a value of (1 for right or -1 for left) you get these numbers because it's on a grid system so anything positive will go right and negative will go left. I didn't use the function of having the ship change direction of where they were facing, thus causing my friction function not applicable. I had to instead use it tied to left or right keys and assigned them a 1 or -1 value. The result isn't as good compared to the program doing itself, but I'm hoping that it'll be good enough for people not to notice. </p><p>Same problem happened to switching images of up and down, since the player doesn't experience gravity. I couldn't add it automatically and had to tie it to keys again.</p><p>It's now 4:25am and I'm having a brain fart in subtracting lives from the PlayerStats. Funny enough I did it before in my previous build. I think I'm just exhausted/frustrated.</p><p><strong>Update: #2</strong></p><p>Waking up from this early morning with a fresh pair of eyes, I realized that in the previous build I hadn't solved the Player Stats dilemma and had actually left it unfinished, also the previous build ran a different code to display health. Anyways I got that done and now the Movement/Navigation code is acting up and the Player's movement has a ice skating feel. I need to dissect my code and try to find what's causing the problem. I so thought I was done with this.<br/></p><p><strong>Update: #3</strong></p><p>Got it! figured out what was causing the ice skating feel, brain hurts. I can now develop the level.</p><ul><li>Finish designing the level</li><li>Develop the Boss and A.I.</li><li>Add a scoring system</li><li>Remaking the Assets</li><li>(consider adding in placeholder sounds)</li></ul><p><strong>Update: #4</strong></p><p>Uploaded version .2 on itch.io</p><p><strong>What this version has:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Reworked Code</strong></li><li><strong>Improved Movement/Navigation Code*</strong></li><li><strong>Different Enemy Types</strong></li><li><strong>Boss</strong></li><li><strong>A.I.</strong></li><li><strong>Score/Highscore System</strong></li><li><strong>Xbox Controller Support</strong></li></ul><p>*I added in acceleration and friction to the movement, instead of instantly going from 0 to 5 pixels it now gradually builds up to 5 pixels. The game has friction so that you don't stop on a dime, but also gradually slow down to 0.</p><p>The game is a lot harder, I think it's a mixture of the new movement system and different enemy types. I want to implement either power ups or invincibility respawn state to help alleviate this.</p><p>I still have a lot more work to do, but I feel the BASE of the game is done. Now it's just tweaking and adding in more levels.</p><p>P.S. I cheated with the boss; not only is it a Gradius Boss, but also I'm not great when it comes to animation. However I do understand After Effects so I had AE do it for me.</p><p>Assets are once again temporary.</p><p><strong>2/13/16</strong></p><p>I have a list of things I'm currently working on:</p><ul><li>Remaking Assets (Player Ship, GUI, Enemies...)</li><li>Rewriting Navigation Code</li><li>Adding A.I.</li><li>Developing Three Types of Enemies</li><li>Developing a Level Boss</li></ul><p> <strong>2/12/16</strong></p>I've recently updated the code for the player ship, previously it had some pretty horrible collision detection.<p><em>So this was what was happening, the game would move the player four pixels ahead and if it collides into something it would move it back and run the destruction event. </em><em><strong>(</strong></em><strong>What this did?</strong><em><strong>)</strong> It made the game harder. I got a couple feedback about how hard the game was and playing it over and over again I noticed how close I would have to be near a wall would change and the destruction event would start at different variables.</em><br/></p><p><em>The new code detects if that player can move 4 pixels and if not, can it move 1 pixel and so on til it collides. </em><strong>(What those this do?)</strong><em> It makes flying in the game A LOT more accurat</em><em>e.</em><br/></p><p><em><strong>Update: #2</strong></em></p><p><em>I discovered a new problem with the code that I just implemented to the Player Ship. There's only collision from the front, must investigate further. I solved one problem only to create another...<br/></em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["theotheralex"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
