Some are saying \"Jugs\" is taking the 30-second genre by storm. \u00a0It's free to play, it's addictive, it has choccy milk and you're sure to come out a more skilled milk jumper in just a couple minutes. \"<br/></p>\n<p>Let me know if you find it too hard or too easy, or if you'd want more features added in the future. Leave me feedback in the comments. I'm looking to patch \"Jugs\" after release a couple times and would love to add in your suggestions to make those patches even better.<br/></p>\n<p>First game release. Aimed for a simple game that I could put out quickly while I work on the larger projects (hype TBD).\u00a0 </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this short weird little game, stay tuned for more releases in 2022 and beyond. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T04:32:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a7/1a7e7e5a519103013ddfb078ba9b682b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sn0man"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
