While you are here, would you like to play a game with me?\u00a0</p>\n<p>All you have to do, is find her six times. But you can't see her. However when you're close to her, she'll make a sound. Touch her to make her appear, and keep touching her until she hides again. If you catch her in this way six times, you win.<br/></p>\n<p>I'll be playing a game too, all I have to do is find you once. If I knock on the door and the lights are off, I can't come in. If I turn off the lights and you turn them back on, I can't come out. If I open the door and you close it, I can't go through. And if I enter the room and you're hiding, I have to pretend I don't know where you are and then leave. But if I catch you once, you lose.</p>\n<p>Let us play, it will be fun.</p>\n\n\n<p>Use the left cursor button to interact with things.</p>\n<p>Use the middle cursor button to look at the rules sheet.</p>\n<p>Use the right cursor button to hide in closets, cupboards, tables and large shelves.</p>\n\n<p><em>If you enjoy this experience be sure to rate it, recommend it to your\u00a0acquaintances or;\u00a0leave a comment on what you appreciated along with\u00a0any suggestions you may have for improvements.\u00a0 Without this support it is very difficult for games to gain any kind of public attention.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/161/16138f9c8df2d9d07fce2630920ad152.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Portrait Prophecies"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
