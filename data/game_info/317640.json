He's like, really evil. Bishi will soon find himself in possession of a very persistant boomerang, and a friend in the name of Maximillian the Third, from the band Because Because! (Who totally isn't the author of this game..)</p>\n<p>- Featuring plenty of checkpoints and infinite lives, but get's a little tricky later on. <br/></p>\n<p>- Enjoy the varied levels and Maximillian's lack of helpfulness!</p>\n<p>- Lots of tunes and funny sound effects!</p>\n<p>- An adorable Bishi!</p>\n<p>- Gems to find for an extended ending!</p>\n<p>- WASD keys or Arrow keys with Shift and Right CTRL</p>\n<p>- Bishi can be controlled with a controller, but conversations must be advanced by pressing the space bar. </p>\n<p> -Please note, the game progress is saved upon beating a boss and starting the following level. (There's about 4 short levels per world so it's not too bad.)<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/></p>\r\nSystem Requirements\r\n<p> <br/> <br/> <br/></p>\n<ul><strong>Minimum:</strong>\n<ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows XP SP2 or above\r\n</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 1 GHZ or higher\r\n</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 1024 MB RAM\r\n</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> 256 MB\r\n</li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 9.0\r\n</li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 122 MB available space</li></ul></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T06:47:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/292/2926bd577d3a3722917eab10b5fa71ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Because Because Games and Music"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
