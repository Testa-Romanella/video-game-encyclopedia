I actually quite really liked the project and think about implementing some of the aspects to my main project.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, about this one:</p>\n<p>the limitation implementation:</p>\n<p>The health is a rare thing these days and in this game it has been moved to a way different level, You have to manage Your health in order not to die. To make it even more difficult and\u00a0interesting the time is on Your back. It is a tool in a meaning that the World is divided into several parts (poor to rich) in order to keep the World populated with a preset value.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The World gets overpopulated? No problem, the fed just sets a higher living cost or lower work payments and we are not overpopulated in a while.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T15:14:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/245/245b89045ca124bde16945717d6ffd73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jacob Hill"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
