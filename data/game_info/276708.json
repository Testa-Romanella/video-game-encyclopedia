I have worked in the game company for several years. Like other colleagues, I used to complain about the foolishness of some designs of the planners.

In the production process, some of the early design, later self will feel very bad, and revision again and again, because I also try to make myself play comfortable, believe that others will be comfortable.<br/><br/><br/>------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>------------------------------------------------------------------", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:50:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bb/0bb2293d67fbd3a78a13abe8288aead9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 401, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u6d41\u4e00\u5fc3"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u6d41\u4e00\u5fc3\u5a31\u4e50\u6e38\u620f\u96c6\u56e2\u603b\u90e8"], "esrb_rating": null}
