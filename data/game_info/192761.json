{"id": 192761, "slug": "undover", "name": "Undover", "name_original": "Undover", "description": "<p>This game was made and intended to be played on Windows.</p>\n<p>Controls with WASD and Spacebar, or a control stick and A button with a Xinput controller.</p>\n<p>EDIT: I Just realized I left my debug mode in. If you're playing with controller and press Y or press F1 on a keyboard, you WILL start moving through walls and could softlock the game. Proceed with this knowledge at your own risk.</p>\n<p>I uploaded this game for the Game Makers Toolkit Game Jam. It's my first Game Jam, and I'm sure that shows through my work. This was made in a 48 hour period.</p>\n<p>The point of this jam was Dual Purpose Design, and I tried to handle that by having the same button be used to go under, and over objects. You can go under the floor to pass under gates and under enemy sights, but you can't progress without popping out and becoming vulnerable. A simple idea, with fairly simple execution.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73e/73ecc274cc61c5d3427b8e416bcbe6a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mint Fox"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
