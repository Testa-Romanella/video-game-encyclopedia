Gloopadoop Invasion is a retro arcade style shoot-em-up. You need to shoot the Gloopadoops and survive at least 10 waves and defeat the mastermind boss at the end.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Arrow keys</strong> move the ship - or you can use a controller</li><li><strong>Z\u00a0or\u00a0N\u00a0or\u00a0C</strong>\u00a0- Shoot your <strong>T72\u00a0</strong>flame cannon!</li><li><strong>X</strong>\u00a0or\u00a0<strong>M</strong>\u00a0or\u00a0<strong>V</strong>\u00a0- Shoot your <strong>AIM-21 \"Shatterer\" Missile</strong> - you have maximum of 5 and they regenerate</li></ul>\n<p>If you get hit by an enemy or a bullet\u00a0you will lose health. You have 5 health pips - dont lose them all!<br/><br/></p>\n<p>If all enemies are destroyed or have left the screen the next wave will start. There are 10 waves and then . . .\u00a0well you will see.</p>\n<p>There is an <strong>Easy Mode</strong> - but the game will try to discourage you from using it - No max payback (highscore) for Easy Mode.. you are better than that.\u00a0\ud83d\ude04<br/>Easy Mode will make enemies fire and attack less and the boss attacks a bit more forgiving.</p>\r\nPickups, Missiles and Surprises\r\n<p>You will occasionally get pickups floating down to you - This is Metal - It will heal one health pip - <strong>Metal Up!</strong> -\u00a0and also immediately generate a Missile for you to fire.\u00a0<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Your powerful <strong>prototype Earthship X36</strong> can\u00a0regenerate missiles roughly every 10 seconds - but you can only carry 5 missiles at a time as indicated at the bottom right - Fire a missile to do massive area effect damage!<br/></p>\n<p>One wave you encounter may be a <strong>TIME VORTEX</strong> level - spinning you into the warp and slowing time. You will need to dodge slower bullets and move slower - Slower might seem easier but .. we will see .. we will see ..</p>\r\nHow to get Payback\r\n<p>You need to deal as much payback (score) as possible to the invading Gloopadoops - this is how you can do that:</p>\n<ul><li>Missiles do a lot of damage and are the best payback really..</li><li>Splatter attacking enemies for an double payback</li><li>Killing tougher\u00a0Gloopadoops will greater payback.</li><li><strong>Do as much damage as possible in a second</strong> to get extra DMG bonus payback depending on how much damage per second you did\u00a0- missiles will be necessary for this</li></ul>\n<p>Your maximum payback will save - try to beat it again and again!</p>\r\nMeet the Gloopadoops\r\n<p>There are many different kinds of Gloopadoops with different attacks and movements.
