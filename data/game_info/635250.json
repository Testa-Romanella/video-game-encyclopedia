In this game, you will progress through dual time puzzles to hopefully sort the truth out in your confused memories.<br/><br/><br/> <br/>The game places you in two very different worlds: a typical house in the heart of the 50's and this very same house destroyed by time. You will travel between these two epochs and discover that even your environment is toying with you.<br/><br/>The player uses a watch to travel between 2 eras and alter the state of some objects. While exploring his environment, he'll have to solve puzzles to progress. Numerous scripted events, as well as a detailed narration, will give the player a unique experience.<h3>Gameplay</h3><br/>The character can go back in time and explore the house of the time. The character can travel between two eras: the post-apocalyptic present and the 1950s past.<br/><br/>The Rollback mechanic allows the player to take an object back in time.
