The doors are locked, but if you defeat every Mightey they will open. <br/></p>\n\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Arrows - Move</p>\n<p>Z - Special ability</p>\n<p>X - Change special ability</p>\r\nYou need to defeat all Mighteys (big orange monsters) to get the keys and be able to leave a level.\r\n<p>Move around the level to open cells. Wherever you open a cell, it will tell you how many occupied spaces there are around it. Red means monsters, Blue means treasures and Purple both. Monsters will attack you whenever revealed and will keep attacking until you defeat them. Monsters spawn according to special rules, keep that in mind. There's some extra health lying around, pick it wisely for maximum benefit. You have 4 special abilities, they don't require a turn to be activated, some of them act according to your facing direction (the last key you pressed). The amount of treasure you pick is your score.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T21:30:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4a/d4abf8fa06f4bcf48f90eeade7faa3e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["orion_black"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
