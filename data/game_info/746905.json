This is my\u00a0first ever game jam and I think I'm going to have to pat myself on the back for completing and finishing this (even though its a little rough around the edges).\u00a0</p>\n<p>After looking at the theme\u00a0I\u00a0mainly wanted to create something atmospheric and naturey feeling.\u00a0The objective of the game is to go through the fake gates until you reach the <em><strong>real</strong> </em>one<em>.</em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I decided to put my main focus on the\u00a0<em><strong>graphics</strong></em> and\u00a0<em><strong>game design.</strong></em>\u00a0I really wished to make longer/more detailed levels but I was running out of time. Regardless, I\u00a0really enjoyed \u00a0working on this short\u00a0game/prototype and I might come back to it in the future to expand upon the ideas I have. I really hope you enjoy playing this as much I enjoyed making it\u00a0:)</p>\n<p>How to play</p>\n<ul><li>WASD to move/spacebar to jump/LeftShift key to sprint</li><li>When standing next to a Rune pillar press <strong>E\u00a0</strong>to spawn a Purple cubes</li><li>When standing next to a Rune pillar press <strong>F </strong>to spawn a Purple cubes<br/>\n</li><li>Purple cubes are push able, simply walk infront of them to push.</li></ul>\n<p>Credits/Assets Used</p>\n<p>Art used</p>\n<p>\"Lowpoly Environment\"\u00a0 By\u00a0Polytope Studio</p>\n<p>\"Enflame\" By\u00a0OccaSoftware</p>\n<p>\"Skybox Extended Shader\" By\u00a0BOXOPHOBIC</p>\n<p>Music/SFX</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/352514/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Contant_aghony/sounds/478179/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Sergenious/sounds/55853/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Dynamicell/sounds/17554/<br/></p>\n<p>Code</p>\n<p>Unity StarterFpsAsset</p>\n\n<p>PS: If you are interested here is a link to the source code.</p>\n<p>https://github.com/Jman1868/Ingress<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T09:12:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86f/86f0d585086f670f2d5de4dd44bba8f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 239, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["J_"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
