When they aren't wandering the trees aimlessly or making nonsense chores, they fall asleep to feed their friend beautiful dreams. <br/>And their friend is a <strong>HUNGRY</strong> creature.<br/>Dita is never full, cleaning out their dreams save for a special group of 5 he's not allowed to touch. Which makes them particularly tempting when Onion goes missing in their own head...<br/><br/>Find Onion while eating beautiful dreams! And be weary of strange, sticky strangers. They only speak nonsense.<br/><br/><em>This game is a demo of current progress on OID. The full game is still under development. Elements seen in this demo are subject to change. A true demo will be released alongside the full release; this right now is to receive feedback on the game to ensure it runs properly, makes sense, smells nice, reflects the color of love (white), and is fun. It is fun to see you.
