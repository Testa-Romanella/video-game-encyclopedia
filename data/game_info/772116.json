Reimagined and rebuilt from the ground up with the latest version of Unreal Engine 4, this is a frantic, unrelenting and supremely challenging shooter.</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Challenging and reimagined gameplay - escape the Blackout Zones before you are overwhelmed by zombies.\r\n</li><li>Arcade focused playstyle. Increase your multiplier, increase your score at a faster rate.\r\n</li><li>Hugely optimised over the original version making the most of Unreal Engine 4's amazing features.\r\n</li><li>Two-Player split-screen co-op.\r\n</li><li>10 Levels of Undead carnage.\r\n</li><li>Dynamic soundtrack from Harry Burt</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Reanimated Edition</strong><br/>The entire game has been rebuilt from the ground up and now offers a much more streamlined and enjoyable play experience. Gone are the somewhat open-ended and confusing levels from before which have been replaced by 10 (an increase over the original 6) focused, action-orientated and much more challenging stages.<br/><br/><strong>Blackout Zones</strong><br/>The levels are focused around\u00a0<em>Blackout Zones</em>. Areas that you cannot escape from until a door is sufficiently powered up. The lighting in these areas is somewhat limited and these Blackout zones become more frequent as the game progresses. Can you escape before being overpowered by zombies? I hope so. But don't worry if you do fall, the game now has a\u00a0<em>Checkpoint System</em>\u00a0which means you don't have to start all over again.<br/><br/><strong>Story</strong><br/>There wasn't really much of a story before and I won't lie, there isn't much of one now. The Undead have risen. You need to make your way to Kennedy Docks and catch the last boat out of town. 10 Levels stand in your way. Oh and a whole load of zombies of course.</p>\r\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\r\n<ul>MINIMUM:\n<ul><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br/>\n</li><li>OS:\u00a0Windows 7 64 bit (requires 64 bit OS)<br/>\n</li><li>Processor:\u00a0Dual Core Processor, 2.5 GHz or higher<br/>\n</li><li>Memory:\u00a04 GB RAM<br/>\n</li><li>Graphics:\u00a0DX11 compatible video card<br/>\n</li><li>DirectX:\u00a0Version 11<br/>\n</li><li>Storage:\u00a02 GB available space<br/>\n</li><li>Additional Notes:\u00a0Microsoft Xbox Controller for Windows\u00ae (or equivalent) is recommended.
