As the sole ex-Consortium crewmember, you were not injected with the test of loyalty serum. Your friends were not so lucky. The active virus in the serum mutated and transformed them into abhorrent monsters. The ship has turned against you. Your mission? Travel to the event horizon and leverage the crystal power source to go back in time to before the tragic events that killed your family. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhile you were asleep, monsters consumed your ship's energy source, a crystal of legendary origin. As you wake up from cryogenic sleep, you find yourself in a ship where nothing is as you remember. Monsters will spawn in the darkness and attempt to attack you and your defenses until you manage to restore power to the entire ship.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs you navigate through the many rooms in your ship, you will unlock new weapons and defensive structures. You will be able to build &amp; upgrade towers to help defend rooms that you have already reclaimed. As you amass more crystals, you have to continually choose between stronger weapons or building defenses.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour decisions matter: turning the lights on too quickly, and you will get overrun, but without power, you will be left in the darkness.
