The story is written below which we used from the premise that was provided. I took the idea and implemented a rough animation in Unity.</p>\n<p><strong>Concept drawings were provided by Ashley, Izac, me and Willow.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Environment Assets were taken from my past project called The Guardian:\u00a0https://grenadeable.itch.io/the-guardian</strong><br/></p>\n<p>For this week\u2019s work, I created a visual novel in Unity. The theme  for this week is Movement. The following details are shown below:</p>\n<p><strong>Premise:\r\n    </strong></p>\n<ul><li>He is stuck in one spot while his shadow is free to move around as it pleases <strong>(Premise provided by Devika)</strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Rationale:\r\n    </strong></p>\n<ul><li>We think this premise shows great potential in both linear and interactive settings. And we love the idea of a shadow moving at its own will, it gives another level of the playground  to the movement - why and how it moves.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Synopsis:\r\n    </strong></p>\n<ul><li>The shadow of a boy builds something mysteriously at night.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Story:\r\n    </strong></p>\n<ul><li>At night, the shadow of a sleeping boy starts moving freely at its own will.\r\n</li><li>The shadow extends and opens the door leading to a suspicious basement\r\n</li><li>There are a plethora of horrendous and scary tools in the basement, the shadow picks up a saw\r\n</li><li>Close-up action of the shadow building something, wielding, sewing metal parts, it looks like the shadow is scheming something bad\r\n</li><li>Morning breaks in, the boy wakes up and sits at the edge of the bed, his back looks upset and lonely.\r\n</li><li>The camera orbits to the front, revealing of the boy has both of his legs surgically removed.\r\n</li><li>The boy stares at the shadow of the cut end of the legs for a long time\r\n</li><li>Shadow kicks out the prosthetic legs beneath the bed\r\n</li><li>The boy happily installs the legs and tries to walk again\r\n</li><li>The shadow is also happy to be in touch with the boy again (feet to feet)\r\n</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>French, J., 2015.
