Using the mysterious <em>Gadget Box</em>, Poppin and Jupa combat baddies, get around tricky challenges, and collect treasure as a team. In this adventure, the pair are traveling up to explore the grandiose <em>Mount Glitteroam</em>; what friends, foes, and secrets will they find along the way? Come and find out!</p>\n<p>* * * * *<br/></p>\n<p><strong>This is a DEMO of what will be the first chapter in a planned 7 chapter game</strong>! It's a comparatively short and more straightforward experience than what the full game will be, which is still a work in progress. I hope this demo gives a good idea of what the rest of the adventure will be like. Please let me know what you think of the game if you try it out so that I know what works and what doesn't!</p>\n<p>The game is currently <em>Windows/PC only,</em> with both keyboard controls and gamepad controls supported. This current demo can take anywhere from <em>20 to 60 minutes to complete</em>, with a save feature being available. Currently, the game uses <strong>PLACEHOLDER MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS...</strong> as I work on future chapters, I'll be getting someone to replace them with unique assets. The demo's credits lists all resources used.</p>\n<p>Thank you for checking it out!</p>\n<p>-Cleave</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/InkDragonWorks<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-06T02:36:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/845/845fc0d704d6dd0c133abf6d50af03fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cleave"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
