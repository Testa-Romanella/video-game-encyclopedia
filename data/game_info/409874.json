It's currently more like a tech demo than a game. The main purpose of this project was to learn how to write my own game engine. So after almost 3 years of trying out stuff, I'm slowly moving my focus towards making a game instead of only working on a game engine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So what can you do in this \"game\". Well right now it's just a simple multiplayer shooter. My biggest inspiration comes from 0x10c a game that Notch (creator of Minecraft)\u00a0started working on but never released anything. The current assets are also taken from one of the 0x10c demos that are out (made by\u00a0https://twitter.com/eldrone). Of course these will be replaced later with models and textures made by me. I will try to recreate similar look :D</p>\n<p>In terms of gameplay I'm still undecided on what this game will end up being. I will\u00a0 move away from the shooter genre and focus more on exploration, survival and simulation.\u00a0As the name states,\u00a0you will get a solar system assigned and your task is to explore it and make good use of it's resources. The planets will be randomly generated and have different tilts in their Y axes, which will make seasons possible. Oh and gravity is also a thing.\u00a0 It will maybe feature a programmable computer to automate stuff or similar but that's pretty unlikely.</p>\n<p>Please remember these are just random thoughts and nothing is set in stone yet. I'm going to work out a\u00a0concrete\u00a0plan in the following weeks. If you have any ideas or suggestions then please leave a comment!</p>\n<p>Also I release this tech demo early so that I can\u00a0engage with you guys and\u00a0fix issues\u00a0 that I may not recognize and\u00a0also I want work with you on something\u00a0together.</p>\n<p>You can follow me on twitter..
