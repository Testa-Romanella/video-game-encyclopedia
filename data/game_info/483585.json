F3 to reset.<br/></p>\n<p>I overscoped somewhat and did most of the work on the final weekend before the deadline. Until then I had an absolute blast working on this. I went to bed very late on saturday and didn't sleep much This led to me to feel burned out by this project even though I only worked a little more than 24 hours on it in total. I entered the jam pretty late and that didn't help either. On the upside, I learned a ton about working with Godot. So there is that.</p>\n<p>There are a bunch of things I would have liked to add, but right now I'm sick of it. Might come back to this after the jam when I have rested properly.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T04:44:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb8/cb8a70b728ba4f805e6fe639d98ff759.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["OnyxIdol"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
