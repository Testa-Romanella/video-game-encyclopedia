In Soliterix you play the solitaire game in a different way: the cards are now blocks and you have a short time to place them until they get into the floor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Still the same rules: build entire decks from A to K. But with a different approach, looks and concept.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Instead of regular cards here you have blocks with the cards value and suit on it. The blocks will constantly fall and you have to control where they are placed to form the sequence. You saw that before, right?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Useless on almost all the card games, here the Joker block will help you: drop that over a block and the block you be drawn back! A simple way to fix mistakes between sequences.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Soliterix have a modern visual where every match takes you to a far galaxy! Relax and play while traveling different worlds. All that with nice soundtracks from Peritune.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T02:40:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ac/0ac6384fbef8478198876065a5ea222c.jpg", "website": "https://www.indigoarts.net/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Indigo Arts"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Indigo Arts"], "esrb_rating": null}
