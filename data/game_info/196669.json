I was amazed on how such a simple game can bring joy and happiness to me. I went ahead, got back to my room and started coding away. Play testing I realized there were distinct Bugs here and there. I was going to fix them at first, but then realized it added another aspect to the game. Feel free to add feedback below, maybe I'll come back to it and continue development :)</p>\n\n<p>Instructions: Player 1 - WSAD | Player 2 - Arrow Keys</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad4/ad4c8f795d8cce0547d2fd9b9d09502a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["edgelesscorner"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
