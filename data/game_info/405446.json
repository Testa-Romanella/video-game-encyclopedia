One night, he decides to blow off steam at a friend's house.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unbeknownst to Doug, a silent threat is lurking in the shadows; an ancient being stalks the streets of Penrith.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unprovoked, it poses little threat, but something has caused this creature to stir, and Doug will find that escaping his home town may not be as straightforward as he has been lead to believe.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-20T02:39:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/893/89327acb60abc78b1ab96939f6ff5af0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lucid A96"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
