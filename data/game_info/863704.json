Every 10 seconds, the ship changes modes: dodge enemy fire, lay down devastating firepower, and then repair and buff your subsystems.</p>\n<p>Play with audio on! Gamepad supported! Fullscreen is best!</p>\n<p>WASD to move. Hold left mouse button for auto-fire, and to heal/buff systems while in the repair phase. Damage to systems causes the related game function to get worse. Too much damage to a single system destroys your ship.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T23:13:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e3/6e3b2bf0c0a2063135a802d50cf82b1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Defrag", "donjuanjavier"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
