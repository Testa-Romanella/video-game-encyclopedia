They can overlap. Snatch can kill you in two ways: Hitting a door twice, being in the middle of breaking a door when you peek your tiny head out the doorway. His tail kills you by politely knocking first, then barging in if you don't answer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2022 Snatch is reset every time he attacks a door, or you flash him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2022 The tail is reset when you look at it for a while\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2022 Reach 15 fuel to win. They get harder later on. Spare your flashes\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2022 I still have a ton of functionality to add, polish to do, sounds to rehash. I'm very happy with what's out here though!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T15:15:29", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["A Sexual Pan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
