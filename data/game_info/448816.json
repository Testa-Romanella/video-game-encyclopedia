A top-down shooter where you have to survive against swarms of weird looking enemies (as i can't draw) and I made the soundtrack in\u00a0\u00a0an hour.If you get overwhelmed use the slow-mo power but be careful as you have to wait sometime to reactivate this power. Good luck, survive for as long as you can\u00a0and try to beat my high score\u00a0 of 180.</p>\n\n\n<p>Although I learned alot from making this,there were many things I forgot to add which I prepared. UI sounds, making similar UI , better Game Over screen,better shooting and instructions,\u00a0player death animation, resolutions, displaying high score in pause ,faster spawns in start option,\u00a0accessing settings through pause menu etc.The biggest problem is there is nothing special and it gets quite boring after a while.\u00a0All these things will be fixed later. I just wanted to upload this.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T06:09:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e33/e33fe193ed11ffb8f270c25dce761724.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["IM-N.A"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
