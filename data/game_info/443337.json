Why did you make THIS game?<br/></strong>Because like everyone stuck at home during the COVID-19 quarantine, I\u00a0had to find some hobby into which I\u00a0could pour my time.<strong>\u00a0 </strong>This game was made entirely during the pandemic.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Is this a remake?\r\n</strong>Seriously?\u00a0 First of all, the title is different!\u00a0 There's a colon in the title sometimes.\u00a0 And, the hero in the image looks nothing like that other guy, because our guy has\u00a0a pipe and mustache.\u00a0 To top if off, all of the monsters are all\u00a0significantly\u00a0different.\u00a0 Take a look at some of the totally original and certainly not ripped\u00a0monsters you'll encounter.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Anything different?<br/></strong>Again, totally original.\u00a0 I'm sure this won't remind you of a particular game.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Is this a remaster?<br/></strong>Anything I make can <strong><em>only </em></strong>ever be seriously considered\u00a0an \"unmaster\" or a \"demaster.\"</p>\n<p><strong>5. When will it be finished?</strong><br/>It is finished.\u00a0 Download it and see.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Is there a better Q&amp;A I\u00a0can consult?<br/></strong>Maybe.\u00a0 Hard to recall, though.\u00a0 It might be in the files of the game somewhere, probably in a QA directory.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Is this for sale?<br/></strong>Nah, you can have it for free.\u00a0 <em>But, if you do donate, every dollar goes directly to make my six-figure student loans closer to five figures.</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>8. Why'd you pick pink for the sidebars?</strong><br/>All for the sake of subliminal messaging.</p>\n<p><strong>9. Will you update the game?</strong><br/>I would seriously not bank on that.\u00a0 Maybe?\u00a0 If there's something major.\u00a0 Or minor.\u00a0 Yeah, probably.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T04:03:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e62/e62ba641736a98b6b46eb8a032c47540.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Rev misterprmiller"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
