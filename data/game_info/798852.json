The source code of this game will be going up onto github. Why? Well, I personally believe that games should be open-sourced, unless there's some secret lighting system intended for your games only or anything along those lines, games have no reason to really be closed source other than discretion of the developer. That's their choice. But once this game is in a decently not prototyped state I will upload the source and leave a link here. Thanks for reading if you did.
