It is supposed to be a turn-based dungeon crawler with procedural generation and perma-death since i hadn't really seen that combination much before, after making this game I figured out why.</p>\n<p>It is by no means any good, and was originally never going to be seen outside of my friend circles, but a friend told me I should put it on here to help build a portfolio. It is my second ever game and my first time using Unity.</p>\n\n<p>All of the music and sound effects aren't mine, obviously, but I figured I should mention it in some way. The music and sfx is taken from the likes of FNAF Security Breach, OneShot, OMORI and Sonic the Hedgehog. I also don't own Among Us lol and the font that's used for almost everything in the game is found here:\u00a0https://managore.itch.io/m6x11</p>\n<p>Back then I didn't think to explain how to play the game while in-game so I'll have to put the controls here:</p>\n<p>Move: Arrow keys/WASD</p>\n<p>Interact/confirm dialogue: Z</p>\n<p>Menu: Escape</p>\n<p>During a battle or if dialogue has a response the user must input, they're buttons that you have to click on.</p>\n<p>I'll release the source code at some point in the future, alongside a mac and linux version of the game.</p>\n<p>That's all there really is to say about this game, there's 20 levels in the dungeon and at the end you'll fight a boss though the difficulty curve in this game is so stupid I doubt anyone will be bothered to reach that point, especially if dying means you have to start from the beginning.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T07:36:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11b/11be13e294a835f8371a4b407f5f318f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MrLewisPaite"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
