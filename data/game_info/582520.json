One player needs to host, while the others connect. This can be done either through the same local network (and the other players type in the host-ip) or port forwarding at this point in time. We do not have any servers.</p>\n<p>(You can change the IP and port from the main menu)<br/><br/>When the game is hosted, before starting the game, the host has access to a host-menu. In this menu you can change multiple settings, such as time, walking speed etc. You are welcome to try this out and see what is fun.<br/></p>\n\n<p>POSTERS AND TRAILER MP4:<br/>https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17ouVIZwyy6quiMbo9YsIQAUVmbzJseJL?usp=sha...<br/><br/></p>\n<p>GOOGLE MEET FOR NGA:<br/></p>\n<p>https://meet.google.com/iii-yvtv-win<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T18:55:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e1/7e1e3e6b904ed0fda7a63dfe4c576053.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GDPanda", "ColonyGameStudio", "TobiasNorum"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
