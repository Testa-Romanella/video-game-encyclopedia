It starts right there where The First Encounter ended. Sam is going to Sirius with SSS Centerprice starship but Crotem crate-but accidentally hits Centerprice and it falls down to Earth, in Central Amerika in the Mayan age. Lucky Sam, the Sirians left a starship on Earth in case SSS Centerprice couldn\u2019t make it. Not so good news - that this back-up starship is located in a different era and time, so Sam has to go through various portals in order to reach this starship. He travels through Mesopotamia, Mesoamerica and Medieval Europe. During this journey, Sam fights two Mental\u2019s (who is the main antagonist of the game) portal guardians: Mayan spirit called Kukulkan and the Wind God Exotech Larva. At the end of the game in front of the Cathedral of Sacred Blood Sam fights Mordekai the Summoner which is the last obstacle to reach the Holy Grail. <br />\nThe Second Encounter has not only new locations compared to the first game, but also adds new weapons and new monsters to shoot.</p>", "metacritic": 85, "released": "2002-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-21T22:20:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/68e/68e7d64c8b37ae0de3616aca74cc4bba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.02, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 94, "owned": 2303, "beaten": 522, "toplay": 34, "dropped": 112, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 499, "suggestions_count": 450, "game_series_count": 20, "reviews_count": 504, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Croteam"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Devolver Digital"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
