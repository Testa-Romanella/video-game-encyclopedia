Fight various unique enemies, customise your Dummy, manoeuvre around the arenas, beat the campaign\u00a0and defeat your friends in the various gamemodes.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>The Arena is a testing-ground for your tools:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><em>Hammer</em>: When swung, this creates a concussive blast around you, throwing you and all you enemies into the air, draining the energy from your opponents.</li><li><em>Assault Rifle</em>: A precise, full-auto rifle that is effective in the hands of those with strong trigger discipline.</li><li><em>Shotgun</em>: While called a shotgun, it's technically a railgun. But we don't care, all we know is it breaks stuff good.</li><li><em>Pistol</em>: In a pinch? Whip out this\u00a0ole reliable and spray bullets as fast as you can pull the trigger!</li><li><em>Grapple Gun</em>: Shoulder mounted, meaning you don't have to stop destroying everything to zoom across the arena.</li><li><em>Friction Manipulation Boots</em>: Due to the nature of the boots equipped to your Dummy, you have the ability\u00a0 to slide to avoid gunfire and reach closed off areas.\u00a0\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Singleplayer:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><em>Test mode</em>: Fight through 3 arenas, collecting your equipment as you go along, to then confront a boss at the end of it all.</li><li><em>Boss Rush</em>: Fight all 4 of the bosses one after the other, a test of your ability to stay alive and utilise the sandbox.</li><li><em>Endless</em>: Fight through endless waves of enemies until you die. With the occasional boss thrown into the mix. And by occasional, we mean very frequent.</li></ul>\n\n\n<p><strong>Multiplayer (Coming Soon):</strong></p>\n<ul><li><em>Equipment Test</em>: A 6 player free-for-all gamemode - kill as many other Dummies as you can in the time limit.</li><li><em>Training Sequence</em>: 3v3 deathmatch, but with chaos surgically added into the mix. Start with only your hammers and compete to control the large, open map, unlocking weapons for your team, and powerups for yourself.</li><li><em>Showdown</em>: Had a disagreement with someone? Resolve it peacefully, and challenge them to a 1v1 match, each starting with all your equipment, and playing in a claustrophobic arena until one of you dies.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Lead Developer: Acidman0123</li><li>Composer: Harribarry101</li><li>3D Models: chillilegoman</li><li>Playtesters: Boof308, Jonbang</li></ul>\n\n\n<p><strong>Specs, Controls, and Technical Issues:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Specs:</em></p>\n<p>I suspect you could run it on lower end systems than this, I wasn't sure of the threshold below my Laptop of which this would be unplayable.
