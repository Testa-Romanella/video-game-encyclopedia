I am trying to learn how to use Unreal Engine, and for this purpose I have created this game. It is a very simple item collection game. And only has 2 levels. The entire game can be completed in a few minutes. Still, I have tried to make the levels interesting enough to explore for a bit. As well as added a timer, so you can try to find the quickest ways to complete the levels.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T05:20:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4b/d4bc7f6933deb0b7718071576102a7d1.jpg", "website": "http://thefirststep.niftyredpanda.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 4, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nifty Red Panda"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Nifty Red Panda"], "esrb_rating": null}
