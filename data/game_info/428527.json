{"id": 428527, "slug": "bungee-spider", "name": "Bungee Spider", "name_original": "Bungee Spider", "description": "<p>Take control of Parker, a small fruit-hungry spider, by tilting your device to swing left or right and move it vertically to bounce up and down. The more you move the bigger bounce!</p>\n<p>Your objective is to eat as many fruit as you can before the buffet closes. While eating fruit is beneficial to your health, our dietitians warn about the risks that come with eating too much: It\u2019s a little known fact that those who spend more time in a buffet are more likely to get hit by a huge water drop or stung by angry wasps.</p>\n<p>According to some experts, this game is best played standing up, so make sure you have enough room around you, and remember to hold onto your device tight! The actual gameplay is fully motion controlled, so feel free to grab your mobile phone/tablet/flat screen tv with both of your hands.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T16:28:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/420/4202a0d308ffc2343dff68806f88688f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Outgunned Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
