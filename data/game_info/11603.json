Desperately looking to break the stalemate the TDF has developed an advanced prototype ship with unique capabilities: the Orion.  You, the Orion's pilot, are part of the first TDF battlegroup to encounter a new and hostile alien race; the Arckin.  With both human factions weakened by decades of war a desperate struggle begins against the Arckin, who appear unstoppable and merciless in their destruction of every human ship and colony they encounter.<br/><br/>CustomizationThe Orion was designed around a new philosophy in starfighter engineering; the idea that he who most easily adapts is victorious, and adaptability is achieved through modularity.
