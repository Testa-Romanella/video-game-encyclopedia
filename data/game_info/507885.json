We originally did the blueprints like this just to get an idea where to build out the rooms, but it's pretty interesting in it's own right so we'll leave this view long-term. We're doing some improvements to the basic gameplay right now but we've just cut a v0.01</p>\n<p>The [Escape] key will pull up the menu and you can select any deck from the ship.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy it. We're working on a v0.02 that we'll hope to follow on with shortly.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T05:24:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c31/c31f6a6771cf54408426935eb54f5be1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UtopiaPlanitiaGame"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
