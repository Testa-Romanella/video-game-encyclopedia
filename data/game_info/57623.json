The game was first released on October 16, 1997, and was re-released as part of the PlayStation the Best line on November 5, 1998.<br />\nAlthough the game was featured prominently at E3 in 1997 with plans to release the game the following year, ASCII decided not to release Moon outside Japan. The game was advertised shortly afterward for a US release in GamePro magazine, but was never published by another company. Despite its critical praise as a role-playing game that defies convention in its own genre, Moon remains an extremely obscure Japan-exclusive title. An English fan translation has been attempted before and stalled but is currently in the process of being translated by a new team.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1997-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-07T14:17:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/436/436a0491e9a1da6f469ab555f81419f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 7, "owned": 6, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 10, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 208, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PlayStation", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Love-de-Lic"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["ASCII", "ASCII Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
