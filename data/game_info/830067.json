{"id": 830067, "slug": "toycar", "name": "ToyCar", "name_original": "ToyCar", "description": "ToyCar is a game were you race around tracks in small cars either in single player or with your friends in online multiplayer.<br/>Use the boost to pass them and leave them in the dust.<br/>But be mindful of the temperature and let off the throttle to cool it down a bit before giving it the full beans again, we do not want the engine to go boom do we?<h3>50% Volume</h3>This game start out at 50% volume and not 100% like most others.<br/>No need to blast new players with over the top audio IMHO.<br/>Head in to the Options and change that if you want or need to.<h3>Car color</h3>And while you are in the options, you might as well choose a car color.<h3>Single player vs. AIs</h3>You can race in single player against AIs to hone those skills.<br/>The AIs are are nice and respectful (Sometimes...) but if you are to slow they will make you regret that granny driving.<h3>Online Multiplayer</h3>You can race against your friends and see who REALLY has the racing skills.<br/>Up to 8 players can race against each other at once.<br/>You can race against players that are not in your friends list using <strong>Click to copy Lobby Code</strong> in the host menu, give that to new friends and they can paste that into the <strong>Lobby Code</strong>. A great way to connect with players when streaming for example.<h3>Online Multiplayer and AI together</h3>If you want some more competition, just check the box to fill up the rest of the online grid with AI cars.<br/>AI cars does not like granny driving here either, so floor it it or get shunted to the next Zip Code.<h3>Tracks</h3>Race around in farmland, tropical or take on the winter one with very narrow track for those incredible daring overtakes.<br/>Or how about some asphalt ripping action in the iconic Italian inspired track.<br/>Perhaps some Japanese sounds good. Don't worry about the dragon, he is just there to watch the race, and cheer you on.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T04:07:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd4/bd406bfb0ab5ff183c6f677f4fab9d0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hadoukanen"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hadoukanen"], "esrb_rating": null}
