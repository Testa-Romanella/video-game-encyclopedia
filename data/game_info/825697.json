Your objective is to eliminate any hostile tanks. But remember that whenever you shoot - your enemies will shoot too. Moreover you can easily hit yourself with your own bullets or destroy your tank with a bomb or by driving on your own mines. So basically you're your own enemy, perhaps even more dangerous than your actual enemies. Instructions on how to play are available in-game.</p><p>Made for MiniJam in 3 days.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T07:20:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/162/162f86ab0b3b3fa03acb8aaec4309ba1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["saginbek_i"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
