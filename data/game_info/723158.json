There are only 5 (short) levels in this game.<br/></p>\n<p>Goal: Guide the Green Circle to the Orange Hexagon by enabling and disabling the Yellow obstacles.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>* Click on the Yellow Obstacles to enable or disable them.</p>\n<p>* Press Space to pause the game.</p>\n<p>* Press Escape to quit the game.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>This game was made for a class at the University of Utah known as \"Experimental Gameplay\", which challenges students to make short games with unique mechanics using a gamejam-like format.<br/></p>\n<p>The prompt for this game was Futurism. I took inspiration from how the Futurism art style often attempted to portray motion in a static piece. I chose to invert this idea and made a game where the challenge exists in the lack of motion. The objects in the game only move once every 2 seconds, but you must try and predict the paths they will take to succeed.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T05:09:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e00/e00bb431104afeae5846b3d43acf90cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Quiloren"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
