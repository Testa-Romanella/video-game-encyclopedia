However, our chicken friend runs out of stamina the longer she goes. What's a parent's best method to regain stamina? Taking care of their kids (maybe)! Collect the chicks along the way to replenish your stamina, and get to your hunky golden chicken goal. There are currently three levels, but I'm hoping to add more later!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assets were from free from the Unity asset store and I made the UI elements myself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T03:50:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d06/d066135e4e500f0a9505c41d2f9d1c1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fiona Soetrisno"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
