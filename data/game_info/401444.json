Balls spawning from the right and we have to detroy them using a Cannon with 2D physics. We can also adquire power ups that will grant us some fire power during some time.</p><p>To complete a level we have to survive 1 minute without allowing the balls going to the left side of the screen. Each time a ball reaches the left edge of the screen, we lose one life. Player starts with 3 lives each game and they are represented by hearts at the top left corner.</p>\n<p>Any feedback is wellcome, this is an early prototype and graphics and lots of things will be improved in the future.</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0Use the mouse to aim and hold left button to charge the cannon. Release the button to shoot the bullet!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-30T02:07:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32a/32a5456c8897aa4712688a231194e11c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dukebot"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
