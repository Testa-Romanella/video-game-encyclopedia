I started not even knowing what a bool was. Now, for a programming final, this is the first fully scripted demo I've made without any assistance.\u00a0I'm trying to get a full time job in game design, and most applications have\u00a0\"Experience with C++, C#, Lua, or other scripting language\" required.\u00a0 I\u00a0wanted to use this to prove that.</p>\n<p>Since the goal was to show what I'm capable of programming,\u00a0I focused on putting in as wide a range of features as I\u00a0could. I tried to 'make an animation' or 'script a graphical change' for every event; and I\u00a0made sure that the timing of each transition aligned with any audio-clips or other animations.</p>\n<p>If you're a developer (either indie or professional), please leave\u00a0any feedback/tips/suggestions you have! My next project is to show\u00a0what I'm capable of designing. I'm going to put in a couple different, basic systems (player growth system, economy system with monster loot and a store of consumables, monsters get stronger, ect.)\u00a0and a few levels, so any thoughts on what would provide a good \"general game design\" portfolio piece would be especially helpful.</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Assets Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Audio</p>\n<p>SoundBits Free FX Collection</p>\n<p>Sprites</p>\n<p>All except the enemy alien were by Matt Walkden.
