This game is mostly about observing and asking yourself questions.</p>\n<p>It is my first attempt to create a complete story-driven game. I also absolutely wanted to create a procedural creature generator so here is the result! Actually writing the story takes so much more time than expected!</p>\n<p><strong>KNOWN ISSUES<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>If you get through the text to fast, the game may crash (wait at least that one creature is generated before continuing)</li><li>Some typos, spelling and grammar errors (English is not my\u00a0native tongue)</li><li>The UI is not as much responsive as I wanted, so you may have some issues on small screens.</li><li>Sometimes, some SALFs appear from nowhere.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>TOOLS USED\r\n</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Engine:</strong> Godot Engine</li><li><strong>Draw:</strong> Inkscape &amp; Krita<br/></li><li><strong>Music: </strong>Orca &amp; Pilot</li><li><strong>Sounds: </strong>rFXGen</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T08:10:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e4/3e4d04cf64f93da36b159d449292ab03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["rmonthil & games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
