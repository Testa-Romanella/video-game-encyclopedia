This only works if you have a sword equipped, indicated by a red ring around a solid green square, which you can tap on to change what weapon you have. Every time you hit an enemy the weapon in your hand will deteriorate a little.</p>\n<p>if you tap enough times on an enemy when you do not have a sword equipped they will fall back, and either switch out with an enemy behind them or be knocked out for a round or two.\u00a0 If you tap on them just as their weapon flashes they will be disarmed for a moment.</p>\n<p>Check out the devlog for notes and upcoming changes as I flesh this game out!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T06:09:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c3/2c3d5016bf2aefda4e07eb26ff00ec04.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Trasjfire Games"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
