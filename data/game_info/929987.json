The local police are doing nothing about it, so it's up to you to save the day. Will you be able to solve the mystery before it's too late?<br/></p>\n<p>This is my entry for\u00a0the Enigma Game Jam, where the theme was 'Supernatural'.</p>\n<p>I've chosen to interpret that to create a fun text-based detective adventure where you have to collect clues that will allow you to solve the mystery of the Thornfield Disappearances. Make choices and follow branching story options to gather the necessary.</p><p>This demo version is a standalone contained story that will hopefully give you a taste of what to expect from a full version.</p>\n<p>I'm hoping to keep working on the game and release a full version somewhere down the line. If you're interested in following me in the meantime, here's my website! And if you wanted to donate anything (you really don't have to), you can do so here :)</p>\n<p><strong>Important note:\u00a0</strong>You will need to download ALL files (including the music and images) in order to play this game.
