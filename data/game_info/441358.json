I removed the game because I was no longer willing to be complicit with Valve's weak and hands-off approach to dealing with toxic and hateful communities on this platform. Video games have fostered an extremely problematic sub-culture and it is this industry's responsibility to do everything it can to tackle this problem.<h3>VERSUS MODE</h3><br/>Wrestle your friends in 2-4 player local multiplayer. The perfect way to settle a dispute, prove your skills, or just unwind with a friend! (multiplayer requires a controller for each extra player)<br/><br/>Every time you play you'll get a brand new procedurally generated titan: no two titans are ever the same, and the same goes for every fight.<h3>CREATIVE MODE</h3><br/>Dive into the creative mode to create yourself a custom titan from scratch. Give it new physical mutations and special abilities. Then take it out for a stroll through the neighbourhood to create as much damage as you possibly can!<br/><br/>A complex per-limb control system and a fully physics-based world make this an experience unlike anything you have played.<br/><br/>Hours of fun await you in Test Tube Titans: Taster Trial!<br/><br/>Trailer footage courtesy of Drae - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf34RAQ35zs", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T06:10:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/113/113ebbbf810af1218cc4c0bce33ee378.jpg", "website": "http://ghosttimegames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 198, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Ghost Time Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Ghost Time Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
