It was a Ph.D. dissertation in information science (research 2003-2008) that lead to significant findings on the immersive virtual environment (XR) design factors of <strong><em>information fidelity</em></strong> and <strong><em>navigational freedom</em></strong>\u00a0 on informal learning outcomes and emotions.</p>\n<p> <strong>Real Virtual Comparison on Learning: </strong>A pilot study  showed that the real field trip   outperformed the virtual in total learning, but  when virtual content was   identical to the real content the learning outcomes were the same. Priming, transfer, and reinforcement were learning outcomes, which indicated that the best educational practices are to    use the virtual and real experiences together\u00a0to prime, transfer, and reinforce the real, not as a replacement for\u00a0the\u00a0real. </p>\n<p><strong>Visual Fidelity and Navigational Freedom and  as Design Factors with Measured Impacts on Learning and Emotions:</strong> There       is significant interaction between Visual Fidelity and Navigational       Freedom, as design factors on changes in test scores, as measured in  Knowledge Gained.\u00a0 Visual Fidelity\u00a0is strong and significant as a factor, and Navigational Freedom shows a strong trend. The combined conditions of both High       Visual Fidelity and High Navigational Freedom resulted in superior       <strong>Knowledge Gained on tests,\u00a0</strong> <em>(Mean</em> = <strong>37.44% increase in test scores</strong>, <em>SD</em> = 13.88) when compared to\u00a0the Low Visual Fidelity and Low       Navigational\u00a0Freedom conditions (<em>Mean</em> = 20.93 % increase in test scores, <em>SD</em> = 13.36). <br/></p>\n<p>The project collaborated with <strong>Gabi Hughes, Environmental  Educator,Audubon Society of  Western Pennsylvania,</strong> who coordinated the Fox   Chapel Area   School District environmental  science education program. Teachers, especially <strong>Beth Durbin, from the Fox Chapel   Area School    District,</strong> were instrumental and supportive. Volunteer  third, fourth, and fifth grade students from the greater Pittsburgh area participated in the IRB approved research.  In addition, <strong>Professor Susan Kalisz, Department of Biological Sciences, at the University of Pittsburgh</strong>, and senior research associate Jessica Dunn,    collaborated and provided the plant population data sets of the real field trip location required to build the visualization  of the park. </p>\n<p>The Virtual Trillium Trail is a unique data simulation and  visualization of Dr. Kalisz\u2019s long-term NSF biological plot study data, unlike  any other virtual world for education and a model of <strong>Virtual Nature</strong>. Furthermore, the location of the  Trillium Trail Wildflower Reserve is the site for many science school field trips, created and lead by the Audubon Society of  Western Pennsylvania. The combination of the biological data and the proven  educational approaches (from 1968, Beulah Frey, Ruth Scott and Ruth Boyles)  offered an ideal and successful real world learning experience to model, on which to base a computer simulation for research into the usability of virtual worlds, and  to better understand patterns of intrinsic learning found in informal settings.<br/> </p>\n<p><strong>Publications and Creative  Works as Principal Investigator</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Harrington,</strong> Maria C.

Knowledge and complex causal chain interactions previously locked in traditional artifacts become accessible with immersive data visualizations and bio acoustics reflecting scientific data sets to show two contrasting scenarios - Woodland in Balance and Woodland out of Balance. This Augmented Reality implementation is unique as it is uses the vision tracking features of the most recently released ARCore and ARKit SDKs producing a perceptual experience on parity with reality. The concepts and knowledge are easily accessible at a click of a button to hear the curator\u2019s interpretive narrative and access a complementary website of facts, The Virtual Garden Timeline. The AR Perpetual Garden App was developed in part, as an international collaboration between The Harrington Lab at the University of Central Florida, The Powdermill Nature Reserve at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, and the MultiMediaTechnology program of the Salzburg University of Applied Sciences, Austria. Undergraduate and graduate students were involved in the production of the app. The multidisciplinary effort was developed with my partners, Dr. John W. Wenzel, Director, Powdermill Nature Reserve, CMNH and Dr. Markus Tatzgern, FH-Professor, Head of Game Development and Mixed Reality, MultiMediaTechnology program of the Salzburg University of Applied Sciences, Austria.</p>\n<p><strong>Apple  iTunes:<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Harrington, </strong>Maria C.
