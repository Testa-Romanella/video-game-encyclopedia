The bullet trail would make strong lines and when they make a square, it would fill with the player color. The one with more colors in the canvas win. You would be able to steal a square and hit other tanks. Unfortunately, I managed bad my time and could delivery only half of the features (with Bugs, I know).\u00a0</p>\n<p>That been said, I had fun! =)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Very neat idea to have the art been done with paint. I liked to make sounds with mouth and to design the tanks. Thank you for this game jam.</p>\n<p>The game is project is here: https://gitlab.com/z3r0_th/paint-jam-2020<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T02:45:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b7/7b7eaabeb0219b0690fc56570168127b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["matheusfernandes"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
