I didn't have time to bake any lighting so the \"rocks\" are just black.</p>\n<p>I'm really sorry if the game is too hard or even potentially unbeatable because I just didn't have the time to rebalance anything and I literally wasn't even able to play it (which is why the music is completely broken).</p>\n<p>The screenshots are all of what I had of the game before the deletion.</p>\n<p>Please tell me the problems you run into so I can fix them for the full release! Or potentially things to add to the FAQ to make it easier for some people.</p>\n<p>This will be massively updated once the jam is over with all the features I either had before the deletion or was planning to add in the final hour:</p>\n<ul><li>Settings</li><li>Accessibility Options</li><li>More SFX</li><li>More Particle Effects</li><li>Main Menu</li><li>The Final Level\u00a0(It was going to be really cute as well :( )</li></ul>\n<p>You can look at my demos from earlier if you want to see a more buggy but potentially more pleasing-to-look-at game.</p>\n<p>FAQ:</p>\n<ul><li>Q: I've lost the ability to progress. What do I do?</li><li>A: Just wait around. You'll lose all your controls in a couple minutes and you'll respawn at the latest checkpoint. This will be faster/tweaked in the full edition.</li><li>Q: My abilities don't seem to do anything!</li><li>A: Certain abilities work on certain bullies. Your ability circle has to touch a bully in order to make them retreat. You can use this to interrupt their attacks.</li><li>Q: Who made the music that I can't hear cause it bugged out?</li><li>A: Jacob Heayes! (@heyimjay_cob) He also edited all my dialogue and came up with the name! He's a cool guy!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T05:43:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/069/0692040d6dcb151ad4a63db7f6729698.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Matthew Redmond"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
