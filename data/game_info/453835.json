This is my first project and I hope you guys understand that I can't release the game with everything I want in it. Therefore, I will be updating the game over a peroid of time for you guys. However, this may take a while to do as, like I said, I'm very busy. Also, this game is based of of Brackeys' tutorial on how to make a game and the demo he created in it.</p>\n<p>Donations are NOT needed, but since this site offers it, I'll just make it an option.</p>\n<p>My Youtube Channel - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9kq0TnfufVhJc4WfYEOVyg?view_as=public<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T06:51:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc8/cc8eedfde080065e65bfbeae48c6695f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GameDevlegit"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
