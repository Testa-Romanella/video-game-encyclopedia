In our game, you manage a civilization of squirrels and help them to prepare for the coming winter by hoarding as much acorns and other goodies as possible!\r\n<br/><br/>In order to get other resources that your squirrels can't harvest,\u00a0you can trade with the other inhabitants of the woodlands.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/><br/>- Camera Movement: W, A, S,\u00a0D, Scrollwheel<br/>- Click and Drag:\u00a0Select Squirrels\r\n<br/>- Click on Buildings when Squirrels are selected: Order squirrels to transport resources from and to the building and your main base.\r\n<br/>- Click on the Hammer in the Top Center: Enter/Exit Build Mode\r\n<br/>-\u00a0In Build\u00a0Mode, buy Villages or destroy already built ones, by selecting the respective buttons and then clicking on hexes on the map.<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------<br/><br/><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong><br/><br/>Try to gather as much resources as possible. There are different types of buildings that can be used in certain ways to achieve that. Oakwoods and Lakes can be used to gather Acorns and Water. Beaver- and Mole Tradeposts can be used to trade Acorns and Water for Wood and Stone respectively. <br/><br/><strong>BE CAREFUL</strong>: Your squirrels also need Acorns and Water to stay healthy (don't worry, they'll just stop working until food is available), so make sure you always provide enough of it.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>CREDITS<br/></strong><br/>The Game was made by Sven and Robin. All assets, except the music were created by ourselves.<br/>(music credits goes to: <em>T</em><em>okyo Music Walker</em>)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T06:12:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acf/acf8b7a8c12232120dfda6643574803b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["theLORDofMUESLI"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
