For the first use of the machine, Cloc decides to do a trial run 5 minutes into the past. However, the machine malfunctions, hopping back through time and shedding parts and pieces as it goes. Now, armed with their trusty time-freeze gun, Dr.\u00a0Cloc must make their way forward through time, collecting the fallen pieces of their time machine in an attempt to make it home to the present. They must also beware of the time-cops, the keepers of history who do not take kindly to those who meddle with time.\u00a0\u00a0Can they evade the enemy and make it home in one piece? Only time will tell!</p>\n<p>You will play as the physicist themself. In order to complete each level, you must find and retrieve a missing piece of your time machine.
