These tanks take on different properties of gravity defying as you attempt to rescue the princess.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Level 1\u00a0</p>\n<p>-The player is immediately confronted by enemy tanks causing the player to test combat skills quickly to become familiar with controls. Directly behind the first encountered enemies is a red block ramp with a life pack on it drawing the player to its location because of desire for health and the natural desire for players to progress upwards to a goal. The player is able to easily locate the path on which they need to follow by following the provided ramps and being able to see that the path leads upwards to the central tower placed in the middle of the level. Blocks are placed around the level both for toy theme aesthetics purposes and they are able to be used as cover for relief from enemy fire. Clich\u00e9 dialogue scripts are provided in the level for comedic purposes, clich\u00e9 Game Jam theme purposes, and they give story and purpose as to why you are fighting these tanks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Level 2</p>\n<p>-The player is placed in a much larger setting than level 1 and has a greater area to explore. To guide player to the end goal landmarks are placed through the level to guide the player to the end such as large toys and a large sand castle mimicking the toy block castle from level one and playing on the players memory that they found the end level portal at a castle. New enemies are added to the level to increase variety and fun including a melee ground enemy and a boss. When the boss is defeated the princess you have been searching to rescue appears at the end portal and you win the game.</p>\n<p>Endless mode</p>\n<p>-In endless mode the player is placed on a toy city block. The streets create a checked pattern with the 4 skyscrapers located around the street. The player is able to navigate up two skyscrapers with a ramp system and can cross over to the other two by driving on wooden planks once reaching the top of the skyscraper from the ramp system. This level is designed in a way to allow the player smooth traversal to allow kiting techniques in the level. Difficulty is presented in that enemies continuously spawn at different time intervals and are able to move through multiple sections of the map requiring the player to be observant of all directions. Two spawner locations are on the ground and two are on the top level of the skyscrapers. to give equal difficulty whether on the ground or roof level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Challenges</p>\n<p>-Game was intended to be multiplayer but we were unable to create the necessary functions to make that happen.</p>\n<p>-Character was intended to be able to control gravity but the gravity scripting was incompatible with the custom player input system we used.</p>\n<p>Triumphs</p>\n<p>-We wanted to create a stratifying feeling when destroying the tanks. From our multiple reviews we have received people are loving the combat system and nailing enemy tanks with your missiles.</p>\n<p>We wanted our dialogue scripts to convey clich\u00e9 and story to our game. We received multiple positive reviews on placement for dialogue and phrases chosen for dialogue.</p>\n<p>We wanted to create fun and easy to traverse level. We received multiple positive reviews that our levels were easy to navigate and players knew where they needed to go without difficulty.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I specifically worked on character and enemy combat including putting the player shooter character together with the needed scripting, audio, traversal components and model assets. I wrote the scripting for the character controller in C# through a tutorial.\u00a0I designed\u00a0levels 1, 2 and the endless mode from the ground up and placed enemy counters in each level I designed the main menu, other menus,\u00a0and UI screen with some assets from MSU. I placed all the dialogue scripting into the game and paced it to give the game evenly spaced and meaningful dialogue sections. I created all of the environment and objects placed therein in levels 1, 2, and endless mode excluding the player and enemy tank models, spawner platform model, missile projectile model, tank barricade model, and crates.</p>\n<p>Please view the following links for the documentation of our game.</p>\n<p>Game Slideshow Presentation:\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>High Concept Document:\u00a0https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iaQrCu73519_xpa1gRlDfYTjrmqK-EZmwKNEau_NvMw/...</p>\n<p>Thanks again and we hope you love what we have created!</p>\n<p>Created by Endo Games<br/></p>\n<p>Conner Allen: Lead Game Designer</p>\n<p>Taelor McBride: Project Manager</p>\n<p>Josh Ellis: Game Designer</p>\n<p>Brannick Ewing: Voice Over/Programmer</p>\n<p>Special thanks to MSU for scripts and other prefabs, Nobiax/Yughues for wood materials, Comeback for tank model assets,\u00a0 and Aural Space for music.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T17:03:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8c/c8cf895dbd1d2c7e38e282df9f35dc18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Conner Allen: Game Designer"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
