Use this to escape combo's.</p>\n<p>- If you get hit after having hit a wall you will receive less hitstun from follow up hits, until the moment you get out of hitstun again.</p>\n<p>I still recommend starting with the tutorial though.</p>\n\n<p>NEXT BIG UPDATE (Version 0.02)</p>\n<p>Planned features of the next update are:</p>\n<p>- Sound effects for the most important actions</p>\n<p>- Improved tutorial</p>\n<p>- New character (Using many of the same animations, but different specials and move properties)</p>\n<p>- Other random changes I haven't decided on yet</p>\n<p>(Some of these may be added in small updates in between)</p>\n\n<p>Estimated update date: June 1st 2019</p>\n<p>Game by: Lex de Kogel</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T09:52:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f38/f38b17f7bfe1e659296701a9bd32caf0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cute Dog IRL"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
