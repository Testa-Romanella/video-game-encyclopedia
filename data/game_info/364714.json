So we, the designers at Chilling Voodoo Samurai, thought to ourselves, \"What is the most worst unlikely control scheme\u00a0one could think of using for a racing game?</p>\n<p>Games.</p>\n<p>That's right!\u00a0In this game, you play as a driver of a car racing on a 3 lane racetrack. Other race cars will constantly come down on those lanes and you will need to dodge them by scoring points in the games to move left and right.</p>\n<p>To summarize, here\u00a0is a list of unlikely combinations\u00a0I feel apply to this game.</p>\n<ol><li>Racing controls and using games for controls</li><li>Multi-tasking \u00a0combinations of different mini games to survive</li></ol>\n\n<p><strong>Q: What is the goal of the game?</strong><strong>\u00a0How do you play this game?</strong></p>\n<p>A:\u00a0Survive as long as possible! When you inevitably die,\u00a0you get\u00a0 a <em>very\u00a0</em><em>cool</em> high score you can brag about to your friends. Great for people, like me, who require\u00a0external validation (Not bragging, but\u00a0I survived 3 minute btw)</p>\n<p>For the left mini-game use the \"WASD\" keys.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the right mini-game use the \"IJKL\" keys.</p>\n<p>For the menus, use \"WASD\" or \"IJKL\" or arrow keys and SPACE or\u00a0ENTER to select. (On some menus you can click the buttons)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: What assets did you use in this amazing game submission that is you feel you should tell all your friends to play and tell them to tell their friends to play and...</strong></p>\n<p>A: Glad you think so!
