What is this game?</p>\n<p>In Elephant in the Room you are the elephant in the room. Literally. It&#39;s up to you to get out of the house without being acknowledged. Use your powerful pachyderm skills to sneak around and make your way out. Your trunk is a versatile tool you can use to suck, blow, or move things around. You&#39;ll probably break a lot of things.
