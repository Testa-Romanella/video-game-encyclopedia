Your job is to make sure every package is delivered to the correct department. Failing to keep the storage space free from clutter will cost your job.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>You're in a storage room. You are receiving new packages non-stop and need to distribute them to the correct department at your company. If the <strong>storage room runs out of space</strong>, it's game over.</p>\r\nStory\r\n<p>Coming sometime...</p>\r\nAssets used\r\n<p>I have used pre-made assets from following sources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Refined Main Menu by Inflat</li>\n<li>Office Scene by Jaime Perez</li>\n<li>Factory Environment Collection by Dens Rutkovskyi</li>\n<li>WeLoveIndies (Music and SFX assets)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, I have tried to add my own twist to them by modifying the assets. For example, every asset I took from the Factory Environment Collection has been modified to fit my needs (dynamically change color based on object attributes)</p>\r\nOwn Contributions\r\n<p>I have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Worked on this game alone</li>\n<li>Come up with the concept by myself</li>\n<li>created all gameplay mechanics from scratch</li>\n<li>created a custom player character with unique abilities</li>\n<li>Ability: grabbing physics bodies</li>\n<li>GameState notifiers: Game over state, slow-motion rampup</li>\n<li>A custom-made basic tutorial. A combination of UMG widgets and </li>\n<li>category-based gameplay framework with appropriate player feedback for each case (success, failure)</li>\n<li>Basic Anti-Cheat measures (show me how you break my game. I wanna know every way)</li>\n<li>level design</li>\n<li>sound design (general spatialization, selection of sounds)</li>\n</ul>\r\nWords of Appreciation\r\n<p>A huge shoutout to Epic Games for providing us with Unreal Engine, a somewhat opinionated but extremely durable, extensible and feature-rich game engine.<br/>Thanks to the Epic Slackers Discord community for their help and support when the official documentation wouldn't go through my head.<br/>I also thank the Epic MegaJam sponsors for their support and encouragement. <strong>WeLoveIndies</strong> has notably made my work much easier with their excellent library of sound effects.<br/>Thanks to Kumodatsu for playtesting the earliest prototype and giving me early feedback. Check out their games here.</p>\r\nConcepts needed to make a game like this yourself\r\n<p>Here's a short list of concepts and ideas you need to be familiar with in order to build a game like this yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unreal's Gameplay Framework (collection of base classes and concepts)</li>\n<li>How to pass gamestate along and let objects observe it (pub/sub principle)</li>\n<li>Casting</li>\n<li>Blueprint components as child actors (not needed but good to know)</li>\n<li>Inheritance in programming. Unreal engine is built on inheritance instead of composition and it'll stay like this for a while.</li>\n<li>How to reference documentation and the Unreal Engine community forums correctly</li>\n<li>How to plan your tasks beforehand</li>\n<li>Know when to stop polishing a feature and instead work on the general feel of the game</li>\n</ul>\r\nClosing Words\r\n<p>Thanks to Itch.io for hosting the jam! &lt;3</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about how I've implemented a specific feature in the game or anything else, feel free to comment below and I'll get back to as many questions as I can.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T13:58:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66b/66b621d983165d4d0f20084de48e31e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zenahr"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
