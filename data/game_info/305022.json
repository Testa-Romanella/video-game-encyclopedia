The theme was \"What Home means to you\".\u00a0 Home is different for everybody, because everybody has experienced home differently. That's how we came to the conclusion that home is really just an accumulation of experiences. We attempt to simulate that idea by allowing you to collect objects to build your home. Also, you can learn a few bird facts if you want.</p>\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anderson Fischer - Systems and Feel Design</p>\n<p>Dakota Stoner - Level Design, UI Programmer/Design</p>\n<p>Jack Melcher - Art, Design</p>\n<p>Todd Dickinson - Programmer, Level/Gameplay Designer</p>\n<p>Living Birds by DINOPUNCH on the Unity Asset Store</p>\n<p>Fantasy Skybox Free by G.E.
