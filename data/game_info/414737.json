{"id": 414737, "slug": "the-virtual-ucf-arboretum", "name": "The Virtual UCF Arboretum", "name_original": "The Virtual UCF Arboretum", "description": "<p><strong>The Virtual UCF Arboretum</strong> <strong>Project</strong> (2016 \u2013 present) is a Virtual Nature model annotated to work as an educational simulation. Constructed as a large open world, using sparse GIS data sets required for information fusion and domain expertise to achieve accuracy and realism, the data are visualized with photorealistic accuracy to match the real environment. The ambient bioacoustics are accurate representations of insects, amphibians, and birds found in the environment. All photorealistic 3D plant models are botanically correct, and each is dispersed using actual plant population data to simulate realistic dispersion and densities. The 100 hectare (247 acres) virtual model was constructed in the Unreal game engine. The virtual environment is unique because it integrates a complementary website with a digital media plant atlas that includes facts and concepts, which allows individual users to pursue deeper inquiry at the moment of personal encounter and curiosity.   \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>How to use: </strong>\u00a0The Unreal Engine model can be used on any VR ready PC, with graphic cards comparable to the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070, or more powerful. Once you download and install it, users can select the <strong>Escape key</strong> to open the <strong>Help Menu</strong>. Use the arrow keys to move around the open world, and at any plant where the cross hairs turn bright green you can click with the mouse to open the plant atlas and read facts and concepts about that plant.\u00a0   </p>\n<p><em>For more information, contact:\u00a0</em>http://mariacrharrington.org/ </p>\n<p><strong>Credits: </strong>The Virtual UCF Arboretum project is an augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) collaboration between The Harrington Lab in the Nicholson School of Communication and Media, in the College of Arts and Humanities, and the UCF Arboretum in the Department of Biology, in the College of Sciences, and the Landscape and Natural Resources team at the University of Central Florida.\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  \u00a0<br/> <br/></p>\n<p><strong>The Harrington Lab Digital   Media Team </strong>\n</p><p><em>The   Primary Creators and Contributors for the Unreal Engine model: </em>\n</p><p><strong>Dr.   Maria C.
