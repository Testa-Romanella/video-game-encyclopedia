I just had the dream of creating a small and simple RPG game. But one moment passes, it all went wrong. EVERYTHING went wrong.\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I don't recommend you play this game. It's not a 'dare' or anything, but your fate is unknown and anything could happen.</p>\n\n<p>3 weeks of work. The project is enough. I don't wanna work anymore on it - it's too heavy for me.
