Deface its pages in creativity exercises, so that your book can understand you. Tear out pages to keep the conversation going, as it reveals to you how it came to be and why it wants to know you.</p>\n<p><em>The Book Ritual</em>\u00a0is about dealing with loss and accepting change. It is about coming to terms with decisions that can\u2019t be undone, and the souvenirs which will lose their meaning to time.</p>\n<p>Played at home on your own, you engage with the complete story as a personal experience.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Played at an exhibition, the story is shared between everyone in the space. Each participant\u00a0gets to experience different chapters, and the transformation of the book becomes a collaborative experience. It can be connected to a USB-connected shredder, so that the accumulating shredded paper becomes part of the installation itself.</p>\n<p>Article: Why I made The Book Ritual</p>\n<p><strong>I'm currently looking for feedback on The Book Ritual before officially releasing it as complete.
