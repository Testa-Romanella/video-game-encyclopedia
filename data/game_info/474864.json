The challenge to the game is that you can't grab the regular rocks because they are too slippery. That is why you have to grab the rocks with the chalk on them so that you can keep a good grip and not fall. For every chalked rock you miss, you will get an X. For every regular rock\u00a0you grab, you will get an X also. Three X's, and you fall. With the occasional wind, climbing can be very difficult. Will you take up the challenge?</p>\n<p>This game is best played in full screen mode.</p>\n<p>If you are not looking at this game on my jam entry, would you be willing to go there and rate my game if possible? That would mean a lot! Thank you!
