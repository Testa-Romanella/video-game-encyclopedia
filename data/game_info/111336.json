Ok, maybe not that epic. :p\u00a0</p>\n<p>In a world of bunny men and dog faced ladies, wildly generous federal law has been passed allowing anyone to fly who can reach the airplane. YOU are the thin, dumb line between freeloaders and complete bankruptcy! Taser the freeloaders before they make it through the gates or the airline is finished. You're only hint to who is who is your outdated computer. FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION!\u00a0Or maybe it is. You can always move back home with your mother. Is Job Simulator still hiring?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Notes:This should work equally well on the VIVE and Oculus Rift. It requires 64-bit Windows 7 or better, and \u00a0motion controllers. It's a silly game I made for Android and then converted over to Virtual Reality on the PC. Because it was originally made for mobile, it should run very well even on a low-end system. In this iteration, the game lasts about 5 minutes, unless you fail. If people like it, I'll add more features in the future. I'd love any encouragement or suggestions you have! (I'd like a $1 even more)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c87/c8708a7b470e396957a4fbdb4ac84807.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MaxSMoke777"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
