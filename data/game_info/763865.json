Everything is designed to be as bad as possible, just like this page.\u00a0After this, no other vr game will make you sick, or your money back.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>But what do you do in Orballin?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>There is an evil rock that you have to\u00a0throw out, but you are a half orb half ball at the big wood spire zone in space. It is up to you to throw the rock into the trash to stop it from being evil and stuff, and you have a little hand and a heart shaped pan. Oh, and you cant move your fingers because you ate glue.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Updates</strong><br/></p>\n<p>1.3.2: Ending has lite\u00a0seizure warning.
