But wait, you found tools enough to fix the car to escape from the hordes of zombies. ARE YOU READY FOR IT?<br/><br/>Escape of the Dead is a solo game. In the game you are trying to fix the car while trying to defend yourself against hordes of zombies. You're given 4 Action dice per turn, distribute between 3 sections of the game (either by shooting zombie, fixing the barricade and/or fixing the car). Roll for success on each section. Any zombie that survived will attack the barricade. When you successfully killed 10 zombies you will be rewarded with power-up. You lose when your barricade is down . You win when the car is fixed 100% and get out of the house.<br/><br/>Based on board game by Jason Sondoh.<br/>Art by Robertson Sondoh, Jr. and Malechi<br/><br/>Zombie,apocalypse, dice game, run, board game,", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-30T13:50:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b3/8b3bfaced2ddc44a0737f54c141ce621.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Maxim Matyushenko"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
