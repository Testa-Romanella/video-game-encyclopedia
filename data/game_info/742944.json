Which is something she couldn't do as a kid, during her time in Orphanarium.<br/></p>\n<p>This time she tells them a story, using a simple deck of cards. It is the story of a missing princess, and the High King's four armies that roam the land looking for her! Ucogi is influenced from her past: She mentions the ghosts she was afraid of as a kid, the MonsterGirls she fought and her closest friends, Alice, Rudy, Dedu and Irene. And if she is a bit harsh on Dedu's character, it's because he made a big mess in SuckerSuck! This game can be played by anyone, as it doesn't contain obscene art or foul language.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>\u2665 Gameplay</strong><br/>The game is slow and easy, as any other Solitaire game.
