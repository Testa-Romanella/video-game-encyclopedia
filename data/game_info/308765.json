The original adventure was designed to be programmed in basic for microcomputers in the 80's. This game was a coursework project in which I was tasked to port the original style and gameplay from this book to work on a modern computer written in c++. The game was build in a custom university engine called ASGE.</p>\n<p>The style of this game is a haunted house that the player is required to exit by collecting objects to help with their escape. By using a list of popular commands and strategy styles from similar games, the player types their desired choices in an attempt to leave the haunted house while getting as a high as possible high score.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The main objective for this project was to get us back into low level programming in the second year of our games technology course along with teaching us how to properly use object oriented programming with the software and engine.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-12T05:37:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a05/a056ed35971f8965d26c518c5f5c1507.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CharlieBlaise"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
