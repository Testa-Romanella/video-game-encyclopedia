It is your chance to build a space station empire that spans across the galaxy.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>All sorts of pilots wander the galaxy and it's up to you to figure out what will bring you the most success.</strong> Each pilot has their own priorities and needs; ranging from refueling their ships, satisfying their desire for alcohol, or gambling away their hard-earned cash. Even though what they each look for in a space station is very different, there is one thing they have in common; <strong>they want to spend some money.</strong> <br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>But where there\u2019s profit, there are always risks to consider. </strong>Pirates are around every corner looking for a score. Markets will fluctuate and potentially bankrupt your efforts as the demands of pilots change. Meanwhile, something mysterious lurks in the shadow, waiting for the right time to strike. <br/><br/>In Space Station Tycoon you will expand your station by building lots of different stuff like docking bays, research facilities, and even casinos to attract every kind of customer you can. Spread your influence among the stars and create the kind of station you would be proud to call your own.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Space Station Tycoon is inspired by its greatest ancestors of the \u201ctycoon\u201d genre.</strong> We took those inspirations and wanted to create our own tycoon game set in a sci-fi universe. Where the player has a chance to experience the demands of running their own station. Our main goal is to ensure that strategic depth and difficult choices are at the forefront of everything you do. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-26T17:37:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/603/60345f30b3ea2ec7758be006698ee23f.jpg", "website": "http://lunheimstudios.com/space-station-tycoon/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 21, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lunheim Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Lunheim Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
