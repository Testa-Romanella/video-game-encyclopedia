Thank you for downloading, or checking out the .json file I made for the 1st part of Freaky Machine, but re-charted. To get this working, make sure your Indie Cross mod doesn't have any additiona; .rar feature with them. It's icon before opening has to be a folder. Go to assets, data, freaky machine, click the json that says freaky-machine-hard.json and delete it. Make sure the re-charted replacement has the same name, because it may not work. If you're not satisfied with the re-chart and want the original charting back, make sure you don't permanently delete the original, or you can just add some tweaks to the charting yourself. I'm fine with whichever one works.\u00a0\u00a0I'm pretty sure that's all you need to know. So thank you for trying out the 1st part of Freaky machine, but re-charted. I will finish the rest of the song soon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T11:26:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4f/c4f284f08bb17a0cfc15af271a036132.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["trickyvroom2022pointblank"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
