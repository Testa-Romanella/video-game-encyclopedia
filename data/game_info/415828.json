The frequency is changed with the [UP] and [DOWN] buttons.</p>\n<p>You have the directions written on a page, that you can look at by holding down [SPACE]. When your dad prompts you for directions, click on the direction that matches the directions on the page.</p>\n<p>How happy your dad is can be seen in the rear-view mirror.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Made with L\u00f6ve 11.3</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Music used:</strong></p>\n<p>From freesound.org <br/>Renamed to \"rock1.wav\" in .love file User: zagi2<br/>Link: https://freesound.org/people/zagi2/sounds/266892/</p>\n<p>Renamed to \"rock2.mp3\" in .love file<br/>User: Prime45 Link: https://freesound.org/s/470766/</p>\n<p>Renamed to \"static.wav\" in .love file<br/>User: Jace<br/>Link: https://freesound.org/people/Jace/sounds/35291/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T05:01:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b28/b2806dfb5952b104e1d535344198ac35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Tiggles"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
