Taterhou is a shoot-em-up where the player must avoid mana bolts from enemy flowers while shooting taters of their own to take out the enemies. The original (non-Deluxe) version of the game was released as part of a <em>Tiny Potato </em>themed ARG. The Deluxe version adds two additional levels and is more forgiving. <br/><br/>Again, this is a meme game - although it is very much playable from beginning to end, the primary purpose of the game is a fun joke. That is to say, do not expect to be playing for longer than an hour. Feel free to download for free, but donations are appreciated!<br/><br/>Botania, the Minecraft mod on which the characters in Taterhou are based on, was created by Vazkii. The project .zip (source) for this game can be download here.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T08:53:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6a/a6ae0d9e18550a0c8a297ef72db480f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Partonetrain"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
