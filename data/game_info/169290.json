{"id": 169290, "slug": "coincase", "name": "CoinCase", "name_original": "CoinCase", "description": "<p>Its my first ludum dare compo and i can say it was pretty fun... Not as a game but as testing some of the unity's tools and assets. Well if you dare you can check it out but disclaimer its super boring :P!<br/>Time spend on this: 5hours.</p>\n<p>INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys (\u2190\u2191\u2193\u2192) for movement and... thats pretty much all you can do :P</p>\n<p>Except of course collect coins and disposed them... In 100 disposed coins you win... and if you run into \"water\" you die :P<br/></p>\n<p>EXTRA INFO</p>\n<p>As an idea close to the theme of ludum dare 40 \"The more you have, the worse it is\", i made it so the more coins you collect (with your little boulder :P) the slower you become. So in order to collect more coins you have to dispose the already collected ones so you can return to your regular speed.</p>\n<p>P.S. I know that this prototype needed much more work to be as a part of ludum dare compo but as my first project i didn't dedicated the time that i should have and also i was still trying to learn the tools of the engine... So yeah it needs a lot of improvement like adding some timer so its a little bit of a challenge and many many more... But thats what i ended up with and i am pretty happy that at least i tried and learned a little more of the engine and what it needs to participate to a event like ludum dare compo :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/893/893a3e15ca4a48514b44b61c45946626.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Billeclipse"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
