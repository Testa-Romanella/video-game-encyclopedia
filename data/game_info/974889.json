Endless battles in endlessly generated worlds is the main thing you will find in this rouguelite bullet hell. Fight your way through, live as much as you can or just have fun, die and restart. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nOnce your cross the riverline - the timer begins to tick, and your goal is to fight as well as you can until the time runs out. The world itself is infinitely generated, so you will never have problems with finding new battles and treasures, but the futher from the starting line you go - the harsher it gets. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nOne of the most important mechanics (aside from running and shooting) is timer: you start with some time, and every moment you play a lottery: advance further and get more treasure and more time, taking risk of finding none, or turn back and return to the starting line safely? The choice is yours. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nInspired by 80-s arcade masterpieces, such as robotron and bubbles, this game gives you nothing but a pure gameplay with no distractions.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-08T07:30:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf6/bf6c3facf61f0f5a9e89e698502bab6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZavaStudio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ZavaStudio"], "esrb_rating": null}
