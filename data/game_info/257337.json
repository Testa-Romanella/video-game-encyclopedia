Wait for much more content to come via updates in this unexplored area by Gamers..<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe wastes released by our cells create Free Radicals that can be very harmful to us and make us sick, scientists say.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAntioxidants that we consume with good foodstuff are prime enemies of Free Radicals and they fight them if they are sufficiently strong; if not, diseases might appear.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn this project, our prime reason is to explore at micro level the things that inflict damage on or the things that protect our immune system and body parts, and, not surprisingly, the huge war among them. Our target group is the young children, teanagers, and the  adults with the pleasure of playing strategy and tycoon games.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs the very first thing that determines the destiny of the war between Free Radicals and Antioxidants is our nutritional intake, we wanted to include a lot of plants to make your immune system healthier as alleged by some scientists.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nStrategic Properties<br/>\r\nYour main objective is to increase your Score. You can do it by playing the Levels and the Sandbox. However, best way to get higher Scores is to play the Career Mode. We recommend playing the Career and Sandbox Modes after getting started/acquainted with the Levels. <br/>\r\nYou will build several gardens and cultivate them outside and use their herbs and spices to create your armies against the Free Radicals inside.  <br/>\r\nYou might need extra cash to grow your business and become stronger; then use the Bank Loan system but be careful.<br/>\r\nYou will conduct Trading services by building several structures to help you grow bigger and thrive along your way.<br/>\r\nYou will expand your business with lots of Lifestyle and Recreation facilities, like Spa, Slow Food or Spice Lab, etc. and earn so much money and experience that you can deal with your enemies who include primarily Toxina, Dirta, Micropath, Cancero, Little Mighty Mite, Nicotina, Smoggard, Angero etc. <br/>\r\nYour above-mentioned enemies manage numerous types of animated Free Radicals within your veins, including many animated Bosses.<br/>\r\nAnd you will be of help some little towers as well as the ones with powerful projectiles getting stronger as you buy power-ups for  them from the Shop, like Super Garlic or the Army of the Mint. There will also be little imaginary Fantasy Genies like Cloventine, Prince Cereal, Spinachard, Saladorn, Jon Lemon, etc. at your service for more fun. <br/>\r\nThe Wiki section will tell you about the Herbs and Spices.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDefense Properties<br/>\r\nAs long as you build a facility, you will have a respective property. For example, build your Mint Garden and gain the Army of Mints. Build a Sumac Garden and gain a Sumac Tower. Build a Garlic Garden and earn Super Garlic who fights against some unbeatable Radicals.<br/>\r\nBe careful about Balancing your Stress level as soon as possible as it might cause Disasters that your Towers may incur.<br/>\r\nYou will also build Recreational, Business, and Trading facilities, like Spa, Herbal Center, Teahouse, Tea Factory, and Spice Factory, etc. that will yield more revenues and prevent some Enemies, Disasters, Maintenance costs etc.<br/>\r\nAlways new Bosses will appear and you also will always gain more properties like new Towers, Units, Weapons, etc.<br/>\r\nAs long as you become richer, you will be able to upgrade your Forces to be able to defend your body more properly.<br/>\r\nBy the way, Toxina, Dirta, Micropath, Cancero, Little Mighty Mite, Nicotina, Smoggard, and Angero will not stop there and they will find ways to become stronger after their defeat and surrender. Be more careful when they enter into alliance  and when unknown Bosses emerge from different locations.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAttack Properties<br/>\r\nAttack Properties are mainly hidden in various sections of the Game but as you explore it, you will see many many different ways to defeat the Enemies, achieve your goals, and get Three Stars!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou will enjoy many different Levels and Sandbox as well as the Career Mode which might take long long hours to become a Lifestyle Mogul. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe will be happy if you learn more about how easy to protect our bodies under the control of expert scientists and physicians and teach others to do the same, through a healthy lifestyle.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe believe that the game will be especially helpful for children to stay away from bad habits and stay healthy throughout  their lifetime by learning about the defense mechanisms of our bodies.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe will do our best to add more and more content and information as we explore in this vast and hardly know field and as we know children wish to play more, so that the gamers can develop trickier tactics, determine more complex strategies, and learn more and more knowledge about the subject matter as promised and owed by a strategy game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you have problems, please feel free to contact: greenlynxgames@gmail.com<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNote: our website is being developed and will be updated here soon.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSincerely<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGreenlynx PR Team", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:51:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9fd/9fd6eca60963efaf7b53857634d1900e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 247, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Greenlynx"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Greenlynx"], "esrb_rating": null}
