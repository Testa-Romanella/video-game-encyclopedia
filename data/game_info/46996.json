You wake up from a nap to sounds coming from your computer. Someone has sent you a link to a stream that is causing alarm to its viewers. Upon viewing the stream, you see a woman named Amalea who\u2019s scared for her life. Amalea says something about the shadow web, and that there are men in masks hunting her down. When trying to explain her location, the stream abruptly ends. This peaks Clint\u2019s interest, and he must dig deeper to find her before it\u2019s too late.
