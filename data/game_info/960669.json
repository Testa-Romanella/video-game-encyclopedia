They shared an interest in paganism, witchcraft and vampirism as well as making original music from an early age, and so the type of band that was to emerge from the joining of forces was, quite naturally, an expression of this. Initially the band was called Incubus Succubus. The original aim of the band was (as it still is today) to be the vehicle in which the celebration of the Pagan experience could be conveyed.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-12T04:17:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef1/ef18f03b301cf9c924b3ff65bf5d219b.jpg", "website": "http://inkubussukkubus.org", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 414, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tony McKormack"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Inkubus Sukkubus"], "esrb_rating": null}
