Collect all crystals to win</p>\n<p>An entry for the Godot Game Jam 9.</p>\n<p>The bulk of the jam time has been spent on making a decent player controller for the world shape and gravity, based on an older (keyboard only) version of the planetary controller on the Asset Library. The results are pretty basic, and the player can parkour around by touching any surface, which sort of compensates the quirky dynamics.</p>\n<p>I've added a helper to the transition manager - It can now change the mouse mode (default visible)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-20T05:02:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b5/8b5dc53636765b457c44deb96408f00f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["eetson"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
