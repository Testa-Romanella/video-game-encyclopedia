How would that world differ from Earth of today?\r\n<p>This single idea was the seed, the genesis point from which the idea behind <strong><em>The Cosmosphere of Armastus</em></strong> began to take shape, long before it had a name, or even a concept of direction or purpose.<br/></p>\n<p>The humble beginnings just so happened to take the form of an Interactive Fiction project. It's possible it may develop in other ways in the future. Regardless, it is envisioned as a universe that is created over time, with updates gradually adding to the existing material.<br/></p>\n<p>The initial public release circa August 2020 is something of a \"starting point\" for this journey. How it evolves with the passage of time, where it all ends, or if it ever does, is up to the world at large.</p>\n<p>Please see the Creator's Manifesto within the Interactive Fiction presentation itself, if you're interested in learning more about the intentions and aspirations behind this project.</p>\n<p>If you wish to join in on the fun and maybe even create a universe of your own, visit the community discussion boards at the bottom of this page. You'll find helpful tips and friendly folks to chat with about all things related to the Cosmosphere.<br/></p>\r\nTerms of Use, Licensing, and Attribution\r\n<p>The Cosmosphere of Armastus is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license, which can be found here: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/</p>\n<p>Please consider using the following for attribution purposes:</p>\r\nThe Cosmosphere of Armastus originally created by Jonathan Hawkins (Jay Ray Hawk) and released under a CC BY-SA 4.0 International license.\r\n<p>This Interactive Fiction presentation is made with the free Twine 2.3 software, using the SugarCube 2 story format.
