There's danger when fighting the boss, but no health is there to lose.<br/>But\u00a0hopefully\u00a0you\u00a0enjoy\u00a0the\u00a0concept\u00a0and gameplay that resulted from the theme\u00a0<em>'Killing\u00a0Time'</em>.<br/></strong></p>\n<p>I\u00a0tried to keep the in-game\u00a0tutorial brief.<br/><em>However in-case it was\u00a0to brief\u00a0and\u00a0you'd like more\u00a0details:<br/></em><strong><em>WASD:</em></strong> Movement.<strong><em>SPACEBAR:</em></strong> Press this to activate your characters 'long hand'. You use this to kill enemies at their time, however your longhand rotating around the screen must match theirs.<br/>Because you're often facing the enemy, I chose to mirror your screens hand so it's easier to match up with the enemies.<br/>This also swaps the direction your hand is rotating in. You can use this to try and align yourself for an enemies upcoming rotation. However take note that missing an enemy will lose your current charge (described below).<strong><em>SHIFT:</em></strong> Hold this down to activate your 'short hand' and charge an enemy 'shot', launching your closest enemy.<br/>This has 3 levels of charge when you can release, each with a different strength shot.<br/>You can gain a maximum of 2 charges. Sometimes you can use this to launch an enemy, then if it's still the closest adjust it's trajectory midair.<br/>Use A/D to rotate your target direction, and W/S to rotate your target height.</p><p>------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>A purpose of this game jam was to build a game purely with Bolt as the visual scripting mechanism, no actual code. This inspired me to take another shot with another visual scripting tool, as it's really nice to be able to make games in a 3D space, especially small projects like this that just wouldn't work in 2D.<br/><strong>To summarize the end result:</strong><br/>I still hate Unity.<br/>I LOVE Bolt! And to think a version 2 is being worked on, I'm already in love with version 1.<br/><br/>As part of this gamejam is to show you've worked on your project with Bolt, below are 2 recordings while I was working on the project. I don't have enough time to record anything more now, a.k.a. minutes from submission time as always D:<br/>However I'll try to record a full game through of this in Unity aftewards and add that further below.<br/></p><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-14T03:38:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97c/97c42732fdc8661984ae81ab6272f11c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Swift Illusion"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
