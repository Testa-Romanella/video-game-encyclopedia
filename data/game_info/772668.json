It was known as a place of wonder and peace, a land of limitless bounty suspended in the heavens above. Five ancient Guardians kept it safe from all harm... Until they turned on the kingdom and its denizens. The Anuchardian paradise fell from the skies, crashing onto the surface of the world below. Only a tiny speck of an island survived the fall intact. The rest coalesced into a twisted mass of winding passages, wild magic, and vicious monsters, known simply as The Dungeon. Somewhere within, the five treasonous Guardians lay asleep.<br/><br/>Generations passed as the few survivors eked out an existence in the Orchard, the sole village on the island, maintaining what little remains of Anuchardian magic. Farmers tend to the fields, scavengers try to pick the bones of the kingdom in the Dungeon. All await the Chosen One, the Bellwielder who will take up the Audros Bell, enter the Dungeon, and wake the Guardians from their slumber, and bring back the paradise lost: Return Anuchard to the heavens.<br/><br/>Finally, you were judged worthy to take up the mantle of the Bellwielder. The Dungeon awaits!<br/><br/><br/><br/>For everyone and everything. You are the Bellwielder and the Audros Bell is your best friend.<br/><ul><li>Master the Bell!
