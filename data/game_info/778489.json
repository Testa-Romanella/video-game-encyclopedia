In IceBlast, the aim is to reach the end of the level and get home to your igloo. You must make use of the momentum boost pickups, but be sure to avoid the drifters where possible... Sometimes the drifters may even be of use to you.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Lewis Starling - Mechanics programming, UI image sourcing, Sound Sourcing and implementation, Trailer Production</p>\n<p>https://lewisstarling01.wixsite.com/portfolio<br/></p>\n<p>Jacob Rowland - Level design, Environment modelling, UI and UX design, bug testing</p>\n<p>https://jrowland709.wixsite.com/levelgamejake<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T06:41:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/654/6542bd6ec60434345ec8459021b5834b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JakesLevels"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
