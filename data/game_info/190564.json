Better games coming soon I promise haha. The concept is it's a maze where you don't know where you are or the walls, so you use a gun to shoot the walls so you can see approximately where you are and where the wall is, as the light makes the wall stay showing. You have limited bullets and you have to get all the rocks.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ae/4aecc1a4719d483756c7f12056bcd5e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FrStudios"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
