In the first phase, the player crates the sun. In the second, the player forms planets by combining free-floating asteroids. In the third phase, players add flavor to their barren planets with different biomes, trees, and terrains. In the fourth and final phase, the player can descend onto their planet to explore and interact with the amazing worlds they have created. Players can seamlessly travel through these phases, creating and exploring multiple planets in their own solar system.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eos was created over the course of 15 weeks by 8 game development students at Champlain College.
