Becka\u2019s portfolio and story follows her life from a young child through her struggle and eventual recovery from an eating disorder. As such, this project is meant to act as a conversation piece around topics like self-image, abuse, coping and addiction.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Throughout the project, users are placed in a series of thematic rooms.\u00a0Each room reflects a moment in Becka\u2019s journey and is accompanied by a set of equally thematic paintings that can be completed by the user along with audio from a fictionalized version of Becka\u2019s life written by the artist herself. Each one of these rooms essentially makes a gallery, a place where the artwork stands in the context of Becka\u2019s life.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-19T04:19:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c2/6c29a33aa677f8431a33ca756edf59d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["GIMMWorks"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
