Here\u2019s the link:\u00a0[Link\u00a0removed\u00a0due\u00a0to\u00a0itch.io\u00a0upload]\r\n</p>\n<p>Short description DON\u2019T READ IF YOU LIKE SURPRISES: Dance people\u2019s problems away!\r\n</p>\n<p>OK COMPANY POLITICS TIME! \u00a0What follows is the word that is located on the street for those consoeurs with refined tastes for corporate gossip\u2026\r\n</p>\n<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n</p>\n<p>First, a refresher for people who aren\u2019t long time Balloon Co. geekotakunerds: \u00a0our parent company of Balloon Co. [all the divisions] made us go on game-making-hiatus until we took a course on learning the programing language <em>Amethyst</em>. \u00a0Our current progress in the online course, despite all our efforts to cheat our way through, is still around 4 to 4.5 years remaining (would have been 3.9 if SOMEBODY who KNOWS WHO THEY ARE hadn\u2019t named their poetry portfolio THE EXACT SAME NAME AS OUR COURSEWORK <strong>SAVE FILE</strong>!!!)\r\n</p>\n<p>Now, when we were  told to make games, we were quite talented at dragging our feet enough to give the highest quality content with the  lowest quantity of work. \u00a0However, when we\u2019re told NOT to do work, civil war breaks out between our laziness and our  rebelliousness. \u00a0So far, the lazy faction had been winning (it\u2019s hard to combat the comfort of warm blankets and sweatpants), until a  recent event that TOTALLY TURNED THE TIDE OF OUR CIVIL WAR HISTORY!\r\n</p>\n<p>For some reason, every year near the beginning of July, our bosses from the American branch of our company send us an email telling us to take a few days off of the work we aren\u2019t doing in order to celebrate something old that happened to Americans. \u00a0On the same day, we also get an annual package from our British branch filled with tea and a note to \u201cKeep your emotions in check and carry out your duties.\u201d \u00a0 This year, we received the email from the middle of North America, but NO PACKAGE FROM THE EUROPEAN ISLAND! \u00a0Our international experts tell us that they were probably distracted from the fact that their pounds are dropping; if they wanted to stop losing pounds, then they should try our patent-pending-then-failing method called the <strong><em>Walrus Blubber diet</em></strong>. \u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>So, the delicate yingy-yangy balance between being told to work and not work was destroyed. \u00a0Anger at the NERVE of those Americans to tell us to \u201c<em>enjoy ourselves</em>\u201d burned within us, and warmed us enough to rip apart the oppressive regime of those itchy covers and pants so that we could defy our parent company\u2019s sacrilegious orders to halt production! \u00a0However, we only had a limited time to stick it to them on their<em> precious holiday</em>, so we rallied around our goal: <strong>Awesome Game Developed Quickly!</strong> \u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>We <strong>AGDQ</strong>ed as <strong>Q</strong> as we coul<strong>D</strong>. \u00a0We <strong>D</strong>ed so fast that, at 11 PM on July 4th, one of our computers burst into sparks and showered the room with electricity and burning metal. \u00a0While we gazed upon the majestic scene with sublime awe, a scrap of burning shrapnel smacked Semyon right in that area between the armpit and the hip on his left side. \u00a0After patching him up, we declared that every year on the fourth day in July we would celebrate by launching burning metal into the air in memory of him surviving and having the coolest scar ever!\r\n</p>\n<p>But now, our rebellious spirit is burning out, and we\u2019ve started sewing back our blankets from the shreds that didn\u2019t catch on fire (some pants had to be sacrificed for the good of the blankies). \u00a0Once our overlords see what we did, they\u2019ll probably prevent us from making another game for a LONG time. \u00a0But hey, we surprised you/ourselves/our stupid bosses with this hiatus game! \u00a0Who knows if we\u2019ll do it again! \u00a0Until that time, we hope you enjoy this game, and keep Semyon in your prayers\u2026\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>CAUSE WHEN SOMEONE \u00a0TAKES ON AN ACT OF GOD AND/OR GODDESS LIKE THAT AND COMES OUT A CHAMP YOU\u2019D BETTER START PRAYING TO \u2018EM!#</strong>\n</p>\n<p>~Balloon Co. [gaming division]\r\n</p>\n<p># <em>IMPORTANT NOTE FROM BALLOON CO. LAWYERS</em>: We advise anyone who resides in a country with anti-blasphemy laws to NOT pray to Semyon as Semyon is not a recognized deity and worship of him may get you in trouble with your local government. \u00a0We also advice against dedicating your spiritual attention to Semyon even if you reside outside one of those countries as Semyon doesn\u2019t know a lick of ecclesiastical law, and thus is really not truly worthy of anyone\u2019s devotion. <br/></p>\n<p>Tagged: #What is this, #It looks like those things on that blue bird website.\u00a0 I doupt it's important, #do people even see what's typed here?
