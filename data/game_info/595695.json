{"id": 595695, "slug": "the-adventurer-guild", "name": "The Adventurer Guild", "name_original": "The Adventurer Guild", "description": "<p>In \u201cThe Adventurer Guild\u201d your job, as Guild Leader, is to hire and manage Heroes and finally send them deeper and deeper into one of three different Dungeons. </p>\n<p>Try to beat the Boss of every dungeon, who waits after Floor 10 for your heroes, to gain the most wanted boss artifact from them.</p>\n<p>Use the different artifacts, you will find in your dungeon crawls, to place them onto your ritual circle and gain different buffs. Each artifacttype reacts different to it\u2019s neighbours, so try out as many combinations as possible. <br/>You also can merge same artifacts to combine theiry power. </p>\n<p>--You can Cheat here--</p>\n<p>Deeper and deeper in the dungeons your heroes will come back, if they come back, with gold and different artifacts for you to use. That means, keep always an eye on the health and power of your heroes, as well as the level of the dungeon they are visiting. </p>\n<p>Even if the heroes the blood and heart of your guild, they are replaceable as long as you have some money left. So manage your gold well and keep always some in your backhand for bad days. </p>\n<p><strong>## Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Mouse - Click on the Elements to activate<br/>ESC - Pause / UnPause the Game</p>\n<p><strong>## Tutorial:</strong></p>\n<p>You should start with search and hire some heroes in the Tavern. <br/>After that you can start your first Expedition (Bottom Right) and choose the Heroes you want to send to one of the three dungeons. We recommend the Dark Forest, because it\u2019s the easiest one. <br/>The Difficulty of the Dungeons are defined by Easy, Medium and Hard and the Level of the dungeon as well. <br/>After you sent your first Expedition, you can watch them walk and as soon as they arrived the dungeon, they will start to fight. <br/>After the fight, they will get your attention with a small question mark and you can decide to keep them in the dungeon to continue the fight and gather more loot or to call them back to you city and get the loot they collected so far. <br/>The final loot will only be revealed to you when your group came back to your City. If they die, all of the collected loot is gone. <br/>At least you don\u2019t know exactly what you lost. ;)</p>\n<p>After some expeditions you can place an artifact on your stonecircle to grant some expedition buffs to your heroes and improve the buildings for more advantages and better heroes and stats. <br/>Especially in the beginning, selling artifacts can be a good choice and keep an eye on the health of your heroes, because money is short in the beginning. </p>\n<p>Last Tip: Sometimes it\u2019s good to grant the dungeons some time to rest and reset. That makes it easier for your heroes to loot the lower levels again. Even if the amount is lower, the chance of success is higher. </p>\n\n<p><strong>## Disclaimer:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WebGL Version seems to be still buggy, we recommend to use the normal download versions!</li><li> MAC and LINUX version are not tested</li><li> This game is beatable and can be played through</li><li> Many, nearly all, of the Icons are not by us.
