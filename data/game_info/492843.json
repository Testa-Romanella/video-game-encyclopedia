There are 10 levels, 1 boss level and 1 short film. The puzzles are quite challenging so be warned. I will add more levels and I want to hear opinions too.</p>\n<p>Use the arrows to move and jump, use Z and X to rotate gravity left and right, you can't rotate gravity twice while in mid-air. Use S for a menu to restart the level or go back to the main menu.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T14:15:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11b/11b7d8047be7d7130b0b76852648b9a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Iustin2800"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
