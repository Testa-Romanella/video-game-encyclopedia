Every time you'll be in charge of choosing 2 of those 4 subjects, so the next generation inherits part of their stats.\r\n</p>\n<p>Obviously, since they're living organisms, they might get ill or suffer on some major issues, that might cause them to die before they reproduce.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Try to get as more generations as you can!\r\n</p>\n\n<p><em>If the in-browser game doesn't run, you can download the game.
