Her biggest hurdle right now, though, is her ability to talk to others. She wants to make friends and lasting bonds, but can\u2019t find the courage to do so. On top of that, her overbearing mother constantly calls her, trying to convince her that her passion for art won\u2019t lead to a successful future. Feeling like she can\u2019t stand up to anyone in her life these anxieties start manifesting as psychic abilities she doesn\u2019t quite understand. She starts having strange dreams and feels the closet in her dorm room calling out to her at night. When she finally decides to take a step inside, she\u2019ll have to face her inner demons if she wants to stand up for herself. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-16T04:41:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b93/b9308a474c91a11cc43928cc4c4045ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Our Odyssey"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
