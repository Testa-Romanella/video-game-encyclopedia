I quickly noticed a lot of trash falls out of the garbage trucks (sorry to put DC trash services on blast) so I walked around the neighborhood picking up trash. This is a small game with small conversations I had when meeting all my neighbors.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not a whole lot going on, literally about a 3 minute gameplay loop to see all the conversation and pick up all the trash. However there's a neat core here for further documenting the stories my neighbors told me. They've given me gifts and mementos and the homes are just beautiful. My art doesn't do it justice but MagicaVoxel does make it easier/possible for someone like me to recreate the homes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hope to come back and fill this out with more experiences.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Art made in MagicaVoxel.<br/>Music from TimBeek</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T05:37:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/168/168720b077715da1bab2129f0d8820fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["colewrus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
