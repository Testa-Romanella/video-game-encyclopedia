Atone for unforgivable actions by giving up your abilities and grow weaker as you ascend to salvation. Battle the angered ghosts, give back what you took and ascend to your freedom. Decide which skills to let go of first, but if you want to escape you will have to lose them all. A game in the vein of contemporaries like The Binding of Isaac and Enter the Gungeon.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>LEVEL DOWN!</strong> - Grow increasingly weaker as you give up everything you have learned, from the map layout to the power of your weapons.</p>\n<p><strong>INVERSE SKILL TREE!</strong> - Want to play as a glass cannon or a tank? Create your own unique playstyle with THREE distinct skill trees. What are you willing to give up first?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EXPLORE!</strong> - Mysterious, procedurally-generated floors of enemies, bosses and secrets - and maybe even a fairy fountain.</p>\n<p><strong>WATCH OUT!</strong> - You might grow weaker, but enemies don\u2019t - watch the once puny enemies become more and more dangerous as you experience this unique difficulty curve.</p>\n\n\n<p>THE GAME ONLY SUPPORTS CONTROLLER (for now...).</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Jesper H.
