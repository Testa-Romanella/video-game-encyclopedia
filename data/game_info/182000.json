The game also has support for a joystick!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Difficulty:</strong></p>\n<p>The blocks drop quicker as the game goes along and gets reset when the player dies. It can get increasingly hard and may come to the point where it is impossible (Or is it?)</p>\n<p>The background music may make it harder as your wanting to listen on ;)</p>\n<p><strong>How to run:</strong></p>\n<p>To run the game, all you have to do is extract the zip file and double click on the exe. Its as simple as that!</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you enjoy the game, feel free to follow us and rate the game!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Dont forget to comment below with your high scores!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Enjoy :)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CHANGELOG 0.1.3</strong></p>\n<p>- I turned down the default volume to 20% from 60% \u00a0as it seems to rise its volume at the beginning of the track anyway.</p>\n<p>- Bugfix: The player would actually be visible this time.</p>\n<p><strong>CHANGELOG 0.1.2</strong></p>\n<p>-Added the \"Title Logo\" on the main menu of the game when you load up.</p>\n<p><strong>CHANGELOG 0.1.1</strong></p>\n<p>-Added a Mac version of the game.</p>\n<p>- Edited the models to a more detailed version.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Bugfix: If the player went to the edge of the map, the player would no longer go through the squares.
