Part creative block, part COVID-era issues, the next big idea just never progressed. So I\u2019ve opted to make a series of games, each of them started and completed in a month. That\u2019s a month of spare time, evenings and the occasional working day (approx. one week's actual work\u00a0per month). I see each of them like a game jam, an experiment, a chance to try out a genre, style or technique. Its inspired by\u00a0Sokpop Collective\u00a0and Rami Ismail's\u00a0Game a Week\u00a0post.\r\n</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Everything is by me,\u00a0Stuart Wallace.\u00a0I'm a Scottish 40-something dad and app creator living near Brighton in the UK. I\u00a0dabble in game-making in my spare time.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Locally Sourced's\u00a0art was all hand-drawn on paper, with photos taken of the drawings and then cleaned up in Sketch. \u00a0The game was made in Unity.\r\n</p>\r\nDonations\r\n<p>This game is 100% free and you're welcome to play it\u00a0as such. If you'd like to support me in making further games then a small donation is obviously appreciated.
