I have a handful of ideas for this project's direction - follow me to get updates as it grows.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game is currently contained in dino, my open source godot monorepo. <br/></p><p>'Dungeon Crawler' is a classic genre, so in many ways I couldn\u2019t <em>not</em> add this to Dino.\r\n </p>\n<p>The work on the launch version of this game was done in roughly a week, during which I battled scope-creep down to the bare bones map in the game. There are two locked doors and two keys, and the bosses are indeed flintstone-inspired. If they survive long enough to attack you, you\u2019ll see they throw bowling balls.\r\n </p>\n<p>At the moment, the arrows fail to fire - I\u2019ll hunt that bug down soon! If you <em>must</em> play it now, you can play it at the higher-level Dino game, and select \u2018OneGeon\u2019 from the menu.\r\n </p>\n<p>I next hope to refactor towards a more independent room implementation, which will more easily support procedural generation and a wider variety of games.\r\n <br/></p>\n<p>I often stream development on this project via twitch.\r\n</p>\n<p>You can support me on patreon.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T09:15:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/154/154fb6aabd973c1c591903427e65e581.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["russmatney"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
