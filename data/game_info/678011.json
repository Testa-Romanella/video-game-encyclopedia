Depending on the type and number of worm segments you have, the way you play can change very drastically.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Please remember this is only a Prototype. It contains 3 Levels which can be fairly difficult for new players.\u00a0\u00a0If enough people like the game (like 10 people maybe), I will work on a full release with more and better balanced content.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>But I think the way it is can be quite fun for at least 10 minutes.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>For now you need to install it yourself with the .apk-file on your phone. If I release the full game it will be downloadable from the PlayStore / Appstore.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Any feedback in the comments is appreciated :)</p>\n<p>Also if someone has an idea for a better name than \"Worm-Game\" <strong>PLEASE </strong>let me know</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-11T06:33:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f05/f05a9fd2b8d4911ac45ea6a3e5c73d33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Matzeall"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
