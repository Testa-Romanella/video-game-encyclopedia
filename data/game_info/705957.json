This week we were supposed to host 24h offline game jam with theme: \"Three Rules\". So kids did some fine job not sleeping, drinking and eating tons of energy drinks and pizza and they delivered some nice first games. They inspired us to participate and here is our game.</p>\n<p>Corner Inn is a game with 3 rules: you can calm down people, resulting in some of them leaving. Serving beer will earn you money, however folk can get drunk and angry. Playing music can also attract few guys into your inn, but that will surely cost you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Team:</p>\n<p>Graphics: Micha\u0142 Sankowski</p>\n<p>Code: Andrzej Szablewski</p>\n<p>Design: Edyta Janicka</p>\n<p>Have fun playing\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T13:50:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/214/214847b568e8c9c4062b9ad254bdcebd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Senterri"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
