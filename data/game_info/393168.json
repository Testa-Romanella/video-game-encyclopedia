Every night all kinds of animals will try to steal all the meat you have stored, so in order to stop them you need to fight back. Every night the animals will get stronger, which is why you will need to spend some of your meat to buy new more powerful weapons. On the tenth night you will need all the skills you've learned in order to defeat a difficult boss.<h3>Weapons and helmets</h3>In order to better battle the animals you will be able to buy new and improved weapons as well as helmets. The helmets in Viking butcher act as ultimate abilities that you can utilise to give you the advantage over the animals. Both the weapons and the helmets have many variations that you can use in order to better combat the increasingly difficult animals.<h3>Difficulty</h3>Viking offers three difficulty settings that fit every type of player. There is easy mode, normal mode and hard mode:<br/><ul><li><strong>Easy mode</strong> is meant for new players who aren't very experienced with the game.  <br/></li><li><strong>Normal mode</strong> is meant to challenge the average player with fun times without being too difficult. <br/></li><li><strong>Hard mode</strong> is only meant the truly hardcore players who love very high difficulty.</li></ul><h3>Multiple maps</h3>Viking butcher features multiple maps where you will battle unique and challenging animals. <br/>The different maps in Viking Butcher will feature drastically different environments where each area has their own special weapons.
