{"id": 525003, "slug": "keep-warm-prototype", "name": "Keep Warm (Prototype)", "name_original": "Keep Warm (Prototype)", "description": "<p>What would you do if you were attacked by a snowman? In this shooter, you play the role of a young boy with an overactive imagination, an imagination so strong, that magical snowmen have arrived and began to chase him! Use the raw power of your throwing arm to begin tearing them apart! Try not to become too cold, or you might just end up a popsicle...</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>RMB/Left Ctrl\u00a0- Crouch and begin building snowballs</p>\n<p>Hold LMB - Aim your snowball if available</p>\n<p>Release LMB - Throw snowball if available</p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>Shift - Sprint</p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Powerups:</p>\n<p>Hot Chocolate - Keep your temperature up!</p>\n<p>Cookies - Tons of sugar to keep you going!</p>\n<p>Snowball Pile - Who doesn't want 10 more snowballs?</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Difficulties:</p>\n<p>1. Easy/Tutorial - Slow and only a limited number of enemies, perfect for getting used to the controls and mechanics.</p>\n<p>2. Medium - This represents an early-mid level gameplay. One more enemy and higher possible enemy speeds keeps you alert and ready.</p>\n<p>3. Jingle Hell - Don't try this. Seriously. Do you really want to waste a while? I had to get good all throughout playtesting, and I barely beat this difficulty twice. Think you can defeat six active enemies, each with the potential to be just a bit faster than you? Better lean on those powerups, you're going to need them. Good luck!\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>This is very much a prototype. There's no menus, no fancy UI, just the core gameplay itself. There are three difficulties that have been tested very little, so it's about as bare as it gets. If you die (you become too cold), the window just closes out. You'd win by clearing out the entire wave of enemies. Let me know what you think!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T04:05:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b72/b728bd41e7a3a8920d25626f0bb3af58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Josh McMillan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
