However, all escape routes to the rescue pods have been obstructed and the only way out is through the \"Holochambers\".\u00a0</p>\n<p>This Game is an Entry for the <strong>Brackeys Game Jam 2022.1</strong>!</p>\n<p>In this game, you must try to solve all the puzzles in the room to progress to the next one. To do so, you must use a tool to materialise the holograms into existence within these rooms. Only then will you be able to access the key!</p>\n\n<p>This is the first Game Jam we ever participated in. We had a lot of fun but feel like we kinda twisted the given theme a little too much. Unfortunately, we focused WAY too much of our time on the shaders and visual design of the game which in turn lead to less content in the game then we hoped to accomplish...\u00a0There are probably bugs, a lack of audio and all that good stuff as well due to the limited time but we still hope you enjoy the game anyways! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T06:15:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/016/0160194d63f87a6f2c5779b523ee0c1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wraygo", "Elektrolf"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
