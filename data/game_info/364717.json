{"id": 364717, "slug": "mancat", "name": "MANCAT", "name_original": "MANCAT", "description": "<p>After discovering the technology to combine different species and inspired by how beautiful and cool Catwoman looks, this researcher decided to merge as one\u00a0with his cat. The result was so abhorrent he was left speechless. Feeling disgusting, he gave up the name Catman, judging himself not worthy of carrying a name so similar to that of his superhero idol. Thus was born <strong>MANCAT</strong>.</p>\n<p>Mancat is\u00a0a top-down shooter heavily\u00a0inspired by Nuclear Throne.\u00a0 It's my first game ever, so it doesn't have that much content. There are\u00a04 procedurally generated levels and a boss, as well as 7 different weapons you can find. I\u00a0may expand it if I ever get better at making art or if I team up with an artist, since it would be pretty easy to add more weapons and pickups.\u00a0</p>\n\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>I'm a terrible artist, so I didn't make most art found in the game.\u00a0Some sprites coloring, animation and basic editings were done by me. Some particle FXs and sound FXs were also edited or created by me. The rest of the art I\u00a0credit the following people:</p>\n<ul><li>JFA.exe, creator of our beautiful protagonist, Mancat, and most of the weapons.</li><li>Superdark, for all the dogs sprites.\u00a0</li><li>0x72, for the sprites that inspired Superdark and for general inspiration.</li><li>VectorPixelStar, for the food sprites.</li><li>Kyrise, for a magical staff and some other stuff that were cut out of the final version of the game.</li><li>Elthen, for the gorgeous portal sprites.</li><li>Michael Baradari, for most of the sounds used in the game (specially the guns).</li><li>The font used is called monogram.</li><li>A big thank you to\u00a0blackthornprod, which inspired me through his udemy course and youtube videos to finally make a game of my own.</li></ul>\n<p>I don't think I forgot anyone, but if I\u00a0did, I'm sorry and please call me out on it!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any </strong>kind of feedback is welcome.\u00a0(Is the game too easy? too hard? would you play more levels?)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enjoy and thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:37", "background_image": "https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzIzNzM3ODgucG5n/original/RCSmBE.png", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["puzzleheart"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
