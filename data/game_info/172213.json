The theme was 'Running out of space'.</p>\n<p>It's a wave-based shooter where the arena gets smaller and smaller with each progressive wave. Controls are as follows:<br/>Move: WASD<br/>Shoot: Left mouse button</p>\n<p>You can collect health and power-ups as you progress. If your health reaches zero, or you fall off the arena, it's game over. Killing enemies will increase your score and progressing to later waves will increase your score multiplier.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84f/84feade5b713f79b399f0e01a693c4f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Conor O'Donovan"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
