{"id": 636320, "slug": "super-mario-world-gameboy-edition", "name": "Super Mario World: Gameboy Edition", "name_original": "Super Mario World: Gameboy Edition", "description": "<p>This is an in-development fan-made port of Super Mario World (originally on the SNES) for the Gameboy/Gameboy Color. You can play the rom either in the browser or download it and run it through an emulator. It plays on the classic Gameboy and the Gameboy Color. Currently only the Gameboy Color version plays in the browser.</p>\n<p>Everything had to be severely cut down to run on the Gameboy, and it currently only has the first level, which struggles to run.</p>\n<p>It's very buggy and currently there are no coins, powerups, lives, or Yoshi. When an enemy hits you, you just go back to the beginning of the area.</p>\n<p>A lot of the enemies had to be replaced by smaller enemies due to how much the Gameboy can display. The levels as well had to be cut back and split up into shorter segments.</p>\n<p>There isn't currently any music, and sound effects are extremely limited. I just don't know much about making music for the Gameboy. If you would be interested in helping convert Mario World's music to the Gameboy, contact me and let me know.</p>\n<p>Also, if you are familiar with the GB Studio engine and have any advice for how I could improve the gameplay, let me know.</p>\n<p>As for the future of this game, I at least want to complete the first world. As you can see, the first world was cut down to match the NES bootleg port of Super Mario World, as it is much smaller and fits better on the Gameboy's extremely limited memory. I hope to some day fit as much of the game as possible onto this rom, or at least the entire NES version.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once again, if you have any advice or want to help with anything, feel free to contact me.</p><p>If you want to embed the game on your own site let me know and I can send you the HTML code.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T09:20:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b37/b37cbb269da8bd966b21920ffef273ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["kedsarama"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
