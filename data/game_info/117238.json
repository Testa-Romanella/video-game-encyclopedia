Being a gamer of 8-bit consoles (such as SMS and NES), I chose the NES color palette and the console's 256\u00d7240 resolution as constraints that would lead the art. The 'NEStalgic' feeling should also be applied to the audio.\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t During development, the resolution was doubled, because 256\u00d7240 is a tiny resolution for current displays.\r\n</p>\n<strong>Credits</strong>\n<p>\r\n\t\u5cb8\u672c\u30a2\u30f3\u30c9\u30ec\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t Code, Art, Audio\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t Press Start 2P font (c) 2012, Cody \"CodeMan38\" Boisclair.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t Templo Gordo font (c) 2001, Apostrophic Lab.\r\n</p>\n<strong>Development info</strong>\n<p>\r\n\tTools/tech used during development:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Development:</strong> <em>GameMaker: Studio Professional</em></li>\n<li><strong>Art:</strong> <em>GIMP</em></li>\n<li><strong>Audio:</strong> <em>DM1 The Drum Machine</em> (iPad), <em>Audacity</em></li>\n<li><strong>Typography:</strong> <em>Press Start 2P</em> and <em>Templo Gordo</em> fonts</li>\n<li><strong>Others:</strong> <em>SVN</em> and <em>Notepad++</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\r\n\t(\r\n\t<em>GameMaker: Studio</em> is the tool adopted by the University for Computer Programming 101 class.)\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOther info:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Development took around 24 hours (from start to finish).</li>\n<li>  Add a couple of hours for taking screenshots, writing game info and adding the game to itch.io.</li>\n<li>GM:Studio specific: 6 rooms, 2 backgrounds, 12 sprites, 7 audio files, 15 objects and 17 scripts.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Project source code: why am I licensing it?</strong>\n<p>\r\n\tYou might have noticed that you are able to get the project source code for a few dollars, so you can study it, modify it, create and release a new game out of it (be it commercial or non-commercial).\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t To answer the above question:\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t I decided to run an experiment with this project (and a couple of upcoming ones): instead of releasing the game for the current common 99-cent price tag, what would happen if I release the game for free (and ad-free) and license the entire project source (minus third-party files such as font files) for those who are willing to donate some amount of money that would be invested in future projects?\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t Some might view this process as \"selling (licensing) the project source code\", but we can also view it as \"make a donation and get a license to study, modify and use the project source on a new game as a thank you for supporting the developer\".\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t Either way, this experiment tries to check if a model like this (\"free game/paid license source\") could be a viable monetization option for independent developers.\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t I see it as a win-win scenario: developers would start getting some money to work on new projects (and hire people to help them) and gamers, students and hobbyists supporting these developers could check how a game was made, study and learn from it, mod it and release a new game to the public.\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t -----\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThinking about getting the project source code?\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t Thank you very much! I hope the project source code will be helpful to you.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t There is one thing I would like to ask you, though: it is OK for me if you make a commercial game out of it but please do not distribute (or sell) the project source code (including art and audio), as doing so would invalidate the experiment mentioned above (and violate the license).\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t If possible, redirect interested people to where you got the project source code. This is much appreciated!\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t In other words, by getting the project source code, you agree that:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can release commercial and non-commercial games using the project source code;</li>\n<li>You cannot and will not distribute or sell the project source code, including the art and audio files included with it.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Contact/Support</strong>\n<p>\r\n\tHaving trouble with the game?
