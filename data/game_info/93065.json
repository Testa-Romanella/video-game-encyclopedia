Therefore, the gameplay is not based on button mashing like in most other athletics games: it's all about good timing.<br/>(A third key allows to lean forward on certain occasions: to finish a sprint, a jump, or to jump over a hurdle.)</p><ul><li><strong>Solo</strong>: compete against increasingly strong opponents and become a champion in each event.</li><li><strong>Splitscreen</strong>: play against 3 friends on the same computer.</li><li><strong>Online</strong><ul><li>Confront the world record and your friends' records.</li><li>Challenge mode: compete against increasingly strong records from the leaderboards and become a concurrent for other players.</li><li>Daily Contest : experience the stress of competition with a limited number of attempts each day.
