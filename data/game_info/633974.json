I wasn't really able to think of a good idea to go with the theme so I just made it so that you have to escape from a platformer level (lame). The game isn't that good, there are only four levels,\u00a0it's a mess of code and\u00a0there isn't that much to it so I'll probably keep updating it after the jam.</p>\n<p>Engine: Godot</p>\n<p>Art: Pixelorama</p>\n<p>Sound: Chiptone</p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/4-chiptunes-adventure</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T05:04:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bfa/bfada63e947bc38b6d42a10c47bbae57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Yamin Shihab"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
