I had to submit something for the game jam, so it isn't quite finished. I plan to do one update at the end of March, which will provide better balancing, fix bugs, and add a new Final Boss (who may have taken the scraps you ignored along the way...)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T17:48:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef4/ef4ac25704e412f5c48bb39787df7f42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Testting"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
