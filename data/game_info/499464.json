{"id": 499464, "slug": "falling-pont134", "name": "Falling (pont134)", "name_original": "Falling (pont134)", "description": "<p>Inspired by the autumn season, Falling is a Tetris-like game in which the objective is to clear the falling leaves before the pile reaches too high. Leaves will fall one by one, and your job is to match three in a row of the same color. Doing so will earn you some points, but beware, the longer you take, the more points you'll end up losing!</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Press 'A' or Left Arrow to move Left</li><li>Press 'D' or\u00a0 Right\u00a0Arrow to move Right</li><li>Press or hold 'S' or Down Arrow to move Down</li><li>Press 'Esc' at any point to quit the game</li></ul>\n\n<p>Falling is a short and simple game created with the intent of joining some small game jams. As such, its my first game that feels somewhat completed (more-so than other projects!) and any critiques are definitely welcome.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T03:14:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0fb/0fbbd84c0f7ccece465fac726c8bc322.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pont134"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
