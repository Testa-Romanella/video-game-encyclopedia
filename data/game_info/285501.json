When you press it, your heatmeter rises. When its reaches critical point you have to let it cooldown and can't shoot. Your goal is to make as many points as you can and reach the highest rank.</p>\n\n<p>This is one of my first games I made that has a real graphical interface. I just tried to make the simplest thing I could imagine to test out the capabilities of Gamemaker. It may not be the best game, but it works and it plays and it looks acceptable.</p>\n\r\n\r\nI am a single developer and all my games will be free to play over at itchio/steam/etc...\r\n<br/>I am currently making games as a hobby. <br/>This won't change in the near future, but with enough support via Patreon I can outsource some parts of game-making like art, sound and music. This will not only vastly improve the games, but will make development much \r\nfaster\r\nhttps://www.patreon.com/korbohned\r\nYour support is very appreciated!\r\nKorbohneD", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbc/cbc3c05b03250a8da5f7e9c144d26a55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KorbohneD"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
