You can walk around the map and interact/read poems that you find. You can access the controls <br/>in game using the pause menu, but I'll also put them above. <br/></p>\n<p>NOTICE: I found the textures for the motorcycle, trees, chair, and fence on google images. Every other texture was made by me using Aseprite. Also, the sounds were downloaded from freesound.org.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T16:38:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/100/100a57117d7f723ff0f8feb22d14f811.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["GameDev_Noob"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
