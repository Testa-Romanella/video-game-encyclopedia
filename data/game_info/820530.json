The ingredients, however,\u00a0aren't going to cooperate if they can help it. Before you\u00a0<em>roll</em> them up, you have to <em>dice\u00a0</em>them into neat piles by dragging the fresh ingredients across the kitchen.</p>\r\nControls and Instructions\r\n<p><strong>Move</strong> - Arrow Keys</p>\n<p><strong>Dice</strong> - Z</p>\n<p><strong>Roll Sushi\u00a0</strong>- X</p>\n<p><strong>Grab / Release</strong>\u00a0- C</p>\n<p>Sushi rolls have to have at least seaweed and rice. Cucumber and sauce are optional but make for a more delicious treat. You get extra credit if you remember to dice the roll too.\u00a0</p><p>The attack and grab hit boxes are a little wonky, but you'll have an easier time walking toward your [victim] and pressing the button when you're very close.</p>\r\nCredit\r\n<p>Liam Gilligan made the sprites and animations by hand. Riley Gilligan\u00a0helped Jules Gilligan with basically everything in Unity when he\u00a0wasn't making sound effects with household objects.
