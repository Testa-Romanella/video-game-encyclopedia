What Ted thinks is best for Theo isn't necessarily a view shared by Teddy, however; the primal, emotional subconscious voice...\u00a0<br/><br/>In the process of repairing Cortex, re-hiring a team and finding out what happened the night of the accident, Ted and Teddy must cast aside their differences and learn to work together. Headspun is a game about recovery, discovery, and the ongoing battle between logic and emotion.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n<ul><li>Rich FMV story-telling</li><li>Branching dialogue - sway the outcome of your interactions</li><li>Rebuild Cortex - earn Neuros to hire staff and commission renovations\u00a0</li><li>Retrieve Lost Memories and work out what happened the night of Theo's accident</li><li>Original Synthwave Score from Soho Loop</li></ul>\r\n\r\nTHE DAZED EDITION\r\n<p><strong><em>IMPORTANT PLEASE READ :</em></strong>\u00a0Headspun:\u00a0Dazed Edition is an early access version of the game.\u00a0If you're looking for a final, slick game experience and want to experience the story in its finished form -\u00a0<strong>please wait for the full release.</strong>\u00a0If you're happy getting stuck into something unfinished\u00a0and would like to involve yourself in the remainder of\u00a0development - the Dazed Edition might be for you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anybody that purchases the DRM-free\u00a0Dazed\u00a0Edition will also be entitled to a Deluxe Edition Steam key when the full release rolls around later next month.
