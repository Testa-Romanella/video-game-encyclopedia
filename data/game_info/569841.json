Please load the reel marked \"PICTURESTART\" first.</p>\n<p>The reels do NOT go in order, as you have to decide which reels to load next when</p>\n<p>facing crucial points in the story.\u00a0 Don't change the reels until you see all your options.</p>\n<p>You can re-watch until you make your final decision. This is just a preview of a much larger scaled story. No spoilers here but INTRIGUE! THRILLS! SPILLS! &amp; More! <br/></p>\n<p> THE SHAKING!!! Wonderfully unique game mechanism.<br/></p>\n<p>To run:</p>\n<p>Type in the speed to run each reel. Zero is static and you press the keyboard &gt; arrow</p>\n<p>to go to the next frame. This way you can progress at your own speed. Any number</p>\n<p>higher than 0 has it automatically play, but it will be harder to read subtitles! Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Works on Spectrum ZX emulator. Tested on fuse.
