Move your character up and down with the [W] and [S] keys. Occasionally the waves will dip and you need to shout as loud as you can to get them up again. Beat your high score over and over again looking dumb whilst playing it.</p>\n<p>For the best possible experience, play this in an otherwise quiet room, so no background music, no chit-chat between other people, no outside sounds.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72a/72ae4d8e5212b314f9f16eb63480801d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nemo Wir\u00e9n"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
