Your goal is to defeat the evil that is spreading in his world. To achieve this, you will have to face various enemies.<br/></p>\r\nSubject of the project :\r\n<p> \"Making a platformer using the basic mechanics of Super Mario Bros (1985), changing the theme, the story and the aesthetics. You will have to integrate a singular feature (USP)\".<br/></p>\r\nMechanics : \r\n<p><strong>Movement :<br/></strong><br/>The platformer subject made me think of an agile and fast character. That's why I chose a monkey. My character choice therefore defined the movement mechanics :<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Make long jump</li><li>Climb some walls</li><li>Horizontal movements</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Abilities :</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Now that the movements were defined, I needed an offensive ability to eliminate the enemies. I'm Not very good at programming, so I needed something simple and effective. So I opted for a projectile that launches from the blue crystal above the character's head.</p>\n<p>This ability consumes energy with each use, because I wanted the player to be able to manage his resources to be more proactive, he will have to choose to shoot or dodge the enemy.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Pick up power-ups :<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Blue crystal : allows you to reload your energy bar</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Yellow crystal : unlocks the dash, allows access to new areas</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Pink crystal : Allows you to switch from the basic projectile to the \"explosive\". It is useful for unlocking a shortcut\r\n\r\n</li></ul>\n\r\nLevel design :\r\n<p>For the level design, I was constrained by the engine, I could not give inclinations to the platforms.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The first step was to define the character's metrics, distance and height jump, movement speed, air control and his box collision.<br/></p>\n<p>Then I made several paper sketches using the tiles as a scale. I also created a legend to find myself in the different interactions.</p>\n\n<p>The second step was to test the levels with placeholders to see if everything was in order before final assembly.<em> (Sorry, I haven't taken pictures of this step).</em></p>\n<p>Finally, after many iterations and tests, I know that my levels are ready, I have used the software \"Tiled\" to join my different tiles.</p>\n\n\r\nEnemies :\r\n<p>All enemies were created on photoshop and animate with adobe <br/>animate.</p>\n<ul><li>The blue mush, cause damage if he catches you. </li></ul>\n<ul><li>The green mush, release a gas above him if you are too close.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>The crystal mush, launches projectiles.<br/>\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n\n\r\nPost mortem :\r\n<p>Looking back, I would have liked to focus more on the 3Cs, because the controls are rigid and the character lacks finesse in his movements.</p>\n<p>My lack of iterations on the mechanics makes the core gameplay too simplistic, I would have liked to have a more singular mechanic.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I'm quite satisfied with the level design part because the process what I used allowed me to test and improve the levels very quickly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Worker : </strong>Solo project<br/><strong>Technologies :</strong> Phaser 3 (JavaScript)<br/><strong>Production time :</strong> 2 months<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T09:12:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55c/55c83bbdd65668add1dc6a8dcc2508fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MedericCardon"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
