Voidborn was my final project on my Bachelors and was an experiment to see if a Grid based combat system could be developed within the Unreal Engine. The project was a success though did lack some additional elements that would have helped it really stand out. For the projects success i did research into A* Pathfinding algorithms for the enemy AI\u2019s navigation of the grid. I was able to develop two unique enemy types with different styles of attack and had a selection of difficulties for the player to try out. The player had a selection of different agents to play as each with their own style of play. These agents where intended to have unique abilities associated with them but due to time constraints they were not fully implemented into the game. Over all it was my most successful university project scoring me 90/100.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T05:42:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a10/a101cf12cbf6f062953aa518ada12b27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TDScale"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
