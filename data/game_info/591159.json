You can feel a distant pull towards an unseen object. It seems like your creator needs his key!</p>\n<p>Jump and bumble around a 3-color world attempting to bring your master's keys back to him. Slowly pick up speed until you soar across the map. But be careful, if you move too quickly your tin body will compact, meaning you 2.0 will pick up where you left off.</p>\n<p>This is my second jam game and the first I've done alone. It is not super polished as I am not used to this speed of work. Obviously missing some music, but I hope you all enjoy sliding around the levels as your pulled by the draw of your creator's keys.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T04:09:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de6/de63f64282156106ae2fc1cb478ba01a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["jchurro"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
