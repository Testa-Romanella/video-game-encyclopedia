The aim is to control the sailing vessel, pick up cargos and deliver them before the time runs out. You need to adjust sails and rudder according to the changing wind conditions. Currently it lacks some explanation on how the sail and wind mechanics work but you can still discover and figure out. There is also right mouse dragging camera control with zooming function. Any kind of feedback is much appreciated, since this is my very first try on game development.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T07:18:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a75/a75912e4229ad03d35c1a2e9df719c92.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Xagokz"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
