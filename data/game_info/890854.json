The game is playable without a headset and involves slowly wandering a small environment with spatialized, complimentary audio objects that weave a pleasant soundscape as you walk. It's a simple prototype but I hope if you play it, you find it relaxing!</p>\n\n<p>The demo is currently only playable on PC.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T12:02:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a6/6a6f38c86dda896407e10ee44fa6403f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pretentiouslemon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
