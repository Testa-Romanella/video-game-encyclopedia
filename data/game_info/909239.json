The main question and answer tools use the basic skill roll, with automatic yes-no, and critical yes-no behaving exactly as a skill/attribute check is made. This means that most questions can be asked and answered without needing to refer to these rules at all.\r\n</p>\n<p>The open question tools, used for questions like \"what are they thinking?\" or \"what is in the box?\" use a pair of word grids, similar to Word Mill's Mythic, but these lists have been customized to reflect BareBones Fantasy. The two word grids live on just one page; that is the only page you would need to print off if you wanted to play away from a computer.\r\n</p>\n<p>The bulk of this book is made up of examples, tips and advice to help you get into solo playing the game with a minimum of snags and false starts.\r\n</p>\n<p>Print + PDF bundles of this title are available from my own store.\u00a0https://ppmgames.myshopify.com/products/light-fantasy-solo</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T17:16:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68d/68d7580aa20982e8197a7c326b979061.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Parts Per Million"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
