Before he painted Henry the VIII he was well known for what we commonly refer to now as \u201cThe Dance of Death\u201d.\r\n </p>\n<p>Hans Holbein\u2019s \u201cDance of Death\u201d is a 16th century print series satirising late medieval society. Using a common motif of the time, a dancing skeleton, to represent the abstract idea of death. This series was arguably the first comic satire in print and ancestor of the comic book.\r\n </p>\n<p>In 2020 I collaborated with the FABLAB at the New University of Lisbon. The project was to produce a series of 20 miniature prints at the same size as Holbein\u2019s. I used google\u2019s deepdream generator to embellish my drawings with Hans Holbein\u2019s style. These drawings were then engraved onto acrylic plaques that were used to print onto paper. The resulting miniature prints are 45mm by 65mm and can be seen here (Dance Of Death 2020 on flickr).\r\n </p>\n<p>The motive of the project was to see what fun dancing skeletons would get up to in our society of corporations, technology and markets. I hope it entertains and provokes.\r\n </p>\n<p>This is a pixel version I have made into a Game Boy Rom.\r\n </p>\n<p> <strong>How to use</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Run the Game Boy emulator in your browser, on your computer or on your phone. Press the button above that says \u201cRun Game\u201d.Use the arrow keys on your computer keyboard and \u201cZ, X\u201d. If you are on a smartphone, you hopefully will get a Game Boy interface of a d-pad and buttons. These can be used to navigate through the images.\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T07:10:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/351/351e504e6e51e4670a8d090b5f1cdf7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bad_Dad"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
