Her name was Laika, and you're on a mission to bring her home alive. Navigate the treacherous gravity of low-Earth orbit and fire camera probes at passing satellites to determine which one is Sputnik-2.</p><p>Laika was made in around 48 hours as part of Global Game Jam 2021. Everything was made by hand, except for SFX, which are courtesy of ChipTone by SFBGames.</p><p>Made by:\u00a0Steven Messner<br/></p><p>Music by: Matthew O'Connor</p>\r\nTips:\r\n<ul><li>Satellites will orbit back around, so save\u00a0your boost for making small adjustments!</li><li>Work with Earth's orbital gravity, not against it.</li></ul>\r\nHOW TO PLAY\r\n<p>The goal is to\u00a0<strong>find Laika aboard Sputnik-2</strong>. Each time you play, the satellites orbiting Earth are randomly generated, so Laika is aboard a different-looking satellite each time.</p>\n<p>To find out which one is Sputnik-2, fire camera probes at the passing satellites or board them by getting close to one.</p>\n<p>You only have a limited amount of fuel and camera probes, so use them sparingly. Flying in space is hard, so make small adjustments to your trajectory instead of holding down the boost button\u2014or else you'll overshoot your target!</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<p>W:\u00a0Boost<br/>A/D: Rotate<br/>Space: Launch camera probe<br/>Mouse: Can control space craft using HUD. Also used for some menu prompts.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T10:41:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d78/d787d3dac32bfd496e184497396beb07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Steven Messner"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
