Locked in your bunker you will have to build, assemble and program an army of robots to lead your reconquest.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to achieve your goals and your curiosity will lead you to unexplored areas.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>I AM LEGION\u00a0is in Early Access.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>GAME FEATURES:</strong></p>\n<p>- <strong>Build a fleet of robots</strong> to take over the Fortress City sector by sector. Pay attention to their capabilities - weight, speed, resource costs, build time - to deploy a balanced army to meet the needs of each mission.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-<strong> Program your robots</strong> to optimise their behaviour by correctly analysing the data you get from the missions. Once your robots are deployed, you can only witness their success or failure!</p>\n<p>- <strong>Influence your victory conditions </strong>by following your instincts or those of the other characters you meet in the adventure. Your exchanges with them will strongly influence your game.</p>\n<p>Reconquer the city, save its citizens, analyse the invader, and develop your robots to their ultimate limit, your priorities define your future.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>EARLY ACCESS</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em><strong>Why early access?</strong></em></p>\n<p>Early access offers a unique opportunity to communicate directly with players, which is a key point in the development of I AM LEGION. We are exploring gameplay ideas that are new and the game will require careful balancing. The exchange with players during the early access period will give us the opportunity to move the game in the right direction.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>For approximately how long will this game be in early access?</strong></em></p>\n<p>Depending on the features we have planned, and the feedback from the community, we plan to leave the game in early access for 8 to 14 months.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>How does the final version plan to be different from the early access version?</strong></em></p>\n<p>The early access version is intended to be a representative preview of the final version of the title, including the core gameplay mechanics. The final version will have more content, the narrative campaign will be longer, there will be more mission types and more robot parts.</p>\n<p>There will also be more mechanics for managing districts and bonus buildings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We have a lot of ideas for I AM LEGION and we would like to invite the community to join us in fixing any bugs, coming up with new ideas and making sure the full version meets their expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>What is the current status of the early access version?</strong></em></p>\n<p>In its Early Access version, I AM LEGION is fully playable with its core mechanics. You will be able to launch the reconquest of your city by deploying the robots you have built and programmed in different types of missions. You can also upgrade your robot fleet by unlocking new technologies and you can experience the game's story in one third of its final form.</p>\n<p>The 3D robot parts can be in three states:\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Waiting for production / They are symbolized with a red shader</p>\n<p>- They are modelled but not textured / They are symbolised with a blue shader or present in metallic form.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- They are finished / The robot part is fully modelled with its texture and FX.</p>\n<p>The production of the robot parts is quite long. We will update the game each time a group of parts is ready.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Where can I contact you if I have any questions or problems with the game?\u00a0</strong></em><br/></p>\n<p>You can reach us at this email address: ial@leikir.io<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T14:14:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd2/cd2365d76b0c048f7847d06562e3ebca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LeikirStudio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
