Our plan was to design a game where the player would combine different ingredients in order to create potions and mixtures (WIP), all of which have effects that involve acts of kindness, mindfulness and bringing people closer together. As it stands, the brewing mechanics aren't implemented yet, so the game (for the time being) is just a chill little experience where you get to enjoy the artstyle, perform limited interactions with your surroundings, and listen to soothing music. The recipes and lore for each potion are also accessible, even if you can't do anything with them (yet!).<br/></p>\n<p>Brewed with love by:</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Johanna Josefsson (Rymdlingen), programming</p>\n<p>- Juan \"Conimor\"\u00a0Mar\u00edn, writing, sound and music</p>\n<p>- Mareike Reh, art</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T08:47:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2b/c2b332be1b29d7b86ebb740146c860f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rymdlingen", "Mareike Reh", "Conimor"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
