These data will be saved for later use. Acceleration data recorded can also be displayed graphically.<br/><br/>For professional use (seismograph), it is recommended to use the \"myVibrometer\" app.<br/><br/>Features:<br/>- Measuring vibration in real time<br/>- Counter for consumed energy<br/>- Vibrations recording function<br/>- Calculation of minimum and maximum vibration along the axes x, y, z<br/>- Multiplayer game (wins the challenge the player who makes the device vibrate less)<br/>- Chart of accelerations recorded along the axes x,y,z<br/>- Zoom for accelerations diagram<br/>- Ability to save the diagrams of accelerations in the \"Photo Album\" of the device<br/>- Diagrams of accelerations can be sent by email", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:06:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1b/d1b53fad4036c52cbe1c51774b5e2693.jpg", "website": "http://www.ngcybit.it", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Gianluca Natalini"], "genres": ["Action", "Family"], "publishers": ["Gianluca Natalini"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
