Most of Sophie\u2019s days consist of managing her potions business that she runs out of her house. She takes her job of being a mother very seriously and would do anything to protect her daughter despite the risky hijinks Bella manages to get herself into.\u00a0<br/><br/><br/><br/>\r\nBella is a energetic, intelligent, and mischievous fairy that lives with Sophie.\u00a0She is an extremely rare mythical creature who\u2019s existence must be kept secret. The last time a fairy was spotted in the wild was over 100 years ago and they seldom leave the fairy realm. Bella left the fairy realm for unknown reasons despite being a famous actress.<br/>\n<br/><br/><br/>\r\nLily is a barmaid from the local tavern in the village on the edge of the forest where Sophie lives. Despite it being a bit of a walk, Lily visits her friend every other day when she\u2019s not at work. Sophie has an enormous crush on Lily, and it is very likely that Lily feels the same but they are both too nervous to make the first move.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDirector, Writer, Producer: WitchyDev\r\nSprite Artist: Temteno\u00a0\r\nBackground Artist: matchai-kat\r\nProofreader: Oiishi, Katakatica\r\nUI Design: Daxsu-Artsu\r\nMusic: TimBeek, Klaus0", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T21:14:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/384/384207b8f5bd073cad6b7f19cee15b87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["WitchyDev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
