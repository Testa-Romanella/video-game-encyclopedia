Move with the arrow keys. You win when you reach 7. At the time of this writing, both this and Not Flappy Bird are still in development, so expect particle effects and music, and more fun stuff in the future for both games. This is my second PICO-8 game and I made it in a short span of time simply for entertainment, so as with Not Flappy Bird, don't expect it to be great. Soon enough I will stop experimenting and start making more interesting games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-30T09:32:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5a/e5aee8bc4a42885393ec1692deac899c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["revquant"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
