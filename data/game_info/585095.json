Moreover, the difficulty of the game will increase. The game is made in the style of minimalism - mainly 2 colors - black and red. Since this is early access, there will be a few bugs here. Jump over obstacles over and over again. Die more and more often. There are also soundtracks in the game. There are only 4 of them. But when the game comes out in full access, I will try to fix all acceptable and identified errors and improvements.</p>\n<p>The game will appeal to hardcore fans.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T07:26:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f6/2f66b45e84d7f308710539d9ffae4c1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["prostofficial"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
