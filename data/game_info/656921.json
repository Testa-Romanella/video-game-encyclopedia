It currently revolves around the idea of getting better swords to fight stronger enemies which both scale heavily. It's still very early on in progress and is just a little passion project of mine.</p>\n<p>Expect heavy bugs because the game is in very early pre-alpha/prototype. If you die there will be an error screen so be expecting that. Please let me know of any other bugs besides that.</p>\n<p>To start the\u00a0 game press N, put in any port, and then the game will begin, be sure to pick up a sword. At the current time the game supports a glitchy version of local multiplayer and online multiplayer which is still being worked on. To use online multiplayer make sure to put in your friend's public IP, to use local multiplayer leave the multiplayer IP slot to default.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - to move around.</p>\n<p>QE - spells which are unique to every sword.</p>\n<p>numpad0 - force skip level.</p>\n<p>numpad1 - give 100 gold.</p>\n\n<p>Credit:</p>\n<p>Friendly Cosmonaut - amazing youtube tutorials that helped me get started.</p>\n<p>Heartbeast\u00a0 - more great tutorials and drew the sprites for the main characters and walls, also created the random dungeon generator Cloaked uses.</p>\n<p>0x72 - for a ton of wonderfully drawn pixel art.</p>\n<p>GMnet - multiplayer which is still a WIP.<br/></p>\n<p>Testers - thanks to the testers E_liar, Chunky Soup, JubNib, NoahW, and Mr. Valentine,\u00a0for helping out in the long tedious testing process.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T01:10:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a87/a87caa596275a7bae178a4309d1ccbb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["underdoghero1"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
