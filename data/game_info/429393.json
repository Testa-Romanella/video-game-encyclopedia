There are obstacles (rocks) and rewards (oranges).<br/></p>\n<p>This was a small project of mine \u2013 I should say concept \u2013 , it's available on GitHub: https://github.com/4321ba/snake3d</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:<br/>Keyboard: Turn with WASD or arrows, R to restart.<br/>Touch: touch the corresponding part of the screen to turn.</p><p>You can also watch gameplay on YouTube (sorry if it showed twice): </p><p>The web version needs WebGL2, which Safari and Edge (I guess the old one) doesn't have. Download it or use Firefox or Chromium.<br/></p>\n<p>I didn't test the Mac version at all, and neither the Windows one natively, so comment if something's wrong.</p>\n<p>Also comment, if you liked it! I would love some feedback.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T09:31:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a7/8a76d0c9ef720f04799a539bd9768176.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["1234ab"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
