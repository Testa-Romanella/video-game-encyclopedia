You can copy the character to your project as a plug-and-play  asset to prototype 3D games with and build upon.\r\n </p>\n<p>It features a character that can run, jump, make a melee attack, aim, shoot, and throw grenades. <br/></p>\n\n<p>There are two kinds of enemies: flying wasps that fire bullets and beetles that attack you on the ground. The environment comes with breakable crates, jumping pads, and coins that move to the player's character.</p>\n\r\nHow to run:\r\n<ol><li>Download or clone the GitHub repository.\r\n</li><li>Press F5 or Run Project.\r\n</li></ol>\r\n\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>WASD or left stick to move.\r\n</li><li>mouse or right stick to move the camera around.\r\n</li><li>Space or Xbox \u24b6 to jump.\r\n</li><li>Left mouse or Xbox \u24b7 to shoot.\r\n</li><li>Right mouse or Xbox RTto aim.\r\n</li><li>Tab or Xbox \u24cd to cycle between bullets and grenades.\r\n</li></ul>\r\nFAQ:\r\n\r\nHow do I use the player character in my game?\r\n<p>Copy the following folders into the root of your project:\r\n </p>\n<ul><li>Player: contains the main Player assets and scenes.\r\n</li><li>shared: contains shaders used by the player asset.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>The following Input Map actions are needed for the Player.tscn to work:\r\n </p>\n<ul><li>move_left, move_right, move_up, move_down: move the character according to the camera's orientation.\r\n</li><li>camera_right, camera_left, camera_up, camera_down: rotate the camera around the character.\r\n</li><li>jump, attack, aim, swap_weapons: Action buttons for the character.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>The Player.tscn scene works as a standalone scene and doesn't need other cameras to work.
