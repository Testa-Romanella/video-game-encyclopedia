It is at this time an ancient mind <br/>awakes and begins reaching out to some of the last survivors on the planet, having them <br/>unite as one force in one of the last surviving kingdoms. These strangers are then faced <br/>with a truth so terrifying that they must confront their own inner demons if they ever hope <br/>to make a stand against the living dead, for the true force behind it all is waiting on the other side.. <br/><br/><br/>Special Features- <br/><br/><strong>Unique dual random battle system-</strong> Choose four characters in your immediate party to complete <br/>sections of the game, during which there are random encounters happening both in this immediate party <br/>as well as back at the home base, choosing from your remaining characters. This allows for added <br/>difficulty in GALER, as a defeat in either random battle results in game over. <br/><br/><strong>Magic creation-</strong> Players have the ability to test and create new forms of magic using ingredients <br/>collected throughout GALER. <br/><br/><strong>Checking for traps-</strong> Not unlike detect traps in Dungeons &amp; Dragons, if a rogue is on your team <br/>they can perform a detect traps skill in dungeons. <br/><br/><strong>Appraise items-</strong> A player can uncover rare items during the game that can be appraised and equipped <br/>as magical weapons/armor <br/><br/><strong>Tons of subplots and hidden storylines-</strong> Depending on who is (and who is not) on your immediate party and the time in which <br/>you are in certain areas, unique subplots can be revealed that changes the relationships between other <br/>characters in the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:14:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f75/f75efcecd341c3f0595ab9080f345b78.jpg", "website": "http://galerplagueofheroes.weebly.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Graham Dodge"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Graham Dodge"], "esrb_rating": null}
