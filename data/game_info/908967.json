I  also slowed the Speed charge a bit as it moved too fast for people to  read it. Thanks for the feedback!\r\n\r\nUpdate 01-11-23 - Keyboard  controls! My version of mouse-only controls appeared to be pretty  unusable for a lot of players, so I added in a keyboard option. It still  defaults to mouse-only for original experience, but now you can toggle  keyboard mode with \u2018T\u2019. You do still have to use the mouse for the Level  Menu, but everything else has a hotkey.\r\n\r\n<p>--------------------<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Solo dev on this one!</strong> <em>All  graphics, models, textures, rigging, music, SFX and coding were done by  me for this jam except for Tail Animator, Easy Save asset and bowling  pin sound effects (which were from a sound pack I own).
