From another perspective, this contrast also represents our life by illustrating wellness and depression.\r\n </p>\n<p>In komorebi, light and shadow play a heavy role.\u00a0 The lights represent hopes that come into our lives, giving us a healthy mind, and making us feel alive. Meanwhile, the shadows on the ground represent the worst time in our lives and evoke a melancholic feeling. However, when you see the whole picture, the contrast between light and shadow creates a realization in your mind. You realize that you are no longer the same person and how much time has passed since then.\r\n</p>\r\nCredit\r\n<ul><li>Audios :\u00a0Minyo San Kyoku by Doug Maxwell/ Zac Zinger. </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T15:31:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73a/73a75477a6dc03383408bc8fb689395d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["reilivia"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
