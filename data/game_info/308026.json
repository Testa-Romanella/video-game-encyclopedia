Can you\u00a0end the threat\u00a0of the Zebryx once and for all and bring peace to the skies?</em></strong></p>\n<p>Play this all new, action-packed, original\u00a0game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. A classic genre, reimagined for a modern audience, this game has been developed from scratch to run on the original NES, and when you buy the game you'll receive a ROM file upon completion.\u00a0 The ROM\u00a0will be playable on\u00a0standard NES emulators as well as on actual NES hardware\u00a0using a flash cartridge such as an Everdrive. This may or may not work on clone systems like a Retron, so be warned that your mileage may vary.\u00a0 It will work on the Analogue NT Mini and the RetroUSB AVS, in addition to an original NES.</p>\n<p>Players who pre-order the game before final release\u00a0get limited access to the 6502 assembly language source code for educational purposes. The game is currently in development. While important updates will be posted here in the devlog, this game is also being developed publicly both live on Twitch and also with devlogs posted on\u00a0YouTube.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-08T06:36:34", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Celisphere Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
