Therefore, when you start racing, you won't have the greatest \n      car, but as you progress and gain access to better Capsule Machines, \n      your car will become the envy of the racing world! The game uses both \n      screens together when you race, so the tracks will appear huge on your \n      Nintendo 3DS, and even more so on your Nintendo 3DS XL! And you're free \n      to customize your car any way you like! Try to make the ultimate, \n      unbeatable car! Compete on 12 different tracks, race in Grand Prix \n      races, and compete in 6 different racing grades! The game includes 6 \n      grades of Capsule Machines, and even more special Capsule Machines you \n      can unlock! You can even combine parts to raise their stats! In \n      addition, you can use StreetPass to race against other players and \n      receive new parts!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26d/26dd1113a0dc5b1adf72457d48027695.jpg", "website": "http://www.natsume.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo 3DS"], "developers": ["Arc System Works Co."], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Natsume"], "esrb_rating": null}
