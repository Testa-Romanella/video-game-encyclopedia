It's an avatar made both for PC and Quest and therefore I kept it simple but charming. :)<br/><br/>The model, model's rig and textures are entirely made from scratch by me for the Jam.<br/><br/>The model has 2 different rigs and weights for PC and Quest to make it look smooth on both platforms, I also made sure the shader's look carries over between them in spirit of inclusion.<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T09:38:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7c/f7c9fa3a6f7789d3f8bb3b05c7c8427b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nini_Cookie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
