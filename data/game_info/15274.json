Reminds the best samples from the history of world animation. There is an impression that the directors and operators of the highest Hollywood level worked on all the scenes in the game - the hero&#39;s simple passage through the hanging ladder suddenly turns into an exciting panorama that you want to admire for a long time. Voices speaking the ancient Scandinavian languages, and beautiful original music help to create a tangible atmosphere of Nordic folklore and adventure.\u2028These advantages draw attention to the game, despite the lack of continuous action. There is no such action in the game, but when it does happen, its epic nature is suited to the world of Nordic fairy tales. Plots of these tales and a description of the world of Nordic myths are adequately represented in the game, it is even possible to study this topic. The gameplay consists of exploring large levels, searching for runes to enter the next level, avoiding various exotic troubles and rare but epic and picturesque battles.</p>", "metacritic": 79, "released": "2015-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-12T07:15:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/032/0329db96e252aa41e672da2ba16f914c.jpg", "website": "http://jotungame.com/", "rating": 3.07, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 557, "owned": 4272, "beaten": 151, "toplay": 73, "dropped": 229, "playing": 22}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 220, "ratings_count": 503, "suggestions_count": 477, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 507, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "PC", "Xbox One", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Thunder Lotus Games", "Thunder Lotus"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Thunder Lotus Games"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
