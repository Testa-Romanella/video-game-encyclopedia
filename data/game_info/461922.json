The main tool I used to accomplish this for Hug Force was through tilesets.\u00a0For stuff such as cliffs, lakes, or even UI elements I had a normal tilemap and a\u00a0 flipped tilemap. This way, I could flip the sprites I had pointing in one direction through code so they looked the other way.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Final note:</strong></p>\n<p>I really enjoyed my time making this, and if you end up liking the game and are interested to see more, I am planning to keep developing the game after the jam, so be on the lookout for that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-06T02:40:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6db/6dbc84f63aa86e55d5111eb6c219c429.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["JoseRG003"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
