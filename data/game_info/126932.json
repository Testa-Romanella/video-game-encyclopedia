Why did you feel called to this place? Enter the Enchanted Castle to find out.</p>\n<p>This text based adventure game was originally written for the JimJam game jam. It played 18th overall, mostly due to having no music or sound effects. This current release remains silent for now as we decide what kind of soundtrack should accompany the game. We would appreciate your thoughts on this. Should we just have sound effects associated with your actions in the game? Should we have a musical soundtrack or just simple random ambiance? Let us know in the comments section.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e6/5e66c6b62320f2decfd578c3d3edabf8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GearBunny Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
