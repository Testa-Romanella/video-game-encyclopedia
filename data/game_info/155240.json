When there are no more bricks you win. But don't let your ball fall to the bottom of the screen.</strong></p><p><strong>Crazy Mode (There are ten levels in this mode) <br/>Bounce the ball at the wall of bricks. When there are no more bricks you win. But don't let your ball fall to the bottom of the screen. </strong></p><p><strong>Flip Mode (There are ten levels in this mode) <br/>Bounce the ball at the flip. When there are no more flips and you see the artwork behind it you win. But don't let your ball fall to the bottom of the screen. </strong></p><p><strong>Opposite Mode (There are six levels in this mode) <br/>you are the Wall and you have to just prevent the ball from hitting you. </strong></p><p><strong>With all of that you will have more hours of fun, the one that was most fun to me was opposite mode, and it takes you and puts you in the enemies' shoes.</strong></p><p><strong>So over all I really found this game to be a great fun classic with a new take on things.<br/>I hope more people play this game, because you will enjoy it. </strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac7/ac79d1c481499c301dc6566c68d53d26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sunrisekingdom"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
