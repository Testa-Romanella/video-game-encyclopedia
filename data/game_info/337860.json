Knowing now that I\u00a0will likely never finish those last bits and I'm definitely not going to make a whole game (though it was fun to think about), I release it now into the world - fully playable with just some blue line sketches for expressions in the last scene (last screenshot).</p>\n<p>BB:WC has a short run time (&lt;10 minutes), contains EXPLICIT CONTENT, profanities, 1 animation, and\u00a0embedded music (can turn off in settings).</p>\n<p>The final scene gives the player the\u00a0option of either making out (non-explicit/wireplay),\u00a0 or choosing from two R18 options:\u00a0SG (Genos bottoms) or GS\u00a0(Saitama bottoms).\u00a0 The art for the scenes isn't incredibly graphic (entry points obscured), but the text is definitely NSFW. ~WARNING etc~</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>CREDITS<br/>Art &amp; Story - Dechanique<br/>Coding - Mineraloid<br/>Fireworks Animation - Kristen Garcia</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-01T03:49:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad3/ad3285cc364f945eb3a5a7baa81a3c1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 240, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["dechanique"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
