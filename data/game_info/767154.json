He stumbled upon a dungeon of human origin with a lot of loosely placed objects inviting to drop them from the shelves. But everything is not so simple, for in this dungeon lives an ancient guardian. One whom cats call \"The Hoover Of Doom\". It will chase any cat that decides to venture into it's dungeon. Will Pop Cat be able to delay the inevitable for long enough to survive? Find out for yourself!</p>\n<p>Our second try at ldjam. Theme is very good this time! And what is more inevitable than endless runners and memes? This time we're more confident of ourselves, but a lot of improvements could be done still and we hope we'll have time to polish this game further a bit after the jam ends.
