Unlike most shooters, you can safely collide with bullets as long as you are the same color as them. Switch back and forth from red and blue, and hold the color button to turn purple. But there's also black bullets and missiles, which must be avoided at all cost.<br/><br/>The game was built around a painted watercolor theme &amp; features an inventive chaining/damage system that results in a more puzzle-esque type of shooter. The closer you are to an enemy, the more damage you do. But this puts you in more danger, so be careful to get close for more damage but don't get yourself blown up! When you are within a certain distance of an enemy while it's destroyed, you will \"chain\". Do this 4 times to increase your score multiplier to get as much points as you can. The entire game was built around this mechanic, every enemy was placed with the purpose of being able to be chained. It can be enjoyed by simply blasting everything in sight, but trying to chain every enemy you come across will allow the true design to come through.<br/><br/>As you advance through 5 main levels &amp; defeat the 5 bosses you will gain the skills to take on the 30 challenge levels available in the game. Playing the main will award you credits needed to unlock these challenge levels, which will test skills in dodging, damaging, and surviving, and get increasingly more difficult the further you progress.KEY FEATURES<ul><li>Dodge &amp; absorb <strong>4 different bullet colors</strong>.<br/></li><li>Risk/reward chaining system.<br/></li><li>Deal more damage (and score more points)  the <strong>closer</strong> you are to enemies.<br/></li><li>Unique <strong>watercolor aesthetic</strong>.<br/></li><li>Tough, dynamic boss fights.<br/></li><li><strong>5 main levels</strong> &amp; <strong>30 challenge levels</strong>.<br/></li><li>Color Blind mode included.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-25T11:39:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cdd/cddad09b411c5be1666fbd43b38cd10e.jpg", "website": "http://www.polaritybear.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["polaritybear", "Polarity Bear"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Polarity Bear"], "esrb_rating": null}
