Gather the 4 diamond relics and bring them to the stone structure in the middle of the map to win! Be wary though, every 6 minutes an attack wave of monsters will attack the monument. Defend it or you will lose!\u00a0Unlock powerful abilities as you level up! Then, regardless if you win or lose, take the coins that you obtained to upgrade yourself and the abilities you can get while playing.</p>\n<p>Controls are typical of a RTS (Real Time Strategy) game. As this was made to stress test an engine in that genre I'm working on.<br/>CONTROLS:<br/>- Right click to move<br/>- 1 to use Whirlwind<br/>- 2 to use Axe Throw<br/>- P to pause<br/>- H to hold position</p>\n<p>Tip!<br/>Stand close to the large stone that is near the starting area to heal!</p>\n\n\n<p>Still technically in development. Gameplay is all there. Just working on fixing bugs and improving performance. Also planned are more sound effects, and a lot more visual effects. In particular room transitions and for victory/defeat.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T15:39:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03c/03c424355f3b3935d22267b553d36951.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frostdream Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
