The file is labeled as a .bas.bin and will work on Atari2600 emulators.</p>\n<p>This is my first attempt at a remake for the Atari2600 and was written with Batari Basic so the game is severely limited in what it does, however the functionality is the exact same as FNaF2 it just looks a lot simpler because it's made on 40 year old hardware.</p>\n<p>I want to remake all of the FNaF2 death minigames for the Atari as the minigames themselves try to mimic what an atari looks like. I am starting work on the give gifts give life game and plan to eventually remake them all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Important Note: This game is not an executable and can only be ran with an Atari2600 emulator. I personally use Stella as my emulator however any emulator should be fine.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T08:42:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d98/d983deca8aa77e7a1c32c7aa204fc78e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["p_picklelol"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
