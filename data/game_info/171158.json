{"id": 171158, "slug": "force-of-wheel", "name": "Force of Wheel", "name_original": "Force of Wheel", "description": "<p>Description</p><p>This game is meant to be played with two people at the same keyboard. You both start off as triangles, and compete in a series of simple minigames. If you win a minigame, your polygon gains one side. To win, get to 8 sides.</p><p>Note: This was made for Ludum Dare 36, whose theme was Ancient Technology. We originally brainstormed some ideas in which you started off as a triangle and eventually became a wheel (or circle), which turned into this. It doesn't relate much to the original theme, but you can imagine some backstory in which a bunch of shapes are competing to become the first wheel in a series of challenges. This is also the first game we've ever made, so we hope you have fun and would love any feedback.</p><p>Controls</p><p>Player 1/yellow polygon: WASD</p><p>Player 2/green polygon: arrow keys</p><p>If you're interested, the (very messy, poorly written) source code can be found here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edd/edd44b47de5bb9c567cac8abb32d20a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["amp"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
