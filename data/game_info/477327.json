But here\u2019s the tricky part - the maze is spread out over a cube, and you can\u2019t see where the end of the path is! <br/><br/>Swipe up, down, left and right to spread colorful paths around the cube. It\u2019s super satisfying to watch the cube twist and turn as you paint it with color. But watch out - it gets trickier as more paths appear! So make sure you don\u2019t leave any path unpainted, or else you will need to retrace your steps to solve the puzzle! <br/><br/>Which direction will you take to make it to the end of the maze? It\u2019s your job to think outside of the box (or cube!) to make sure you complete each tricky challenge. As you complete more levels, you unlock more beautiful colors and patterns to paint with.<br/><br/>It\u2019s you against the cube - have you got what it takes?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T02:28:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36e/36e6bc82fc399c8d03edccf25e72a423_4nDWm0L.jpg", "website": "http://popcore.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Popcore"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Popcore"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
