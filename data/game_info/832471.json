Then, play back the recording to help you solve the second half of the puzzle. You only get one chance to record yourself. Otherwise you have to restart the level.</p>\n<p>This game was made for VR Game Jam 2022. This is my second game jam and my first for VR. I had planned to finish 8 levels but was only able to finish 6 for now. I have some clever plans for the future. I do expect to add more levels at a later date.</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<ul><li>Left joystick - walk</li><li>Right joystick - rotate</li><li>Grip - grab items</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Please let me know if you find any bugs.</strong></p>\n<p>Credits\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Hands: Justin P Barnett https://www.patreon.com/posts/free-oculus-vr-46544401\r\n</li><li>Prototype Materials: Ciathyza https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/10624\r\n</li><li>Media Buttons: Bogdan https://www.cgtrader.com/bogdan\r\n</li><li>Music: X3nus https://freesound.org/people/X3nus/\r\n</li><li>Motor Prop: Asset Store Originals https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/40268\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T10:59:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b4/3b4b9f62a39847ca0e39e2677bcfe16c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["kylejramstad"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
