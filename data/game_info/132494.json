Theme \"Running out of Space\".</p>\n<p>https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/no-escape<br/></p>\r\nThe game\r\n<p>Trapped after robbing a bank you must resist as must as you can as you run out of cover and more cops keeping on coming after you. Armed with a gun, your now only friend, survive the hords of justice.</p>\r\nThe Controls\r\n\r\n<p>Both Dual Shock 4 and keyboard + mouse control are available!\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Movement - Left Stick / WASD</li><li>Aim - Right Stick / Mouse</li><li>Shooting - Square / Left Click</li><li>Shoulder change - X / Right Click</li></ul>\n<p>Shoulder change will let you modify the side at which the character is standing for a better aiming depending on where you are at the map.\r\n</p>\n<p>You can also check the control in-game right before you start the game.<br/></p>\r\nThe Characters\r\n<p>Goat Guy aka The \"Good guy\"<br/></p>\n<p>Da Police aka The \"Not so good\" guys</p>\n<br/>\r\nThe music\r\n\n<p>The music chosen this time is also creative commons done by the awesome artist by the name of Jahzzar that I found at freemusicarchive</p>\n<p>If you wanna download the tracks or listen to more of his music check out the links below:</p>\n<p>Jahzzar : http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Jahzzar/</p>\n<p>Menu theme : http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Jahzzar/Smoke_Factory/The_last_ones</p>\n<p>Gameplay theme : http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Jahzzar/Blinded_by_dust/Roads_that_burned_our_..</p>\n\r\nThe results\r\n<p>Done mainly using Unity3D, Photoshop/Paint and Blender it has proven to be quite a challenge for me in order to achive certain objectives. Nonetheless it was great fun learning new stuff and trying out some ideas.</p>\n<p>The theme was not something I really liked so the idea that came out to me was to actually \"run out of space to cover\". With that in mind I decided to make an approach to the Cabal/Blood Bros arcade games but with a different perspective and in 3D.</p>\n<p>As of now you can either download the game (recommended option) or try out the WebGL version, which won't be as good performance wise though.<br/></p>\n<p>Overall I'm pleased with the final results and will certainly work on the game in the future once I get the time. As always, I think there's room for improvement so I'll probably work on that first, adding more features and bug solving.</p>\r\nThe Highscore\r\n<p>Think you can beat mine? Go ahead an prove it xD</p>\n<br/>\r\nEnjoy, comment and vote!\r\n<p>Enjoy and any comments and criticism are welcome!<br/></p>\n<br/><em>Love playing around with mixamo animations </em><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f79/f795ccb87fa474f3eab0e0620ef83449.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["AkrosRB"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
