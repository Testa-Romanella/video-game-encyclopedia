The Project: Artificial Legacy Saga is setup to mimic the look and feel like a video game compilation, with each part being a full game that is crafted to look and feel like it came from a different console generation. <br/><br/>The first game 'Project: Artificial Legacy' is designed after a classic 1980's NES game and introduces us to a 7-year-old Kirana who with the aid of a device her father built must rescue him from the clutches of evil creatures who want to use her father's knowledge to create a weapon so they may take over the world. <br/><br/>Time in the game will flow similar to \"real life\" with each game take place roughly 4 years after the pervious, matching the change between console generations. Give that this game is going to be in Early Access for the next few years we have decided that we will be selling each game as DLC.<br/><br/><h3>Project: Artificial Legacy</h3>1000 years ago, humans were severed from their connection to the world's magic. Today Dr. Asher has created a device that will once again allow humans to re-tap into it. Code-named Project: Artificial Legacy, the device will allow its user access to different powers when combined with one of four crystals. But Evil forces from an unknown land have found out about the doctor's discovery and have kidnapped him. It\u2019s now up to his young daughter Kirana to use his prototype device and fight her way through an underground labyrinth to rescued him.<br/><br/>Jump, Push objects out of your way, stop lavafalls, and create blocks out of thin air, all while avoiding dangerous creatures as you travel deep underground searching for the 4 keys that will unlock your path to rescue your father. Along the way find the 3 missing crystals to unlock the full potential of the device and send them back enemies back to the world they came from, In this NES style action game.<h3>Super Project: Artificial Legacy*</h3>\"Kirana is Back! It has been 4 years since the events of 'Project: Artificial Legacy' and things have been pretty normal for Kirana, until one day while out and about she overheard some people in town claiming to have seen strange creatures on the outskirts of the forest, creatures that sound awful familiar!\"<h3>Project: Artificial Legacy 64*</h3>\"Kirana is taking the fight to the next dimension!\"<h3>Project: Artificial Legacy 4</h3><br/>* Title subject to change.<br/><br/><h3>The Idea Behind the Game(s): </h3>It all started with a single idea... \"What IF Medaverse Studio was founded in the 1980's?\" And with that we kicked off development of the 'Project: Artificial Legacy Saga'.<br/><br/>While we have seen many retro style games out there, we're adding our own spin on the idea. We're not just doing one game we're going to be doing Four and Each game will be designed to look and feel like it came from a different console generation. Each game will also be able to be played as a standalone game but will still be connected  (just like our favorite games that have been around for ages) . <br/><br/>Second, we are putting some very strict guidelines and limitations on each game, in theory we should be able to re-create the game on its given platform and it should look and play identical.<br/><br/>and third, when it comes to gameplay, we limit ourselves to what was already being done during specific era and try not to use gameplay that did not exist during that time. Example in our first game we limit ourselves to what was available up until 1987. Same goes when we look at material for inspiration  (e.g., other games, Movies, comics, books, etc.)  we limit ourselves to what was available during the given time frame we are \u201cworking in\u201d. When we select the date, we pick something reasonable for a release, we don\u2019t want to be releasing a SNES/Genesis game in the middle of the N64/PlayStaion era because we wanted to use a specific idea. While it might not be very evidenced in the first part, it will become more obvious in the future installments.<br/><br/>A lot of thought and preparation is going into the development of this series. It\u2019s going to be a good challenge and a lot of fun too.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-18T04:23:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d54/d546965302b68b00d3f29f37573db237.jpg", "website": "https://www.medaverse.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Medaverse Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Medaverse Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
