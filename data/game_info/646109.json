Try to get the highest score, and don't run into the big guys!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The web gl build for some reason thinks everyone is the same person for the leaderboard. The windows version does actually give a unique id to each player.</p><p>The game also starts to lag when you get to a certain size, this is due to us using physics rigid bodies with not a ton of optimization. As such as your atom gets larger, more and more load is being placed on the cpu, causing the lag in question.</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Your mouse is key, left click and hold guides your atom, right click zooms out.\u00a0</li><li>Read the tutorial for better information .</li></ul>\n<p>Tools Used:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Our own Sweat and Blood: Chavezfk, Mewbusi,\u00a0bamboozledshibe .\u00a0</li><li>https://github.com/SorkinType/Atomic-Age</li><li>https://www.blendermarket.com/products/nebula-generator\r\n</li><li>https://github.com/PlayFab</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T09:44:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/278/278ee7f03aeef59add640b45475f1f80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["chavezfk", "mewbusi", "Banished Crown Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
