(Going to upload a DEV-log video on it soon to Youtube(Youtube.com/DimzNoms) I'll update this description when it is uploaded).</p>\n<p>This game was only tested on Keyboard and Xbox controllers (other controller may work it just wasn't tested). <strong>CONTROLLERS PREFERRED FOR 3+ Players.</strong></p>\n<p>The game is free but if you would like to donation a $1 or $2 for my hard work.\u00a0I would be VERY GRATEFUL! ( Donate: https://streamlabs.com/dimz_/tip )</p>\n<p><strong>[THERE MUST ALWAYS BE A Player1!]</strong></p>\n<p>There's a few combos and tricks you can do. So Experiment with holding a\u00a0 few directions and inputting actions (and vise-versa). Example: Hold Up while doing Jab-Combo makes your ender a launcher.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS FOR KEYBOARD:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Player1:</p>\n<p><em>Movement:</em> WASD.\u00a0 \u00a0<em>Attack:</em> Z\u00a0 \u00a0<em>Shoot:</em> X\u00a0 \u00a0<em>Jump:</em> C\u00a0 \u00a0<em>Start:</em> Q\u00a0 \u00a0<em>Super:</em> Z+X\u00a0 \u00a0<em>Block:</em> S</p>\n<p>Player2:</p>\n<p><em>Movement:</em>\u00a0ArrowKeys.\u00a0 \u00a0<em>Attack:</em>\u00a0Nm1\u00a0 \u00a0<em>Shoot:</em>\u00a0Nm2\u00a0 \u00a0<em>Jump:</em>\u00a0Nm0\u00a0 \u00a0<em>Start:</em>\u00a0Nm7\u00a0\u00a0<em>Super:</em>\u00a0Nm1+Nm2\u00a0\u00a0<em>Block:</em>\u00a0ArrowKey-Down</p>\n<p>Player3:</p>\n<p><em>Movement:</em>\u00a0TFGH\u00a0 \u00a0<em>Attack:</em>\u00a0V\u00a0 \u00a0<em>Shoot:</em>\u00a0B\u00a0 \u00a0<em>Jump:</em>\u00a0N\u00a0 \u00a0<em>Start:</em>\u00a0R\u00a0 \u00a0<em>Super:</em>\u00a0V+B\u00a0 \u00a0<em>Block:</em>\u00a0G</p>\n<p>Player4:</p>\n<p><em>Movement:</em>\u00a0IJKL\u00a0 \u00a0<em>Attack:</em>\u00a0O\u00a0 \u00a0<em>Shoot:</em>\u00a0P\u00a0 \u00a0<em>Jump:</em>\u00a00\u00a0 \u00a0<em>Start:</em>\u00a0U\u00a0 \u00a0<em>Super:</em>\u00a0O+P\u00a0 \u00a0<em>Block:</em>\u00a0K</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS FOR CONTROLLER:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>Movement:</em>\u00a0Left-Joystick (Dpad for Menus)\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Attack:</em>\u00a0A/X\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Shoot:</em>\u00a0B/Circle\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Jump:</em>\u00a0X/Square\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Start:</em>\u00a0Start\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Super:</em>\u00a0Y/Triangle\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Block:</em>\u00a0Down on Joystick<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T04:58:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c2/2c29ad104c33cefb3d37b7e00c6ed94b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Dimz"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
