So, keep calm, put on the headset and enjoy.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>As a viewer, you very slowly (almost unnoticeably) levitate across the scene, with the musician playing the\u00a0Handpan\u00a0drum\u00a0in the center and the crowd moving around the musician\u2019s stage.\u00a0The bustling central London crowd is set in contrast with the calm music and voice of the musician.\u00a0The style of modelling is ornamental, and the cool\u00a0colours\u00a0(clean neon) represent night life in Leicester Square, where the artist usually performs. With the help from university technicians and staff, I was able to collect Motion capture data of the Musician playing the\u00a0Handpan. This is an experimental piece where I am trying to learn ways in which ornamental modelling can operate in harmony with the music, keeping the style of the animation coherent.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T05:20:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c14/c14c8195c7517ac166ce6a218c71e855.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["maitry1798"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
