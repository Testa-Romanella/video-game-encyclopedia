In the middle of it all is a girl named Novella, who becomes a magical girl to defend her village from a monster attack. Can Novella stop the monster invasion before it's too late?</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: this is not a complete game, but the first few levels of what (hopefully) will be a much longer game are fully playable.</p>\r\nControls\r\nKeyboardGamepadActionArrowsD-pad / left stickMoveZA / CrossAttack<br/>XB / CircleTalk / interactAX / SquareInventory (pause)SY / TriangleTransform / end transformationSpaceL1 / R1 / LShoulder / RShoulderHold current direction.EscapeStart / SelectExit to title screen.F2Start / SelectVolume/graphics settings menu.\r\nCredits\r\nLachesisPretty much all graphics, programming, etc.DrozerixPublic domain music (all available on The Mod Archive).The Trending FontsMagiera Script font\r\n<p>The sound effects are all default MegaZeux PC speaker sound effects currently.

I've wanted to make a game similar to it for some time and I\u00a0thought magical girl mechanics might be interesting to add to the mix.</p>\n<p>This game was created with MegaZeux, a game creation system originally released in 1994 for DOS. MegaZeux has a built-in editor and was originally text mode based, but has evolved over the years to be able to create more complex games.\u00a0MegaZeux is available for download\u00a0here and this game will soon be as well, in case you want to peek at the code (warning: parts of it are truly atrocious).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T04:51:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20c/20ca48c7afa27358661078e0e0effab6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lachesis"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
