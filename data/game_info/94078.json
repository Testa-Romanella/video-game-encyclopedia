It's up to you to figure out how to beat your opponents! <br/><br/>You control the protagonist using a keyboard (WASD + IKLO) or an Xbox360 Controller (Thumbstick + AXYB), which is preferred, since the controller rumbles when you rumble in-game! <br/><br/>The game ends when you get defeated!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/182/18214ee8bca8c662b17170073207d896.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Bckman", "Konradventure"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
