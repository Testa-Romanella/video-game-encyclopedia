{"id": 720492, "slug": "cat-prison", "name": "Cat Prison", "name_original": "Cat Prison", "description": "<p>It's a quest-like, puzzle and exploration-type adventure game.<br/>You play as a cat living on a farmland\u00a0on a journey to find his master and reveal many secrets on the way. Quirky, mystical, heartfelt.<br/><br/>Expect:<br/>\u25cf Solve quest puzzles as a cat (not an unbeatable hero adventurer)<br/>\u25cf Companions and friends on the way<br/>\u25cf Many dialogues, items and locations to experience<br/>\u25cf Farmland atmosphere (inspired by Stardew Valley like games and graphics)<br/>\u25cf A mystical story you probably won't expect with twists along the way<br/>\u25cf A\u00a0little bit of combat (just for fun, really, it's not an RPG or a combat game)<br/><br/>I was not intending to publish it anywhere when I made it. It was more of a project to get familiar with RPG Maker MV as a tool, but I got hooked on the process and inspired by the idea of a cat protagonist game. Used mostly stock assets and a little bit of free ones form the forums, which I can't properly credit right now since it was made a few years ago. It's a 100% playable, completeable and to an extent \"polished\". But it has at least one bug in logic\u00a0as far as I remember. Takes about an hour to complete. My wife and son played it on their own and the feedback was positive, so enjoy. And will be glad to hear your thoughts on it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T06:42:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df8/df87b7eb042d3adcf48407ffcc6a953b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kprosnikov"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
