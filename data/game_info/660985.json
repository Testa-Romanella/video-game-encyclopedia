I'm a 13 year old game developer from Sweden.</p>\n<p>My take of the theme \"Wave\" was simply a wave-shooter. I'm quite new to all of this and this is the first game I am ever uploading to any kind of platform. <br/></p>\n<p>The game itself is really basic, not bringing much original to the table, however I started kind of in the middle of the jam so I'm happy I managed to make anything at all! I do love the rolling mechanics though...<br/></p>\n<p>As I said, basic. But I hope you like it as much as I do!</p>\n<p>Tilemap - https://analogstudios.itch.io/forest<br/></p>\n\n<p>MelkerB<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T20:40:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/292/292401990bf60ff99bbefa7f4cf3bdae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MelkerB"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
