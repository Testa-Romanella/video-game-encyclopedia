Here\u2019s a closer look at what you can do with Quicken WillMaker Plus:<br/><br/><strong>Your Will</strong><br/>The heart of every estate plan is a will, also known as a last will and testament. This legal document puts you in control of who inherits your property and who would take care of your children if it were ever necessary. Without a will, state law determines these issues. Your will also allows you to name an executor (sometimes called a \u201cpersonal representative\u201d) to carry out our wishes. And you can appoint a trusted person to manage property left to young people. With Quicken WillMaker Plus, you can revise and update your will whenever you like.<br/><br/>New for 2016: You can now use Quicken WillMaker Plus to give your executor authority over your digital assets, including social media accounts, online banking and more.<br/><br/><strong>Your Health Care Directive</strong><br/>Spare your loved ones difficult decisions by laying out your wishes for medical care and naming someone to carry out your instructions:<br/><br/><strong>Health Care Power of Attorney</strong><br/>Name a trusted person (your &amp;quot;health care agent&amp;quot;) to make important medical decisions for you if necessary.<br/><br/><strong>Living Will</strong><br/>State what types of medical treatment you do or do not want if you are too ill or injured to direct your own care. Your health care providers must do all they can to follow your wishes.<br/><br/><strong>Your Durable Power of Attorney for Finances</strong><br/>A durable power of attorney ensures that someone you trust (called your &amp;quot;agent&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;attorney-in-fact&amp;quot;) will be on hand to manage the many practical, financial tasks that will arise if you become incapacitated. For example, bills must be paid, bank deposits must be made and someone must handle insurance and benefits paperwork.
