I originally used Firefox and had a consistently low framerate. But after changing to Google Chrome, the FPS increased dramatically to a steady-ish 60.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Hook, Line &amp; Sinker is an action platformer where the only weapon is a grappling hook.</strong> Players zip across the stage, gaining momentum to smash into enemy units and gain the highest kill count possible.</p>\n<p>That about sums up the game, really. I'm just uploading it here so people would be able to playtest the game. Speaking of playtesting, I really would appreciate it if you sent me your feedback. Any bit of criticism will help. My contacts are @largemem on LINE and 'Adam G.#4096' on Discord. So yeah, that's about it.
