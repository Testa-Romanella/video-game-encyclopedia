I'm Denis, the developer of SiegeUp. I was working on it for the last 4 years, in my free time after work in the beginning, trying now to make this project my main job. My goal is to make a balanced RTS to play on different platforms and bring new players to the genre. I also feel that the concept of walls and sieges has not been fully developed in RTS games. Walls in SiegeUp allow bringing opponents closer to each other while keeping pace and diversifying the landscape. I keep working on updates very actively, according to the plan, 2 more races and tech tree to come by the end of the year. So, wish me good luck!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T12:25:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a5/0a55cb44c52fd38ea6b22acc56828083_TjcVXte.jpg", "website": "https://siegeup.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 378, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Denis Zdorovtsov"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Denis Zdorovtsov"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
