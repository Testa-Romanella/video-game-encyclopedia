Will you make it?</p>\n<p>Kable was solo-developed for the \"Side Quest with Codemasters\" game jam. This was my first attempt at a games jam. I gained experience that will stick with me forever. This small project has taught my a lot about game design and project management. For example, I now value good project scoping and planning much more than I previously did.</p>\n<p>I made this project a prototype because I couldn't implement everything I wanted to. This was my mistake due to bad planning and zero experience trying to develop a game within a week. Nevertheless, I am very proud of myself for accomplishing what I did.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-12T03:03:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93d/93de5175f3094f09f33110310f564706.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jekplex"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
