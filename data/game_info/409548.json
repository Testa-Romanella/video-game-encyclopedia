No label, only a note saying \"#01\".</p>\n<p>After three weeks of intense searching, I've found five other floppies. That's enough for a demo I guess.<br/></p>\n<p>What secrets lies within theses floppies ? Why would someone try to get rid of them ?</p>\n<p>Especially because it seems like a waste, and kind of useless. Does anyone still use floppy ?</p>\n<p>Erm, anyway...</p>\n<p>All theses floppies are encrypted. All but one, containing a program apparently destined to decrypt them, only if you have the right password.<br/></p>\n<p>And it's up to YOU to\u00a0 shed a light on all of this ! Solve the puzzles , found all the password and decrypt all the files in this unique mystery game !<br/></p>\n<p>&lt;==============================================&gt;<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Instructions\u00a0<br/></strong></p>\n<p>* The game take place entirely on the files of the games, and on the executable \"Flop_util.jar\".<br/></p>\n<p>*Each numeroted file represent a floppy (#01, #02, etc..). To unlock the next floppy you need to retrieve the paswword from the previous one. DO NOT RENAME, EDIT OR MOVE THESES FILES.</p>\n<p>*If you think you have a password, type it into Flop_util.js , it will automatically unlock the corresponding floppy.<br/></p>\n<p>*The game has been tested on Windows, might not work on Linux or MacOS.<br/></p>\n<p>*You do not need any particular computer related knowledge, as I made this game accessible for anyone.<br/></p>\n<p>&lt;==============================================&gt;</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing ! Be sure to follow me on Twitter to see what I'm up to next : https://twitter.com/Le_Toulousaing</p>\n<p>This year I challenged myself to release one demo each month. See how far I can go before completely losing it.</p>\n<p>Cover art by Kroki (https://twitter.com/Kroki_skyblog) Go check it out he's great !<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-03T06:26:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/181/1815a4725134ad5dd98448c506d3131b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Toulou"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
