Buy upgrades to speed up the process of word crafting.</p><p>You start with nothing but bare hands and 10$ cash. Buy the cheapest letter gun and start decimating objects with your tool to convert them to letters with the left mouse button.\u00a0 Once you pick up letters with the right mouse button  you can only drop them at the shop over the counter. If the letter is needed it will be accepted\u00a0 and highlighted in green color, otherwise the letter will be dropped and can be used later. Letters that are currently in high demand are displayed floating over the shop as a real word and each letter is highlighted if sold. Once a whole word is complete the player receives payment to upgrade the tools. At the end a phrase will be crafted from all completed words.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3be/3be34e52428ee697e55c42e9b27e0e0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gamescodedogs"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
