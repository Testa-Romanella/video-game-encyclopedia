Our goal was to show players the challenges that a handicapable student might face in their day to day life at RPI. While it\u2019s not an exact simulation, our game fosters empathy by putting the player through these struggles and shows potential consequences for circumstances that are out of their control (GPA, tardiness, etc.)</p>\n<p>This was a group project for our Game Development 1 course at RPI. The assignment was to make a game in Unreal Engine that fostered empathy in\u00a0the player.\u00a0Game developed by\u00a0Jordan\u00a0Faas-Bush, Nicholas Smith, Grant Doney, Zack Schwartz, and Xuan Liu.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-11T04:14:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/639/639e805f2b10667747e5feac6b9c3b76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Smithn10"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
