It's \r\ndesigned as the first in a series, telling a character-driven drama. The\r\n story follows players of a new hit scrolling shooter series. It'll have\r\n unlockable game modes and characters, such as boss rush and score \r\nattack. I'm aiming for six levels playable, with a boss unique to each \r\nlevel. I want to pay homage to many great SHMUPs throughout history, \r\nparticularly ones I personally love. The story will be told through a \r\nvisual novel interface.</p><p>First demo done, enjoy it, folks. I'll upload it shortly. Demo will \r\ninclude no more content, but I'll polish existing content in updates as I\r\n add more content to the full game.</p><p>The free beta contains one stage, one boss, one character. All four \r\ndifficulty modes working. Please report bugs. I'll try to iron them out \r\nin updates to the demo, and work on content for the finished build. By the time the final build is finished, I hope to have all touches, ie music, better screens, added to the demo as well, minus the final exclusive elements, such as five more stages/bosses, and two-four more characters.</p><p>Paying now should guarantee full version access, to my knowledge. You itch.ioers are more knowledgeable than me, however. It would definitely help motivate.<br/></p><p>News:</p><p>-Back again, working again. Sorry about the wait folks. I should be done with an update in a few days.I had an interesting christmas and a funeral. Working on it again, though.</p><p>-Hello, new version up, folks. It's been awhile. I had stuff going on, including hard drive failure. But I made alot of progress in the last few weeks, and finished up 1.4. The game is now available to purchase. I'll add footage of the second stage and Aki for the curious later tonight.</p><p>7/12/15: Patch version up, same method as 1.2.1. Sorry for that, folks. This is the version you want.<br/></p><p>Current Status: Postponed. </p><p>I'm sorry to any who were looking forwards to this, as I was too.
