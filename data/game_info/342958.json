I'm fairly happy with it. It's got very simple gameplay, but I think it's fun. It would be better suited for mobile and I'll may port it. I'll see. I'm happy that now I understand the <em>Godot</em> engine better. I also for the first time made some options for the player. You can adjust the difficulty smoothly, so everyone should find the right spot.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is obviously to dodge the flying... <em>things</em>. You can post your score in the comments (I'm just curious).</p>\n<p>_____________________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Work both WASD and Arrowkeys.
