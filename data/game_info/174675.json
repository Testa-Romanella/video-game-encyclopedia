This is my very first coding project, based on a tutorial in the Udemy series by Ben Tristem: \"Learn to Code by Making Games - the Complete Unity Developer.\" </p>\n<p>I took the Text Adventure lesson, and not only changed it and customized it, but to make sure I REALLY understood the material, I elaborated on the techniques I learned and made my own fully fledged beginning-to-end text adventure. </p>\n<p>The game features a basic inventory system, a suit with a few useful functions, and multiple endings. You can die, too, if you're not careful!</p>\n<p>This game can be completed in a few minutes, mostly depending on how fast you read. ;)</p>\n<p>Enjoy the adventure!</p>\n<p>--Kyle</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/249/249703a80239c5cab4855e99dbc6c81a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Arcangel Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
