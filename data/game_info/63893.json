My aim was to create a challenging game within the time span of one month. You have to complete around 40 levels to beat the game. Every five levels, you will see some new items/objects/obstacles, so you have a progression in complexity and difficulty. I hope you have as much fun playing the game as I had creating it. Thanks!\"", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:56:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb3/bb30b0d707a123b4e254a34185dd1351.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Maximilian Ritters"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Maximilian Ritters"], "esrb_rating": null}
