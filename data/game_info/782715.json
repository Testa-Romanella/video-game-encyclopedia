You can move the mace by moving the mouse around the player in circles, when you hit a certain rhythm it will start spinning.<br/><br/><br/></p><p>Made in just under 3 hours (spread over 2 sessions) for the Trijam!<br/>Originally it was gonna be a puzzle game, you go through a few maze-y levels, figuring out how to go through some doors and some groups of people, but I figured there wasn't enough time for that and changed directions mid jam.</p>\n<p>Didn't have time to make the scores look nice since the font I was using\u00a0was actually a texture. Also I would've liked to add score modifiers (the closer your mace passes near someone the faster your\u00a0score increases).<br/><br/>Visual cues could've been clearer too</p>\n<p>Also, storing high-scores didn't make it into the game, so your score dies when you reload the page :(</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T08:02:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d11/d111b58eace26816c71cd322c412cfc3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["streq"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
