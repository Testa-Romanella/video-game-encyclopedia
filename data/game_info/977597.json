{"id": 977597, "slug": "inkulinati-supporter-bundle", "name": "Inkulinati Supporter Bundle", "name_original": "Inkulinati Supporter Bundle", "description": "<p>Inkulinati is a turn-based strategy game inspired by medieval manuscripts. Draw your army of Beasts, and spill the ink of your enemy, defeat medieval superstars and collect perks to unleash hidden powers. Being a master of the quill isn\u2019t easy, so make sure you\u2019re focused and plan every move wisely. Embark on your journey and become the greatest Inkulinati of all time!</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Don\u2019t let the looks fool you. Inkulinati is a game of nuance and brain-sizzling challenge that will test even the most hardened strategists. And as every hardened armchair general knows, it all starts with your units, which we call Beasts. There are multiple deadly (and bizarre) [b]Beasts[/b] to unlock. They all have their special individual skills, as well as class-specific abilities causing different effects. And when these Beasts work in unison, a symphony of destruction, death, until the literal apocalypse will endure.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s not just your Beasts that can cause havoc and damage. There are special, battle tide-turning actions performed by the [b]Inkulinati Masters[/b] themselves - such as yourself! Use your unique Hand Actions to smash your opponent's units, draw obstacles to create barriers, relocate your units with a move of your finger, or explode your troops to create pure, pure chaos. Just remember - your opponent can do it too. And to keep it more interesting, each Inkulinati Master can have their own set of Talents too that can help win the battle.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>But wait, there\u2019s more. You will need to adapt your tactics to every battle. Each Battlefield is its own domain, with its own particular dangers that you should watch out for, and opportunities that you can use. Look out for objects that are scattered all over the [b]Battlefields[/b], such as exploding Pots of Beans, travelling Hell\u2019s Maws, Clouds of Blessings, and use them to your advantage.</p><p>And just when you think you have a handle on the battle, an [b]Apocalyptic event[/b] can come in and flip all of your plans upside down. We\u2019re talking fires, plagues, and the Memento Mori itself. However, when all hope is lost and you\u2019re on the ropes, an Apocalypse might be just what you need to turn the tide in your favour.<br/>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>There are different difficulty levels to choose from depending on your cunningand know-how, so even younglings will be Inkulinati-Masters in due time. And for those that want to know the ins and outs, you can learn how to master it all in our [b]Academy mode[/b], where we teach you step-by-step all the nuances to win every battle.<br/>\u00a0</p><p>Uncover the mystery and secrets of the Inkulinati and face such opponents as Hildegard, Dante Alighieri, and more. Go out into the world and start your adventure! Fight the biggest Inkulinati masters in the land, tame the untamed Beasts, build your ultimate army, try to bring back your Master from the clutches of death, and most importantly, finish your grand quest with the biggest party that the middle ages have ever seen!</p><p>The best adventures are those of your own. In Journey mode you will create and develop your own character. As any aspiring Inkulinati Master, you will get to create your own Inkulinati character.
