From the islands of Finland to the snowy mountains of Russia, you\u2019ll explore and experience beautiful maps based on real world locations in this puzzle game with a unique theme. With the power of the Unreal Engine behind it, Immersive Poetry is definitely a title you don\u2019t want to miss. Read on if you need some more convincing!<strong>Maps</strong>\tIn Immersive Poetry, each map is based on a real-world location using inspiration from the nature found in those areas. You will get to see the pine trees in Yellowstone National Park, to one of many Finnish islands, complete with seagulls, fish, and vegetation natural to the country. Each map, or \u201cLevel\u201d, has its own mystery to solve alongside the original objectives presented. Along with this, each map is also named after and inspired by a real world poem, from \u201cA Boat Beneath a Sunny Sky\u201d by Lewis Carroll to \u201cThe Road Not Taken\u201d by Robert Frost.<strong>Soundtrack</strong>The soundtrack in Immersive Poetry is a wonderful time of piano music, each track fitted into the level as naturally as possible. Hate it when games have the same 3 minute loop over and over again? Not around here, you won\u2019t!
