But it won\u2019t be that easy, as it seems. There are a lot of ways how to make the jump, and that\u2019s why you have to consider your every jump. One mistake and everything you have achieved is gone. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>To make our form more enjoyable we\u2019ve divided the map into 6 parts. Each part will have its own special qualities and a different subtext. After you complete the given part there will be a guard waiting on you, he is going to give you your last task that will open the door for the next part. But beware, that\u2019s not all. In between two parts there is so-called intermediate level, that works like a connection. This is where it gets really dangerous\u2026 And why? See for yourself. <br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>What\u2019s there to look forward to? </strong><br/><br/><ul><li>6 Big parts (entertainment is taken care of)<br/></li><li>Retro graphics <br/></li><li>Real and funny moments from the life of Agraelus <br/></li><li>Funny texts <br/></li><li>Special qualities for each part </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T03:30:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/339/339684c53c726f6da1cc709a7b4f7458.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["PYMO Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["PYMO Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
