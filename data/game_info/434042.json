You have a <strong>tribe with creatures</strong> and they <strong>can product gold or food</strong> by using certain buildings. And if food is won't be enough for creatures by the end of the day, some of them are die.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Gold </strong>is needed to improve some stats to improve next session(rogue-lite style) - BUT THIS FEATURE <strong>IS NOT FINISHED</strong>. :(</p>\n<p>Another aspect of the game is that <strong>from time to time hostile creatures attacks</strong> your creatures, and for defending you should use gun. In plan - it was a separate building.</p>\n<p>There is no polish and can be some bugs<br/>Also game without sounds :(</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Mouse Tap - on building</strong></p>\n<p><strong>WASD - move crossfire</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Space - Shoot a bullet</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T07:39:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a5/9a58733dc37193eb4ce6695a0ac46acb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SneakyFoxDev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
