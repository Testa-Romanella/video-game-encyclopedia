That's it. There isn't really an end, but there's a point where it becomes impossible to continue playing due to the amount of balloons spawned. Made in Construct 3. Golden balloons don't take away health, and they give 200 cash when popped. They have extra health and get faster over time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-03T02:51:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fa/8fa2ad62d02320f3a7dd7811f58efaf0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheMasterIsHere"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
