The theme was \"climbing a tower\".</p>\n<p>The Games is about a wizard, climbing an infinite tower by finding the ladders on every floor and knocking out the enemies along the way.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>WASD to move (also in menu)\r\nLeft Mouse Button to shoot\r\nE to interact\r\nENTER to select in menu</p>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>The game is best played in a display resolution of 1920x1080, if this is not possible an aspect ratio of 16:9 is recommended. Any other aspect ratio will work, however I can not guarantee that it looks as good as with the recomended settings.</p>\n<p>If you switch type of orb, the level goes down by one, and will not be reset completely.</p>\n<p>The magnet is experimental.</p>\n<p><strong>Enemies</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The Green Slime`</strong></p>\n\n<p>The green slime is the most basic enemy. He will chase you and try to hit you, but watch out, he get's faster through the floors!</p>\n<p><strong>The Red slime</strong></p>\n\n<p>The red slime is just like the green slime, but it spits slimeballs instead of trying to hug you. They are one of your biggest problems</p>\n<p><strong>The Bomb</strong></p>\n\n<p>The bomb will chase you at high speed and jump at you, after which it explodes. At first they jump a little short, but they get better as you progress in the tower!</p>\n<p><strong>The Bush</strong></p>\n\n<p>Stationary. Watch out for the thorns.</p>\n<p><strong>The Magnet</strong></p>\n\n<p>A real nuisance. Will pull you in and damage you if you get to close. More of an annoyance than a threat.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T04:46:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4b/a4ba69035ba75474e4a8fcf774690ba0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["TheSecretGameDeveloper"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
