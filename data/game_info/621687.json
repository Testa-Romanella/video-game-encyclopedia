There's one problem though; you can't directly attack the ghosts. The only way for you to kill the ghosts is to cast a spell at the orb\u00a0to send a magic shockwave across the area. The orb is surrounded by a wall you can easily vault over, but you cannot see the orb from beyond the wall. Crystals will appear outside the wall, these crystals are very valuable to Wizards and Witches, so you must collect as\r\nmany as possible while protecting the magic orb.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>WASD/Arrow Keys - move</p>\n<p>You must be inside the wall to make the orb attack.</p>\n<p>Also, I'm sorry in advance for my terrible art and sound effects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T23:44:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a60/a603a2844152483d057ab2f5e877723a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GE08Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
