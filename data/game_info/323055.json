You have an opportunity to participate in building a new village from the ground up and experience first-hand what it was like to create a new settlement.</p>\n<p>As a newly appointed bailiff, you must decide what buildings to erect and what people to bring in, and you must also settle disputes between the villagers. Each building is unique and comes with its own upgrades, material and labour requirements, so you will face some difficult decisions.</p>\n<p>A bailiff&#39;s lot is not an easy one, but he can still enjoy some fun after a hard day&#39;s work. Get yourself one of the new horses available and take it for a ride, throw a few dice against seasoned players in your new local tavern, match your skills against variously skilled opponents in your combat arena or just rest at home in your own comfortably furnished house.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-19T14:40:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/077/077bea7cd9bf2f05f66f4427e78372e2.jpg", "website": "https://store.steampowered.com/app/883150/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance__From_the_Ashes/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 4, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 268, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Warhorse Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Deep Silver", "Warhorse Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
