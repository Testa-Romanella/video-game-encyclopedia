The idea is, you're given a set of sprites/sounds/music/code example and you have to make a game out of them. There's a lot of stuff, from characters to items, weapons, map stuff and visual effect. I decided to make cheese.</p>\n<p>One more thing: I went for a self-imposed challenge and <strong>avoided using any function that draws on screen</strong>, even though stuff like rect() and line are allowed. Any graphical thingie you see is a stretched palette swapped sprite \u2013 and boy was that fun. I mean hard. Really really fun.</p>\n<p>My submission is also on the Pico 8 website at this link.
