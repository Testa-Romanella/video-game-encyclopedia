Use that time to start harvesting resources and<br/>    building up defenses.<br/><br/>Minerals - You will need to build a smelter (Hotkey T) near <br/>    where you see rocks and crystals.  Use the builder to pick <br/>    up minerals and drop them along sides of the smelter <br/>    building.  The smelter will automatically pick them up and <br/>    process them as it needs. <br/><br/>    Start with the crystals first, as they are the highest <br/>    value resources.  When those run out, you can process the <br/>    rocks, starting from the largest to the smallest.<br/><br/>Solar Power - You will first need to build a power station <br/>    (hotkey A) somewhere on the map.  Once it is finished, you <br/>    can build up to 8 solar panels around the power station.  <br/>    If you need more than 8 panels (which you probably will) <br/>    then build an additional power station.<br/><br/>Gas Refinery - Build the refinery (hotkey G) on top of <br/>    volcanos.  The more volcanoes you tap, the more gas you'll <br/>    have available.<h3>Setup Defenses</h3>    You can move rocks or build walls to fortify the areas <br/>    most vulnerable to attack.  Then build sentry tanks at the<br/>    factory and move then a few spaces behind your wall, as <br/>    they have a very long firing range.  Be sure to set them <br/>    to sentry mode (hotkey S).  If they aren't spinning, then <br/>    they aren't going to defend!<h3>Build A Radar Station</h3>    This game does not employ a fog of war, and you can always<br/>    see anything in the main view area.  However, if you want to<br/>    be able to see both player and enemy mobile units live on <br/>    the mini-map, a radar station must be present. Player units<br/>    show up in white, while Protoid units are yellow.<h3>Balance Of Units</h3>    Obviously not all units are equal.  Some are slow, some are<br/>    fast.  Some are cheap, and some are expensive.  A small<br/>    group of heavy tanks, for example, could decimate your <br/>    opponent's base. However, they are expensive, take a long<br/>    time to build, and they are slow to move.  On the flip side<br/>    of that, ATVs are cheap and fast, but not very powerful.<br/><br/>    In time, you will learn which units are best suited for<br/>    different strategies.<h3>Missile Silo</h3>    Missiles can devestate your opponents base easily.  But be<br/>    warned, they are expensive and slow to build.  You must<br/>    also build a new missile for each launch.<br/><br/>    The coordinate system used is based on how many spaces <br/>    relative to the silo the target is.  So, if you have more <br/>    than one missile silo, the coordinates will not be the same<br/>    for each one.  Also the coordinates are shown in hexa-<br/>    decimal.<h3>The Protoids</h3>    It is good to know your enemy.  The Protoids will typically<br/>    not attack your base until their army has reached a certain<br/>    size.  However, they will always rush to defend the base if<br/>    you attack them.<br/><br/>    They aren't too bright when it comes to navigating the map<br/>    to attack your base.  However, their tanks will blast<br/>    through terrain objects that are in the way, or even build<br/>    bridges over water, thus allowing the rest of the units<br/>    a path to your base.  <br/><br/>    Protoids do rebuild their base if pieces of it are<br/>    destroyed.  So don't wait too long after a partially<br/>    sucessful attack, or you may have to start all over again.<h3>Difficulty Levels</h3>    There are three difficulty levels: easy, normal, and hard.<br/>    There are numerous things that change with each level. Some<br/>    things are small, such as the ratio of tanks vs soldiers<br/>    that are built.  Also the number of sentry pods that the <br/>    Protoids build varies.  It is as little as 4 pods per base<br/>    in easy mode, to 12 pods in hard mode.  <br/><br/>    In easy mode, the protoids will not even build a factory, <br/>    hence no tanks will be made. And with no tanks, the Protoids<br/>    will not cross water or create paths through forest or<br/>    rocks.  <br/><br/>    In hard mode, the Protoids will build two bases at the<br/>    start of the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-01T05:54:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbe/bbe2d93913701e41a46d534f65913368.jpg", "website": "https://www.the8bitguy.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["8-Bit Productions"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["NMSE & Co"], "esrb_rating": null}
