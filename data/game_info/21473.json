Once called New Hamburgerstand in the early A.D. years, it flourished with fur trades and Bacon Cheeseburgers. It was also home to the gravesite of a crusty, sorcerous, evil-naughty-person; the Viking warlord \u201cHelfdane the Terrible!\u201d Helfdane\u2019s tyranny of the New Land was halted during these very rough times due to bad planning, and terrible hygiene. <br/><br/>Today, Bacon Cheeseburgers are still at an all-time high, and New North America is on the verge of being historically \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665-slapped. An archaeologist cork-sniffer named Dr. Howard Bre, and his lovely assistant, Kayte Sparo have disturbed this ancient gravesite. Thus, fulfilling a curse which reanimated Helfdane and his minions to rip the life force from beings starting with Nordic Cove! Holy crap! <br/><br/>Kayte\u2019s boyfriend, Paulie Chops, must find the help he needs to turn this around, stat! This is their date night after all. Don\u2019t act like you\u2019ve not had a night like this. Alright! YOU deal with that Helfdane thing. We\u2019re getting Bacon Cheeseburgers and staying warm.
