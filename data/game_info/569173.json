The twist is you can't fight back! The only way to progress is by waiting out each individual enemy timer and watching them self-destruct!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Along the way, you will find new abilities that will help you avoid the bad guys, but will sometimes anger them and\u00a0make them transform into their rage state, which will make them more powerful and immune to some player abilities.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The enemies will get stronger and gain new abilities as well as evolve on a tiered basis, which will change their aura.</p>\n<p>There is a lot of randomization as well, so each enemy can be more unique.</p>\n<p>The most intimidating part of all is that if you fail, you have to start all the way back to stage 0.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tip: To continue to the next stage, stand on the button around the middle\u00a0for about a second.<br/></p>\n<p>Good luck!<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game and leave feedback! I may update the game in the future as well.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T04:42:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bad/bad077ff063e8cdbe1ff34e5d8d1bdb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["okNobleDev"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
