You find yourself locked inside an inescapable building made entirely of ceramic tiles, with no memory of how you got there. The only way out is to disarm all the bombs hidden throughout the building.\r\n</p>\n<p>But there's a catch. A monster named Rupert is also trapped in the building with you, and he's determined to find and kill you. Rupert is not your friend. He's a terrifying presence that roams the halls, listening for any sound that might give away your location.\r\n</p>\n<p>As you explore the building and disarm bombs, you'll need to be constantly on the lookout for Rupert. You'll need to use your wits to evade him, hiding in rooms or ducking behind objects to stay out of his line of sight. If he catches you, it's game over.\r\n</p>\n<p>The building is a labyrinthine maze of corridors, rooms, and staircases, each one more eerie and foreboding than the last. And as you progress through the game, Rupert becomes more and more aggressive, making it harder and harder to evade him.\r\n</p>\n<p>Can you disarm all the bombs and make your escape before Rupert catches you? Will you be able to survive the horrors that lie within the building's walls? The only way to find out is to play \"Rupert's Not Your Friend.\" But be warned, this is not a game for the faint of heart.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T14:00:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a9/2a903733904bfb0c29cc74d42775d442.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ricode"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
