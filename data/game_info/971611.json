In this dueling game, players become true Mages and fight each other with the power of the elements. The game is focused on crafting spells and is packed with fireballs, crashing waves, devastating tornadoes and powerful magical abilities, all held in the palm of your hand.<br/><br/><strong>WHY PLAY MAGE NOIR?</strong><br/>There are a lot of reasons to play Mage Noir, but among the most interesting ones are two unique mechanics that separate it from other card games out there.*<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>THE SHARED MANA POOL</strong><br/>Mana is aggregated at the center of the table, every action you take will change this amount, and you\u2019ll get to claim some of it at the beginning of your turn. But the rest may end up with your opponent, so plan accordingly. The separation of Mana from your deck also means no more failing to draw what you need to cast your spells!<br/></li><li><strong>THE SPELL CRAFTING SYSTEM</strong><br/>In Mage Noir, you\u2019ll combine lesser spells to create stronger ones. The spell crafting system is simple, logical and very thematic. Will you cast your spells for immediate effects or risk saving them to combine into a game-winning combo?<br/><br/></li></ul><br/><strong>WILL YOU BE THE NEXT MAGE NOIR?</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T21:10:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f7/5f736baa8e7d50f50f49104616353e34.jpg", "website": "https://magenoir.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 273, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Double Combo Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Double Combo Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
