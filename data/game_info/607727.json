The brief for this project was to create a complete mobile game with polished UI to an industry standard.\r\n</p>\n<p>Initially, I spent 11 weeks out on another game (which I will never release!) where you play as an elephant who shoots snakes out of it's trunk. But that game ended up being too buggy and messy to continue.</p>\n<p>So, with only a week left before the deadline, I decided to create an entirely new game from scratch....</p>\n<p>And that's how Panya was born!</p>\n<p>I have since added a bit of polish here and there and ported the game to multiple platforms.</p>\n<p>Inspired by my girlfriend Madzia &lt;3</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>A generally relaxing atmosphere</li><li>Never-ending climbing<br/>\n</li><li>Wild obstacle dodging action<br/>\n</li><li>Several cute pandas</li></ul>\r\nFuture Plans\r\n<p>in the future, I might add some more emphasised replayability and upload it to hte android app store but I am content for now :)</p>\r\nFinal words\r\n<p>If you come across any bugs or generally weird things please let me know so that I can address those issues.<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you for playing &amp;\u00a0I hope you find it as relaxing as I do!</p>\n\n<p> </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-24T05:29:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/090/090a2a201ffa5b8a341d7a44117b999d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Ben Silk"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
