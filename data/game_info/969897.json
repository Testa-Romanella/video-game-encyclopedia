Take part in solving challenging tasks and become the master of leader board.<br/><br/>This is a special version of Rover Mechanic Simulator created in cooperation with European Rover Challenge - Space &amp; Robotics Event 2020. During this year's edition (11-13 September 2020) registered participants will take part in the competition. <br/><br/>A random tournament ladder will be created among the registered players. The matches will be played in the single elimination system. Two participants taking part in the game will start it in pairs at the time specified by the organiser. More information about rules and prizes will be available on ERC Facebook page.<br/><br/>The tasks will be randomly selected for the participants depending on the game starting time. Each player has to complete 4 tasks as quickly as possible (repair the Martian rover to the condition required in a given task) with the lowest resource consumption possible.
