You can remove notes. You can add notes only if you previously removed them. In this mode the game does everything for you and lets you do the thinking. You can switch back to manual mode - the auto-populated notes will remain.<br/>\u2022 Manual Mode - you are responsible for adding/removing notes. No restrictions.<br/>\u2022 Manual Mode with \"smart notes\" - you are responsible for adding/removing notes, but the game will auto cleanup the corresponding notes when you enter a new number. If you change your mind and remove the number the game will put them back. In manual mode you can use the \"Clear Notes\" button to clear all notes.<br/>\u2022 Clear notes - in manual mode clears all notes<br/>\u2022 Hint - press the \"Hint\" button and one unknown number will be revealed<br/><br/>ALERT LEVELS:<br/>\u2022 OFF - No alerts<br/>\u2022 Conflicts Alert - When the entered number conflicts with another number on the same row, column or box it will be colored in red and you will hear an alert sound. Hidden conflicts warning.<br/>\u2022 Wrong Number alert - When the entered number doesn't match the real number it will be colored in red and you will hear an alert sound.<br/><br/>DOUBLE-TAP SHORTCUTS - very convenient for this type of big puzzle:<br/>1. If you want to quickly remove a number you entered - just double-tap it<br/>2. When there is only one note in a certain square - double tap it and the note will become the number<br/>3. If a row, column or sub-square is populated with unique numbers and there is only one number left - double-tap the square - the remaining number will appear<br/>Double-tap shortcuts reduce the solving time by 10 - 20%.<br/><br/>NUMBER-FINDER FEATURE:<br/>When nothing is selected tap a number in the notes pad or in the number pad. All squares containing this note or this number will be highlighted;<br/>This feature will allow you to solve the puzzle much faster: 40% in AutoFill mode and 10% in Manual mode.<br/>For some players it is half of the fun to find the correct notes by themselves and solve it without any extra help. Don't use the feature if you are one of those players.<br/><br/><br/>**** NOTE ****<br/>If it looks like you have solved the puzzle, but nothing happens or the numbers don't make sense - please don't write a bad review, but set the alert level to \"Wrong Number\" to see what is wrong.<br/><br/>CONTACT US<br/>Tap the email address on the Help or About screen - we will give you hints and directions of how to resolve any problem.<br/><br/>Enjoy :-)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T04:26:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd1/fd1c351cf25030b9b130585b27c27815.jpg", "website": "http://iphone.sudoku16monster.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 211, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "macOS"], "developers": ["Vladimir Kussakov"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Vladimir Kussakov"], "esrb_rating": null}
