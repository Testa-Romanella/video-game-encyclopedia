It also contains plenty of Shout Outs to other games, including enemies from other Mega Man titles, and many level design homages. Most of this stems from its usage of assembly hacking, allowing for deeper customization than other ROM hacking tools.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-05T20:18:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e1/3e15e4a8bb87a5b492cc563bd815b0a3.jpg", "website": "https://sites.google.com/site/rockman4mi/home", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
