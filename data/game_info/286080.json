I take it you've played that before, no?\r\n</p>\n<p> The concept is generally the same; collect things and avoid crashing into the walls. But there a few new mechanics in play such as time limits (of course) and the ability to reduce the trail of your snakey-self on the fly to make things a bit more stressful and more micromanage-y in the moment to moment gameplay.\r\n</p>\n<p>This was made in a week for the BoredPixelsJam 3 with the theme of \"Gameboy\". I'm decently proud of it! I hope you enjoy...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1a/d1a019015210ed522c6f02edbeb0a41e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tonyfinale"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
