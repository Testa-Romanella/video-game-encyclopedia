Each player can walk and jump fully experiencing the space. Also, it is made with a mixture of 2D and 3D styles to feel more like a fantasy world. This is a multiplayer game and it is completed by adding colors when players touch an 2D object.</p>\n<p><strong>Artist Statement</strong></p>\n<p>I always have a vague fantasy about the space of dreams. Dreams seem to always allow me to do things that cannot be done in reality. I always thought it would be great if I could remember my dreams, or if I could control everything in my dream. For me, a dream is a colorful and fun space with mixed colors, but on the other hand, it is like a blank space that I can\u2019t control with my will. So the space of The Dream Carnival is a game where you can experience a surreal space and at the same time make your own dream with the color that the character has ( like my color).</p>\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong></p>\n<p>Move around with your character and hit any uncolored object to fill colors. When you start the game, your character is assigned a random color.</p>\n<p>W \u2013 Up\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>A \u2013\u00a0 Left</p>\n<p>S \u2013 Down</p>\n<p>D \u2013 Right</p>\n<p>M \u2013 Sounds (music) | on &amp; off</p>\n<p>Space \u2013 Jump</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-15T02:26:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/897/8978b93fae2e2dbf63d3c7528127e6fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 267, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ellie Park"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
