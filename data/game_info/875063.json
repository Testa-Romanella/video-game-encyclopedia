You must be on the same side of the street to throw the package.</p>\n<p>Each package you deliver gives you a point, every few seconds the speed of the truck increases, up to a maximum of 5 times and you lose when you hit an obstacle.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T09:55:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91a/91ae5a852833e7ecbdfefe43f380ed32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gonzalo Daroch"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
