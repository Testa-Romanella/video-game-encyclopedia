One urban youth\u00a0with cabbage hair and big dreams\u00a0has just decided to check out a subway stop far from his home,\u00a0 in\u00a0 order to kill time until dinner.</p>\n<p>This is his story.</p>\n<p>I've wanted to make a game for a hot minute, but never got around to it. While short and not particularly complex (It was made in RPGMaker after all), I'm quite pleased with the finished project. I did use 100% my own original artwork and music, so\u00a0I think that it ain't too bad for a first game.</p>\n<p>If you've ever played an RPGMaker game, you know the controls. If not:</p>\n<p>Z, Enter, Space Bar = Confirm</p>\n<p>X, Escape = Cancel / Menu</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys = Selection / Movement</p>\n<p>Other than that, it's pretty self explanatory. Check out my cool game, and tell your friends about it.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39c/39cdde627188c4e99f42903c6ad874b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HomieBoon"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
