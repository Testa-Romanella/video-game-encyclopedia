The game is inspired by the short story, \"Sins: Various\" by Exurb1a.</p>\n<p>You are tasked to destroy the evil Iio and stop him from destroying The World. That's about all there is to say. That is exactly what you'll be doing in this game and there is nothing else to say.</p>\n\n<p>This game is not complete. Or should I say, this version. This is the prologue to a series I am starting called Everynight. I'm not totally sure how many entries will be in the series, but I\u00a0already have plans for two entries in the main series\u00a0and also a prequel (Getting a little ahead of myself, haha.) As you can probably see in the title of this game, there is a \"First Draft\" at the end. What this means is that this game is only the \"first draft\" of Everynight: Prologue. This game is more of a framework for what the final game will be. The final game (Everynight: Prologue) will have assets (art and music) that are not open source. AKA, I will either be making all the assets or hiring someone to do so. I also have plans for a completely different battle system, but to do that I will most likely have to switch engines, which isn't a huge issue since I'll be remaking the game from the ground up anyway.</p>\n<p>My current road map for the series looks something like this (It's not complete, so don't worry if it looks like I'm doing stuff in a stupid order. I'll probably figure it out eventually, haha.):</p>\n<p>Everynight: The Day Before: First Draft</p>\n<p>Everynight: Prologue</p>\n<p>Everynight: The Day Before</p>\n<p>Everynight: Main Series? (Not so sure about the name for this yet or the exact number of entries, since it will most likely be split into multiple parts.)</p>\n<p>Everynight: Epilogue\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this game as much as I enjoyed making and I also hope you stick around for further entries and developments!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-01T04:49:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/409/409f5610900c7bd988ee9d1aee090b1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jake The From StateDog"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
