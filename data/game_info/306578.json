This week's theme was \"Radioactivity\".\u00a0</p>\n<p>Initially I planned on making a game that involved using controls in a nuclear power plant control room. I looked around at\u00a0various control room imagery and started playing\u00a0around with objects in a 3D scene in Unity. I quickly realized that I'd aimed a little too hight for my first game so I took a step back and started playing around with pixel art in PICO-8\u00a0</p>\n<p>I ended up making a fun little sprite of someone in a hazmat suit and continued to expand on the world for that person without much of an idea of what the actual gameplay might be. Over the next day I created a few more sprites\u00a0and started to lean towards the idea of someone cleaning up nuclear waste.</p>\n<p>This \"game\" as mostly pieced together in the evenings about an hour before I went to sleep each night, and instead of a cohesive game, it really just became a tool for prototyping various features. Over the week I worked on sprite animation, music composition, character movement, and level design. While I wasn't able to complete this project in time, I'm excited to apply everything I\u00a0practiced this week to next week's theme.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-05T05:22:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d9/4d9cbd199970a717d80694414569c0ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kevin Thompson"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
