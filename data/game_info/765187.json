I had one semester to work on this project and I\u00a0learned a ton along the way.\u00a0<br/><br/>While this project will not be made into anything further, I have learned a lot from the production and cannot wait to take what I've learned into my next project. If you enjoy the project and want to support me as a poor starving indie game developer, it would be greatly appreciated but never expected.<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy my short horror game!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T07:16:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/598/59852d906f76c95168aa224b8d62cee5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brandon Winkler"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
