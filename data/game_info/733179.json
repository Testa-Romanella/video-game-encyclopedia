Pressing long will cause a slower reload but you will conserve ammo)\r\n</p>\n<p>**Left click** to shoot\r\n</p>\n<p>**E** to interact (open a chest, operate a lever/button, pick up an object)\r\n</p>\n<p>**T** to use a healing kit\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0Game objectives</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Each player will arrive at a different corner of the map. They will have to explore around them to find equipment and *biodomes*. Biodomes* are half-spherical buildings with glass roofs and levers to activate.\r\n</p>\n<p>Once a lever is activated, one of the entrances to the main base will unlock (the force field will change from red to blue).\r\n</p>\n<p>Once in the base, the player will have to find his way to a control center. There, pressing the red button will start the ship's takeoff sequence: everyone will have 4 minutes to get to the platform under the ship to escape while a swarm of enemies will be attracted by the ship's noise.\r\n</p>\n<p>To get to the ship, you have to take the door on the other side of the button and then go down into the boarding bay. Two levers are to be activated at the feet of the communication towers to lower the platform.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Acknowledgements</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We would like to thank ENSIIE and T\u00e9l\u00e9com SudParis for giving us the opportunity to realize this project.\r\n</p>\n<p>A huge thank you also to K\u00e9vin GOILARD for all his precious advices during the whole development of the project.\r\n</p>\n<p>Finally, we also thank all the testers.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Authors</strong></p>\n<p>This project was realized by :\u00a0</p>\n<p>LOUZIER Timoth\u00e9</p>\n<p>VALLERIE Erwan\u00a0</p>\n<p>MEZIOU Khalil Mehdi</p>\n<p>DEBRUYNE Lena\u00a0</p>\n<p>DE LA VILLE MONTBAZON Pierre</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Graphic Assets : DE Environment, CreepyCat, Protofactor</li><li>Tools : TheKiwiCoder, UFPS, SensorToolkit</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T05:27:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/701/701866e5c649aad42ae59cdce73b6f52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 199, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["khalil_m", "LenaDebruyne", "Timoth\u00e9 Louzier", "Pete VM", "Renox91"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
