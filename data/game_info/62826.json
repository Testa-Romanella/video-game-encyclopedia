While passing by the planet their scanners picked up weird signals coming from the planet surface, and now you have landed at the origin of the signal coordinates.<br/><br/><strong>Pre-Alpha Demo features:</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>One big area for you to explore, more than hour of gameplay<br/></li><li>Plenty of secret upgrades<br/></li><li>Fight your enemies with a gun and a sword<br/></li><li>Two boss fights</li></ul><br/>Melee attacks are powerful and heal you on kills, but need some amount of power to use. Hitting enemies with your gun regenerates power, but is less powerful. The key to success is to weaken your enemies with gunfire while closing in for a powerful melee finish.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-29T19:29:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd0/fd020bcb809ae5766565ce2cc69c0d5f.jpg", "website": "http://mindseizegame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 99, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 238, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kamina Dimension"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Kamina Dimension"], "esrb_rating": null}
