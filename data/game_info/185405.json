You have a futuristic motorcycle, and you are driving the highway when you see Pirate Robots approaching. Lucky that this thing has weapons, huh?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Made during the first Game Makers Tool Kit Game Jam (#GMTKJam), with the theme of Dual-Purpose Design.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Click Space to Jump. Hold Space to Boost (drive faster. uses fuel). Jump quickly after Boosting: Boost Jump(higher, uses fuel).</p>\n<p>Click Left Ctrl/MB to shoot an Homing Missile. Hold Left Ctrl/MB to charge an Energy Weapon, shooting multiple Bullets depending on how long you held it (max 5 seconds). If you hold Left Ctrl/MB while in air and you have fuel, time slows down while you charge your weapon. (Uses fuel)</p>\n<p>Hitting enemies or obstacles drops Pickups. Fuel Pickup also gives a small speed boost, Health Pickup slows you down a bit and Missile Pickup causes you to shoot a few Bullets with your Energy Weapon.</p>\n<p>I made this game alone (bad idea, as you may see from art quality and lack of sound). I started by using the Unity 2D Standard Assets, but worked on them long enough that they are almost unrecognizable.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/984/9840764ea03a879757d08678c2483339.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Laurender"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
