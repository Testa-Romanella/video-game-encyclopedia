Instead of 21, the target is 8. And there's only two \"cards\", one or two. The deck has an even number of both types of coins/cards. Hit allows you to flip another coin to add 1 or 2 to your total. Stay keeps you at your current total, while the computer tries to get a better score. 2X will double down your bet, and you can get 1.5 times the usual reward, rounded up.\u00a0</p><p>If you find yourself stuck in Blackjack, make sure to finish the round first (both players at 0). This will allow you to exit.</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game is a mashup of Frogger\u00a0(the log platforms) and Blackjack (using collected coins to bet and win more). It also has the set collection mechanic from Pac-Man.\u00a0 The game's style is derived heavily from the old GameBoy handhelds, from the sound to the graphics. Made in 5 days during the 8-Bits to Infinity Mashup Jam.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Take a good look at the demo level...you may find some mushy secrets (2 mushrooms to find).</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>DragonCola:\u00a0</strong>Musician and Playtester.
