The usual battle scenes are not used, you have to shoot the zombies with guns. This game is made for you if you like rpg maker games made different than they should. There is no real story, it's just a little fun game.<br/><br/>There is a zombie apocalypse and you have to go on a journey to stop it. By shooting zombies you'll earn money that you can use to buy weapons such as machine guns. The zombies get stronger and stronger the further you get on the journey.", "metacritic": null, "released": "1993-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-08T02:25:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dae/daed9e310a1d6a8a48eaffdffe1bcb5e.jpg", "website": "http://bullsbros.wixsite.com/bullsbros/project-x", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 35, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team17 Digital", "East Point Software", "Bulls Bros", "Marco Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Arcade", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Team17 Digital", "Bulls Bros", "Hoi 4 Deu"], "esrb_rating": null}
