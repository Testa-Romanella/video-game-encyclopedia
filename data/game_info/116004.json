{"id": 116004, "slug": "big-bots-crossword-adventure", "name": "Big Bot's Crossword Adventure", "name_original": "Big Bot's Crossword Adventure", "description": "<p>Journey through a surreal crossword puzzle factory that is haunted by hungry ASCII characters and plagued with insidious traps in this physics-based, \"text-based\", 3D action word game where you must assemble all the crosswords to restore the factory to working condition. <br/></p>\n<p>(I slacked off during the jam and only made one level of the game so far.)<br/></p>\n<p>Made in 24 hours for #RemakeJam, a game jam where you remake your first game with the skills/tools that you have now. More info: RemakeJam</p>\n<p>This game is a mashup of the first games I made (with ASCII-based graphics in the 1980's) and the first commercial game I made. Not that it makes for good game design, but pays homage to pieces from my different early games:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>My earliest games (2nd grade?) were just simple question/answer text-based games, sometimes with multiple choice. I still have the same problem of figuring out what to call a game. My first ever game was called \"QWERTY\", and it's sequel was \"ASDF\". The third game was \"DEST\".</li><li>I soon learned how to use ASCII characters, and move them around the screen. I used the stranger extended ASCII characters as different monsters. For example, a \u00c7 looks like a creature with a big mouth, while \"\u00a5\" looks like a dragon to me. Thus was born the Monster Warriors trilogy of games, turn based games where you buy a team of monsters and fight against the other player's team of monsters, using D&amp;D stats and rules.\u00a0The first version was ASCII based. Later versions were vector based, and then pixel based. Unfortunately, the 5.25\" and 3.5\" floppy disks are long lost.</li><li>I originally wanted to remake \"RoomRomp\" for this jam. It was an ASCII-based graphical roguelike game where you collect loot, fight monsters, and descend to deeper levels. It was one of my first games using QBasic, which was a huge improvement over GWBasic. </li><li>The robot character is a remake of BlockBot from my first commercial game, Bigbot Smash, available on IOS, from 2011. Back then I didn't know 3D modeling, so I created all the meshes in-game programmatically via Cocos3D and OpenGL.
