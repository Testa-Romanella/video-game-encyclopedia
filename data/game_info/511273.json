To neutralise them, you must throw tags at them! Watch out for the waves of food coming to get you, and beware of the little time you have to fight them!<br/><br/><br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 Food Fight! is a jam game created in 7 days for the 5th PB Game Jam around the theme of \"Tag\". It was really hard, but it taught us many things. For some of us, it even was our first 3D game! If you encounter a bug or a problem, tell us in the comments! We really hope you will like our game.<br/><br/>Note from LootGodamn : we couldn't implement all the 3d models and effects we intended to because of the time frame. Anyhow, it was a fun experience!</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Game design: Geek_Joystick, Lord Yamoshi, LootGodamn</li><li>Programming: Lord Yamoshi, Geek_Joystick</li><li>3D Modelling: LootGodamn, Geek_Joystick</li><li>Composing: Nameless (yes, that's his pseudo)</li><li>UI Design: Geek_Joystick, Lord Yamoshi</li><li>SFX Design: Nameless</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T07:07:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfd/dfda16e01e9f9f0e0bcc4c139dd80753.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Geek_Joystick", "LootGodamn", "RMayMusic", "Phenonamal"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
