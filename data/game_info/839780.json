When the Caponians tried to reduce the IQ of every human being to single digits? If you answer i yes,\u00a0you are probably pretty old.</p>\n<p>In the year 2022, exactly 25 years after the Caponians tried to take over the world, mankind has an other alien-problem. They. Are. Back. This time the stupidity machine does not destroy brain cells with a 60Hz signal - making phone calls is outdated.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The new way to make humanity the dumbest species alive is even worse:\u00a0Social media. With their evil social media apps they control what people believe. Their algorythm\u00a0\u00a0approves every piece of nonsense and reduces the attention span of users to a minimum.</p>\n<p>If you read this description until here - congratulations! Seems like your attention span is okay.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Help Zak, Annie, Melissa and Leslie once again. Save the Cheerleader, save the world! Okay, there is no cheerleader. And to be honest, there is no Leslie either because I ran out of tile-slots. But hey, play it anyway to honor one of my favorite Lucasfilm games!</p>\n<p><strong>This game features\r\n</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Aliens with funny hats</li><li>4-way-scrolling..... in some levels</li><li>Some references to the great original game by David Fox</li><li>Pyramids!
