I commissioned artists to create a fantasy world, and hide as many bees as they can inside it. Now it\u2019s your job to find them all! With 10 art pieces to choose from, and 1000+ bees, you will have a lot of searching to do.Controls:Use your mouse to move around the image and zoom in / out. When you find a bee, click it and it will disappear. You can also use WASD to move and the arrow keys to zoom.Difficulty:A full range of difficulty is included, but all levels start unlocked, your progress is saved as you play, and you can use hints if you get stuck.Get immersed:Each painting has its own music and ambiance to help you connect with the world, as you search for all the bees.ReplayableYou can restore a small number of bees back into a painting so you can find them again! It\u2019s much harder when there are only a few bees left (especially randomly). You can also use up to 3 save slots so you can replay without progress loss. Alternatively, you can reset your progress for the entire game if you\u2019d like to start over.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-23T11:21:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/137/137ce943536a1bfa19f45bd89137973b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.88, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 1, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 11, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Follow The Fun"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Follow The Fun"], "esrb_rating": null}
