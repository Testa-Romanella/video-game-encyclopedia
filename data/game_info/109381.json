As the alien ship approaches it passes Earth's last line of defence, a laser facility on the Moon. The laser is about to fire and destroy the aliens when it is sabotaged and malfunctions. The player/engineer has to solve a series of increasingly more difficult puzzles through the practical application of circuit theory under severe time constraints to fix the generator to fire the laser and save the planet from destruction.<br/></p><p>Only good engineers need apply\u2026\u2026 your knowledge and expertise is everything!</p><p>This VR simulator complements the PC version of the game and is intended as a training device. </p><p><strong>Setup Instructions</strong><br/></p><p>Download, unzip and execute. </p><p>Minimum Requirements</p><p>You need an Oculus Rift to play (developed for the DK2).
