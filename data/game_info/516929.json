Then this game got you covered, wait what do you mean there are 500 new 2D platformers coming out everyday?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh well, this is just a normal 2D platformer that I've used as a learning experience with GameMaker 2 and game development in general. its short, challenging but fair and has some fun mechanics! It features 10 levels including a difficult version of each stage in a gamemode called The Hell Gauntlet! If you include the hub world and tutorial, that is 22 levels in total!</p>\n<p>The game also features some sick tunes by Joakim \"Klagarn\" Jansson!
