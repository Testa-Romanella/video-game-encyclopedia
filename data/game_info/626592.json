To play, you need the Cast Away rules, as some of those rules may not be fully explained in this supplement. This is designed for play with 1 to 4 players. A Navigator is optional, but having someone who has read both books before play is probably helpful.\r\nThis game is designed to simulate sci-fi survival on an uncharted planet that is mostly covered in water. It takes inspiration from the <em>Subnautica </em>series,<em> No Man\u2019s Sky</em>, <em>Oxygen Not Included</em>, and there\u2019s a little of<em> Delve </em>and <em>Umbra </em>mixed in there.</p>\n<p>----<br/></p>\n<p>Contains:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Water\u00a0Landing RPG</li><li>Water Landing RPG - Plain Text edition</li><li>Crafting Cards printout</li><li>Ship Salvage Table printout</li><li>Resource\u00a0Tracker printout</li></ul>\n<p>Requires:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>This book</li><li>The Cast Away RPG and Character Sheets</li><li>Polyhedral hobby dice</li><li>A deck of cards with Jokers</li><li>Pen, pencils, and a handful of tokens.</li><li>Included printouts\u00a0(optional, but helpful)</li></ul>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Water Landing\u00a0<em>is an independent production by Grahame Turner</em><em>\u00a0and is not affiliated with Afterthought Committee or Peach Garden Games</em><em>.</em>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T07:55:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84e/84ef9bf217b791bd5d7f6e283c9fc91a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["theinstagrahame"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
