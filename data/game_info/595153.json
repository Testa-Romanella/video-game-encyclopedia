{"id": 595153, "slug": "an-oreible-game", "name": "An Ore'ible Game", "name_original": "An Ore'ible Game", "description": "<p>An Ore'ible Game (or as we refer to it internally, &amp;%!*\u00a3&amp; Unity Physics!) went through a few different concepts before ending up as it did.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>In the end we decided to make it into a level based system where you can unlock the next level using the money you have collected from the deposited ore. As We had made a Truck (that at least would work on a flat surface) which could be used to transfer multiple ore at once and can raise it's container to tip the ore out on the players command. We decided to have some levels that were based on using the truck.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>We ended up with four levels, two based on running around as the player, two based on using the truck.</p>\n<p>The original concept of the game was to be physics based game along the lines of Totally Reliable Delivery Service in a mine where you would have to collect ore, using various vehicles to get ores in different ways (like launching of ramps to hit stalagmites to break ore off) and then use the money from depositing the ore to unlock more vehicles.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately we hit a snag with this idea, and that snag was the Unity Physics Engine.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The big issue we had with it was with the wheel colliders, unfortunately it seems that for us (and for everyone else based on what all the comments about them on the internet) that it is impossible for the vehicles made with the wheel collider to go up any slopes. The wheels just don't get any grip.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As such we had to take what we had managed to make at that point (which was about half way through the jam) and adapt it into something that kind of could be called a \"game\".\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Known Bugs/Issues</strong></p>\n<p>* If the player tries to exit the Truck when it has fallen on over with it's right side against the terrain they will fall out of the map\u00a0</p>\n<p>* (Web Only) Bad input issues especially with a controller. Looking into this never had it before. Even my old game jam games that recompiled are doing it in their web versions. Firefox doesn\u2019t seem to even acknowledge the controller Only my desktop seems to have this problem.<br/></p>\n<p>* Not an issue per say, but there is no game over state. Once you get to level 4 there is nothing else after doing it. You can just keep collecting money\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Changelog</strong></p>\n<p>* V0.0.1 - Initial Release</p>\n\n<p><strong>Instructions\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Drop ore in the Ore Deposit to earn money to unlock deeper levels in the mine at the Lift Access Terminal.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can use the Truck to move multiple ores at once by throwing the ores in the back of the truck and the truck can then raise it's container and tip the ore out on command.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls\u00a0\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Player</strong></p>\n<p>Movement = WASD / Left Analog Stick\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jump = SPACE / A Button\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Interact / Pickup = E / X Button\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Throw = F / B Button\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Truck</strong></p>\n<p>Movement = WASD / Left Analog Stick\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>Jump = SPACE / A Button\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Interact / Pickup = E / X Button\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Throw = F / B Button\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Extra</strong></p>\n<p>Reset Level = Shift + R <em>(Cheat for if everything breaks)</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Made by</strong></p>\n<p>Richard Hancock - Code - https://www.richardhancock.co.uk/\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jamie Slowgrove - Code / Truck / Levels - https://jamieslowgrove.co.uk/\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><strong>Tools</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Unity 2020.3.5f1 Personal\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Visual Studio 2019\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gimp\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>GitLab CE\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>Audacity\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Blender\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>3RD Party Credits</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Music\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Magic Scout Cottages by Kevin MacLeod\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4672-magic-scout-cottages\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>SFX</strong></p>\n<p>Lift Transition - https://freesound.org/people/vlnpetiteau/sounds/564406/ (CC0)\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Truck Move - https://freesound.org/people/soundjoao/sounds/325810/ (CC0)\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lift Ding - https://freesound.org/people/qd42/sounds/539574/ (CC0)\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Truck Tip - https://freesound.org/people/chainsaw_dinner_party/sounds/403075/ (CC0)\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jump - https://freesound.org/people/GiocoSound/sounds/421139/ (CC0)\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ore Collect - https://freesound.org/people/colorsCrimsonTears/sounds/566201/ (CC0)\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Other</strong></p>\n<p>Keyboard and Controller Prompts - https://opengameart.org/content/free-keyboard-and-controllers-prompts-pack (CC0)\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T12:38:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1d/f1d9cc1fc9806ccff16ee0a59422a6d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["ygrichman", "PerplexedPegasus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
