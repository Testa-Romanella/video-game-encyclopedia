Sling spells, discover unique weapons, explore procedurally generated environments, and uncover secrets as you try to make it out alive.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wicker is being developed as a senior thesis project at The\u00a0College of\u00a0New Jersey's Interactive Multimedia program.\u00a0<em>The current final product is planned to be more of a demo, or small slice of a full game, as opposed to a complete game. Think of it like a proof of concept.</em></p>\r\nHow far along is Wicker?\r\n<p>Right now,\u00a0<em>Wicker is still a playtest</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wicker still has a few months left in development. As it exists now, the game contains the majority of features planned for the final version, although quite a bit is still missing. The game is still fairly light on content, and the gameplay loop currently in place is there more for testing than anything else. It also has quite a ways to go in terms of polish.\u00a0</p>\r\nWhat's coming next?\r\n<p>Wicker is being developed on a pretty tight timeline, with the definitive end to the project coming in mid May. It's possible I continue to develop it past that point, but May is the current endpoint.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The duration of March will be spent on spicing\u00a0up Wicker's procedural generation and creating a more finalized gameplay loop. Expect more coherent level generation, with more \u00a0unique areas, like small biomes, graveyards, as well as abandoned towns and buildings. The game should also have more structure - less sporadic item generation, more interesting objects, battle arenas with rewards, and a placeholder boss fight.</p>\n<p>April will be focused on content, although this is more up in the air.\u00a0\u00a0We plan to add more enemies, weapons, spells, and relics to the game during this month, as well as expanding upon the procedural generation changes from March. The goal is to make the world of Wicker feel more full, and make individual playthroughs of the demo more unique. I\u00a0would also like to use this month to finalize a boss fight. If things are going well, I\u00a0may also add a new feature or two - potion brewing/crafting or item shops.\u00a0</p>\r\nHelp make Wicker a better game!\r\n<p>The timeline given above is vague. Things are bound to change as the game develops and priorities shift, but more importantly, I\u00a0want your help figuring out what needs changing. Please play through our current release of Wicker, and fill out our playtesting form!
