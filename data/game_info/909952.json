For instance, a 2 can be flipped into a 5 or a 6 into a 9.<br/>Be careful to create a non-number in the process since the number cannot be used until it is set right.<br/>There are also \u201cspecial\u201d green and red digits that cannot be flipped but provide you powerful bonuses.<br/><br/>You can choose from three modes:<br/>Classic - eliminate a set amount of numbers as quickly as possible;<br/>Puzzle - get rid of prearranged groups of numbers in as few moves as possible;<br/>Endless - do the best score before the grid is full.<br/><br/>Sumoku supports iCloud and Game Center (both Leaderboards and Achievements).<br/>There are two themes available: Light and Dark.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T06:56:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e34/e34dd2be49f98a389350d3ec1f56bb69_DLPUlud.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Raffaele D'Amato"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Raffaele D'Amato"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
