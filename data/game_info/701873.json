The puzzle is featuring an interaction event system that lets the player interact with various control panels that changes the structure of the pyramid. To aid the player, a hacking tool is provided that lets the player use the control panel remotely.</p>\n<p>*<strong>Important</strong>*<br/>See images for the control schematics as well as information on how to use the hacking tool. The prototype will be impossible to beat unless you read the hacking tool guide. Ideally, this would've been introduced in the prototype but that was not something that we could do due to timeconstraint.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T08:40:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fdf/fdf7242fb3ea2068c1d19f5a5e8bd8e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Latent_Gecko", "DutchDave", "markstrm", "Mooncharon"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
