Sadly wasn't able to add all of the features I wanted but still was able to learn a ton and had a very good experience.

As long as 1 person plays the game I'm happy,\u00a0 it is what it is if they do or don't like it as long as they play it I'm fine with it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T06:04:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ed/5ed3ea20e9619def4dbca22dde6f8691.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["MoldySugar2205"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
