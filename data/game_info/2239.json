{"id": 2239, "slug": "furi", "name": "Furi", "name_original": "Furi", "description": "<p>Furi is a game that consists of boss fights. It is set in a neon-bright futuristic world with some elements of traditional Japanese aesthetics. The game is accompanied by a synthwave soundtrack recorded by several popular electronic artists including Carpenter Brut.<br />\nThe player assumes the role of the Stranger, a white-haired samurai wearing a red cloak. The Stranger was kept as a prisoner on an orbital station until he was released from his cell by an unknown benefactor wearing a bunny suit. The protagonist, now armed with a plasma gun and a katana, has to fight his way to freedom through a series of levels, each of them containing only one enemy, a boss who guards Stranger&#39;s prison. Each battle is preceded by a cutscene that further reveals the plot, and each boss requires a unique approach.<br />\nThe game is played in an isometric top-down view. The combat system is very simple, it includes no combos and consists of only four basic movements. The Stranger can slash with his sword, fire his gun, block an incoming attack or dash forward to avoid it. Each action can be made more powerful by holding its button for several seconds, although it slows down your movement.</p>", "metacritic": 76, "released": "2016-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T09:29:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/556/556157feed9ee1f55f2b12b2973e30a3.jpg", "website": "http://www.furigame.com/", "rating": 3.92, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 252, "owned": 2738, "beaten": 362, "toplay": 124, "dropped": 301, "playing": 55}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 127, "ratings_count": 690, "suggestions_count": 437, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 700, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["The Game Bakers"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Plug In Digital", "The Game Bakers"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
