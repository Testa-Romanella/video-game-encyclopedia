Due to the potential threat of AI becoming self-aware, the governments of the world had to work together to prevent the possible extinction of the human race, in doing so, they created the XERA Corporation.<br/><br/>A new law was soon taken up by all governments of the world. This law strictly prevents any further research and development of artificial intelligence. There was a loophole, which would allow the XERA Corporation to legally seize all research and prototypes created, and continue the research and development at its own facility.<br/><br/>In 2022, the first artificial intelligent humanoid went online. Soon after, it showed signs of consciousness and emotion. Then one night, it disappeared from the facility. The humanoid found an abandoned factory, which is where it created hundreds of replications of itself.<br/><br/>The military soon took over the XERA facility, and sent out a remote update to the humanoids. Something went wrong, the updates were corrupted. They started to turn against the whole of humanity and the world fell into war. Everything is chaos, it's kill, or be killed.<br/><br/>This is a story of a future, no one saw coming.MULTIPLAYERXERA: Survival has been built from the ground up with multiplayer support.
