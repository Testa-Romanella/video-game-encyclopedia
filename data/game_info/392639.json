The core concept is about raising the character's offense/damage by hitting monsters, once the character gets hit though, the damage gets cut by a lot. This concept is by no means original, it's actually inspired by a Flash game by cello_cken (Japanese) and while the game differs quite a lot from the inspiration, it's still noteworthy nevertheless. I had lots of fun making this game and by trying to lower my ambitions I finally managed to release a finished game. Taking a simple game and making my own implementation of it is generally a very fun thing to do for me.</p>\n<p>A sequel might happen in a rather long time from now, with more content and characters.</p>\n<p><strong>Coding, Art and Music by Naryunic</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Point and Click:</strong> Move around</p>\n<p><strong>Space: </strong>Attack</p>\n<p><strong>Shift+Space: </strong>Turbo Attack (Fencer/Lilli only)</p>\n<p><strong>Shift:</strong> Shield Block (Knight/Slars only)</p>\n<p><strong>M key:</strong> Toggle music on/off</p>\n<p><strong>N key:</strong> Toggle sounds on/off</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T05:43:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee6/ee69ed6a9c06d6b61bdbcabe60db3de7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Naryunic"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
