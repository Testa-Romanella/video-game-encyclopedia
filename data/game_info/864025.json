Your memory fuzzy, your leg hurts from a fall you don't remember but certainly can feel.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>You only remember a couple of words:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>GO</strong></p>\n<p><strong>SEARCH</strong></p>\n<p><strong>END SUFFERING</strong></p>\n<p><strong>You find a stick to help you stand...</strong></p>\n<p><strong>What awaits you at the end of the clearing, you only have to take a couple of steps and see for yourself.\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Discover the weird world ruled by seemingly only animals.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Jump, duck and attack at the right time to avoid meeting your end.\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Explore every nook and cranny, nearly everything is interactable\u00a0in a meaningful\u00a0way. One man's trash is another animals treasure.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Choose wisely, your actions have consequences and most if not all will remember what you've done.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Befriend the huge and diverse cast of Sealed and unlock new gameplay options.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Fight small and huge, the world is full of small insects and huge monsters for you to fight or befriend.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Join me in my endeavour to create Sealed.
