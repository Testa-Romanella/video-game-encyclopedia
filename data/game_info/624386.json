Retexo Mori.\"<br/>\r\n- Daily Prayer of the Unyielding<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRetexo Mori is a Pac-Man-like game in first person, with bullet hell elements and an aesthetic that clashes early 90's FPS pixel-art with vaporwave. It features short, high-intensity rounds inside carefully crafted arenas where you must navigate, avoid, and outwit Shadows that pursue you relentlessly. It is easy to understand, but difficult to master: while the enemies behave predictably, in tandem they can easily box you in if you don't think far enough ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou are the last of the Unyielding, and you must perform your sacred duty of cleansing the earth of your eternal enemy. This is all you know. This is all you need to know. This is all that you are.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T02:27:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/671/6713e64697c4a9b325a052961b192e42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ElzaiGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ElzaiGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
