Trying to move through an enemy mob will attack it. Move onto doors or stairways to go to the next room.<br/></p>\r\nDescription:\r\n<p>The Hero's Elegy is a dungeon-crawling, action-rpg game with rogue-lite elements. It has turn-based combat, but all characters run simultaneously, so you get all the speed and energy of real-time combat with none of the waiting of turn-based games!</p>\n<p> In Rogue-mode, fight your way to the bottom of the procedurally-generated dungeon to find the treasure! Encounter new enemies, items, puzzles, and traps with every fresh play through!<br/></p>\n<p>The Hero's Elegy will eventually release as a free mobile app with DLC expansions to support new features! Mobile/Touch Input is a priority, so interacting through touch will be fluid and intuitive!</p>\n<p>It's still early in development, so expect many updates and new content regularly!<br/>The Hero's Elegy is exclusively a Rogue-mode dungeon-crawler right now. This is more of a Demo of the intended final game, enabling quick iteration of systems and features!</p>\n<p>I look forward to any feedback users may have, so please leave a comment!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T10:13:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d51/d51b85f6e5869cb9f945bea8ce5b84ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jamesdesjardins"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
