It's missing sounds and music, and there were many other gameplay ideas and mechanics to pursue. However, \r\n\tI ran out of time and had to wrap everything up very quickly. I hope that anyone who plays would at least get some enjoyment out of it. Maybe a post-jam version, if there is any interest at all?\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tCredits\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThanks to God that I managed to get this done! \r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tThanks also to Ade for her game design ideas and support!\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tThanks to \r\n\t@PhotonStorm for Phaser, a remarkable game development engine.\r\n\t<br/>\r\nThanks to the organizers: ThreeDee Media (Tulip 3d), PhotonStorm (Phaser 2d), and Scirra (Construct 2) for organizing the jam.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/746/746d4a7015ba827e5df58d2f9ee92409.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["chongdashu"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
