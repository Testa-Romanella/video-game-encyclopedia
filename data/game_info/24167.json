The game transports players to the enigmatic \n      Malgrave Island, where they must hunt for hidden objects and solve \n      puzzles to collect a magically powerful dust scattered across the \n      island. Anyone can delve quickly and easily into the game's rich \n      seek-and-solve action, using the Wii Remote controller to examine \n      multi-layered hidden-object scenes, locate cleverly concealed items and \n      obtain inventory items that will help to overcome brain-teasing \n      obstacles. Multiplayer features allow players to team up and crack the \n      case together or face off in a competitive hunt for hidden objects. \n      (Additional controllers are required for multiplayer features and are \n      sold separately.) No matter who's playing, it'll take sharp eyes and a \n      keen mind to get to the bottom of Mystery Case Files: The Malgrave \n      Incident. \n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:38:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f90/f902debf2e117c517e2299a11f27dab0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 286, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": ["Big Fish Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
