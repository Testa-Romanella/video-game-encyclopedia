I don't use Construct 3 but because for now I don't have the money to buy the license, so I use the Free Version of 2 so I don't have variable limits.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Sorry for my Bad Eng btw!</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T04:55:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92b/92b9177ef3199bb660f9bc25d238ad6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tremotino109"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
