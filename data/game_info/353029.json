Fight endless waves of enemies and compete for the high score! Upgrade your ship and find the best combinations of weapons to obtain the highest score.</p>\n<p>Installation:<br/>Currently supported platforms are Windows/Mac/Linux<br/>First you need to extract the .rar file to a path of your choosing. For windows users, you will need to ensure that the .net 4.5 framework is installed and available.</p><p>This game may run on Mac and Linux but is untested.\u00a0If you want to, you will need to have mono installed and run the game with the mono command. Please let me know the results you get!<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>To move you use the \"WASD\" keys. You aim where you want to shoot. When you have a secondary weapon you can click on the button in the bottom right of the screen\u00a0to activate it. The upgrade and pause menu is accessible by pressing on the square in the top right hand of the screen. Pressing the \"Esc\" will exit the game.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Early\u00a0Access Beta:<br/>Blasteon is currently in early access. Much work is being done to release new content such as a more in depth skill tree with more skills. More enemies are being added, and there will be bosses to come in the future. Thank you for all who play Blasteon in early access and assist with feedback.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While in early access, the game will be free. You may also notice bugs and a lack of certain features. Currently there is not any sound in-game but I can assure you it is working but is not polished enough yet to be an enjoyable experience for the player. If you notice any bugs and wish to bring them to my attention, please send me a PM or comment here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I will be releasing weekly updates until the game is out of early access which will be on August 28th. At that point, the game will be available on Android as well at the Google Play Store.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-27T10:55:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b06/b06780cc2763329766afd20fe8367a94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ALT"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
