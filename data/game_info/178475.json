Your goal is to first collect every battery in the level to power the electric chair. Then once you use the chair, you'll become a ghost. In ghost form, you have to collect all the crystals to open up a portal. Go in the portal to beat the level and go to the next level. This game was originally made for the \"Home of Nerds Game Jam\" with the theme \"Dying is good\".<br/></p><p>Controls:</p><p>Arrow Keys -or- WASD = Move Character</p><p>Space -or- Enter = Select Menu Item</p><p>Backspace -or- R = Reset Current Room</p><p>Esc = Quit Game</p><p>Royalty Free Music By:</p><p>Music track: Funky Guppy</p><p>Composer: Bjorn A.
