The theme is \"out of control\", so I decided to make an RPG where you cannot select the spells your units cast. Instead the units will decide a que of spells they want to cast, and you have to decide between spending your turn guarding (reduce damage but don't cast), cast the next spell on your que, or skip the next spell on your que (which uses up your turn). Enemies have elemental strengths and weaknesses so you'll need to plan accordingly in order to make it out alive.</p>\n\n<p>This is the first game jam that I've entered. The current project is not complete, and only has three playable stages at the moment. I have not been able to implement features such as an attack forecast and fair spell distribution yet, so the game is a bit unfair and still a work in progress. I'm at the end of my time to work on it (getting on a plane) so I figured I'd submit what I have for anyone who is interested. The game should work for the most part though, I hope you enjoy :), it's been a blast to create. Thanks to GMTK for hosting this jame :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T19:16:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afa/afaf8dde7bdfe36c57957ff9d7771292.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Enathri"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
