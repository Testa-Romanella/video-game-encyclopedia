In this game, you would move boxes to there right position, by placing them the line with there respective colors. You have to take two colors and place them side by side in there respective colors bars.</p>\n<p>This is a 2d platformer game I was supposed to submit for Gdevelop game jam, but time is up, so just enjoy playing it. This game was a serious rush, so I didn't have time to think properly, so the game was not completed,but it has two levels. I also noticed I forgot to change the font in the game home page, and also the sounds are not what I wanted to use, my computer has speaker problem. I will update this game in the feature, when I am done editing it. Please don't mind my rush work.</p>\n<p>Please use space, right and left key for controls.</p>\n<p>If you like this game, and want to support it's next serious upgrade, you can do so. It would help this games development. And I promise to make the game more than 1000x better.</p><p>I also plan to create a mobile support version, if I get $1000 support, In which I will also publish the game to steam for free and Google play store. Or if my wishlist is completed.</p><p>My Wishlist<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks \ud83d\ude4f for your support \u2764\ufe0f</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T15:01:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0e/e0e260608a0c38b60fff6e6db68d1f03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Liki Studios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
