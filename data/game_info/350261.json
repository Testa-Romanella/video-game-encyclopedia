Intended to be more relaxing and addictive than challenging, you'll still have to keep moving to keep the fight going, keeping your energy up and looking out for MurderZones to give you unlimited firepower. Kick back, relax, and blow some heads off, or better yet, electrocute 20 enemies at once.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n..Or maybe rocket jump off a corpse in mid air? Get out there and expose some rib cages, have fun!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f62/f624821566ad293381e238bcaeddbcd8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 184, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lewkorp Digital Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Austin Lewko"], "esrb_rating": null}
