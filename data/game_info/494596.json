{"id": 494596, "slug": "league-a-hockey-stats-simulator", "name": "League - A Hockey Stats Simulator", "name_original": "League - A Hockey Stats Simulator", "description": "<p>LEAGUE is a dice-rolling statistics simulator for a solitary player of any age. It is exceptionally easy to learn and play, but can contain many optional levels of complexity or flair for an eager player. LEAGUE requires only a workbook or lined paper, a pen or pencil, and a collection of standard six-sided dice (seven is ideal, but one will do in a pinch).</p>\n<p>In LEAGUE, you will create a hockey association of completely your own design, complete with original teams, players, and trophies. You will roll for players\u2019 statistics, roll for teams\u2019 goals during elimination playoffs, and act as general manager for each team during the off-season, enacting trades, retiring players and replacing them, and adjusting the league with new teams in expansions or buy-outs as you see fit.</p>\n<p>This dice-rolling game was invented by a bored child of farmers in the 70s who passed it onto his children. One of them took it too seriously and has now written it up into a downloadable PDF to share with you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T03:15:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aae/aaedb9192ff4ce476485c39db369969d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["A S Ember"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
