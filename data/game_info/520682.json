{"id": 520682, "slug": "stressful-feather", "name": "Stressful Feather", "name_original": "Stressful Feather", "description": "<p>Stressful Feather is an interactive experience created on Post Processing meant to create a calming relaxation effect. You control a falling feather and must try to keep it in a moving box by using your microphone (either your built-in on your laptop or any microphone connected). Controls: Talk into your microphone to lift the feather up while pressing the W key to raise up the sensitivity (the feather requires a higher volume to float up/square becomes red) while also using the S key to lower the sensitivity (the feather doesn't need too much volume to float up/square becomes black).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stressful Feather was heavily inspired by the game \"Celeste\" where at one part, the character is having an anxiety attack and the player must keep a feather\u00a0floating to keep the character calm. My team and I were interested in this mechanic and hoped to customized it by having it rely on microphone input. Enjoy!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T03:57:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f0/3f0e639fe3eb75492555074f1235fdf9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hugo Lopez", "Gun Game", "Bryant Castro"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
