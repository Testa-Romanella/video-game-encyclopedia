A slightly clich\u00e9d story, but a new experience!<h3>Unfamiliar Puzzle</h3>Have you ever seen the puzzle gameplay of the <strong>meta</strong> element (i.e. breaking the fourth wall)? I dare say that this is the first time you have seen a game played in this way! Of course, if you have seen it before, I admire your wide knowledge!<br/>For example, drag the window to solve puzzles:<br/><h3>Familiar yet Unknown Puzzle</h3>The traditional Chinese culture is integrated into the new puzzle design, and you can feel the charm of traditional Chinese culture while solving the puzzles. Don't worry, there is no Huarong Path here, because I also hate it!<h3>Why did the game close automatically?</h3>Don't worry, this is part of the gameplay. Just reopen it.<h3>Unexpected development</h3>Without playing to the end, you can't imagine how the story will develop like this!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-22T05:47:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57c/57c1d0fe156534a51a920679fcc72d2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u7167\u5fc3\u4ead"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u6574\u4e2a\u597d\u6d3b"], "esrb_rating": null}
