We wanted to help people understand the experiences that tens of millions of people face with this \u201cinvisible disability\u201d.</p>\n\n\n<p>IMPORTANT</p>\n<p>Make sure to read all of the clipboards for the full experience of the game! If playing on browser, fullscreen the game as well to allow for a fuller experience.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Team Leader: Koji Wong</p>\n<p>Tech Lead:\u00a0Andrew Yu</p>\n<p>Design Lead: Angad Pantvaidya</p>\n<p>Project Manager: Shreya Nair</p>\n\n<p>*Unfortunately, due to size issues when uploading to itch.io, we had to compress the game a lot so the web version will look a lot worse visually than the windows/mac version. We recommend downloading the windows/mac version and playing from there instead.</p>\n\n<p>This game was created for the Games for Change Student Challenge 2022 with the theme, \"Shaping the World for Difference\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T10:43:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a4/4a412eb5273fd76fc77041fe06ffafbd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["SirQuackyy"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
