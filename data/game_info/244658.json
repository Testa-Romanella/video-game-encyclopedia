Your task is super simple, run from cops, collect as much money as you can, and survive as long as possible. This sounds very simple, but when you start playing you will see it's not so easy. Police cars are hunting you, and they will try to smash your car, so you should be very fast and very careful. The police cars are not your only problem, because often you will encounter many different obstacles in unexpected places and at time even the police helicopter, so react quickly. And of course, don't forget to collect money. Racing will not have sense, if you will not be able to get a lot of money, because the more money you make the more cars you can buy.</p>\n<p>Controls are very simple, constant acceleration and two button controls with fast restart. So, start the game, choose your favorite car and go ahead, show your driving skills, make quick, unexpected turns and remember, one hit and you are dead.</p>\n<p><strong>Key features of Police Car Chase game:</strong><br/>23 super 3D fast cars<br/>7 police cars: coupes, pick up trucks, sedans, SWAT vans and helicopters<br/>super easy controls<br/>nice and simple design<br/>funny gameplay<br/>multi language support</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7bb/7bb6345d7391bd9729d2ff5d2b9b277c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["sexy_adult_game"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
