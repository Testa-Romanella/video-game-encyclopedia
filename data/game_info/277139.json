I was playing as Bru-El, ilmatrian Cleric. During my campaign, I made a deal with a devil (as one would do when they are desperate) which lead me to being cursed and lose the ability to heal Humans [FYI: ilmater is a God of Humans (mostly)]\u00a0 When I had to make this game, I originally thought of making story based on Drizzt and how he obtained his weapons, but I realised copyright is a thing, and I preferred to be more original, so I made this based on my own character's adventure. Bru-El cleric of ilmater, son of forgotten house of Shiro-EL. I am assuming it be having few bugs, I will try to see if I can find them and fix them, feel free to contact me if you found any, or you think I should quit trying to be a game designer or (who knows) you liked the puzzles and the game, and you wanted to complement me... Go ahead :3 I would really like that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If bugs are found, let me know and I will try to fix it as soon as I get free time.</p>\n<p>[Thank you again (^_^)/\u00a0 \u00a0]</p>\n\n<p>p.s this game has 3 possible endings, Good Luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31d/31df47a3b0da5c407130b83bdab9024e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["KuraiSensei"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
