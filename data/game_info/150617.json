We chose to discuss through this medium\u00a0how globalization creates a juxtaposition between connecting us and highlighting how segregated we can be.</p>\n<p>Livestream is a walking simulator that lasts for one minute. The player has control over the camera but not over movement.\u00a0</p>\n<p>With this particular experience, I saw it as a prime opportunity to experiment with how landmarks and lighting can be used to attract attention. While the player has no control over position, they do have control over the camera and I attempted to play on that to have the player look at a the tower at a certain time.</p>\n<p>Eva Ly -3D artist</p>\n<p>Cosmo Porter-Witt -3D Artist</p>\n<p>Julian Hyerachi - 3D artist</p>\n<p>Brayden Beavis - Designer</p>\n<p>Luigi Salvadore - Designer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b3/8b3e6f78345bde728c1592c8df86b6ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["blbeavis"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
