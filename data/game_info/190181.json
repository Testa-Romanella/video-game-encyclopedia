{"id": 190181, "slug": "the-new-acey-duckey", "name": "The NEW Acey Duckey", "name_original": "The NEW Acey Duckey", "description": "<p>Acey Duckey was an old BASIC game by Bill Palmby, first published in the book BASIC Computer Games (1978).</p>\n<p>I basically re-coded the whole game twice. Once in the past when I was learning the basics of the C language, I developed a terminal version. Later, I coded a new version of the game in Lua, using the L\u00f6ve2D engine. The game still keeps the essence of what it was in the beginning (in BASIC language), but now has elegant sprites, sound effects and a better and more balanced algorithm for winning and loosing, including all faces of a cards deck and touchscreen compatibility (which means you can run the game on your smartphone if you have the Android L\u00f6ve2D app installed.</p>\n<p>The game is still in test, so feel free to post opinions on what I may improve in the game. Please remember that this game is Open Source, Attribution to me (and Bill Palmby) is required when redistributing this game or using parts of it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I also would like to thank Kenney (https://s-i-tech.itch.io/acey-duckey2|\u00a0https://twitter.com/KenneyNL) for the assets used in this game. You are awesome man!
