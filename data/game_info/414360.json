Recruit Foragers to harvest Biomass from plants. Every 3 seconds (an in-game tick), your Queen will automatically convert Biomass into Fungus food that your colony can eat as it grows. Recruit more workers to convert more biomass per tick.<br/></p><p>Right click plants to assign Idle Foragers to that plant. Left click plants to unassign ants from that plant.</p>\n<p>Expansion requires lots of food and each ant requires 1 food every 60 seconds. You can turn off expansion by clicking the Grow Colony button. Win by reaching 100 population. Lose by reaching 1 population and running out of food.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T03:31:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe6/fe6fe08b855910a24a72820ed561c80f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Technic235"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
