I faced many bugs and I've tried my best to solve all of them. Still the game could be much more improved and more levels could be added (I was only able to make two levels due to busy schedule and also couldn't find bangla alphabets). Thank you <strong>US Embassy Dhaka</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>Arduino Community Bangladesh (ACB)\u00a0for such an insightful course.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T04:27:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a74/a748e9f9c01e9355ca7e5f58c5db251c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["maliha20414"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
