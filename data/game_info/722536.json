In the case of this game, our environment is a house with pottery whose agents are made up of cute little doggos.</p>\n\n<p>A word about the limitation:</p>\n<p>When we were thinking over the limitation of \"movement is lethal\" we landed on an idea that was a little bit tangent to it. That is, if a pot was disturbed by a doggo, it would shatter and cause the player to get a low score (that is, the doggo's movement into the pot was lethal to the pot and the player's score). As lethal as one can get for a cute puzzle game.</p>\n\n<p>Be Good is a puzzle simulation game with a cute doggo who deserves some treats...\u00a0</p>\n<p>...Most of the time.</p>\n\n<p>Have fun!</p>\n\n<p>Created by 2 people.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T10:25:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fe/5fe754ad6cc2dfdd39b7d1397e8c4345.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Navid"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
