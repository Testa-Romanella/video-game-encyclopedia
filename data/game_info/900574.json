It's quite a simple project, and I'm just making this for fun in my free time. This game takes place with you (the red dot) in a small arena. Within this arena, enemies spawn, flying around the entire map wildly and unpredictably. You must move your red dot with WASD, arrow keys, or even a joystick, and press SPACE to attack the enemies.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T07:44:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be3/be3f3c9a53ff24f7175a34716fc32438.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lee"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
