This goal of the jam is to make a game that can be played from start to finish in 20 seconds. I took some liberties in adding a small intro and allowing the game to repeat any time the player loses or start again at a higher difficulty if they win. There are 5 levels of difficulty (Out of Control is the maximum).</p>\n<p>The game was built with\u00a0DragonRuby Game Toolkit and I strongly recommend it to anyone who is interested in making 2D games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T07:30:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c12/c1279a46e4a95000bb8a8436ca876a0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Akzidenz"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
