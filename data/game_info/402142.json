These are secret spaces, liminal and oracular. You know in the mountains there is coal, those dark, black diamonds that mean riches and a life of leisure. Hidden in between the dense forests and winding creeks, the fog and spiritualists, the shale and caves, there is hope, future, a hidden and secret valley. But the mountains, southerner, are older than you. And they\u2019re waiting.\r\n\r\n<p>This is the 5.5x8.5 zine edition of Souther Holler: A Trophy\u00a0Dark Incursion. You can print this out on five pages.\u00a0It is slightly edited and expanded from the version submitted to the Trophy Incursion Writing Contest.\u00a0You can download the version submitted to the contest for free.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a ready-to-play zine, and includes\u00a0the SRD content released by Jesse Ross and Trophy so you can use this as a reference for your incursion and Trophy in general.
