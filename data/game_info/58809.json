{"id": 58809, "slug": "forgotten-city", "name": "The Forgotten City", "name_original": "The Forgotten City", "description": "<p>The Forgotten City is a game about time travel, a mysterious murder, and avoiding fate. It is based on an award-winning Skyrim mode of the same name. The game retains most of the original mod&#39;s lore, but reimagines the characters and the setting and features a completely new voice acting and a music score. The game is powered by Unreal Engine.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game is set in a mythological ancient Roman city somewhere deep underground. A group of 26 archeologists explored the city until one of them accidentally broke a taboo and activated an ancient curse. Now they are trapped in a time loop and cursed to die and relive their deaths forever. That is, unless one of them changes what happened to the city and its inhabitants long ago, thus preventing the curse.  In the ruins, there&#39;s a portal, which leads to the past and allows the characters to relive and alter the previous events in the vein of The Groundhog Day movie. The Forgotten City features branching non-linear plots with difficult moral dilemmas and plot twists. There are multiple endings that depend on the player&#39;s actions.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls a protagonist that is fully customizable, up to his or her sex and physical appearance, in a 3D ancient city. Compared to the original mod, the game introduces new combat mechanics and wall climbing. However, most of the gameplay is based around characters&#39; interactions and timeline manipulations.</p>", "metacritic": 87, "released": "2021-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-21T14:41:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/6e9/6e9136f09bb9daaaed5a0e6d508028b4.jpg", "website": "http://forgottencitygame.com", "rating": 4.23, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 111, "owned": 878, "beaten": 210, "toplay": 175, "dropped": 49, "playing": 13}, "playtime": 7, "achievements_count": 147, "ratings_count": 230, "suggestions_count": 247, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 236, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 5", "Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox Series S/X", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Modern Storyteller"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dear Villagers", "Modern Storyteller"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
