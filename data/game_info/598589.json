By the way check out my other project:\u00a0https://chromebook-gamerwastaken.itch.io/friday-night-funkin-optimized-for-chrom...\u00a0By the way,\u00a0The source code is part of phykro, I only do this to continue updating his project and optimize it even more so please give phykro credit for the source code and not me thank you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>v0.0.3 re-added the bottom dlior people in week 5 (since it looked ugly without them and somehow made the arrows a little stuttery on low end devices without them) and same thing happened with the curtains in week 1 and the building lights in week 3, but atleast I deleted some usless diles (like the ludum dare prototype images) to decrease load times and make the game run kind of better, and also returned the car in week 4 and even added the random numbers (the ones that randomly show in the girlfriend's sprite) were re-added cuz of the same reason.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T08:30:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6f/a6ff0a14c2b498420c7972df48f45a54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["chromebook_gamerwastaken"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
