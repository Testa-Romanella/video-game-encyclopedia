Pearls fall out of the bottom of the \r\nplatforms, and you must sort them by pushing them with your nose. If they fall off the bottom, they will \r\nloop back to the top. However, as you sort the pearls, the rate of pearl\r\n production increases. Don\u2019t let them pile up too much \u2014 they\u2019ll become \r\nharder to separate, and a wrongly-sorted pearl is -1 points. The game \r\nends if a pearl stack gets too high and blocks a new pearl.</p>\n<p>You can also play this game on your smartphone, by touching and \r\ndragging to move in a direction. As long as your finger continuously \r\nmoves, the fish will move as well.<br/></p>\n<p>Find more small games like this at http://cassowary.me/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bba/bba08504406ec54a96ce98bdec7c583a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cassowary"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
