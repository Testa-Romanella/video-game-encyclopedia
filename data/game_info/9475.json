Players assume the role of the scientist Wilson lost in the dark world. The main objectives for Wilson are to stay healthy, fed and mentally stable, and to avoid attacks of supernatural enemies in order to survive as long as possible. Players control the action with the keyboard (general activities) and mouse (combat). The game features day/night time cycles, which change survival pace dramatically. Days are usually spent exploring the map, gathering resources, and crafting, while nights require maximum concentration and caution to stay aware of dangerous enemies. Enemies range from tiny frogs to carnivore birds and tentacles. To lead a successful survival players must control tree scales in the screen top, which track hunger, health and sanity respectively. Death occurs in various ways from including starving, insanity, and deadly wounds inflicted by monsters.</p>", "metacritic": 79, "released": "2013-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-22T21:54:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/f3e/f3eec35c6218dcfd93a537751e6bfa61.jpg", "website": "https://www.klei.com/games/dont-starve", "rating": 3.85, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 211, "owned": 4923, "beaten": 360, "toplay": 118, "dropped": 857, "playing": 76}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1091, "suggestions_count": 423, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 1095, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "PS Vita", "Linux", "Wii U", "Xbox One", "PC", "macOS", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Klei Entertainment"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Klei Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
