I don't have time. You have no time. We have no time.</p>\n\n<p>The Background:\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>I hadn't played video games for several years. But experimentation brought me back. Sampling to create something new is part of every art form. Be it cinema (Tarantino), painting (Warhol) or music (MF Doom). The medium of video games is still very young, many new things are possible.\u00a0There are an incredible amount of artists whose styles I really admire and have always wanted to see in a film or game. For a few friends in 2019, I started to sit down to make a game for the first time. Very personal thoughts and ideas came out of that. Probably some of them seem rather strange, but in any case they create different feelings and are interpreted differently - multifaceted, different and diverse, just like my friends. That's why a mixtape game is always a very personal gift to good friends. And an ode to the realisation of ideas that can be created together with very different people.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n\n<p>The Features of this speedrunning Mixtape Game:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Run and gun game with surreal boss battles\r\n</li><li>15 visually different stages\r\n</li><li>\u00a03 Gaming modes (single player, local co-op and Game Journalist Mode)\r\n</li><li>Playable with controllers\u00a0(very recommended)</li><li>Free Play\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T06:38:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab3/ab3eabc6b1c5f0cb47b269d67d988af7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 485, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jan Ski"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
