{"id": 813569, "slug": "astrotrucks", "name": "AstroTrucks", "name_original": "AstroTrucks", "description": "AstroTrucks was designed as a futuristic take on running the logistics behind a deep-space colony. Featuring accurate 6-DOF physics, this multiplayer game starts you off as a lowly taxi driver, ferrying around passengers between Warp Gates and various production facilities. As you build up your experience of your port, move into various career paths, including mining, cargo and ore transport. Delivering raw materials will allow your in-system facilities to craft better components and items, allowing the economy to flourish.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTired of taking in the motion-platform compatible VR flying and docking experience? Try your hand at being the Space Port Authority - guide your friends (or strangers!) along the most efficient routes in a glorious 3d-holographic view. Make strategic decisions about new processing facilities, or just sit back watch a busy spaceport with hundreds of AI and Player ships go about their business.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEvery ship is endlessly customisable, from in-cockpit baubles to external paintjobs, along with a vast range of upgradeable components to improve your performance. A deep Experience and Role Playing system also allows your character to improve at key tasks and to gain mechanical sympathy to squeeze more out of your knackered spaceship.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nKnackered? Yes, your spaceship has a complex series of intern-woven systems, each of which wear and break over time, causing issues. Driving carefully will minimise these issues - or you can put the pedal to the metal for a larger delivery bonus, at the risk of having to limp back to the repair dock and explain exactly why your fuel injector is kinda... melty. Drive carefully and efficiently or spend those bonuses art the garage; the choice is yours.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOf course, if you're tired of the marketing-speak, a somewhat more technical and less formal design document can be found in the linked section!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T04:35:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f59/f591eb9850676e49d5767258bf53cb4b.jpg", "website": "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q9m1Adv-LYYcOMNZwYmOsMPKDoBbwEZ6kwnUXChsv2g/edit#heading=h.m01wwi7njk7i", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 532, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DjArcas"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ProjectorGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
