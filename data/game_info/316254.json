This game contains profanity from West Indian Countries. If you aren't from the West Indies, the words you hear may not make sense because I\u00a0had a particular audience in mind. That said, you can still play dominoes against 3 computer players. Either way, I\u00a0hope you enjoy it and thanks for checking it out!</p>\n\r\nJust a reminder, this game contains profanity, specifically West Indian cursing! You have been warned!\r\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p><strong><em>--Washing the Dominoes--</em></strong></p>\n<p>When the dominoes are dumped on the table in the beginning, you can wash or shuffle the dominoes.\u00a0In order to wash the dominoes, hold the Right Mouse Button and move your mouse around to mix them up.</p>\n<p><strong><em>--Game Start--</em></strong></p>\n<p>Use your mouse to select a domino to play, if that domino has a valid play space on the board a green cube will appear. Double-click on the green cube with the Left Mouse Button\u00a0to play your domino in that location. If no green cubes appear, that domino cannot be played. If you have no dominoes that can be played, you must click on \"Pass\". If the dominoes are misaligned or disheveled just click on \"Reset Positions\".\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>--Controlling the Camera--</em></strong></p>\n<p>Hold the Right Mouse Button and move the mouse around to rotate around the table.

If there is a player that has no more dominoes, that player is the winner. If the game ends because there are no more valid moves, then the player will the smallest amount of points left in their hand wins.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-06T03:45:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27a/27a13226468558c7f39bfbfef7b3a222.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["alvinkpollard"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
