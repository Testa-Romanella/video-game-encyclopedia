One touch from a zombie and it's game over. Navigate the different levels, through the wastelands into a city, and find a means of escape.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was created for the Construct 3 Builder Jam #1,\u00a0 which can be found here. The theme for the jam was 'There is only one'. I interpreted this to mean 'one chance', which coincidentally\u00a0 is also the name of this game.</p>\n<p>I created most of the assets from scratch using Infinity Designer, including the background artwork, the buttons and the tilesets. The only sourced assets used were the character sprites, found here, and the zombie enemy sprites found\u00a0here. <br/></p>\n<p>One Chance can be downloaded and played on both desktop and Android devices. Click the Download Now button and you will have the choice to download for Windows, MacOS and/or Android. Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-10T03:16:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbc/bbc241a8552ec424e8176bf8706e1768.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Allus Interactive"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
