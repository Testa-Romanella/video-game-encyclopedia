The closest dock is a small island with a lighthouse, surrounded by hundreds of rocks\u00a0 and\u00a0naval mines. Will you survive?</p>\n<p>For this game, I worked on my own and\u00a0put lot of effort was put into the sound design and atmosphere. You can walk around the ship to use the boat controls, and look around for mines. You also have a handy mine detector on the bow of the boat.</p>\n<p>WASD to walk around</p>\n<p>F to toggle flashlight</p>\n<p>Q and E while in cabin to adjust steering and throttle</p>\n<p>It can take anywhere from 10-15 minutes to reach the lighthouse, depending on how the obstacles generated. As everything must die in one hit, as soon as you hit a naval mine or rock, it's game over.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>(This game was made for Mini Jam 108: Seaside. If you're in this jam I would love to check out your game!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T05:11:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/540/5401014ea2b78618b01d9fdb176f3544.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Looncaller"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
