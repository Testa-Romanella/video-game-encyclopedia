Both games were designed and programmed by David Crane and star jungle explorer Pitfall Harry. Released after the North American video game crash of 1983 when interest in the 2600 was waning, Pitfall II was one of the last major releases for the console and one of the most technically impressive. The cartridge even contains a custom chip designed by David Crane to allow four channel music instead of the two the system is normally capable of.</p>\n<p>Pitfall II was ported to the Atari 5200, ColecoVision, PCjr, Tandy Color Computer, Apple II, Atari 8-bit, MSX and Commodore 64. The game's plot was later loosely remade into Super Pitfall for the Famicom/NES.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1984-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/750/7500165f0327d8d8efb79dc490119893.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 9, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 223, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Atari 5200", "Apple II", "Atari 8-bit", "Atari 2600", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Activision"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["SEGA", "Activision Blizzard"], "esrb_rating": null}
