Roombattle is a\u00a0game where robot vacuum cleaners\u00a0chase you (a robot vacuum too (but you lack any weaponry)\u00a0).\u00a0</p>\n<p>To get the highest score possible, you must survive the longest time possible and absorb the most radioactive dust spots you can. While you play, your battery slowly drains; you must collect batteries to replenish it. If an enemy touches your vacuum cleaner, its battery is lowered.</p>\n<p>Inspired by this\u00a0William Osman video :\u00a0</p>\n<p>Made by efi, jusoue, Overlord, Quarton, Ramou and\u00a0Taluuuu<br/></p>\n<p>A big thanks to Quarton's father for the awesome music!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T19:52:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e3/0e3b800c6b77096781ec19e65ab54da2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["EauDouce"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
