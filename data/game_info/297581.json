Endless Runner style game.<br/><br/><br/>The story behind the 25%: <br/>As a freshman student and one-woman show with no background in coding or computer design, my journey building this app started as a fun opportunity to learn about the world of technology, app development, and graphic design. This quickly turned into something much bigger than myself. I enjoyed learning a new skill, but felt as though something was missing. I realized I could turn this project into something that I was truly passionate about and something that also brings about real change in the world. I am passionate about advocacy for victims of sexual assault, and helping them feel heard and believed. For this reason I am donating %25 of my profits to organizations like Pave. Pave promotes victim empowerment and spreads awareness of this prevalent issue.
