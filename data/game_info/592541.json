The most popular sport is chickens fighting on a gravity ball made out of thick jelly! How far can you make it? Compete with friends or the whole world or just play for fun!<br/><br/>Chickens are chaotic, so every time you try the same round, it is slightly different, so keep on trying until you get the best situation to win. Up to the round (level) 43 it is the same for every player and they can be won without help of the spare chicks. It has been tested many times. If you struggle, there are tips at the end of every lost round. Spare chickens are saved forever, if unused.<br/><br/>From the round 44 every player gets the same units and fights against the same enemies, but the location of the enemies will be random. This has been done to make the game endless. Yes! You can play it forever.<br/><br/>There are no ads between levels. You can watch ads to get spare chickens or see helping tips but only, if you choose to.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T10:00:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f8/9f81b5abe74dbaed625a589eebffdb7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SpinningDevs"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
