Two missions, five years apart, turn out to be connected by one man. In this frenetic and bloody third-person shooter that unleashed the iconic red-headed femme fatale on the world, the dhampir Rayne faces horrific creatures, hordes of soldiers with an array of tools and firepower, and every Nazi officer that stands between her and the one she must stop.<br/>\n<br/>\nBloodRayne 2: Terminal Cut<br/>\nBloodRayne is a dhampir, born from the unnatural union of vampire and human. Blessed with the powers of a vampire but cursed with the unquenchable thirst for blood and a weakness to sunlight, Rayne is challenged with her most personal battle yet as she hunts down her siblings. With new acrobatic movements and rail sliding, fast-paced blade and gun combat, fatal finishing moves, more dhampir powers like time control, and an extensive combo system, BloodRayne 2 is a brutally satisfying continuation of the iconic series.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBloodRayne: Betrayal<br/>\nRayne has returned to battle and feed in a brand new hack \u2018n slash adventure. Slay ghastly enemies as the sexy dhampir with superhuman strength, speed, and agility, recruited by the vampire hunting Brimstone Society for one last mission. The target is a lavish, yet sinister ball in a secluded castle with plenty of dark and gruesome surprises. With the help of a mysterious friend and members of Brimstone, Rayne must infiltrate the manor, take out the fiendish horde, and stop an evil master plot once and for all.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T02:05:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e77/e779d36dded26dca206e4108acb6c7de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 496, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Terminal Reality"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Ziggurat Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
