This could turn into a fully fledged game. I don't know. Please try it out and give any feedback. WASD to move. Space to Jump. Right click to exit the game(Don't ask why). You are on a 16 x 16 chunk of blocks(of course from Minecraft) and everything is in slow motion unless you are pressing a button. This is not meant to be anything at the moment. This is just so I can test ideas. Please give ideas in the comments. Currently there is a bug where the camera rotates by itself. From what I can gather, this is not from my code.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-18T06:02:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/738/738a75c972bb66cc63cb2d0f032d7049.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["WASD12345"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
