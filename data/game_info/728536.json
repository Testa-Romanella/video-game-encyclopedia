{"id": 728536, "slug": "senshiking", "name": "SenshiKing", "name_original": "SenshiKing", "description": "<p>SenshiKing is a local multiplayer turn-based game with rock-paper-scissors mechanics, inspired by Mesuking and Mushiking: The King of Beetles.</p>\n<p>The players can choose one from various fighters and use different power-ups during the battle. In addition, the players can perform all these actions by presenting and placing other markers in the arena field. The game environment mimics the day/night light and the weather conditions that dwell in real-life.\r\n</p>\n<p>In the end, only the toughest luckier survives.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions to Play</strong></p>\n<p>Two people must play SenshiKing on the same mobile device.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game should start with the players positioning of the arena.\u00a0Then, each player needs to choose a character\u00a0by showing its marker to the camera. After that, each player has a turn to select a symbol (rock, paper, or scissors) with the designated markers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sometimes the game generates power-ups, visible above the characters' health bars. There is a marker for the power-ups (the one with the red box), and there are three power-ups:\u00a0cloud, meteor, and arrow. Each one has different uses, and they can be explored to deal more damage to the opponent\u00a0or recover health.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T08:38:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/013/013bca10610567586b70be3d27c2e74a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Pedro Esteves"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
