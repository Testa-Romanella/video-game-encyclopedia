{"id": 861390, "slug": "civitas", "name": "Civitas", "name_original": "Civitas", "description": "<h3>What to expect...</h3>Civitas is taking an iterative development approach. <br/><br/>The demo of Civitas that will launch into <strong>Early Access</strong> is focused on sandbox gameplay with procedural world generation and city-building tools. We have designed an innovative \u2018Plot\u2019 mechanic that enables precise planning and leads to more unique creations by the player.  We expect to deploy minor updates frequently, with larger updates in between early access release and full launch.<br/><br/>The first major update during Early Access will introduce resources, Patrons and Civvies into the game. This will bring Civitas alive, creating a sense of progression and purpose for your cities. Once the game reaches this stage, players will build and evolve interconnected communities across their world, from tiny hamlets to thriving metropolises.<br/><br/>The final update for the full launch of the game will further expand and polish content, enhance performance optimizations and introduce mod support for the community to extend the game\u2019s life through their own creative additions.<br/><br/><h3>Open Your Atlas</h3>Map nerds, rejoice! Civitas is a game inspired by those iconic lithographic bird\u2019s eye view maps of the Renaissance era created by legendary cartographers including John Speed, Georg Braun and Frans Hogenberg.<h3>\u2018Tis time to thrive; not merely survive!</h3>Civitas is a game about the freedom to build without the pressures to survive. Escape into a thriving world of your own creation!<h3>Create a vast landscape and plot the land to your liking.</h3>Generate a continental landscape, procedurally formed using plate tectonics. Build multiple Civitates on 16km^2 map tiles.<h3>Plan and build a Utopia; from humble medieval hamlets to bustling Renaissance cities.</h3>Unique \u2018Plot\u2019 mechanics parcel your landscape in any way desired. Assign these plots a purpose to discover more upgrades and decorations that lead to unique creations.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Chart the course of society to prosper and lead your Civvies to enlightenment!</h3>Civvies will bring your maps to life as they move about their Boros and complete their daily tasks.<h3>Every Plot Tells a Story</h3>Follow the different narratives of your plots as Civvies move in, live, pass on, give birth, learn, and grow through the seven ages of man, as defined by Shakespeare, and not necessarily in that order. <br/><br/><br/><h3>Sandbox, Growth or Discovery Modes</h3>Choose your path of progression with sandbox free-build mode, tech tree growth, or discover an uncharted landscape.<h3>Who is Sharp End Studio?</h3>Sharp End Studio is a video game and digital media company based in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.

The idea evolved into a prototype that has received funding to bring the game into Early Access and beyond. The goal for Civitas is to introduce World Building elements into a City Builder, while easing the difficulty of Medieval-themed games, and introducing innovative gameplay mechanics.
