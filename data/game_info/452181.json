Adventure Thru Inner Space was groundbreaking not only in introducing the Omnimover and by creating an attraction almost wholly focused on backgrounds (with no characters except for the onboard narration) but in the way it arranged dramatic, themed space toward educational goals.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Several years ago we released a beta version of this software; in recent months, we have worked to arrange an updated version worthy of a wide public release. The time for that release has come. Now you have the ability to experience this extinct Disneyland attraction on your PC monitor, HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and Oculus Quest. It may work on other headsets, but we could only test with what we have. If we hear they are working for some, we will update our release notes to make others aware.\u00a0\u00a0So join us as we journey back in time to look at--what was then imagined--as the future of science.</p>\n\n<p>Development Team:\r\n</p>\n<p>Jeremy Marx</p>\n<p>Kurt Pfeifer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-08T04:21:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f1/8f1c45ae079fc08defa298685595d641.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["crankysomething"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
