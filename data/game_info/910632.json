Honestly, I didn't expect it to be so complicated to make, but I'm nevertheless happy with how this game turned out.</p>\n<p>In this game, you are in charge of a new business in a new market, a restaurant on Mars. When you buy foods, they generate profits automatically. With these profits, you can buy more foods or upgrades that help you grow your business even bigger.
