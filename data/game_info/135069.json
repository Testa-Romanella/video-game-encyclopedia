A zombie survival game with typing to sing.</p>\n<p>You play as Mother Abigale and start of within your settlement. Unfortunately, zombies are rising from the dead in the graveyards around the state, and so you'll need to recruit people to your cause and go destroy those graveyards.\u00a0 What better way than singing?</p>\n<p>Instructions</p>\n<p>You can move around the state by clicking on the sectors in the minimap (top-right). When focused on your settlement, you can input text to sing the words to some songs (alas, Mother Abigale only knows a few).</p>\n<p>For each correct word, you'll receive another follower - but for each incorrect letter there is a chance you'll attract more zombies around the map. Each new follower requires 1 resource (the wood icon) - if you have no resources, nobody will join you.</p>\n<p>At the start of each new day, each person in your army will eat one food. If there isn't enough food, your followers will slowly die and turn to zombies themselves.</p>\n<p>Followers left idling in a sector (that is, not fighting zombies) will automatically gather both resources and food at different rates, depending on the sector type (lake, forest, city, grass).</p>\n<p>To win the game, you'll need to destroy those graveyards!</p>\n<p>Some Caveats:</p>\n<p>* You need to set focus on the input text to input letters. When focused, you'll see the caret flashing. When focused, [Esc] will remove focus.</p>\n<p>*\u00a0f1 will show most console output, in case there is a problem (e.g. textures missing or the like).</p>\n\n<p>Have fun</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e3/3e3a6d022597178fa9d2fbe50fd39d11.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LintfordPickle"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
