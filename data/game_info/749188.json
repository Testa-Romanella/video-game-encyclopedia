I wanted to make a shoot-em-up using the gyroscope but the \"tube\" level design was very clunky for the shooting mechanics so I got rid of it. What was left was pretty close from the feeling that I had playing F-zero GX for the first time\u00a0when I was little so I decided to keep rolling with it.<br/></p>\n<p>There's still a lot to do for this project, a lot of polish and bugfixes\u00a0but I'm pretty confident in what I made so far.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T06:57:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b7/8b75d4860877e4adeb4dbaa9f653a249.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Pierre-Louis Bourry"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
