Sadly there is no way to cure it, so the threat must be handled the old fashioned way: By shooting at it until it dies.</p>\n<p>Use your epic DIY skills to\u00a0create completely new and extremely unbalanced firearms by combining different weapons. Then use them to completely obliterate the living crap out of everything that moves! Wipe each level clear of all enemies to move to the next. And remember to keep an eye on that ammo bar, because once you run out, you can't get any more.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the JamCraft 5 game jam in less than 10 days. It's still very rough and only has 5 levels (+ a secret bonus level). I might leave it in it's current state or I might update it. Honestly, I don't know.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T08:32:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1d/d1df7ab15a241ba059eaa471bea1d925.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["30fps"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
