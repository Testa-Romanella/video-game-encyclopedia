In this game you select components and bearing in order to launch your rocket along an optimal path, hitting waypoints and clearing obstacles along the way.<br/></p>\n<p>Rockets! was a competition entry created in July 2007. It came second, winning me a small amount of prize money - the first money I had ever earned from a video game. It's not aged badly, all things considered, but it's a little rough around the edges graphically. Still a pretty fun time, though.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-18T04:39:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df9/df9441a65451fc100680bfa24c8c4948.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gazza_N"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
