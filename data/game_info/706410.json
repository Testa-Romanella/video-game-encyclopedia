This game was done in 48 hours by a 13-year-old idiot in a hotel. So... I actually created this in like 10 hours... Pls kill me</p>\n<p>You play as Santa Claus, trying to figure out who belongs to the naughty list and the nice list according to their actions and grades. Very short and simple game lol.
