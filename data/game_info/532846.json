But it is a little project that I\u00a0had been working on almost two years ago. I was able to dig it up, this was what actually inspired Very Impressive\u00a0Parkour Game. When I said, \"Who doesn't love a flashback to an old game\", I meant this game.\u00a0</p>The refrence in Very Impressive Parkour Game<p>Then I realized no one had any reference. So if you are interested, download it.</p><p>Be warned:\u00a0</p><p>The game is unpolished AF and you have to ALT+F4 to close it. It also doesn't save progress, but it only has 7 levels. TBH I spent more time making the logo than the game itself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T05:26:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/124/1248d0fcb26b0a6cd7585004ab23f4e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mootbing"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
