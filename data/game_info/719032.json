However, there are some exceptions. Titles such as <em>Undertale</em> and the <em>Mario</em> RPG games force the player to take a more active approach during enemy turns. They will either have the player mitigate damage via a timed button press, or they will allow the player the chance to evade damage entirely.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Additionally, we\u2019ve seen some active time RPGs veer away from the approaches commonly found in action games. Instead of using melee combos and snapping to enemies, these games make use of abilities that go on cooldown upon use. Such titles include <em>Final Fantasy 14</em> and <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em>, and tend to maintain the meticulous feel of a classic turn-based game while having the combatants constantly move and push the battle forward.\r\n</p>\n<p>These two concepts (responding to enemy attacks and cooldown based combat) have helped these games feel unique and active. As a designer, I\u00a0wanted to prototype a combat system that utilizes these techniques in a top-down game. In doing so, I hope to\u00a0test how well said techniques work together, as well as see how the active cooldowns of <em>Final Fantasy 14</em> and the like apply to a 2D setting.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T07:15:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/491/491ebd0c29adec9d32ad5a68f6cce68b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lena Taylor"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
