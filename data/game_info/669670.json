The controls are the same for both sections, with the spacebar being used to jump in the platform area and to shoot in the shooter area. Enemies in the platform section drop ammo pickups while enemies in the shooter section drop timer pickups. Both have a small chance to drop health pickups as well. As your score gets higher, more enemies begin to spawn and the timer starts ticking down faster. You'll have to do some sharp shooting and heroic hopping to get a high score! (Mine is 86)</p>\n<p>All assets were made by me during the jam. I used Chiptone and Audacity to create sound effects. I used Musescore and Audacity to make the music. I used Inkscape to create the visuals. I used the Godot game engine for to game itself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T04:02:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/438/43841d57a1d6edb949af60bc9018ea57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AidanToad"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
