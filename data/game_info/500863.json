I took this theme to raise awareness for our polluted oceans and to credit the work of some few that go daily outside to clean up the mess other people left behind. Try to avoid plastics and start to recycle your trash!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>I'll release a proper post mortem about the game jam, and my struggles. I hope you enjoy this little game and I am happy to receive feedback! The game is taking place on one screen and is high score oriented.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Follow me on Instagram for other upcoming games! @bensworld.games</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T03:09:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed6/ed649a60bc40ff0b7f1da9e5a1947d6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bloham"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
