The project timescale was three months so inevitably with such a large scale scope and multiplayer features the game did finish but it definitely does need a little bit of polishing to do. However the team worked hard on this game and we managed to put out a truly special piece. Our own attempt at a small scale MMO, though limited to 20 concurrent players for now\u00a0:D<br/></p>\n<p>What I did:<br/>- Movement + physics<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - Wall running, hovering<br/>- Interactions<br/>- Camera controller<br/>- An extensive story and the main quests/questing system<br/>- Dialogue system<br/>- Intro cutscene<br/>- Level design / Map design + the world building<br/>- Tutorial<br/>- In-game music player<br/>- General bugfixing etc.<br/>- Youtube trailer<br/></p>\n<p>Additional features in the game:<br/>- Singleplayer, MULTIPLAYER and PVP Arena<br/>- Dedicated servers<br/>- Control scheme remapping<br/>- Save and Load<br/>- AI for three different enemy types:<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - Melee, ranged and flying<br/>- Inventory system<br/>- Crafting system<br/>- Final boss<br/>- A wide range of scaling weaponry:<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- for ex. minigun, grenade launcher, raygun<br/>- Spells:<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Black hole, magic ball, thunder cloud</p>\n<p>- Rarity and changing statistics for all items AND loot<br/><br/>...and much more!<br/></p>\n\n<p>There are of course numerous things that could\u00a0be adjusted and changed for example:</p>\n<p>- Swampyard level design has to be more compact and vertical<br/>- More sidequests<br/>- Scaling of enemies and weapons to better match the expected scaling of player (now feels like dark souls difficulty at the start and later on the player becomes an absolute terminator)<br/>- Level two<br/>- More of the fullness feel to the world. Things that raise the curiocity of the player</p>\n<p>In the end, I am happy about the outcome and even happier about all the countless things I learned throughout the making of Mechawizards!<br/><br/><strong>HOT TIP!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>USE\u00a0GRAPPLE HOOK FOR MANEUVERING ON LAND!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls -\r\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>W/A/S/D - Arrow -keys - Movement\u00a0\u00a0<br/>Left Mouse Button - Use Primary Weapon\r\n<br/>\r\nRight Mouse Button - Use Secondary Weapon\r\n<br/>\r\nMiddle Mouse Button - Melee<br/>Shift - Grapple Hook<br/>Scroll\u00a0Wheel - Reel In/Loosen Grapple Hook<br/>Space - Jump\r\n<br/>\r\nSpace (hold) - Hover\r\n<br/>\r\nTab - Inventory\r\n<br/>\r\nQ,\u00a0R,\u00a0F - Magic 1, 2 &amp; 3\r\n<br/>\r\nE - Use/Talk\r\n<br/>\r\nJ - Quest Log\r\n<br/>\r\nEsc - Esc Menu</p>\n<p>!!!
