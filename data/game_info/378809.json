You woke up in the wrong territory and there's only one way out: escape.\u00a0Killing the set amount of bots in each level will grant you the ticket to enter the tunnel loop. Your movement will be constrained once you run out of time or health, and you only have the time up until\u00a0sunrise, so <em>Hurry up!</em></p>\n\n\n<p>I used a spreadsheet to keep track of the game elements and ensure that the game has a good play design and a\u00a0smooth difficulty ramp. (Players, Procedures, Rule, Objectives, Resources, Conflict, Boundary, Outcome)The sheet also contains the data of game elements like AI-Bots damage, distance threshold, and...etc. I have personally play tested those levels and designed the time accordingly to the average of my results.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cognitive Flow in games<br/><br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Balance out conflicts and procedures / resources<strong><em>RayCast + Projectile</em><br/></strong><br/><br/>\n<p>After several rounds of play testing, I've created my \"quart shooting\" system with a custom offset.
