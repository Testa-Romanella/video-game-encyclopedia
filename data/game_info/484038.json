Funding for the space program was limited so the researchers at UNNAMED SPACE EXPLORATION ORGANIZATION built a mouse-piloted spaceship to explore the stars...<br/><br/>A - Move Left<br/>D - Move Right<br/>Spacebar - Jump<br/>Escape - Restart<br/>Alt+F4 - Quit the game<br/></p>\n\n<p>Came up with the idea while simultaneously moving out, so time was quite limited. Unfortunately didn't have any time for sounds... I think it's an idea that could go quite a ways! Was thinking of adding random tilt, asteroids to avoid, enemies that could stun the mouse, and a boppin 8 or 16 bit soundtrack. Not sure if it'd be better as a \"How high can you get?\" kind of game, or a level-based spaceship navigation game with more stuff thrown at the player as they progress....<br/><br/> Hopefully someone gets inspired or likes the idea, please let me know if you have any thoughts or comments!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T06:21:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c7/7c7f935eaff75542cc6e00d76e0d606e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["spenmas"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
