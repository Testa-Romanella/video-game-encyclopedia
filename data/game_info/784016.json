The demo is playable directly in your browser via WebGL or via the Windows Standalone download. This project uses a Unity client to connect to a remote\u00a0server that is using a custom extension for database transactions, transform updates, etc.</p>\n<p>Runiq features a fully-authoritative server controlling a day/night cycle and weather, multiple quests, and a full-fledged inventory system as well. This project is still very much a work-in-progress and was designed purely for the sake of demonstration via my freelance portfolio.</p><p>Portfolio: http://eatsleepindie.com</p><p>Twitter: https://twitter.com/eatsleepindie</p><p>YouTube:\u00a0https://youtube.com/c/eatsleepindie</p><p>Instagram: https://instragram.com/eat.sleep.indie</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T08:30:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/992/992d6ea06452aa18bb0bb13e2a9709f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["eatsleepindie"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
