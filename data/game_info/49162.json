{"id": 49162, "slug": "paddle-master-vr", "name": "Paddle Master VR", "name_original": "Paddle Master VR", "description": "Paddle Master VR is a casual cross between a breakout-style game and racquetball.   You play inside something like a racquetball court, but with numbered blocks that you must destroy.   You have a gun that you use to shoot balls at the blocks, and a paddle to keep the balls in play when they bounce back to you.   When your balls are all gone, your gun is automatically reloaded, and a new row of blocks appears, and any old blocks are moved closer to you.  You lose when any blocks get pushed past the red line marking the front of the play area.  How long can you last?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/007/0070d28af1caf0100b96d0426896b9f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Raging Pygmy Goat Games"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Raging Pygmy Goat Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
