The only action you can take in this game is rotation. With that said,\u00a0I made this game in only two days because of a crazy schedule. So it's very rushed, but let me know if you'd like to see a more polished version in the future!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T02:28:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/907/907f54fa7da77666575ff2c7656edff6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KrytalityStudios"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
