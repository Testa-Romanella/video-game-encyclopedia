Its trails were walked by hikers who claimed to have seen some figures crowned by a halo of light, but that is only part of the legend... Even so, there are those who have found in these lands a frequent place of pilgrimage and offering. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Kali M\u00fcller knew Rockrose like the back of her hand, she used to camp by the lake with her partner Illai and it was common to see her walking each of the trails. The last time she was seen was on the path leading to the lighthouse, where she used to sit and draw the unique figures of the shrines, fascinated by the local stories about miracles, strange symbols and unexplained medical recoveries.<br/><br/>Delve into Rockrose after her strange disappearance and find out if the legends are true...<br/><br/><br/><br/>Lapso: NIMBO is a short adventure as a prologue to the story of the main game.
