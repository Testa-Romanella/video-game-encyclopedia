Get instructions directly from the devil and order food that people hate the most based on their preferences. You must remember the orders as once you've accepted an order you can't view it again. Further levels have you making food with more items! Watch out for liars as they will lie\u00a0 about their preferences and so their likes and dislikes are in reverse!<br/><br/>Music: www.bensound.com<br/></p>\n<p>Sound Effects: www.soundjay.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T06:49:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/556/55648d9a2fc6fdafccc37d40abf29f5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TomPoucherGames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
