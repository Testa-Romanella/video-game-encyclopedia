Online Multiplayer Open Beta", "description": "<h3>This is a FREE Open Beta of the game!</h3>You asked - we provided!<br/><br/>Online multiplayer mode of <strong>Warriors: Rise to Glory!</strong> a turn-based combat game with RPG elements.<br/>Create a bloodline of (un)honorable fierce warriors fighting in the arena to death until you become the most feared gladiator bloodline in the world. Get revenge against those who butchered your ancestors! Customize each of your warriors looks, name, honorary titles and fighting style. Fight in duels and tournaments, and please the crowds, so they help you defeating your adversaries. With each victory, you and your bloodline become stronger, getting loot and harvesting the souls of your butchered opponents. Use your hard-earned money to buy all kinds of weapons and armor, when you win, you will have to decide your opponent\u2019s fate which will also affect your path. \u2013 you can send him to his maker or\u2026 well\u2026 <br/><br/><br/><br/>Some warriors will not make it through their epic journey, but do not fret: their descendants will inherit some of their skills and riches, so your seed will grow stronger and stronger, and eventually they will win their freedom back and avenge you \u2013 kicking lots of asses in the way!<br/><br/>So what are you doing here, with a mismatched armor, a bloody giant axe, and about to fart in some poor sod\u2019s face? Or, as the poet would say, WTF? The mad emperor Ayziz reigns over the realm of Indiekingdom with an iron fist because, well\u2026 that\u2019s what mad emperors do! Ayziz uses his dark powers to open a portal to different timelines and places across the multiverse and teleport thousands of warriors to fight against each other in his pits and arenas for his sick and wicked amusement (did we mention he is mad?). You are one of these warriors \u2013 after arriving near naked, leaving behind your home and family, you were told that only the fiercest warriors get their freedom back. You entered the fighting pits knowing that you won\u2019t make it alive\u2026 but also that your descendants will keep fighting to find freedom, revenge, and hopefully something nicer to wear than that disgusting loincloth!<h3>KEY FEATURES</h3><ul><li>Fight intense turn-based battles in spectacular arenas<br/></li><li>Create your custom warriors with crazy looks and bestow him the most ridiculous fearsome honorary titles<br/></li><li>Fight in 1 vs 1 duels and tournaments or participate in team fights in 2 vs 2, 3 vs 3 or Free for all!<br/></li><li>Fight with your friends in Co-Op mode.<br/></li><li>Gain experience and level up your warrior with better stats and new combat skills<br/></li><li>Earn money as you progress to buy cool gear (or just loot them from these poor bastards\u2019 corpses)<br/></li><li>Please the crowd and they might help you in and outside the arena<br/></li><li>Decide the fate of your fallen opponents: kill them or humiliate them\u2026 and earn rewards based on your decisions! <br/></li><li>Make your decisions wisely for death is permanent. </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f85/f8541b1d513ba47a5a6ae7da44ede2e5.jpg", "website": "https://www.warriorsrtg.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 259, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Gavra Games"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Gavra Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
