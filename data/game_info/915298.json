Experimental neural networks are popping up around the globe, delivering communication and information at a rapid pace. As one of the few \"specialists\" who are still off of the grid, your services are in high demand. But be careful, in this rapidly changing world things aren't always as simple as they seem.<br/></p>\n<p>Ringers is a First-Person atmospheric horror-adventure game. This concept demo was made in one week for a solo game jam with the goal being to create an immersive atmosphere and engaging universe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*(Note) This is an older concept\u00a0demo for a potential project that did not go into full development, but I thought it would be fun to release it nonetheless.\u00a0I created the entire level\u00a0in one week for a solo game jam, so I apologize for the short length.\u00a0Additionally, If you record a let's play of this game, please share the link in the comments! It's great for QA testing and provides helpful info for all future game development.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you enjoy the game, make sure to check out my most recent game Weeping Woods!
