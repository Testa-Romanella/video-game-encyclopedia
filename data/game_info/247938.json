{"id": 247938, "slug": "reincarnation-3d", "name": "Reincarnation 3D", "name_original": "Reincarnation 3D", "description": "<p>In complete dedication to the classic first person shooter's DOOM and Wolfenstein3D comes Reincarnation!</p>\n<p>Made in 5 hours over live stream this game is meant to recapture the atmosphere of the original shooters while bringing in new game play elements inspired by the original Call of Duty\u00a0Black Ops. The game jam theme was \"ouroboros\" which one translation is \"reincarnation\". So my entry is a reincarnation of this game style and graphics as well as using reincarnated humans (zombies) as the enemy. The more literal translation 'infinite / infinity' is also used as the game never ends and you compete for the highscore (Current confirmed is 16,000\u00a0!)</p>\n<p>If you watched the live stream you'll note how everything was taken into consideration:</p>\n<p>The resolution is 480x270 design to be close to the original DOOM resolution but for 16:9 monitors. The camera's FOV has also been taken into consideration. The roof is also a single color rendered above walls rather than a texture or object like in the original games. All walls are one universal height to simulate the limitations in games like Wolfenstein3D which had its walls all at one height.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ac/5ace9a16dda4d706a464ec194322b4c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BlakeGillman"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
