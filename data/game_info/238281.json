Brackets can handle up to 5 players per team, and up to 64 teams (for now).  This gives you more than nine quintillion possibilities in setting up your tournament (believe us, we searched the internet for that number).  Brackets was originally designed to help with a bar game which had 2 players per team, and a random number was chosen to see who gets to shoot first.  We've included that random number generator as well on each round.  Pick a number between 1 and 10, closest goes first.  Brackets is a fun way to chart your tournament and keep track of who wins.  If you have any kind of game night, tournament, or bar game... you can use Brackets!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:17:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9b/b9bf9c006a27f3a9afdad38d4aaa92d4_uruJbQg.jpg", "website": "http://enygmaticapps.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Todd Clark"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Todd Clark"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
