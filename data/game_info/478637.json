Please download the game down below!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rewind Your Life</strong> is a frantic Top-Down fighting/shooter like\u00a0game, in which you control the player character through his three life phases - child, adult and aged. Fight against enemies from stressful, everyday life, like the pesky teacher, who will weaponize \"homework\" against you. Taking damage will speed up your aging, until your eventual death. Collect <em>Rewind Items</em> to counter that. They represent happy moments of your life, which make you younger and revert the aging. You can also get Power-Ups to gain advantage over the enemies.</p>\n<ul><li>Fight against a gall bladder with a thermometer</li><li>Adopt a cute dog</li><li>Progressive difficulty</li><li>Made for the Brackeys Game Jam 2020.2 in one week</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Move - WASD / arrow keys</li><li>Dodge - space bar</li><li>Attack - left mouse button</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Thank you for playing!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T07:44:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c3/1c350e06a7aea42c3d056faa53a514a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Tschlompf", "Bombsher"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
