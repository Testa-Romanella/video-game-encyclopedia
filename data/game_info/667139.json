Each time, you click the right combination, you get a +1 to your streak counter an every 2 streaks, the level will raise and it will become more difficult.<br/></p>\n<p>The concept is nothing new (well known as \"Senso\" with 4 colours), so i mostly focused on making my first \"complete\" game with unity in a very short time. :)<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T05:31:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d17/d17708b967a29f93811dbcb10b85edfd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["SirTobyB"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
