OVER THE NEXT 48 HOURS WE WILL BE UPDATING THE TRAILER, SCREENSHOTS AND MORE. THE GAME IS NOW A TRUE SURVIVAL HORROR GAME. WE HAVE CHANGED OUT THE MESH, CHANGED THE LEVEL DESIGN, MADE THE GAME MUCH SLOWER. WE COMPLETELY 100 PERCENT RIPPED OUT THE OLD A.I AND REPLACED IT WITH NEW A.I. THE ZOMBIES WILL NOT DAMAGE THE PLAYER AT THIS TIME BUT WITHIN A FEW DAYS THEY WILL. AGAIN THIS GAME IS NOT THE SAME IT ONCE WAS WE ARE TAKEN FULL STRIVE IN CHANGING THE PLAY MECHANICS AND WE HAVE DONE SO WITH GREAT STRIVE THE LAST 72 HOURS.
