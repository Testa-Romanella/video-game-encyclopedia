The feeling of finishing a game you've had on your mind is incredible, even if it's just a simple game like snake. Instead of waiting for something to happen I opened trello and started writing up things I wanted to add into the game. Game development would start the next day. And so I did.</p>\n<p>The first day was the hardest and I was about to drop more than one time, but I managed everything through the help of countless tutorials and experience from other projects.</p>\n<p>My intention from the beginning was to upload this game once I'm finished to get your opinion on how you liked it, and maybe some suggestions. I don't plan on picking it up for now once I start my next week long project but some major bug fixes or really nice updates can still be done. So feel free to message me!</p>\n<p>A list of dropped features due to lack of time and/or motivation and/or\u00a0ideas:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>AI to play against</li><li>Multiplayer</li><li>More items (like slow down time)</li><li>Grand Prix overview after finishing that shows an evaluation of how well you did and gives you a rank</li><li>Much more that I just forgot about</li></ul>\n<p>In any way, please share your experience after playing this game. I really liked it, but thats mainly due to it being my own game. Tell me what I can do better next time! Cheers!</p>\n<p><strong>All the information that is important to play the game properly should be available in-game.
