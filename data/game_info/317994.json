This was made with Godot 3.1, on GLES2. In fact, the source is only 104\u00a0<em>kB</em>, and I haven't even cleaned up my code yet. The secret?<br/></p>\n<p>This game is, literally, almost\u00a0<em>asset-free</em>. The graphics are all from in-engine vector drawings, and the sounds are procedurally generated with a model of an old Motorola NES-style synthesizer. (At least, I think it was Motorola.) I didn't remove the icon file, and I could probably slim the source down further, but I think my point has been made.</p>\n<p>The objective is simple\u2014heard the groundhogs (and later, snakes) out of their holes with your RC car. The RC car has three potential payloads\u2014dynamite, a boom box, and a sand bag. The animal movements are technically random, but biased toward the tiles of least threat. They avoid the sky, the bottom of the screen, your RC car, the boom boxes, and the dynamite to varying degrees.</p>\n<p>So yeah, basically you're groundhog hearding.</p>\n<p>If this gets enough attention, I may come back to it later and add a few new payloads (cement? water hose?), animals\u00a0(rabbits? tarantulas? centipedes?) and maybe buff the physics down a little (locate those occasional physics-processing needle-skips, and maybe add fluids, breakable rocks, and other things). Right now I'm just going through my checklist and producing a base for every game idea I've got.</p>\n<p>I'll be holding a poll on my Patreon page in the not-too-distant future. 'Till then, enjoy!</p>\n<p>(NOTE: I'm aware of the slight delay that some people get when detonating dynamite\u00a0while running the web version of the game; it is in-all-probability\u00a0an optimization issue involving unnecessary generation of noise. This is not as present in the downloadable version of the game, likely due to a WASM-vs-Multithreading issue,\u00a0and wasn't happening at all in the editor. I'll try and root that out before the 2\u00a0MB contest ends.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T08:27:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/971/9716164635a1d5d602d1a010a1801a58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["vikinghelmet99"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
