I give so much effort to these game, i hope i can win this jam, good luck for everyone who participate in these game jam too!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I really hope by creating this game people will be interested about learning the Satera Jontal. One of\u00a0the reason i made this is because i found out that not much\u00a0people in Sumbawa know about Satera Jontal. These is my effort to spread the knowledge of Satera Jontal. <em>yam</em>\u00a0<em>mara leng tau samawa, lamen yong kita, sai bali?</em> (like sumbawa people says, if it's not us, then who else?)<br/><br/>On the next update i will bring a lot more content to the game, such as boss, puzzles, and more! Stay tune~</p>\n<p><strong>If you have feedback please tell me in the comment, that will helping me so much!<br/></strong>Jika kau punya umpan balik, mohon tulis di kolom komentar, itu akan sangat membantu!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T08:04:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7bf/7bf053a74053204aa52c38583cf07e84.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Garry"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
