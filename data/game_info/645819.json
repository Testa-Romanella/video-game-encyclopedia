The game currently only has 4 levels\u00a0and a playground where you can try out the mechanics.\u00a0Share your highscores on our discord\u00a0server!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>The only difference between the paid and free version is that the paid one contains a endless mode and it will be updated more frequently,\u00a0you also get to support an up and coming dev that will fuel 100% of the profits back into more games! The free version will continue to receive all the big updates but will no longer receive any new levels.</strong></p>\n<p>Our current roadmap aims to improve graphics for this demo. Leaderboards, an endless mode and\u00a0more levels will (hopefully) come with the full release on steam (TBD).<br/></p>\n\n<p>This game is being solo developed by me, Fernando Alzueta, a 17yo who has way too much free time in my hands.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T08:29:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23c/23c338cb6f8f543332ca2ed9d4788081.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["fernandoa"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
