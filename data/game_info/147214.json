I chose to mimic a classic side-scrolling monster shooter: \"Dangerous Dave and the Haunted Mansion\". Though with less features, no score, no extra lives, and only one level I feel I captured the spirit of the original game as well as the Jam itself.</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<p>Menu: N for New, H for How, C for Credits, Esc to return to Main</p>\n<p>WASD to Move</p>\n<p>Space to Jump and Climb</p>\n<p>L-CTRL to Shoot</p>\n<p>E to Open Final Door (there are two doors, one is a fake)</p>\n<p>Story:</p>\n<p>Driving down an old dirt road Andy Blast is set upon by zombies.
