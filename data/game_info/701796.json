I didn't make it.</p>\n<p>Theme is \"Just Destroying Stuff\". Guess I should have gone for something more simple, but playing some golf with a wrecker ball as a golf club had its charm. What i didn't account is how long it would take me to figure out a proper way to move the wrecker ball around.<br/><br/>This is basically POLYGON Construction demo scene with my Wrecker that you can control to hit a foreman and some barrels.\u00a0Synty Studios - Asset Store (unity.com)</p>\n<p>Lack of time to make it a golf, I at least\u00a0wanted to add a bit of gameplay which you work on the best way to hit the exploding barrels skid to send the foreman as far/high as possible. Ran out of time, explosion is pretty lame.</p>\n<p>So, for controls.</p>\n<p>A/D to move left and right. W/S to lift or lower the arm.<br/></p>\n<p>Note, wrecker ball isn't actually attached to the machine. To maintain proper movement, it is hooked to an invisible game object that moves on a 2D plane.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T08:21:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98c/98c13717a2ed125b4686522eed32e09e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kalahee"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
