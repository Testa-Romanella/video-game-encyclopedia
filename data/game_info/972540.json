There is no greater honor than to serve the Juice Queen, and the sky is definitely not made of plywood.<br/><br/>Juice Galaxy is a happy place to fly around and smack things and drink juice. And explore things. And just, flip around doing stuff. Use any of a multitude of weapons to clobber and devour the local wildlife. Gather juice to increase your power and take on more powerful enemies. <br/><br/>The game is still in active development. There's still a ton of work to do. I want to polish the physics and add a ton more abilities, places, music, items, monsters, and story.<br/><br/>Enjoy, and please feel free to leave feedback or suggestions.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-31T12:27:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/076/0768a776432ebb9958cca0f2fb43279d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 284, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["fishlicka"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["J4D3D"], "esrb_rating": null}
