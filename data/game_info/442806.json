But what about having tentacles instead of hands? You're about to find out! I'm very certain that tentacles are meant to be used to dance.\r\n</p>\n<p>The tentacles are following the IK targets (the wireframe balls) which are connected to your hands. Move your body and hands to make them dance. Use rotating and waving gestures. The index trigger button moves the IK target further away to stretch the bone chain. Use it for effect. Cross the controllers to interchange the tentacles - gives them a big fancy wave.</p>\n<p>Technology behind. It's made with Unity and the oculus integration plus URP. The tentacles are connected to the shoulders. Actually there are two rigs. One a biped skeleton and the tentacle rig over it. <br/>Tentacle 3D model by Daniel Glebinski.<br/>(https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/tentacle-rigged-8fcc783af94246a0b8febf424a4b96b9)</p>\n<p>Music track \"Forest Daytime 3\" by Gamemaster Audio 3d Background by Crosstales</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T06:55:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d15/d15910c3e0112f3e476996ba546c7a4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 341, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hexodus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
