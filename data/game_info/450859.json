I was feelin' pretty nostalgic and decided to try it out.</p>\n<p>The thing is, it looks like the file has been corrupted (or something). Immediately after I boot it up, some random error-checking program starts trying to shut down the drive--I have no idea why, I didn't program that. And I'm fairly certain no one else has had access to the disk image.</p>\n<p>Anyway,\u00a0I figured I'd upload it here, give the internet a chance to figure it out. Lmk if you find anything interesting!</p>\n<p>I've attached downloadable versions for Mac and Windows, and there's a version playable in-browser as well, but for some reason the browser version is broken and some features don't work :/</p><p>I HIGHLY recommend playing the download versions, the web version is there mostly just for fun.</p>\n\n<p>[this game was made for the Two-Minute Horror game jam]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T04:38:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/659/6598d0ffa724512827ec2efe1db1ffc5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Cormorant42"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
