Not knowing what expect, the trip takes a sudden turn when his ship sinks and is washed ashore in the desert city of Saitis.<br/>With the help of the second survivor Enros, he must find a way to travel to the capital, and join forces with other adventurers along the way, so he can finally fullfill his supposed destiny.<br/>All this in a young world, before technology and machines, pulsing with magic.</p><p>The game adopts a non-linear approach, except for a main objective, and rewards exploration vs grind.<br/>You can choose classes for most characters that fit better to your playstyle.<br/>The classes are Gladiator, Defender and Swashbuckler for melee and Elementalist, Mystic for mages.<br/>Like everything in the game you must first search for it, so keep your eyes open!</p><p>As I said before, this is Chapter 1 only. Keep your eye open for when the 2nd Chapter is done!</p><p>One last thing! Godstones Genesis needs your help! Please post your feedback(with bugs!) and all ideas about any mini quests or improvements you might come up with!<br/>I aim for the best (that are also doable) to be included in the final game, along with proper credit and npc named after you (a name that's fitting please!)</p><p>Credits for plugins go to:<br/>Yanfly, Julian 'Szyu' Heinen, Rexal, Yoji Ojima</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a46/a461681d8fbb07a483b21d8d8c30d333.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 266, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ted Latas"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
