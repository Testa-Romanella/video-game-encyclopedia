I was 6/7 years old maybe. They were a blast &amp; foundational for my interest in games - leading to a game career. I finally recalled the name recently &amp; just wanted to extend a thank you\"<br/><strong>IndieJulian</strong><br/><br/>\"As a kid I was confused by this game, as an adult I remain the same. 10/10, would get hit hard by nostalgia again\"<br/><strong>Zeron</strong><br/><br/>\"Honestly this game was one of the many Lenny Loosejocks games that made my childhood worthwhile. Even throughout all this time, it's still just as enjoyable and charming as it was all the way back then!\"<br/><strong>TheDogVon</strong><br/><br/>\"Quirky, oozes charm, this game is an experience on to itself. Walkabout this aussie weirdness, a true Ezone gem!\"<br/><strong>Luio</strong><br/><br/>\"A game that grips me just as much now as it did in my childhood. Outstanding gameplay and great humor!\"<br/><strong>AjaxIronside</strong><br/><br/>\u201cLenny goes Walkabout provides a true and honest look into down under living. Smash some toads and stay awhile.\u201d<br/><strong>Briefcase</strong><br/><br/>\"Great game, filled with great animation, minigames, and so much fun stuff to do\"<br/><strong>Nicky</strong><br/><br/>\"A piece of history in the early days of internet entertainment. Lenny Loosejocks was one of the mascots for Shockwave / Flash at the end of the 1990's and for good reason. In his first large scale adventure, you walk Lenny through the town of Pullyapantsup in The Land Of Down Under. Explore, play minigames, squish toads, and walk through a mind field that leaves you on a cliffhanger for Lenny's next adventure. It's been over twenty years, and the lovable oaf is still prevalent in my memories.\"<br/><strong>Shakermaker</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T03:42:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03f/03f2c7cf8fcd2ce6d9b60166b1b110b8.jpg", "website": "https://ezone.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ezone.com", "Ezone"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Ezone"], "esrb_rating": null}
