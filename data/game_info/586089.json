This is a humble but thorough attempt to recreate the success of early Master of Orion game, keeping you away from planet micromanagement and allowing to do pure research, strategy and tactics. Planet control is simple and based on the economic triangle (new!). Fans of Master of Orion will feel here like home.<br/><br/>Tachyon Wars introduces concepts like reconnaissance and invisibility to run sabotage missions on enemy territory. Resources are scarce, so every loss of resource matters.<br/>The game takes place in wide open space, so you won't be able block a star node to prevent enemy from entering your territory. Instead you will keep the perimeter well scanned and patrolled.<br/>Fleet control expertly automated to facilitate real-time gameplay: all fleets are moving simultaneously, so they all follow the directions you set for them. This mode is different from a traditional RTS, and reflects the feeling of turn-based gameplay. Have a try to see the difference.<br/><br/>Tachyon Wars was envisaged as a multi player experience (which is coming soon!), but the included AI will surprise even veteran space strategy players! Stay tuned for updates about the online game.<br/><br/>I believe in fair play. Tachyon Wars has no hidden costs, no microtransactions, just pure fun. Play it and enjoy.<br/><br/>In summary, this game has it all. Open space to explore, intense battles, crafty AI and space fleet automation. All of it well seasoned with novel realtime game mechanics. Uncover the secret of dark matter and construct fierce space fleets. Reveal enemies plans with tachyon scanners and sabotage the enemy cargo flows. Test gravity weapons and bomb them away from their home planets!<br/><br/>Please leave comments what you like or dislike about this game. I value and open to any feedback. I am keen to keep tailoring game to your views.<h3>I Hope You Will Like It.</h3><br/><br/>Help with tutorial:<br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaG-uCixOZ4", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T02:44:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/824/824614f7efce726dd402769566ffa5be.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/TachyonWars", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 342, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fair Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Fair Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
