{"id": 351003, "slug": "roguebook", "name": "Roguebook", "name_original": "Roguebook", "description": "<p>Roguebook is a single-player roguelike deck-builder that takes place in a procedurally generated world.<br />\nEnter an ever-changing world full of legendary encounters and stories. Craft your cards, assemble the perfect deck and defeat the Roguebook itself... or die trying.<br />\nRoguebook is the second major game from Abrakam, the creators of the strategy card game Faeria, which launched in 2017 and has the best rating for a CCG on Steam with 86% positive Steam reviews and 1 million downloads.<br />\nEvery time you play, the Roguebook generates a new world for you to explore. Said to contain all available knowledge in the world, rumors are whispered that those who dare to read the Roguebook can gain omniscience and attain near god-like status.<br />\nThe pages within are filled with dangerous creatures, ancient legends, and exotic lands from the world of Faeria. The Roguebook itself is a mischievous entity with its own goals and motivations. It is able to rewrite itself entirely, always with the intent of tricking and fooling those who read it - trapping them for eternity.<br />\nWill you be able to outsmart the Roguebook?<br />\nYour adventure begins by selecting two heroes that will explore the Roguebook together. Each hero has their own special abilities and strategies. Combine different heroes for a completely different play experience.<br />\nThe combat in Roguebook focuses on dual-hero gameplay. Each hero supports the other in different ways, from unleashing explosive combos to protecting the other from damage.<br />\nCore Battle System<br />\nDuring battles, the hero in front is the one normally exposed to damage.<br />\nWhenever you a play a card belonging to the hero in the back row, your heroes will swap positions.<br />\nIf any hero reaches 0 health, they become inactive for the rest of the battle and have their cards removed from the deck. After the battle, that hero is healed back to a low amount of health and two Wound cards are added to your deck. A Wound is a card that&#39;s not playable and will only act as a handicap. It is said that finding a helpful wandering monk can help you remedy these wounds...<br />\nIf both of your heroes reach 0 health in the same battle, your current run ends and the Roguebook wins.<br />\nEach card in Roguebook has a chance to have a certain amount of sockets. In these sockets, you can place a wide variety of gems to upgrade them in interesting ways. Gems also have assigned rarities. The rarest of them can completely transform your deck.<br />\nIt&#39;s up to you to find the best way to use your gems with your deck, allowing for an infinite amount of customization. This vastly increases the ways you can break the game... exactly what we love about roguelikes!<br />\nEach time you enter the Roguebook, it will generate a unique world for you to explore. Gems, cards, relics, encounters, and all sorts of legendary stories are randomized to guarantee a fresh experience with each new reading.<br />\nYou can move around the map freely and decide which area or encounter you&#39;d like to visit. Fog of war will prevent you from seeing the whole map, so some exploring will always be necessary. It&#39;s up to you decide which areas you&#39;ll discover, but be quick - for the Roguebook is always nipping at your heels as you go. Between fighting and looting, you will sometimes meet friendly NPCs: Fugoro the Shopkeeper, the Wandering Monk, the Court Jester, the Jeweler, etc.<br />\nThe Roguebook contains the entire history of Faeria within its pages, including every legend and story that has ever been told around the campfire. Your heroes will encounter all manner of exotic beasts, endure powerful magic, and solve challenging problems.<br />\nWe loved Gamebooks and would love to explore their narrative aspects in Roguebook. Each hero will have their own unique traits, like Wisdom, Cunning or Strength, giving them new possibilities to solve situations they encounter. Also, we want to have chain of events. For instance, the second or third time you meet the Apex Predator, the story will change depending on the results of previous encounters.<br />\nThe game is strongly connected to the already established Faeria universe.<br />\nThe Roguebook began as an esteemed book of lore from the world of Faeria. After the events in the Chronicles of Gagana take place, it was lost and forgotten inside the depths of a faeria well. There it lingered for over a decade.<br />\nThe contact with this endless source of faeria transformed the book in a terrible way. Over time, it slowly develops its own free will - and reaveled its mischievous personality. By this time, characters like Sharra and Seifer have grown into heroes and villains of legend in their own regard. Their thirst for finding new challenges will draw them to this powerful artifact, now known as the Roguebook.</p>", "metacritic": 79, "released": "2021-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-07T05:41:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/021/021e9b567a8f65c3c5adf37282564047.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.08, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 35, "owned": 181, "beaten": 10, "toplay": 28, "dropped": 13, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 118, "ratings_count": 24, "suggestions_count": 224, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 24, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Abrakam", "Abrakam Entertainment"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Card", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Nacon", "Abrakam"], "esrb_rating": null}
