{"id": 6626, "slug": "perfect-woman", "name": "Perfect Woman", "name_original": "Perfect Woman", "description": "Perfect Woman is a game inspired by the ubiquitous personality questionnaires featured in women\u2019s magazines and the female roles they define. There are so many such roles emphasizing aspects of family, career, experience, sex and more. But these can not possibly characterize the depth and complexity of a woman\u2019s life. Perfect Woman uses these stereotypes as building blocks for you to be your OWN perfect woman.\n \nThe game is structured into progressive levels, each one representing a different stage in a woman\u2019s life. Starting at the child stage, players must post in front of a Kinect to mimic various poses that appear on screen. The better a player is able to hold the pose, the more \u201cperfect\u201d their rating for that level.\n \nPerfect Woman features a branching decision tree which serves to create a narrative of the character\u2019s life. Past choices may make future choices more difficult. It\u2019s not always possible to be perfect at every stage in life, and that\u2019s perfectly fine.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/630/6303f925a9e2c23da59f9eea4f404df3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Xbox One"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Peter Lu & Lea Sch\u00f6nfelder"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
