{"id": 768076, "slug": "monster-master-2", "name": "Monster Master", "name_original": "Monster Master", "description": "The game is currently early alpha quality.<br/>FPS heroes versus RTS horde. An asymmetric multiplayer where 1 player spawns the different monsters, and 3 class-based fps heroes try to survive it.<br/> <br/><br/>The game is set in to the small town of Kingsfield, where an energy research facility has given birth to a cosmic horror entity called the monster master. <br/>Players can choose to control and mutate the monster horde or survive as a group of class based heroes with unique powers. <br/> <br/><br/>The hero perspective is a thrilling unscripted experience where the monsters feel very intelligent. It suddenly is very quiet and you know \"It\" is planning something.<br/><br/>For the Monster master it feels like toying with other players. Dance puppets, dance!<br/> <br/><br/>Before purchasing please be aware, that this game is in early alpha development and it is being actively updated. The core game is understandable and fun in a group of 4, but this is not a highly polished nearly launch quality early access game. We'd love to hear your honest feedback and that is why it\u2019s in open development/ early access.
