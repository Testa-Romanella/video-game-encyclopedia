Use your hook hands to capture enemies or climb walls.</p>\n<p><strong>Theme : </strong>When we were making the game, we tried to find a simple game mechanic that can be use in a multitude of way. So we ended up with hook hands that you can use to climb walls, grab enemies, throw enemies and propulse yourself. But we also tried to make everything else have another purpose. Your time is your life, the enemies try to hurt you be you also need to collect them, sacrificing enemies make you progress in the game but also give you life back, you can grab enemies but you can also throw them on another one to kill them.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls :</strong></p>\n<p>W/A/S/D, Right Click, Left Click</p>\n<p>Joystick Left, Joystick Right, Left Trigger, Right Trigger</p>\n<p><strong>Platform :</strong> Windows</p>\n<p><strong>Third-party Resources :</strong> Unity</p>\n<p><strong>Credits :</strong></p>\n<p>Damien Laplante, 3D Artist</p>\n<p>Olivier Charon,\u00a0Animateur</p>\n<p>Antoine Berthiaume Dutil, Programmer</p>\n<p>Hugo Bombai, Programmer,\u00a0Sound Designer</p>\n<p>Axel Garcia, Programmer</p>\n<p>Jean Claisse, Sound Designer</p>\n<p>Pierre Gachard, Level Design</p>\n<p>S\u00e9bastien H\u00e9roux-Lefebvre, Additional Help</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b16/b1608a4a5d658b4a27795ac0035ed5b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["antronik7"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
