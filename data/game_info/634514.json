Hook the fish onto your line by clicking on it, after which you collect it.\r\nThe aim of the game is too feed all the animals who are hungry and have their minds set on eating fish, specifically:\r\n1. The Duck\u00a0\r\n2. The Heron\u00a0\r\n3. The Snake\u00a0\r\n4. The Albatross\u00a0\r\n5. The Eagle\u00a0\r\n6. The Otter\u00a0\r\n7. The Fox\u00a0\r\n8. The Bobcat\r\n9. The Seal\u00a0\r\n10. The Bear\r\nKeep in mind, these animals are hungry and if they don't get their fair share of fish, you're next on their list.\r\n<p>(Full - screen recommended. UI might be dislocated or cut off otherwise)</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer:\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\n    Do NOT feed animals in reality, unless requested and monitored by professionals in the field. They may not be able to tolerate being stuffed with fish.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T07:17:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/814/814639c4b765994327be9a1d84b99417.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FrogDev97"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
