Something was howling and thumping overhead all the time, and I did not want to work on it, but I needed to distract myself somehow, so I did it. I continue working on the game in Lviv, in between volunteer activities (I helped people evacuate from cities where hostilities were taking place). When I finished it, I realized that working in safety brings me joy, and it allowed me to take my mind off my nervousness for at least a few hours. I hope this game can bring some joy to someone too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Although the game was not planned to be fun. It was a fixation of the reality, when author can't control it with their works, so they can just be a witness. I was just a eyewitness, spectator of things that happen, and I was too ruined too, to create something new. So I just asked people that lived with me in a bomb shelter, and my friends, who lived in other bomb shelters, how are they - what they think and feel. This is what game is about.</p>\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Quackerton in: The Locked Birdhouse (WIN/MAC) by\u00a0WhatNames\r\n\n<p>In this storybook game, Professor Quackerton and her friends have to band together in the wake of a loss.
