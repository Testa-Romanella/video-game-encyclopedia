Pretty much everything went really smoothly, and LEd allowed me to create visually advanced levels with quite few work. <br/></p>\n<p>Gameplay wise, I add a very bad time trying to make the <em>time-loop </em>functionality fun, and it never became a really good base for interesting puzzle design. It proved to be hard to create many unique situations with it. With some sleep, I now have some better insight at what should be fixed, but I\u2019d love to hear about your comments :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T12:37:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd8/cd84e084617a810df5d2e899aa122f37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["deepnight"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
