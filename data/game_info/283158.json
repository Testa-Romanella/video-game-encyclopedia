The firetruck and ambulance are ready for firefighting and rescue duty.<br/><br/>Drive rescue and emergency vehicles in the urban city as well as offroad. Fire extinguishing can be tricky so make sure you throw the water with pressure and keep the direction of the water gun steady. Keep the firetruck emergency siren on and speed away.
