This new employee guide comes to you directly from the Far Corner Devs.   </p>\n<p>We here at *REDACTED* thank you for joining our family. You may have heard people refer to this job as:\r\n  </p>\n<p>- Monotonous\r\n  </p>\n<p>- Passion devouring\r\n  </p>\n<p>- A complete waste of shareholder funds\r\n    </p>\n<p>However we as your human resource department would like to assure you  that our employees have reported a massive 6.9% satisfaction rate...  that's up on last quarter!   </p>\n<p>Things can be stressful on your first day, so here's some tips to get you started:\r\n  </p>\n<p>- You can use the W,A,S,D keys to move.\r\n  </p>\n<p>- E to interact (Follow the signs!)\r\n  </p>\n<p>- Q and F will use your items\r\n  </p>\n<p>- The coffee machine takes some time to brew, so make sure to account for this on your (unpaid) breaks!\r\n    </p>\n<p>In order to help you stay at peak performance, you can find  *REDACTED* sanctioned medication across the floor... proven to help with  stress, now with minimal acid reflux!\r\n    </p>\n<p>Should you find contraband, we urge you NOT to consume this on the  job. We have no need for sluggish, carefree employee's in our work  force.\r\n    </p>\n<p>Finally, your fellow employees are your biggest strength. Sometimes a  chat is all you need! A social pick me up is good for you, but  sometimes they might just want someone to listen, or for them to vent  themselves; morally (and contractually) these people are also your  responsbility!   </p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy your long, satisfying, and tax deductable employment with us! <br/></p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Created By:<br/>Sean Gilbert - Design, Programing, Art, SFX<br/>Sam Kae - Design, Music, Play Testing<br/></p>\n<p>Entry for VimJam2<br/>Theme: On the Edge (i.e. Stressing Out)<br/>Requirement: Boss<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T09:21:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab9/ab96c6bc22353ae0d2c3e43bda25086c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["GingerNingerish"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
