Pick up asteroids with your spring to pull them around, and press space to release them. There are 4 springs to find in total. If you want to drop a spring, press P. Sometimes springs will grab asteroids on their own, making them harder to find. Look for asteroids on planets that are behaving oddly to find them. If an asteroid turns red that means that its orbiting a planet!</p><p>-</p><p>MADE BY THESE AWESOME PEOPLE</p><p>Justin Capcap - Planet Gravity Guru</p><p>Keana Almario - Asteroid Orbit Ambassador</p><p>Michael Arcadi - Spring Pull Professor</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d8/0d80ad71c2390df9672d966fa232da42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Arcadim", "CapSquared", "Kishi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
