Instead of giving up, we took a leap of faith and plunged into indie game development in June of 2020. <br/><br/>We\u2019re finally happy with the design, and believe that we have created the experience we wanted, and are proud to share the story of James and Mary with the RPG Maker and wider gaming community. <br/><br/>We hope that you will gain an insight into pain, loss, grief, addiction and what guilt can do to a person, and that you will never have to personally experience it.<br/>Just remember to keep the flame alive.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T02:52:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a9/4a9c04c0378fddfcb210328e24461eaa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RoundTable Games Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["RoundTable Games Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
