Thus, your gaming has become the main income source for food and luxus.<br/><br/>Within the VR world, you can craft enhanced tools and even build a shelter, so you can mine your stuff easier and won't be affected by animals or rain. People with low skills do also get food, but due to the fact that it's tasteless, it's not as rewarding as ingame created food. You won't starve when eating cheap food, but you also won't get the benefits from it.<br/>Those benefits do range frome health to stamina.<br/>Now it's time for you to hop into the utopian, gaming centered survivalist world of Nyx.<br/><br/>Have fun!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T05:26:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54e/54e37e24d29cdc710faeb088daf4add1.jpg", "website": "https://visionsbrewstudios.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Dennis M.
