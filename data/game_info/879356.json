{"id": 879356, "slug": "frozen-horizon", "name": "Frozen Horizon", "name_original": "Frozen Horizon", "description": "<p>In this party management game you manage a party of gnomes trying to repair an airship. You've crash landed on a frozen island in the middle of an ocean home to a gnome hungry Duke.</p>\r\nKnown Bugs\r\n<ul><li>There is a game blocking bug preventing you from picking up quest notes. It has been fixed and will be updated post Jam</li><li>There is an issue with the airship inspection action that will cause the game to crash.</li><li>When a gnome dies or is fired his inventory overwrites the inventory of the gnome that replaces them. </li><li>If all members of your party dies right after making a move, you  won't be able to move anymore (and path of the last move taken is  frozen on the screen)</li><li>\u00a0If a gnome is strong enough it can receive negative damage (feature?)</li></ul>\n<p>Right now the game is locked for editing as part of the review process for the 2022 lisp game jam. If you're not judging it for the jam and enjoyed the first minute / want to play a version with most of these fixed you can check out the release on github and play it using the love2d binary gitlab or at https://alexjgriffith.com/temp/frozen-horizon/<br/></p>\n<br/>Tips and Tricks\r\n<ul><li>Put your trophies on the Tavern Wall to attract more experienced gnomes</li><li>If your party is running low on health try and end your turn within the confines of a settlement. Preferably after finding an inn.</li><li>Don't sell misinformation! This will be critical in the later portions of the game as the Duke focuses his vision on you.</li><li>Fewer high level gnomes will perform better than many low level gnomes. Equipped gnomes perform even better.</li><li>Save your invigorating potions for your visits to dangerous places, like The Duke's Haunt or The Mage's Lookout. Beware, low level potions will last at most 3 days.</li><li>Stuck on where to go next, try rummaging around for a quest or buying one off of a gnome in the tavern.</li></ul>\n<p>Frozen Horizons is my submission to the 2022 Lisp Game Jam.
