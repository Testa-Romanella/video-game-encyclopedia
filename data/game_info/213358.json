Instead, you'll have to run straight into the enemies crossfire in an attempt to get them to shoot themselves! I know this sounds difficult but don't worry, you can slow down time! Use that to your advantage while in their crossfire.</p>\n<p>Your avatar moves towards your cursor. You cannot stop moving.<br/>Hold left mouse button to slow down time and let go to go back to normal speed.<br/>You slow-mo ability only lasts for a short while but recharges when you're not using it, so try to strategise when to use it.<br/>If you decide to fully deplete your ability however, it goes on cooldown mode and you can't use it again until it's fully recharged.<br/>Dead enemies drop little glowing orbs. Collect them for points and try to beat your highscore!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f84/f84e6d5cb5980191440fe8fd4e98986b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Seet"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
