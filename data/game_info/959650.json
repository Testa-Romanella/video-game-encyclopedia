I hope you enjoy this simple Match 3 game I've built for my Steam debut.<h3>Shift Rows or Columns, not Symbols</h3>  In RC Match 3, you shift an entire row or column of symbols at a time. This makes for a slightly different puzzle than others in the genre, as the symbols are constantly shifting around the board.<h3>Increasing Difficulty</h3>  As your score increases, more symbols will be added to the mix, making it more likely you'll reach a Game Over state. Can you learn to use the shifting rows to your advantage and set up future moves? The game tracks your personal high score so you can see how far you've come. How high can you go?<h3>Customize Your Theme!</h3><ul><li> 11 Backgrounds<br/></li><li> 4 Symbol Sets<br/></li><li> 4 Color Schemes for the \"Flat\" symbol set, including a colorblind-friendly palette</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-21T03:13:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/121/121653c95802b300b9ef35600cb49cb1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Half-Heard Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Half-Heard Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
