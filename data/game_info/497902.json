{"id": 497902, "slug": "spice-and-iron", "name": "Spice and Iron", "name_original": "Spice and Iron", "description": "<p><em>(A cooking deckbuilder I\u00a0was prototyping in 2018.\u00a0Many systems and interactions are simple or unfinished, so apologies if something doesn't work how you expect it to.)</em><br/></p>\n<p>Pick up ingredients from the local markets and cook up meals tailored to\u00a0 your customers! Ingredients have a variety of taste/texture attributes in addition to their filling amount and satisfaction amount. Customers have traits which affect their perception of various items. Try to maximize their satisfaction to get the biggest tips! The idea was for progression to be based on number of unique dishes crafted, to encourage creativity in cooking.</p>\n<p><strong>Good combos:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Smooth and crunchy.</li><li>Sweet and salty.</li><li>Dry and Fatty (Fatty is earned when a dish becomes \"Fried\" in the wok.)</li><li>Milky neutralizes Gamey.</li><li>Refreshing after Spicy foods have been eaten.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Generally bad traits (although some might like them):</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Gamey</li><li>Fishy</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>To start cooking, click on your food shop in the middle, and enter.</li><li>Ingredients can be place on the 3 appliances: wok (fries), grill (grills), and cutting board (slices).</li><li>In order to\u00a0 cook a dish, press the End Turn button. Some ingredients are best cooked over several turns such as meats.</li><li>Action points are only expended when you play a card. So, using spices, moving prepared ingredients is ok.</li><li>To play spices and ability cards, pull them onto the mat right in front of your cards. Spices can then be pulled from the spice tray in the bottom right.</li><li>If you are having trouble adding an ingredient to an appliance, it likely hasn't been prepared properly. For instance, only sliced ingredients can go together.</li><li>The customers have 3 phases with 3 turns each. They will be disappointed if you don't feed them within a phase.</li><li>If you run out of ingredients but the customer hasn't left yet, you should just spam \"end turn\" until they are done.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Issues:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>The day/night cycle doesn't do much right now. How it works is: whenever you enter a market or the food stall, the day progress by 1/3.</li><li>Adding lots of ingredients to a dish can cause some physics lag. This is especially true with spices like salt.</li><li>Some traits and descriptions might not much up perfectly, such as \"SmoothCrunchy\" which is the same as \"Mouthfeel\".</li><li>The region-based traits (ie Region Liker)\u00a0aren't fleshed out well, they were based around ingredients having regional traits, such as Sencha being Japanese.</li><li>The save/load feature more or less works, but it shifts the time of day.</li></ul>\n<p>I mostly discontinued it as I was unsatisfied with the core game loop after a year, and wanted to move on to try some new things. I think there is still some potential for fun here, especially with the theme, but I\u00a0haven't had time to revisit it.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T07:34:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3dd/3dd19e2c5cce3352fb016958c7e1ad3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["starmote"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
