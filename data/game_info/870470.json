Of course, opponents (e.g. S\u00eddhe) can take HP\u00a0from him, but when it runs out completely, our protagonist is returned to the gates of T\u00edr Na N\u00f3g\u00a0and you can continue his mission.</p>\n\n<p>If you defeat S\u00eddhe as the main enemy, banished from that area\u00a0will be, but not until the end of time, but only for a certain period of time.\u00a0If you run away, you will not meet S\u00eddhe on that screen\u00a0again, but as soon as you leave the area and return, S\u00eddhe will be there again,\u00a0in fact, he looks forward to the next fight, strengthened.</p>\n\n<p>You will always meet him during your quest, but you will find one in the game\u00a0map that will help you in which sections it appears\u00a0your enemy, so you can even outsmart him if you want.
