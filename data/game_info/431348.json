Gather the feathers but nothing happens.</p>\n<p>\"young Pheonix will have to prove its weight in this harsh world, while its parent sleeps. If you get cold, you can hatch again stepping in magma. After all: \"Every end is a new beginning\" (see? I said the thing)</p>\n<p>I wish I had more time with this, but it was a  great experience!</p>\n<p>Used 4 colour pallet to draw all my pixels, using Aseprite. https://www.aseprite.org/<br/></p>\n<p>For music it was my first time with Bosca Ceoil, Great fun! https://boscaceoil.net/ (spend at least 4 minutes so you can listen to the whole tune)<br/></p>\n<p>tried to \"Wake a Widden Wecret Woor\" (W is the hint in case you missed it)<br/></p>\n<p>Probably you can still transform using \"K\" or \"Space\"nas I was still testing while I run out of time.
