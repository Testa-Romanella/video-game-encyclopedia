And will keep reviving you back to their crazy tower of death until you reach the top floor and get rid of them, allowing you to finally be free...<br />\nReaching the top to challenge the Necromancer is no easy feat, the pathways are narrow and full of traps: chainsaws, spikes, cannons, flamethrowers... On top of that, the floor behind you will start exploding if you take too long!<br />\nCan you stop this madness?<br />\nOr will you give up?<br />\nGame Features</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The main game consists of 5 areas of 4 floors each that you have to complete without getting hit a single time otherwise you will be revived at the last checkpoint.<br />\nProcedural Levels: Every floor is different!<br />\nUp,Down,Left,Right!: Simple to pick up but hard to master<br />\nUp to 4 players: Cooperate! Only one needs to complete the floor<br />\nVersus mode: Or compete! Let&#39;s see who completes the floor first<br />\nEndless mode: How high can you climb without dying?<br />\nCustomizable difficulty: Settings to make the game easier, harder or just for fun<br />\n+30 characters: \u200bLots of characters to choose from! They do not bring any gameplay advantage - it&#39;s all about taking your favorite skeleton into the tower.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-09T02:30:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed8/ed85de32bde5cc4b824c517f941e1ff8.jpg", "website": "http://bolhut.com/You-Died-But-A-Necromancer-Revived-You/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 215, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["BolHut"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BolHut"], "esrb_rating": null}
