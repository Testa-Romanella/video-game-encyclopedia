Many horrors were lived in that house, and the smell of the dead lurks everywhere.<br/>When the two children were in the doors of the mansion, a terrible spawn attacked them. One of the children was captured. Your task is to find your friend and go away.<br/>To accomplish this task, you will have to explore the house. Many doors will be closed, and you will need to find keys.\u00a0<br/>There are also some notes that will explain a bit what happened in the mansion. But beware, for the terrible deadly spawn is inside, and if you are caught, you and your friend will experience the fatal doom.</p>\r\nThe Terror Mansion\r\n<p>This game is inspired in the level Terror Mansion of my Unity game called My Home. The structure of the house is exactly the same. The same doors that are opened there, are the ones that will be able to get opened here, but for many of them you will need to find keys.</p>\n<p>This game has many different endings, a total of six. To get the perfect ending, you have to rescue your friend and go away without getting caught a single time by the terrible monster. Every time the monster takes you, it will determine the different ending. The fatal ending happens if the monster takes you five times.</p>\n\n\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Special mention to Com_sho, SchwarzeNacht,\u00a0Sithjester, Kadokawa, and Cocoparisienne</p>\n<p>Sound effects are from freesoundeffects.com</p>\n<p>Thanks to Blizzard for the Combat System, and<br/>SephirothSpawn for the Lantern Script</p>\r\nBuy the Soundtrack", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T15:42:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b2/6b2f248e75c73d363435a38bbcb23d49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anamura"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
