Initially, the project was started for a game jam, however, due to time constraints, it was never completed. To nobody's surprise, game development is really hard, and so is burnout.\u00a0Now though, we finally decided to release a short playable demo to showcase the fruits of our efforts. The finished version of Poppycock will feature various nonsensical games which you can pick up and play for short periods. Although that day may not come for a while, we hope that everyone will get to experience our vision for this game.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nControls\r\nFor PC, use the Arrow Keys and Z<br/>For Mobile, use the A button to mash and the B button to jump.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\nFelpies -\u00a0Lead Programmer, Director, and Spritework.<br/>Amber\u00a0- Cover Artist, Character Designer, and Spritework.<br/>https://twitter.com/sphyrnaa<br/>Bee\u00a0- Spritework\r\n\r\nAfterword\r\nIf you enjoy Poppycock and are excited to see where our project goes, we would really appreciate it if you'd give us a good review and share our game with your friends. Also consider following my Twitter as linked above, where I will be posting updates and anything related to the game.\u00a0It really goes a long way, and it helps our game be discovered by more people. Thank you so much for playing.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T08:14:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/035/035d1f1baff64f9528308bd1cae597e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["felpies", "umiso"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
