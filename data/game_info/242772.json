{"id": 242772, "slug": "music-zoo", "name": "Music Zoo", "name_original": "Music Zoo", "description": "<p>Music zoo is, uh, a tech demo about singing animals, made for Music Game Jam 2018.</p>\n<p>I hoped I would have time to implement some actual gameplay, but some IRL stuff got in the way. My list of goals for the project may also have been a bit ambitious for a 15 day jam.</p>\n<p>At any rate, I'm quite happy with a few things about this and I'll tell you all about it.</p>\r\nThe animal synthesizer\r\n<p>Each animal in the game has a single sample, and can pitch-bend notes from that in 2D positional audio. The samples are simple mouth-sounds with a known frequency.</p>\n<p>I intend the core gameplay to revolve around the dynamic arrangement of a core melody and the vocal/rhythmic limitations of animals. For now, they all just sing notes exactly as they are on the midi track. They sound pretty much like I hoped. :)<br/></p>\n<p>Many thanks to @arlez80 for making the awesome Godot Midi Player asset, which does the heavy lifting of reading midi files.</p>\r\nMade with Blender\r\n<p>I got quite excited with the reveal of the new Grease Pencil on Blender 2.8, so I did all of the game's graphics with a nightly build.</p>\n<p>There was jank at times, I admit, but generally it was pretty pleasant to work with. I can totally see it having a place in my 2D graphics pipeline.</p>\r\nFuture stuff\r\n<p>I'm far from done with this game. I could probably have reached having some gameplay if I worked on greyboxes, but hey, I wanted to fool around with Grease pencil, no regrets.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, most of the stuff I started this project for lies ahead. It looks something like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Animal fumbles and mistakes</li>\n<li>Teach godot MUSICAL THEORY!</li>\n<li>Musical arrangement gameplay</li>\n<li>Animal-collecting gameplay</li>\n<li>Procedural pentatonic melodies</li>\n<li>Dynamic accompaniament</li>\n<li>Percussive foliage</li>\n<li>a few more animals</li>\n<li>More absurdist comedy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ok, yeah, that's a lot. Oh well, next jam I'll have a smaller idea (and work faster!).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/feb/feb00be5f73d48030ab43c31196b13f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["BadAlchemy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
