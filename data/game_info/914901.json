Death, an ancient Kraken leviathan haunts your every move in this tense underwater horror survival game. Fight to survive using powerful weapons and upgrades as you explore a beautiful yet treacherous underwater world.</p>\n<h1>Gameplay</h1>\n<p>Death in the Water 2 at its core is a wave-based shooter but combines elements of terrifying horror and tension with heart-pounding adrenalin-fueled action.<br />\nEach dive (wave) typically starts off with elements of exploration where the pace is a bit slower and gives you a chance to find treasure, and other collectibles as well as find your bearings. During this phase, the tension builds as you investigate ruins, wrecks, and reefs. Sharks and creatures are passive and may not always attack you unless provoked, much like the behavior of real sharks.</p>\n<p>At any stage during the dive Death (the Kraken) will launch a mind-control attack on all creatures and a feeding frenzy will kick off with you being the primary target. You will need to survive and complete the dive objective before you move on to the next wave. As you progress to the next dive the difficulty ramps up and things get even more frantic. The combination of tension and action makes it incredibly addictive as you explore the open world map.</p>\n<p>Will you escape the clutches of the Kraken, or will you join the endless ranks of the drowned?<br />\nThis is a game about facing your fears head on and conquering the challenges that stand in your way.
