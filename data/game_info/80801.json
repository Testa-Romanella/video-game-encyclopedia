After attending for a good decade, it's taught me so much. It's an eye-opening experience of cutting-edge art, technology and cultural experimentation!<br/><br/>Burning Man encourages everyone to participate fully in the event, for a maximal experience. However, I witnessed that people sometimes needed a helping idea to get them started. Thus I created a Mission Me Machine and brought it back to Burning Man with me.<br/><br/>The Mission Me Machine is an interactive art sculpture that dispenses MISSIONS for people to take-on. It was designed to promote playful social contact, self-discovery, and artistic adventure! The Mission Me Machine has since travelled to a variety of art festivals along the west coast. Wherever it goes, it delights people by giving them fun and eclectic quests to accomplish!<br/><br/>So I decided it was time to create a digital version of the Mission Me Machine, so that everyone with a mobile phone could play and be inspired in their everyday life!<br/><br/>That's the origin story of this strange and wonderful app Mission Me!<br/><br/>Hope you like it :)<br/><br/>Art by digital visionary painter Mugwort. <br/>Music by sonic alchemists YAIMA.<br/>App created by Sillysoft Games.<br/><br/>Level up your life!  <br/><br/>\"Mission Me made me do it\"", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:23:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/906/906fd7b6b91370babfb196262d0d188b.jpg", "website": "https://missionmeapp.com/presskit/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Sillysoft Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Family"], "publishers": ["Sillysoft Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
