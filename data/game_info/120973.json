When combos are successfully performed, the executing player pushes the other one back. Once a player is pushed to the edge of the fighting-platform, the attacking player gets the opportunity to perform a hard (long) finisher-combo. If succeeded, the player wins. Otherwise, the other player can counter with a slightly easier (shorter) combo to turn the tide and get back into the game.</p>\n\n\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>The game supports up to two players</li><li>Keyboard and Gamepad (X Box) inputs can be used</li><li>You can fight against an CPU (or even let two CPUs fight against each other)</li></ul>\n\n<strong>Technical Details</strong>\n<ul><li>The game was made in Unity 2D</li><li>All sounds and graphics were made by ourselves</li></ul>\n\n<strong>What we would have added or changed if there was more time</strong>\n<ul><li>More playable characters and a character-selection screen</li><li>Multiple stages</li><li>Difficulty settings for NPC players</li><li>Special effects (e.g. camera shakes)</li><li>More animations for attacks (currently only one per character)</li><li>Background music and UI sounds</li><li>Rework some sounds in general</li><li>\u2026</li></ul>\n\n\n<strong>! ! !
