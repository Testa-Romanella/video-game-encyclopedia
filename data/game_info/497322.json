You have 10 seconds to collect as much corn as you can, press 'space' to collect the corn.</p>\n<p>This game is a soft reflection of how I feel when I code, that no matter how much I try nothing I do is every enough, so I feel the need to keep repeating the same actions again and again until I eventually burnout. It is also a silly game that is part of my ongoing corn lore series. Hope you enjoyed :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T05:24:40", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["rp2971"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
