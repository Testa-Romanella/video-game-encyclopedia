The story takes place in a sci-fi universe and the player must <strong>free hostages</strong> in a police station full of <strong>androids</strong>.</p>\n<p>I'm sorry for the main menu and the intro in french, yet i translated the in game text for our english friends !</p>\n<p>This was my first year project as a student. It is coded on Phaser/Javascript and was my first programing experience\u00a0so please excuse me if it is a bit laggy.</p>\n<p>Hope you'll have fun,</p>\n<p>Sacha Y.</p>\n\r\nPOST MORTEM\r\n<p>I was a big fan of Dishonored so i thought my first game should have a similar system mixing stealth and brutal approach. Now i realise that i should have focus my energy on one specific way of playing.</p>\n<p>The main problem of the game is the controls, i never found a way of mixing the down input with crouching (because i wanted the player to be able to crouch on ladder... yeah i know its weird). So the boss becomes pretty difficult since the player isn't much challenged on lasers before.</p>\n<p>The second problem is the tutorials, very few people were able to pass the stealth tutorial in less than 2\u00a0minutes.</p>\n<p>Plus some minors issue like :</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Number of bullet useless</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Too much text</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Useless bonus</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Player doesn't understand that his step make noises</p>\n<p>Looking back, I think the project was way too big for me to handle and that can be see by the lack of graphisms in the late zone. But overall i am pretty satisfied with the result since it allowed me to learn a lot by experimenting. I think the graphics are pretty satisfying and that the game could be very cool if i rework it one day in the futur.</p>\n\n<p>My Page :\u00a0here</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-17T03:38:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff5/ff51a948bff568b9adad676c5534debd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SachaY"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
