Real-life Macaroon has seen off cats and kills blankets on a regular basis.</li><li>The fox gets faster and the red kite will fly over as you cover more levels so choose which level you start from wisely if you're aiming for Iron Bun.</li><li>Manipulate the fox, especially using the rabbit holes, to make your life easier.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T05:25:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb5/fb5d342a1fa25ff0fff9c0f871dc13ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["drake_blue"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
