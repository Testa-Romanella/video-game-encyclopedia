The game was ImPlayr this first person football game where you would play in a team and try to win the premier league, which wasn't named premier league because of copyright I'm pretty sure. The game had this cutscenes in a real life environment and then had gameplay in trainings and games.</p>\n<p>The objective of my game would basically be the same thing but whithout the cutscenes part and all of that stuff. If you're interested in looking at the ImPlayr game itself here is a link to a youtube video for you to check it out!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The controls of the game are pretty simple:</p>\n<ul><li>LMB (Left Mouse Button) -\u00a0shoot the ball (the more you hold it the more power it has);</li><li>R - reset the ball randomly (a \"square\" for the random positions\u00a0can be changed in the settings);</li><li>W - reset the ball (can be changed in the settings as well to wherever you'd like);</li><li>Q - reset the ball to the penalty spot;</li></ul>\n<p>Those are the basic controls. You can also change some stuff in the settings which to open is the same as all other games ESC (Escape button). Things you can change in the settings for now:</p>\n<ul><li>Time of the day - set night/day time;</li><li>Goalkeeper - enable/disable goalkeeper;</li><li>Trail of the ball - enable/disable a small trail in the ball</li></ul>\n<p>I have also added some other stadiums but I haven't gone around to make it so you can change to them. Also the ball has a curve mechanic which is pretty neat to play around with. The goalkeeper isn't perfect since it's my first time trying to make one (it took a long time to make that one so please don't rely too much on it it's a really REALLY early version :/ )</p>\n<p>Also I'm using some assets from the asset store for fps/otimization tracking so don't mind that for now, again it's just a demo of the game :).</p>\n<p>Anyway hope you guys can give me some feedback on the game and I'll try to keep working on it whenever I can. Thank you for downloading if you do anyway!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T11:47:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95b/95b79de21e6424dc70c9e7b53ab0868a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Quim201"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
