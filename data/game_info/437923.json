{"id": 437923, "slug": "six-feet-away", "name": "Six Feet Away", "name_original": "Six Feet Away", "description": "<p>Six feet away, not six feet under; is an action survival game which requires players to prevent themselves from becoming infected with a mutating virus for as long as possible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You as the player, are tasked with your own health and safety.\u00a0 Avoid other spawned individuals who are infected (the rate of spawn increases overtime) and try to remain healthy by running away from them.</p>\n<p>Players are equipped with tools such as a sanitizer, a cleaning spray and a broom (to prevent infected individuals from getting too close). Use them sparingly and to escape from sticky situations.</p>\n<p>Much like in the world\u2019s current fight against the SARS-COVID-2 virus, resources available are limited. There are not enough refills or masks to make you perpetually in-vulnerable. As a strategy avoid the crowds which spawn and come close to you.</p>\n<p>The game\u2019s maps are procedurally generated and each playthrough and level is guaranteed to be unique.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The best strategy is to stay six feet away!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stay home and stay safe! <br/></p>\n\n<p>WHO website : https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus <br/></p>\n<p>Music : Algorithms, Podington Bear, soundofpicture.com, licensed under creative commons</p>\n<p>Sounds by Straget, Unfa, Rombat, Jimmy Fisher, Lizane Jorden, Digest Sound, Reasanka, hargisssound ; licensed under creative commons</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T05:34:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/883/883429e885053b7709d34e46eb7ea46e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["rangeet"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
