One entrant, Wilhelmina the witch, has dreamed of winning this competition since she was a little spellcaster and now has her chance to make her dream a reality. Wilhelmina and her zombie friend Zack travel the world, collecting ingredients for an ultimate brew that will earn Wilhelmina the coveted title of Creepiest Creature. Along the way the clumsy witch and her aloof friend encounter a variety of colourful characters who react to her wacky personality in various ways such as humans who treat her like a queen, vampires who will stop at nothing to prevent Wilhelmina from winning the competition and a bogeyman who perhaps overestimates his chances.
