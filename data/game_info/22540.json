Following the ethos of mimicking a Relic Entertainment expansion pack, Eastern Front has succeeded in adding a full Soviet faction packed with unique and exciting units to the existing armie as well as the rugged Ostheer - a unique new Axis faction which was designed from the ground up to counter the Soviets - a feat never before achieved in the Company of Heroes world.<br />\nWe are constantly working to improve Eastern Front; our dedicated and experienced development team has worked on the mod for seven years, and we don&#39;t intend to stop yet.
