My goal was for the main goal of this tutorial to be clear like in the original game. This is not a complete remake of the original. I took story, art and mechanic\u00a0liberties to shape this game to the Bitsy engine. I would love to hear feedback and I hope you enjoy playing!</p><p>CONTROLS:</p><p>W - Up</p><p>A - Left</p><p>S - Down</p><p>D - Right</p><p>*Any button to continue dialogue*</p><p>TABLET/MOBILE:</p><p>Swipe to move</p><p>Click to continue dialogue\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T11:01:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da1/da1727d3133df4fab426bd42996e36af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TaraByte_tm"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
