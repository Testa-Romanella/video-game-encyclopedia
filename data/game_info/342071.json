The reason why i release this game is simply to have a first game released and since game developing is my passion i hope that someone else can have a bit of fun as well.\u00a0Since i'm terrible when it comes to art, all the assets used are from the free portion of the unity asset store, or sometimes sadly the default assets. I hope that there are no more major (or minor) bugs in the game, but if any are found please comment and i will try to fix them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To anyone downloading this game and giving it a try, thank you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-19T04:21:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ed/8ed9056b77408abaeba24a032efe96ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NotsoblackReaper"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
