The procedurally generated levels increase in Difficulty and size with each level you clear.\u00a0 The enemies you meet will also vary based on your progression. <br/><br/>While this is a work in progress hobby project, the game has proper menus and user interface. All assets are hand made, no asset flipping. However some assets are still placeholder.<br/></p>\n<p>This game is far from finished so Feedback, comments, criticism and ideas are all greatly appreciated. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-27T04:08:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2d/e2d632eb0d34304a967cfb9a968fbe40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Masonmason22"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
