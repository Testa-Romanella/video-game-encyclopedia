It was initially developed within less than 48 during the\u00a0<em>Global Game Jam</em>. There are three teams: RED, GREEN and BLUE. Every player has a spray gun, filled with the color of her or his team. The goal is to spray other players. A player who has been sprayed, changes the team membership to whatever color was sprayed. The game ends when all players are in the same team. That team is the winner team. Since in the end, everyone is in that team, everyone is the winner.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c47/c47c335af01f014eac6a404dd7ffd837.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["cpfr", "ojlr"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
