The controls are as follows - W A S D for basic movement, left click to fire weapon and finally the mouse can be used to look around.</p>\n<p>Finally, the game was made in UE4 in around 4 hours and the music used was all royalty free. Due to the short time limit I decided to stick to the base geometry in order to get the core game's idea across and so no asset packs were used.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T07:26:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9a/c9ab2da91bb37af093c6f7c78f27cc89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stay Retro"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
