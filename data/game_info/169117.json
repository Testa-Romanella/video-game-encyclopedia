It is currently in very early development, so if you find any bug, please send me a message! Squared is designed to have a configurable difficulty, in an attempt to be enjoyed by players of all skill levels.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe goal of the game is to make clusters of the same color as large as possible. Every few seconds, a block drops from the sky on a random column, and you can shift blocks on a row left and right. Mind that if a block has no support underneath it, it will fall down! Each block will display its score, and on the left you can see the total score you achieved.</p><p>\r\n\tControls:\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tescape: return/quit\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tleftarrow: move row left\r\n</p><p>\r\n\trightarrow: move row right\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tuparrow: move selector up\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tdownarrow: move selector down\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tleft control (standalone) / space (web html5) : drop square prematurely\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tNote: to use the source code, you need the unofficial build from the 26th of october from http://fixnum.org/godot/.
