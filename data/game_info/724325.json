{"id": 724325, "slug": "lemmings-remake", "name": "Lemmings Remake", "name_original": "Lemmings Remake", "description": "<p>If you have played Lemmings before, this game will feel similar, but not the same.</p>\n<p>Play with the \"literally\" sandbox levels and try to solve puzzles on each level to bring the Gnomes to safety.</p><p>There is also a creative Tinker mode where you can try your own concepts or just play with the elements and have fun.</p>\n<p>A fun little Lemmings-esque granular physics based puzzle game in which you mould and shape the landscape using a variety of fluid particle-based materials such as water, lava and sand to help your band of gnomes reach the exit on one piece.</p>\n<p>Your little gnomes walk mindlessly forwards oblivious of any hazards as in Lemmings. It\u2019s up to you to shape the landscape to keep them away from peril and get them to the exit. You do this by hoovering up granules of materials such as dirt, sand, water, lava and obsidian and then dumping them on other areas. Each of these materials has it\u2019s own physical properties and can even cause reactions with other materials (lava + water = steam + obsidian).</p>\n<p>As you progress the puzzles get trickier and there are even boss fights to contend with. It\u2019s great fun sucking up and dumping the various types of materials as it gives the game a wonderfully tactile feeling and the granular physics are a joy to see in motion. It\u2019s like playing around with a giant sandpit, filled with gnomes, spikes and spiders. Sure, spikes and spiders aren\u2019t particularly pleasant, but if you dump enough sand on them they\u2019ll surely go away!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T06:28:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/410/410a5bf934d94c943f57d7c2ca6c889a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Arcade Game Studio"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
