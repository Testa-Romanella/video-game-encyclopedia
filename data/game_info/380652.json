This language made it simple for enthusiasts to create their own computer games. Programs were often distributed as code listings in the community-run magazine VIPER.</p>\n<p>In 1995, Tiger Toys released a physical game toy called Lights Out. \u00a0This was played on a 5x5 grid, and the lights did not \"wrap around\" the edges as it does in this version -- ie. the light in the top left corner only toggled itself, the light below it and the light to the right of it.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Several variations of this game were released over the years, including Mini Lights Out, the version in this game. \u00a0The fact that the lights wrap around in this version means that all patterns are solvable, which was not the case for the original Lights Out.\u00a0 This allows for a procedurally generated sequence of patterns, so you can have nearly endless games to play. \u00a0Well, 65,535 of them at least.\r\n</p>\n<p>In 2014, John Earnest created Octo, an IDE, emulator and high-level assembly language that made it easy to make CHIP-8 games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T09:36:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dab/dabe20afca835e6d7529cc8b9a958abe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tobias V.
