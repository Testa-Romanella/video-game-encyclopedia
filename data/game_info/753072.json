All assets\u00a0solo made within the timeframe. As often is the case, it turned out different than what I had imagined but I'm still pleased with how much I managed to get done within the timeframe (despite catching covid in the last few days).<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>I consider the challenge to be a succes in that I created a game with a start and end that has some core roguelike elements, though I feel I failed in re-creating the open-ended playstyle / player expression</em><em> possible in a good roguelike.<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>The game was made in godot which alongside 3D game programming I'm quite new to, though having a blast exploring it. Many sounds were placeholders that never got replaced, all sound effects + music were made on a modular synthesizer (Mutable Instruments Rings + Beads only), all models were done with primitive geometry inside the godot editor.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T09:55:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/991/991e5eb162fb80cd38a6b3c1d7a46d1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Supermuch"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
