The Department of Control is an agency of the United \n      Nations that acquired secret technology, which was hidden from the \n      public for decades. Opposing it is the resistance, composed of former \n      military members that refused to join the Department. Marco is one of \n      them, and the game tells his story. We join Marco as he is deployed on a \n      mission to destroy scrambler devices placed around the city. While \n      creating this game we wanted to reflect the realism of urban warfare, \n      therefore most of the time Marco takes cover behind walls and other \n      obstacles. Make sure you've defeated all your enemies before trying to \n      access the next post.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ee/6eecd3201f7426a14fabcd0c2b48a2d1.jpg", "website": "http://www.calaris.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 348, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["CALARIS"], "esrb_rating": null}
