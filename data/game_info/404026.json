One of the core issues I described was the implementation of analogue art and art styles in games, this is why I decided to create a game with art assets that would fit this criteria. I decided to go with art made of watercolor since it is the analogue art I am interested in, and I already had the supplies. I also made sure to include the philosophical aspect as well by choosing a scenario in which the art could transmit a powerful message.<br/></p>\n<p>In the end I came up with a very subjective and personal scenario that represents my experience with anxiety.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For me doing something for the first time is always a challenge. It doesn\u2019t matter what it is. An example would be that I get very nervous if I have to knock on someone's door that I don't know. In my head I have the weirdest scenarios of things that could happen. What if I embarrass myself, or what if the person is not there; something like that. My heart starts pounding and in the worst case I start hyperventilating. Other situations like that would be calling a delivery service or visiting a new unknown doctor.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t think people can't imagine what these situations are like for me. This is why I created this scenario. The task is easy and abstract enough for people to not know what is going to happen. I avoided recreating a situation because I think people might not understand what I am trying to say. The scenario must be something they experience for the first time. Eventually if I relive situations more than once I do get used to them too, something like giving a presentation. By now I have no problem giving presentations because I have done it a thousand times. Or knocking on the door of a professor, I've experienced this enough now. This is why I decided to create this abstract scene, where the atmosphere represents my feeling of anxiety. The art assets itself are not frightening at all. In fact, I designed them to look peaceful and inviting to underline that the situation itself is not frightening at all.</p><p>Credits:</p><p>Game Art and Design by Karolin Kr\u00fcger</p><p>Music by TeknoAXE</p><p>\u00a0tracks I used:\u00a0Fields of the lost;\u00a0Cello Zen;\u00a0The Cold of the Night</p><p>Thanks to J\u00f6rk Sroka for helping me with the code.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-13T02:44:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b82/b820e2bfc3c078331aeb390e904a0e5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Karo"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
