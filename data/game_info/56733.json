To cater to older players who had outgrown Reader Rabbit, 1998 saw the release of the first title in a new spin-off series entitled The ClueFinders, for third grade through sixth grade.</p>\n<p>Generally, the games in the series taught language arts, featuring a variety of simple games designed to teach schoolchildren basic reading and spelling skills. Originally, the title character's name was changed to reflect a change in subject, as with Math Rabbit and Writer Rabbit, but it was eventually decided to call the main character \"Reader Rabbit\", and feature his name in all titles regardless of the subject area covered by a particular game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f87/f878eeccba6c90775cd3905b41bc024a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 193, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "PC", "Apple II", "Atari 8-bit", "Classic Macintosh"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["The Learning Company", "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt"], "esrb_rating": null}
