There is other stuff too, like catching gems to unlock silly characters and extra boats to display them. <br/><br/>I designed this game to be challenging at first, once you pick up the wall jumping mechanic you should be able to clear obstacles more easily and anticipate how to position your character to better catch the falling gems.  There are currently 10 obstacles, some with variations, that are selected at random and repeat as you ascend the cliff.  I got a bit carried away designing some of the characters and I think I may give some their own spin off games in the future!<br/><br/>I really appreciate feedback and plan to update this game, so let me know what you would like to see or if you spot any bugs! <br/><br/>Thank you for your interest, I hope you enjoy playing Wall Jump Stuff as much as I enjoyed making it! -  Paul Chettle, Fizzy Vortex Games<br/><br/>Trailer Music: Onwards! by Kevin Mueller find his awesome music on Newgrounds<br/><br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>- Click the mouse or tap space to jump from wall to wall<br/>- Jump from obstacles too!<br/>- Clear the obstacles and smash the crystal beams above<br/>- Try to catch the gems that break out from the crystal beams<br/>- Unlock characters with gems<br/>- Chase your top score!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T06:18:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d09/d096fca4f1c14f66184534c2cc355f9f.jpg", "website": "http://www.fizzyvortex.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fizzy Vortex Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fizzy Vortex Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
