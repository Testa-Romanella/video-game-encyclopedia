The screenshots shown above more accurately show the current enhanced graphical state of the game</strong><br/><br/><strong>Little Hats</strong> is an open-world survival game mixed with RPG elements, in which you play as a Gnome! Set in a handcrafted fairy tale world inspired by dutch culture and folklore. You will have to survive, craft, build, and explore, to discover why the gods sent you down to the world. To do this you will first have to find a way to the lowlands while avoiding all kinds of danger along the way. Or enable <strong>Passive Mode for young players</strong>, which will disable all monsters and scary creatures.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Future Updates, and Early Access</strong><br/>Most of the game right now takes place in a magical forest called Steynwoud, but the goal is to eventually add an even larger part to the world called the lowlands (where the story will continue), an area completely based on the Netherlands, with fantasy versions of <strong>cities such as Amsterdam and Utrecht, and villages such as Volendam.</strong> This part of the world will also have winter with snow in certain areas, and summer in other areas with lush green fields and small forests. If all goes accordingly I will also try to add a <strong>co-op mode</strong> at some point in the future. This GIF shows some of what is currently in development.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Explore a Fairy Tale World</strong><br/>Visit the gnome cities to buy or trade items and objects with your fellow gnomes. Explore a diverse forest with many different types of terrain, and many animals. Become enchanted by the beautiful fairies, and sneak your way through big human towns and villages. Talk to the humans, gnomes, and other creatures to find out the secrets and history of Steynwoud. But most importantly, stay clear of any and all trolls! <br/><br/><br/><strong>Gathering, Crafting, Building</strong><br/>Live fully off the land by gathering resources and crafting everything yourself, or make some coins and buy a workbench in one of the gnome shops, the choice is yours! Build your house brick by brick, or plank by plank, for maximum originality in your building. Build your house faster and more traditionally by placing an entire wall at once, or do both, it's all up to you! <br/><br/><br/><strong>Inspiration for Little Hats</strong><br/>The game is primarily inspired by dutch artists Anton Pieck, and his drawings which often depicted old nostalgic scenes from the Netherlands, and also scenes from fairy tales/folklore. On top of that, I have drawn inspiration from various other artists such as Rien Poortvliet, Arthur Rackham, and many other (mainly) dutch artists and pieces of folklore, or nostalgic scenes from my childhood growing up in the Netherlands.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T18:07:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1a/f1a21e317e964a73ccfe8f8a0e19981f.jpg", "website": "https://littlehatsgame.carrd.co/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 390, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tim Venekamp"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Tim Venekamp"], "esrb_rating": null}
