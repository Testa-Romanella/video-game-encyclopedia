Probably because it had the greatest death scream in videogames history.\u00a0 Long story short, i was inspired enough\u00a0to make a video of my own.\u00a0 While i was thinking, youtube's autoplay started playing one of Philip's game development videos. And yes, in that video, he was talking about the development of Deragon Eremine, the original one. Clearly, it was inspired by Deus Ex, so i though, maybe i'll make a video, or mod the game with those sounds replaced, so i could record the video? But then, i discovered what the game itself was quite difficult. Recoring a video with successful run would prove to be problematic.</em></p>\n<p><em>So instead, i chose to remake this game from scratch in a few days.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c45/c45dd112614b39a8ac53e3c14529ab59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Phirenor"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
