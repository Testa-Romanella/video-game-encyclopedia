{"id": 831220, "slug": "titans-tribute", "name": "Titan's Tribute", "name_original": "Titan's Tribute", "description": "\n<p>The goal of our game is pretty straightforward: You customize your titan\u2019s ability set to your own liking to develop winning strategies to dominate your enemy and claim victory.\r\n  <br/>Titan\u2019s Tribute is a 1v1 PvP arena fighting game which is played locally on a split screen. Players can choose between both playing with a controller, or 1 with a controller and the other with the keyboard and mouse. When creating our game we wanted to focus on having fast paced combat, and most importantly replayability.<br/></p>\n<p>This is why we chose for ability customization instead of a \u201cpick your character / hero\u201d mechanic. In Titan\u2019s Tribute you have 4 customizable limbs, the core/torso, your left and your right arm, and your legs. Each ability is assigned to an element, causing your titan to visually change upon choosing a certain elemental ability. But the most important part of this customization is the fact that players can really build their own unique play-style. You could for example go for a long-ranged \u201csniper\u201d like build to try and defeat your opponents from far away, or go for a more mobility based build to get in close range deal massive damage. For me personally, I like to have a mid-range build focused on map-control and high burst-damage.<br/></p>\n<p>All of this customization eventually happens in an immersive, multi-level fighting pit where players may use their unique ability-set to their heart\u2019s content. The battle arena has engaging and detailed stylized graphics that make the fights all the more epic.</p>\n<p>Our game isn\u2019t really directed towards a casual gamer, instead we focused on a niche group of hardcore players that like fighting games. Titan\u2019s tribute wants to appeal to those players who want to be the best and those want to show their mastery of the game.<br/></p>\n<p>We\u2019d love to add more game modes, like a 2v2 and a 4 player free-for-all. But to fit all of this on 1 screen would probably be a bit too much, which is why we would love to add online multiplayer so everyone can enjoy the game from their own HD-screen.<br/> Furthermore we would like to add a training grounds where you can test and perfect your favorite build on some dummies / AI characters. Next up would be buffs and environmental hazards, to give our players more even encouragement to move around the map, and would allow us to expand the amount of arena designs and layouts. And last but not least, we would like to add more elements and abilities to customize your character, and integrate them deeper into the fight with elemental reactions, pushing the customizability even higher and giving our players even more ownership on their experience.</p><p><strong>Prototype Demo:<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Finished Project:</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T14:53:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/586/586fc54dff9f0b2b4b388fca147c299f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 279, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PRonningen"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
