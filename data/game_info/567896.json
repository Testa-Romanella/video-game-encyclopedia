{"id": 567896, "slug": "battle-of-ages", "name": "Battle of Ages", "name_original": "Battle of Ages", "description": "<p><strong>Battle of Ages Rx</strong> is a <em>prototype-ish\u00a0</em>low-poly strategy game inspired by games like <em>Age of War</em> where the player must destroy the enemy's main base. To do so, both the player and AI train soldiers who will fight each other until reaching one side. In BoA Rx you train and upgrade units, to do that you need resources, you can get these from certain buildings (depending on the faction), and to get more, you must upgrade and research other\u00a0stuff. Researching, training and upgrading, all require time, and buildings can only perform <em>one of these actions at a time</em>.</p>\n\n\n<p>As of now, the Roman Empire is the only available faction, and it's also <strong>cut-in-half in terms of content</strong> (literally, despite having models for the Lv 3 buildings, I've completed only the first 2, the next thing to do would be to expand on this). After the Roman one, I'd like to introduce the <strong>Japanese</strong> (based somehow in Oda's Clan), a <strong>WW USA</strong> faction, and a <strong>WW2 German</strong> one too. BoA is not a game settled in a specific period of time, instead, it takes an approach more similar to what some Civ games do, by introducing <strong>multiple factions from multiple eras</strong>. These will all be played\u00a0in a balanced way obviously, you can think of it as\u00a0in <em>\"one legion of Romans, equals one military soldier alone\"</em> for example.</p>\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent Features:\r\n<ul><li>Experimental Easy and Hard difficulty (Still, really basic AI just to test things out, it will train units and upgrade things on the go, easiest one takes more \"time to think what to do\")</li><li>Unit &amp; Building upgrading system: I love management and strategy games where you can upgrade things, and then see the results visually.</li><li>Only one faction (\"Roman Empire\") and one testing level. Decided to not use terrain in Unity and just use my models instead to preserve a more low poly and modular-like approach. I'm considering changing this rather than expand on it hm</li><li>Unique faction mechanics, looks, units/buildings and upgrades: \u00a0Factions feature unique units each one, unique buildings, unique layout, unique types of resources and unique ways to progress. From many weak units training fast, to stronger and bigger ones, from a focus into long-range to one into close combat, from low population limit to large armies of multiple soldiers, from a faction with 3 buildings and 5 resources to one with 6 buildings and 2 resources. I want every faction to look and feel\u00a0different.</li></ul>\n\r\nSome of the planned Features:\r\n<ul><li>Multiplayer</li><li>Localization (starting with Spanish, which is my main native language rather than English, which is the base language for the game btw)</li><li>More factions (obviously)</li><li>New mechanics, rebalanced and expanded old ones.</li><li>More and new assets (from music to models and animations, cause despite the simplistic design, I still find it too plain).</li><li>Different game modes, and a better AI (which is not difficult to do since the actual one is almost brainless)</li><li>Polished and more optimized UI, maps, animations, code (yes, code must be optimized and polished asap).</li></ul>\n\n<p>There's an<strong> in-game tutorial </strong>already explaining what's the objective and what are the basic mechanics. There's no score currently (not even timer), there are no rewards, there are no unlockables. This is a prototype and I plan to expand and improve upon it.</p>\n<p><strong>Quick note: Expect bugs and balance issues</strong>, the game may feel too hard or maybe too easy, I evaluate any kind of feedback, and<strong> you're free to not only provide criticism but also to make suggestions</strong>. I'd highly appreciate it.</p>\n<p>The game is and will always be free without any kind of paid content.</p>\n<p>If you want to share your\u00a0thoughts about the game\u00a0with me, then feel free to\u00a0\u00a0DM me on Discord!</p>\n<p>You can also comment about it down below.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T11:31:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b22/b2265a3156c452959730f0db67da9398.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VNBP - Leo"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
