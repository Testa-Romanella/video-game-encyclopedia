This [buck/doe] was happy, it had a family and a warm shelter. One day, [he/she] sets out to find food for it's family. The [buck/doe]'s family eagerly waits for its return. Will [he/she] find its way home?</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<p>Once upon a Time is a short, story-driven adventure game set in an peaceful forest. You play as a randomly selected female or male deer who is deseperate to find food for it's family and return home. In the game, you can move, pause and read and follow the story as you walk through the forest. I have tried to make Once upon a Time as beautiful as possible through ambient sounds and piano music along with incredible pixel art.
