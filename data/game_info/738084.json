Each level features different ways to escape with dangers along the way. Explore the seemingly infinite expanse of eerily familiar levels in the backrooms for a taste of the game's creepy maze-like twists and turns.<br/><br/><br/>The game's immersive experience is enhanced by its lifelike graphics, minimal user HUD, and somber ambiance.<br/><br/><br/>Find your way through seemingly infinite levels. Every level has different twists, turns, exits, and enemies.<br/><br/>\"If you're not careful and no-clip out of reality in the wrong areas, you'll end up in the Backrooms, where it's nothing but the stink of old moist carpet, the madness of mono-yellow, the endless background noise of fluorescent lights at maximum hum-buzz, and approximately six hundred million square miles of randomly segmented empty rooms to be trapped in. God save you if you hear something wandering around nearby, because it sure as hell has heard you.\"", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T03:07:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e25/e257661905030dcaceb60e0ada04a3e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["PlayPun", "Lydo Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PlayPun", "Lydo Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
