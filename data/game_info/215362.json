If you are interested in helping us fine tune the game, please send us a video of you playing the game so we can see how first time players approach the magnet ability. Thanks!<br/></p><p><strong>WARNING: We did not do enough testing and it turns out it's possible to softlock the game if certain enemies don't die first.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ol><li>On the 2nd wave (wave 1 numerically), it highly recommended to kill the soldier in the top right using the other soldier's bullets.</li><li>On the 6th and 7th waves (waves 5 and 6 numerically), there may be an enemy that wanders around not firing. If they are the last one alive, they will not fire and therefore you cannot progress.

Use the magnet as the bullets pass to make them start \"orbiting\" you, then release when the time is right.</li><li>Flinging the mouse around doesn't cause to bullets to move any faster. It's all using yourself as a sort of gravity slingshot.</li><li>You can move just as fast with the magnet on. Try pulling the bullets along with you if you don't have time to sling them around.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee5/ee59320d2606f2a42a6900a32d3e89ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bonnicus"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
