But staying in control is harder than it seems when you have to handle all processes at once.</p>\n<p>All factory operators play on the same keyboard and control their dream factory with up to 10 fingers. Further game modes let you not only adventure in dream factory land by yourself but also in multiplayer modes, such as Battle Mode (up to 4 player) and Romantic Mode (up to 35 players).</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>1. Mouse to navigate the menu<br/>2. Keyboard to control your dream factory<br/></p>\n<p><strong>RULES</strong></p>\n<p>1. Serve your dream factory the controls it asks for by holding or releasing the appropriate control.<br/>2. When you lose control your dream factory will produce nightmares and eventually takes damage.<br/>3. If your dream factory is destroyed, children and grown-ups all over the world will have nightmares. Better try next time :)</p>\n<p><strong>INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>\n<p>0.
