Some of them you can get by harvesting resources, like trees, stones, and berries. Other's you'll need to do some crafting to get! You'll also want to build an inn or two to get some minions to help you gather resources! In the Inn-habitants tab of the Inn Upgrade menu you can select what resource those minions will collect. Upgrade the inn for more minions! You can find iron ore across the river, but how do you cross it?</p><p>Item you gather do directly to your inventory, while your minions have to deposit items into Depots for them to get added.<br/></p>\n<p>This was a project I made a while ago and finished up recently. The explorable area is pretty big, but it's mostly empty. Maybe I'll add more later? The items you can get are also pretty limited, so it should be pretty straight forward.<br/></p>\n<p>The crafting ingredients/upgrade amounts aren't exactly balanced. Let me know if something seems like too much or too little.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T04:52:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b90/b90ea1bec0ebebc45c5187f3e73f3095.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["genaralskar"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
