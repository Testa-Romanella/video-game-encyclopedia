Somehow, the whole town looks dark. But there are still few lights out there which could probably show you the path. Use the arrow keys on your computer to navigate left and right. Press the Up arrow to Jump. There are few crystals on the way to help you find your way to the source of all the problems going on in the town. Find your way out of this dark world to turn everything back to normal once again. Have fun playing this very-short 2D adventure platformer.</p>\n<p>Please do drop a comment with your reactions and suggestions.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your support!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Kartikey Hebbar,</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Deadcat Productions</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T08:08:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6c/a6c6c19d4b22a55db4ab528320b98bb4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Deadcat"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
