The aim is to last as long as possible. To do this, the player has two mechanics at their disposal. The main one is the ability to shoot, which will destroy enemies and add to the score. The second is a shield, which can be activated for a few seconds and will block enemy projectile, before having to recharge. If the player is hit, they are stunned for a few seconds until the damage is repaired. Losing half of the buildings will result in the game ending.</p>\n\n<p>Created with:</p>\n<p>C#<br/>Unity<br/>Aseprite</p>\n\n<p>Created for coursework at the University of East London.<br/></p>\n<p>http://www.uelgames.org/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/892/89269e22097fcc79a06955829349312c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Nullific"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
