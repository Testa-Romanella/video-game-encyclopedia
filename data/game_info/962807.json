Players should observe the points (white and green octagonal prism) and the lines connecting them, to grasp the concepts and patterns about them, in order to help \"AISister\" proceed to the next test chamber.<h3>Experiment 88</h3>\"AISister\" is co-invented by three companies. The companies are responsible for manufacturing her virtual brain, physical body, and real-world simulation system respectively. Experiment 88 is the 88th experiment designed to test her logic and behavioral responses in the real world.<h3>Unique Levels</h3>Traditional puzzle-solving can be clich\u00e9. Therefore, as the level progresses, you will meet darkness or coldness or maybe rain. Sometimes, completing a level will reward you with items.<h3>Tips:</h3><ul><li>You can complete the game by simply using a normal mouse.<br/></li><li>If you have no clue how to solve a puzzle, try focusing on the prisms and lines.<br/></li><li>Settings Menu allow you to adjust the zoom level in the third-person view.</li></ul><h3>Official Release Teaser</h3>The game plans to include at least double the number of levels in the future official release, stay tune.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-30T02:46:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b4/8b49faabeea91097b897915a7dc24d64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 256, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Yiibro"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Yiibro"], "esrb_rating": null}
