We have rights to the back catalog of almost 200 titles by well-known Japanese developer Norn/Miel. This time we are translating the title Tsundere Idol into English.<br/><br/>Tsundere Idol is the story of Kota, a mild-mannered student in Japan who is a fan of the up and coming idol sensation Rui Kurumizaka. Wouldn't you know it she happens to attend the same college as him and is in one of his classes!  Too shy to approach the cool and popular Rui, Kota is happy just to be in the same classroom as her. Then one day an accident occurs and the contents of Rui's bag spill out on the floor revealing an naughty magazine! Our hero steps up and claims ownership in order to save the true owner the embarrassment of owning up to possessing such salacious literature. And thus begins an unexpected and unusual affair.  <br/><br/>Features including:<br/><ul><li>Translated version of the original Japanese Visual Novel <br/></li><li>Main female character fully voiced with original Japanese dialogue<br/></li><li>Original Japanese artwork modified to 16:9 aspect ratio<br/></li><li>Hours of story content<br/></li><li>Audio including music and special effects<br/></li><li>Enhanced with character sprite animations</li></ul><br/>Please note: When you download Tsundere Idol from Steam it does not include any explicit adult content.<br/><br/>For more information about the game please check out our website or follow us on Twitter.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T19:56:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f09/f09c224d4aff5e0c44ad64cec5195add.jpg", "website": "https://cherrykissgames.com/tsundere-idol", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 8, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 319, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["miel", "Norn"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Cherry Kiss Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
