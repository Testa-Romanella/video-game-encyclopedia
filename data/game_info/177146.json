Anxious for their new job, the player slowly becomes more and more stressed over time, when they are too stressed, they cannot sleep. If the stress bar maxes out, the game ends. To decrease stress, try one of the many relaxing activities found around the house.</p>\n<p>Each activity plays as a small mini-game. Match the correct number to the sliding bar to decrease stress. Incorrectly matching the number increases stress. Pressing no key at all results in only the average continual stress increase.</p>\n<p>Try to get as much sleep as possible by 7AM.</p><p><strong>Edit: 3/30/2018:</strong> Fixed some minor bugs that were preventing the <strong>HTML5 version</strong> of the game from porting properly, as well, in the HTML5 version <strong>only</strong>, fixed the issue in which the high score screen launched with our testing high scores. <strong>Windows</strong> version is still the original - although it was removed / re-uploaded while I struggled to figure out how to include the HTML5 port to this page. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34c/34c5296ea25d865b7a4da4444837e727.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RiverGiantGames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
