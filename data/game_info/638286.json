More attachments will become available throughout the game, with all of them unlocking at around 1500 enemies. All attachments cap at level 5 (purple)</p>\n<p>While you can upgrade over time, so will the enemies! Every few upgrades you get the enemies will change their patterns and send out stronger, faster, and scarier units.\u00a0See how long your lonely turret will survive with your help!<br/><br/>Controls<br/>-A and D or left and right for rotating the turret<br/>-W and S or up and down for zooming in and out<br/>-1-8 for selecting a position to place attachments</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T06:35:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc9/bc942b4ab40cb9aa242b2175ce52d5c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wildgamez"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
