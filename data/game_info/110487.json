The way the word was used is thus: \"Lets go play some \r\nSpacies\".  It was a generic term used to cover all the games available \r\nat the local arcade.</p><p>This is my first ever effort to create a game, and any feedback is \r\nwelcome.  Constructive criticism helps me develop the game further; and \r\nbug reports increase the stability of the game.</p>License<p>This project is licened under the Mozilla Public License v2.0 </p>Recommended Specs<ul><li>CPU - Dual Core or Higher</li><li>Graphics - Any accellerated graphics card with a minimum of 256Mb of dedicated VRAM</li><li>Hard Drive - ~200Mb of disk space</li><li>Monitor - Minimum of 800x600 resolution</li><li>Internet - Initial game startup requires an active net connection to pull down WebFonts from Google.
