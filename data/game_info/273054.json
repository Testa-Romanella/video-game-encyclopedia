At the same time, the pencil core ends and you have to pick up small pencils. In the case when the rod comes to an end, but there are still no pencils, you can pick up a fragment of the mirror. It will give effect for a few seconds - instead of wasting the rod will be restored, but at the same time the control becomes mirror - you lead to the left, and the pencil draws to the right. You can also pick up a heart that will allow you to face an enemy just once and stay alive. The longer you drive without lifting your finger from the screen, the higher the combo will be, which increases the speed of scoring. Plus gradually increases the speed of the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Initially, we planned to call the game Karan Dash, but later changed our mind and stopped at <strong>Pencil Dash</strong>. The motivation was that this elegant game of words would be understandable only to the Russian-speaking audience (yes, we from Russia). In Russian 'karandash' means a pencil.<br/>We released the game a couple of days ago and are now engaged in promotion. In this experience, too, no one in the team has, all the knowledge about the promotion, we learned from various articles.\u00a0Published information about the game on various sites/forums for free. From paid channels, we ordered advertising on 4pda, one youtube\u00a0blogger, several posts in VK (Russian facebook) and AdMob. By the way, this post is also part of the promotion, so I leave here a link to the game.<br/></p>\n<p>I would be grateful if you install (and will suddenly like it?), and for the review with a rating I promise to put a candle for your health!<br/>And I promise in two weeks to write a second post with the results, blackjack and charts.<br/>See you later!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64c/64c66ed9c3836889e0529872c147e765.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mkjio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
