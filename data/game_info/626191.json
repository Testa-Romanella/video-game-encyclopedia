If you are a 'new scratcher' then I'm really sorry to tell you this won't work for you yet (you need to graduate to Scratcher status!) Tip for wall jumping - To wall jump, simply hold up to jump, touch a wall and then pull away STILL HOLDING THE UP KEY :) - Never let it go while wall jumping, that's the secret!!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T06:10:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc0/bc0f8f518080f4db791f1f395309e90b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gameryashu"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
