I've been making physics games in my spare time for over 10 years. Just Flip is my latest and greatest!</p>\n<p>Like all my physics games, it gets to the point quick with minimal fluff and nonsense.<br/><br/>Launch yourself, parkour style, over a single massive mountain <em>(Note: this demo is just a small portion of the full mountain)\u00a0</em>full of steep cliffs, ski slopes, and interesting obstacles. Flip, Ski, Fall down, rage, get up, keep flipping!<br/><br/>The controls in Just Flip are simple in concept, but require some practice to get a feel for the inertia of the flip. The launch and flip mechanic has been honed, tweaked, and iterated-on for over a year to make it smooth and satisfying.<br/>Just pull down and back sling-shot style anywhere on the screen and release to launch. Once in the air, mouse down to crouch or release to extend. Stick the landing and repeat.<br/><br/>Inspired by the world of 'Getting Over It with Bennet Foddy', Just Flip consists of a single large continuous mountain of stuff to flip and ski over. You will not be artificially teleported back to the start if you fail to stick a landing, you will simply get back up and keep flipping. Of course, if you fail to stick the landing in the wrong place, gravity might have a say in where you end up.<br/></p>\n<p>If you enjoy 'Just Flip', please consider wishlisting on Steam. It really helps.</p>\n\n<p>-Jeff</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-31T02:58:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbf/dbf7bd396cc75b51efbcd3a85db93b47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JeffWeber"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
