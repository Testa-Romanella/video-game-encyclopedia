The theme of this jam was \"Rewind\" so I decided to think outside of the box and make a game where you wind and REWIND cranks to move buckets up and down to fetch coins from the bottom of a well. I spent most of my time on art, and was unable to complete the game. I may one day revisit this project and make this into a fully playable game some day. But for now, enjoy this barely playable prototype.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Left / Right - Move your character</p>\n<p>Up / Down while standing on a well - Wind and rewind the crank to move the bucket people up and down</p>\n\n<p>Objective:</p>\n<p>Catch coins and bring them to the top.</p>\n\n<p>Music composed by Aaron\u00a0Bonneau!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T08:16:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/117/11710e143706c3db0ac9ecab3caed412.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["noahbonneau"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
