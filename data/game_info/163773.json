Especially when your co-workers keep playing tricks on you, you want revenge don\u2019t you? Invite them over to play this office simulator.

The players can then choose which task they complete, but the player outlined in the task will earn extra points if he completes that said task. Tasks can be completed by simply doing what the task instructs, for example: Bring me some coffee would instruct the player to go and find a coffeepot, fill it with coffee and then simply deliver it to the supervisor.</p>\n<p>A second strategy to all this is to prevent everyone else from getting anything done. Through this so called \u201csabotage\u201d mechanic, players can simply disable an interactable so that it can\u2019t be used until repaired. However the player does this at his/her own risk because the supervisor can spot this kind of behaviour, so tread with caution.</p>\n<p>The player that has earned the most points when the timer has run out, wins the game making him the new employee of the month.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50a/50ab06cf6a186eefcf84dc42e4167e88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["StevenR", "KoenCardoen", "Sara Obert", "StijnBilliet"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
