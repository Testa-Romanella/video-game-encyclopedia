More can be added if there is interest but this is as far as most players got originally.\u00a0</li><li>Practice mode is now meant to showcase the MASSIVE square mile of city.</li><li>Since flying is now smooth I removed the ability to skip rings, you have to hit every one. I also moved the collider in a little so you have to be inside the ring for it to count.\u00a0\u00a0</li><li>I\u2019ve placed the HUD onto the players wrists and added the ability to turn them off by pushing a physical button they are being projected from.\r\n</li><li>I wanted to keep as much jank as I could. The car sequence breaks modern immersion conventions a little to keep the mechanic the same, expect to have to try that a few times before you get it and yes, that means you have to start over at the rings again.\r\n</li><li>There is no health bar and if I make more levels I don\u2019t plan on adding it.\u00a0 The countdowns and danger to citizens is enough of a challenge. I will probably make powers permanent as well, all drawing from a central battery that the pickups will refill.\r\n</li><li>Now that this is a first person game there\u2019s no player model, this lets me remove any reference to Superman and it\u2019s trademarked characters, something I think DC comics and its parent company Warner Brothers will appreciate.\u00a0\r\n</li><li>You are now playing as Super Human Six!\u00a0 I had to change very little to make this possible, you might not even notice other than the cover.\r\n</li><li>Finally, I changed the ending, or rather created one because the original game just used the static opening models again. It was only 20 seconds long and is seriously lazy, there is no back wall of this set and they just\u00a0SHOW THE HOLE ON SCREEN. The camera shook so bad because they didn\u2019t turn it off on the previous level.\u00a0 A level that concludes with a sign that reads \u201cthe end\u201d</li><li>My version also has a \"the end\" sign but at least it's graphically interesting.\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T11:23:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c43/c43887a4d622d7e84c722f1a6e736ba8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["wackomedia"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
