However, it will be targeted for the next big update, and <strong>contributing to the project</strong> will surely help speed this up!</p>\n<p><strong>CubeCramp </strong>is bundled with a <strong>translation file</strong> that developers and fans can modify to translate the game with no applications other than the notepad. This way, translating becomes available for everyone, in a cheap and efficient way. This is reason we were able to translate the demo in as little as an hour. Not only translating, but also<strong> modding</strong>, creating your own dialogues becomes a feature.</p>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T04:55:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cef/cef34a9ba39a72111b40d631543c30c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Quantum Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
