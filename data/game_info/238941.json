Prove it.<br/><br/>The sky is blue, the grass is green and Pogocat is prepared for a wholesome day of jumping. Hop, flip, spring, boing, and skip with her as far as possible across the grassy mountain plains.<br/><br/>Pleasant? Perhaps, but probably not. After all, it's a cat on a pogo-stick. There will be falls, and there will be tears. Patience is essential on Pogocat's journey.<br/><br/>Features:<br/>- An endless, gruelling journey with you, a pogo stick and a persistent hopping cat.<br/>- High-difficulty, physically-simulated pogo motion-dynamics.<br/>- Feline outfits to make the journey more colourful (yes, Pogocat actually enjoys dress-ups)<br/>- Ad removal for distraction-free jumping.<br/>- A feline friendship worth working for.<br/><br/>Remember that feeling that you once had where one day you'd come across a cat on a pogo-stick? The day has come, and it's a beautiful one at that.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:17:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/301/301a12939cfd396b57565f18b84356ef.jpg", "website": "https://pogocat.2pt.com.au", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["2pt"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["2PT"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
