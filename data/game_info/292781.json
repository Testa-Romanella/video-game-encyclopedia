You can play it if you didn't have played Earthbound already but I think you'll miss a part of the experience.<br/>If you love JRPG, colored pixels, UFOs stories, consider playing the Mother games serie.</p>\n<p>This game has been made with Bitsy, a really cool application by Adam Ledoux to design short game with minimalist graphics.  You can find it here https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy<br/>Also, thanks to Mark Wonnacott for the cool application to fuse bitsy and audio easily https://candle.itch.io/bitsy-audio<br/><br/>I've done the music with some soundfonts of Earthbound, synth1, drumpro64 on Reaper DAW. <br/></p>\n<p>If you find any bugs, don't hesitate to leave a comment.</p>\n\n<p>Twitter : @monplaisirmusic<br/>Bandcamp : https://chezmonplaisir.bandcamp.com/<br/>Website : http://loyaltyfreakmusic.com/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f2/4f259f114d44d5cd9371ae8520a92b1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Monplaisir"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
