I wanted a Portal aesthetic with more of a Matrix ending. There needed to be a way to lose which is what the lava is for. I didn't want a timer counting down for the player to lose since that didn't feel proper. Instead I used lava rising as a way to keep the player moving.</p>\n<p>The player controller is Unity's FPS controller and the textures are all from the probuilder kit. I kept the original textures from the probuilder kit because I felt it matched the Portal style I was going for.</p>\n<p>Music Used:</p>\n<p>\"Gnarled Situation\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\u00a0Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License\u00a0http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T18:22:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff1/ff1f2366fd34c06fb9777008f6dcc510.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["K-b0b"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
