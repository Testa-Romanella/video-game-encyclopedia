It will take a 10 second cooldown to be used again, but price remains static.</p>\n<p>-Bottom right you can upgrade your clicking power.</p>\n<p>-Random coins will spawn, their rewards grow with each grab, but they also bring misfortune as the cart gains speed every time a new coin spawns.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T16:31:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fa/2faad1b64bdf36236bc89d28b4fdf051.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["payaosito"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
