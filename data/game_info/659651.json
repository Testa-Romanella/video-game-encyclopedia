Also, don't get knock out of the arena.\r\n</li><li>The lower your health the slower you spin, same goes for the enemies.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>FPS Issue</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If your FPS is too low, consider toggling on Hardware Acceleration on your browse. To do so, simply head to your browser setting and search for \"hardware acceleration\" like so:\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<ul><li>If you fall together with the last enemy you'll get stuck in eternal falling screen.</li><li>You can sometimes get stuck on the edge.</li></ul>\n<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: if you encounter any of the bug above, just refresh the page.
