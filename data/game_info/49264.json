The game is made more hectic and rounds are kept short by weapons scattered around the track that create ways for players to eliminate each other. Points are awarded for staying alive as long as possible. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nFollowing in the footsteps of Party Golf, the game has a deep customisation system that allows everything about \"normal\" gameplay to be changed so players can create whatever style of gameplay they like the most!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T17:05:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dab/dab6760741ddec174a7ff5cf7443bded.jpg", "website": "http://partycrashersgame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 31, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 219, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["Ian Lewis t/a Giant Margarita", "Giant Margarita"], "genres": ["Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Giant Margarita"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
