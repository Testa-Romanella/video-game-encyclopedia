The game can be played as a local co-op, but the aim is for a single player experience. </p><p>In Unification you play in two opposite worlds, black and white, light and dark, up and down. You will control Steve on the top half and Susan on the bottom, both are equal - yet opposite. </p><p>Run, jump and evade as you go from platform to platform, avoiding green baddies, pressing buttons and opening doors.</p><p>Unification is a prototype demo made in ClickTeam Fusion 2.5.</p><p>If the game is well received, then I may add music, sounds and extra levels to this version and create a full fledged game out of it in the future.</p><p>Thank you so much for playing, this is a first game project and needs a lot of work.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d4/0d4f0cff9696cefcd83e29e5dbb1b01f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChillAxE"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
