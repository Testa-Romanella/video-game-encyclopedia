Player discretion is advised. Contains the following:</p>\n<p>- Heavy profanity</p>\n<p>- Sexual content (skippable)</p>\n<p>- Brief references to past trauma</p>\n<p>- Bigotry against fictional groups</p>\n<p>I am also adding a disclaimer that this VN contains morally questionable views and behavior on the part of the protagonist. This VN is not only a critique of scientific advancements and the future of capitalist society, but also on our common media portrayals of power dynamics in romance. I want to shine a light on elements that, while commonplace in romance VNs, appear much less acceptable when the script is flipped. All characters depicted are unambiguously over the age of 18.</p>\n\n<p><strong>STORY</strong><br/></p>\n<p>We follow protagonist Shiloh, a young woman hoping to work her way up in the world, but is currently stuck taking boring online classes and working unforgiving shifts at a local fast-food joint. After a particularly stressful night at work, she finds a stray, genetically-modified catboy rummaging through the dumpster. Fearing for his safety and well-being, she takes it upon herself to bring him home and care for him. Cue the tragic romance.</p>\n<p>Shiloh's roommate isn't too fond of genetically-modified creatures. Even worse, there's a scary-looking dude who's been hired to capture our beloved catboy after his client buys the rights to catboy's DNA.\u00a0\u00a0How will Shiloh prevent her new catboy companion from being caught by these two antagonists?</p>\n\n<p><strong>CURRENT FEATURES</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The story is about 90% written, with some scenes missing or cut short in this initial submission.
