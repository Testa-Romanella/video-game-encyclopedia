Players who take the time to learn how to play this game are often pleasantly surprised by the unique mechanic, not replicated in any of the other Game &amp; Watch\u2122 titles, which provides for some challenging gameplay especially at higher levels.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGameplay\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n<p>\r\nEvil Demon Crabs crawl up from the bottom of the screen (in one of four columns) and make their way up towards the top where they queue in front of a red line. Taking control of Mr. Grab players have to push the stack of crabs over the red line and off the screen in an attempt to clear the top most row of any crabs.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSuccessfully clearing the top row will earn the player 10 points and the game will advance to the next level which will contain even more crabs. Also each level has a bonus timer which counts down from 20 points, the balance of which will be awarded as bonus points when the level is completed, so the quicker a level is cleared the more points can be earned. If the bonus timer reaches zero, an additional row of crabs will appear at the bottom of the screen every 30 seconds. The number of bonus points available will increase by 5 points for each level cleared (up to a maximum of 70 points).\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn Game A, the crabs pushed off the top of the screen reappear at the bottom to make their way back up so you'll have to quickly decide which crabs to push over the top to avoid finding yourself stuck between the remaining ones.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn Game B, the crabs continuously appear from the bottom of the screen and the bonus timer counts down twice as fast as in Game A.\r\n</p><p>\r\nA miss occurs when Mr. Grab is caught from below in the arms of a crab, or if an entire column is filled with crabs from top to bottom (like in Tetris). Three misses and the game is over!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tControls\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tKeyboard\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tUp\r\n\t\t\t\t\tW or Up Arrow\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDown\r\n\t\t\t\t\tS or Down Arrow\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tLeft\r\n\t\t\t\t\tA or Left Arrow\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tRight\r\n\t\t\t\t\tD or Right Arrow\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMouse\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tRotate\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDrag\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPress\r\n\t\t\t\t\tLeft-click\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tZoom\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMousewheel\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tResources\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAudio\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDavid Haywood\r\n\t\t\t\t\t( youtube.com )\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tBox Art\r\n\t\t\t\t\tNintandbox\r\n\t\t\t\t\t( nintandbox.net )\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tInstructions\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTorsten Lindh\r\n\t\t\t\t\t( intheattic.co.uk )\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTextures\r\n\t\t\t\t\tLee Robson\r\n\t\t\t\t\t( progettosnaps.net )", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T18:00:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69b/69b259b4aea4eea1c2ca0695db0352d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Itizso"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
