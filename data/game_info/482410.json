The game will be from a first-person perspective and will feature a simple goal of trying to return home safely. The game will be set in the early evening and starts after the character has fuelled up at a gas station, driving towards suburbia and their home. The player will initially experience feelings of relaxation and a sense of calm at the beginning of the game due to the setting and music, but as fatigue comes in waves at the player, they will then experience frustration as various mechanics affect how they handle the car and make it more difficult to avoid crashing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-21T04:10:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/502/5027f220bb618dfcadb265521bcc4a2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jparsons"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
