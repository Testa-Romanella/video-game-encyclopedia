The age of men has flourished and died before our eyes. We have come so far, yet it is sometimes difficult to see the magnificence of our own destruction. Pedro Custodio and Fynn Levy's 'The Year I Died, 1997': A VR Experience will attempt to take players merely an inch closer to true understanding. Many say the mind is simply a tool, something to be twisted and bent to fulfil our needs. Prepare for the shape of your mind to be shifted in the coming moments of existence. Do not be scared or timid, for everything is just a spectral image moving from one reality to the next. Do not fear death, it is but one moment in the face of eternity. </p><p>This game requires Google Cardboard and an Android phone to play. </p><p>Made for Ludum Dare 35.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d8/0d8bb25b17bdfc77b3e2bb8ecc343b8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Warm Sunday"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
