I might continue this game and release a full version in the future but I haven't decided yet.</p>\n<p>Gameplay:</p>\n<p>It's a turn-based combat game with basic role playing and story elements. Also, it has a block/parry system inspired by Paper Mario and Sekiro.</p>\n<p>Story:</p>\n<p>\u00a0In this game, play as Chungus and Bison as they try to get revenge on the people who destroyed their village. Furthermore, follow their \"gripping\" story as Chungus and Bison fight their way to the \"staggering\" truth.<br/></p>\n<p>Sound Credits:</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/LiamG_SFX/sounds/322151/, Sword Ring 4, changes were made<br/>https://freesound.org/people/LiamG_SFX/sounds/322174/, Sword Impact Blunt 3, changes were made<br/>Clunk https://freesound.org/people/BiblicalBricksProductions/sounds/196146/ changes were made</p>\n<p>All other sound effects and music were created by me.</p>\n<p>The Programs I Used:</p>\n<p>Made with GameMaker Studio 2, Adobe Animate, Soundtrap, and Audacity.</p>\n<p>Feedback is very much appreciate.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T05:32:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7a/a7ab4041de3a89adbdb8a512c55612af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sharpit8"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
