Drinking water is becoming increasingly<strong>\u00a0scarce</strong>\u00a0as people are swallowed up by the ocean.</p>\n<p>As a result, Santa Claus sent monsters to punish humanity and make them\u00a0<strong>aware\u00a0</strong>of the imminent\u00a0<strong>danger\u00a0</strong>!\u00a0</p>\n<p>But luckily, 4\u00a0<strong>heroes\u00a0</strong>will fight to prove that they can make the world a better place !</p>\n<p>Finally, mankind will follow their example and do everything possible to make amends for their mistakes ! There is\u00a0<strong>always\u00a0</strong>a solution !</p>\n\r\nJust a quick note\r\n<p>Hello everyone !</p>\n<p>I am pleased to present my first video game. The birth of this game took place at the beginning of containment when I wanted to make some friends laugh.\u00a0Indeed, this game becomes more and more difficult between the five levels, but don't worry... it will be even more fun !</p>\n<p>I will ask you to grant me some indulgence, this is my first experience in video game development. And of course I'm open to any constructive criticism !\u00a0Don't hesitate to share your opinion !</p>\n<p><strong>The game cinematic introduction can be jerky if your PC is not powerful enough ! I'm trying to fix this problem !</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Thank you and have fun !\r\n</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n--&gt; Game Graphics\r\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Thanks to :\u00a0Gameart2d,\u00a0\u00a0Craftpix\u00a0&amp;\u00a0Bevouliin</p>\r\n--&gt; Game Sounds\r\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Thanks to :\u00a0Zapsplat,\u00a0Kenney\u00a0&amp;\u00a0Freesound</p>\r\n--&gt; Backgrounds, Design By\u00a0Freepik\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Website Itch.io\r\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Thanks to\u00a0 :\u00a0<strong>dgim-studio</strong>,\u00a0<strong>zivile_z</strong>, &amp;\u00a0<strong>starline\u00a0</strong>!</p>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Game Cinematic\r\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Thanks to\u00a0 :\u00a0<strong>alicia_mb</strong>,\u00a0<strong>upklyak</strong>,\u00a0<strong>davidzydd</strong>,\u00a0<strong>vectorpocket</strong>,\u00a0<strong>brgfx</strong><br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<strong>macrovector </strong>&amp; <strong>vectorpouch </strong>!</p>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In-Game\r\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Thanks to\u00a0 :\u00a0<strong>starline</strong>,\u00a0<strong>dgim-studio</strong>\u00a0&amp;\u00a0<strong>brgfx</strong>\u00a0!</p>\n\r\nInstall instructions\r\n<p>The game comes in a zip file, \u00a0unzip it and run \"BackFire.exe\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T06:24:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/879/8791eb9c7380ec967f8bd65a00005db3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UrakenBingBang"], "genres": ["Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
