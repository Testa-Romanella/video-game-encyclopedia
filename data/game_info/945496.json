I was personally responsible for conceptual art, art assets,\u00a0music, and sound design. Everything you see and hear (save for the gryphon and javelin pick-up sound effects) are custom made assets made by myself!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game's aesthetic is steeped deeply in Ancient Greek pottery art, as well as the Icarus myth.</p>\n<p>Pterry flies to freedom\u00a0in an island-hopping adventure to make it home to Athens. Just beware of Helio's wrath and be\u00a0sure not to fly too close to the sun!</p>\n<p>The final build will be coming soon in a few weeks! The boss level is not complete as of this posted build. There is also no restart button, you will have to manually close and open the executable to restart the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T08:55:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/527/527d14158a06bd7820cda2c80cb92c7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WillWe"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
