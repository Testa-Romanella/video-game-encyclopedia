If you move into a room that doesn't exist yet, you have to build it. Spend cards from your hand that include all the gems on the door you're building. (Most cards have 2 gems, and can be spent as either or both!) Choose the rotation of the new room and add it to the mine.<br/><br/>Collecting Gems<br/>For your action, use a room's special ability to draw more gem cards. Different rooms have different rules for drawing cards, so choosing the right room for your situation is key! (If you can't find a useful room, you can always draw a single card instead.)<br/><br/>At the start of your next turn, if you have more than 4 cards, you'll have to discard down to 4.<br/><br/>Winning<br/>In Rush Mode, the players race against each other. Have the most points at the end of the round when anyone reaches the point target.<br/><br/>In Crisis Mode, the players race against the clock. You'll be forced to \"burn\" cards from the deck every turn, removing them from the game. Reach the target score before the cards are all gone!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-29T01:59:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a5/3a58b742654b23b21b75ffd1a9f40672_Aden8k6.jpg", "website": "https://quicksilver.com/wp/gem-rush/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 225, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Quicksilver Software"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Quicksilver Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
