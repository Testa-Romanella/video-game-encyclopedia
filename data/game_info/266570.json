A counter will keep track of your cat's scores. <br/><br/>You can choose between 3 flying insects (fly, mosquito or moth) and 6 different backgrounds.<br/><br/>A \"warning\"; iPad games are not for all cats. I can't guarantee that your cat will like this game or play it at all. Cats are different - just like us : ) But MY cats love it!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:04:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/077/07735886a045742241902463478444a8_SW27S2g.jpg", "website": "http://www.martinecarlsen.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Martine Carlsen"], "genres": ["Family"], "publishers": ["Martine Carlsen"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
