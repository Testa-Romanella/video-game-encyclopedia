In this game, you need to complete short levels by getting the ball in the right hole. You can use the arrows left-right, or A and D, or click/touch left and right of the screen to move the platform where the ball is resting on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game gets harder with each level, introducing more and more obstacles. There are holes where you don\u2019t want the ball to fall into so you have to move the platform little by little. If the ball rolls off the platform you can spawn back at the bottom and you can try again. You have to stay patient and calm to have the most success.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T08:49:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4a/b4ad4f9200c22ffbef55323a0461369c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nannings"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
