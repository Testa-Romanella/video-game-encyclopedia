This is the only game within the IP.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game is self-called &quot;reverse tower defense&quot; by the developers. The point is, you and your opponent have to build stationery structures to defeat each other&#39;s bases. Many of the maps designed so no side has the opportunity and every odd in the gameplay depends on the speed and skillfulness of the sides. There a total of 40 maps.<br />\nThe core gameplay element comes from combining the materials: Endroi can pull the multi-colored blocks towards him \u2014 if hit an enemy, they destroy both the for and themselves, and if they get hit by another block of the same color, they form a construction \u2014 most likely a turret \u2014 which shoots in all directions. So the player is forced to continually think about the directions of pulling and the placement of turrets to antagonize with the AI-driven opponent adequately.</p>\n<h3>Story</h3>\n<p>The plot circles around Endroi on his quest to acquiring the power of Cubetracking \u2014 which is Cubes + Attracting combo-word. On his way, he encounters many enemies and overcomes them with tactics and more exceptional time management skills.</p>", "metacritic": 75, "released": "2013-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:54:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/850/85053bb302b7ab558b1a6ef747da4d86.jpg", "website": "http://www.ludochip.com/", "rating": 1.94, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 33, "owned": 1059, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 13}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 13, "ratings_count": 35, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 35, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Ludochip"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ludochip"], "esrb_rating": null}
