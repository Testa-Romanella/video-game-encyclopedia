The theme was \"Joined Together\".</p>\n<p>Use your mouse to place bear pairings together in one box to earn money. You can only pick up one item at a time and can only drop it in a box or the trash so be careful what you pick up. If you accidentally grab an item you don't want, you can throw it in the trash can but once it fills up you'll have to empty it by holding down on it with the left mouse button.</p>\n<p>Get enough money to reach the max of 3 Bears per level! Enjoy the various teddy bear pairings!\u00a0Remember, every bear likes a pot of honey!</p>\n<p>Note:\u00a0It's advisable to lower your volume before starting the game.<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>\r\nProgramming &amp; Game Design<br/>\r\nkrasi0707<br/>\r\nArt &amp; Game Design<br/>\r\nDivna</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T10:37:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e3/2e3caec6b0167adcd4e2420a9824c3f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["krasi0707"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
