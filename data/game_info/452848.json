The goal of which was to teach my daughter how to code and learn photoshop while also immersing myself in the renpy engine once again. We entered this one in particular because the barrier for entry was so low. No need to make it pretty, just make something.</p>\n<p>So we discussed the type of art and how it would probably make for an ugly game. Which is where the idea for this came from. The story is a knock off of the classic Ugly Duckling books we all grew up. It's a tale of a game trying to find someone to play with it. The art is based on the ZX Spectrum and the Questprobe games.\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p>The art is ugly (the code is even worse), but it was a great learning experience for the two of us so hopefully it's something you can enjoy as well.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T03:04:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90c/90ccf80a157ff13a1cd8c254b1a15ede.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["HardLuck"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
