It was a very dark journey about the horrors of the internet and was built atop a strange romanticism I had for AI, the C programming language, and old technology. The original was built in Flash, which was a bit of a nightmare, but this remake was coded in Java. </p>\n<p>\r\n\tSome years later I had the thought to recreate my old Flash game in Java. I was a much better programmer and had the skillset required to do this, but the project didn't hold my interest. The original game for me was simply \r\n\t<em>too</em> dark, and my mentality later on in life wasn't capable of capturing the same essence. I made the original to cope with depression; this remake lacked that ingredient, so the project ended with literally just a simple title screen made and some funky music.\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n\tMusic is 1989 by 4mat. I love the group, check out their \r\n\tDecades album.</li><li>Everything else is by me, Muhammad Abdul-Rahim.</li></ul>\n<p>One day I might release the original game back to the world. It was previously on Kongregate but has since been taken down.<br/></p>\n<ul>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/616/6167ec25884ae03b3252871023388498.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["M.H.
