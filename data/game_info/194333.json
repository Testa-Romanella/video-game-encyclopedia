The ships auto launch when complete. </p><p>Version 1.1 with the fully fleshed out game, Include graphics and sounds complements of some very talented people.</p><p>Improvements? The blocks, while awesome should do a better job of suggesting function. And the blocks will eventually include more then just single squares. And there is always the obligatory polishing with high scores, credits, and a story crawl.<br/></p><p>Download the zip file and move all files to the same folder; double click the exe to run. Alternately you can run it from the following web site: http://smallbasic.com/program/?PTQ565.
