You have to deliver the pizzas as fast as possible!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>But watch out: While\r\nthis quarantine time <em>everyone </em>wants\r\npizza. So everyone runs on the street and tries to steal one of your\r\nyummy pizzas. You have a little provisions the hungry can steal, but\r\nif they eat to much, you have to restart your deliverance. </p>\n<p>To\r\nget the people away, you can shoot scruffy pizzas at them. This will\r\nkill their appetite for pizza\r\nand let them go home again. But shooting isn\u2019t that easy: Your\r\nshooting mechanism is linked with your car radio. So it will shoot\r\nwhen a note of the right pitch is played...</p>\n<p>Besides\r\nthe hungry people, there are sometimes obstacles on the way, too. If\r\nyou crash with them, one Pizza will fly out of your car. </p>\n<p>The\r\nhungry people spawning mechanism is like the shooting mechanism\r\nsound-based. That\u2019s the\r\nsame with the obstacle spawning mechanism. So\r\ndon\u2019t be surprised if you can\u2019t shoot for a fey seconds. </p>\n<p><strong>Because\r\nall the sound-files must be analysed by the code when you start the\r\ngame, it can take a few seconds to load. Please be patient and wait.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Movement:</strong>\r\nW A S D or arrow keys. Your radio is controlling the shooting, so you\r\ndon\u2019t need to press any\r\nkey. You only have to move\r\nyour mouse cursor to the place you want to shoot.</p>\n<p>Music:\r\n\u201cNo Limit\u201d with\r\nGarageband</p>\n<p>Art\r\nmade with Inkscape</p>\n<p>Godot\r\n3.2.1 (stable) used</p><p><strong>WARNING: flashing screen</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T08:02:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc9/fc9b5c9f4dec32cecc4a466c4dd0285b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["The Neo GameFactory", "John Nitrous", "jontanan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
