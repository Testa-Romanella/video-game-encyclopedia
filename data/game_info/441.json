{"id": 441, "slug": "deus-ex-the-fall", "name": "Deus Ex: The Fall", "name_original": "Deus Ex: The Fall", "description": "<p>Deus Ex: The Fall is a first-person role-playing stealth-action game developed by Eidos Montreal. It is the fourth installment in the series. The game serves as a prequel to Deus Ex: Human Revolution.</p>\n<p>The year is 2027. Human augmentations are a common thing. Bex Saxon, an ex-SAS, gets employed by a PMC called Belltower Associates. Hiding from the Illuminati in Costa Rica, Ben starts to experience augmentation rejection syndrome because of a global shortage of Neuropozyne which suppresses the symptoms. Ben unravels a global conspiracy revolving around the drug and tries to warn the World Health Organization.</p>\n<p>Like the previous installments, the game features a high degree of role-playing. Players are able to upgrade their augmentations, unlocking more and more abilities. An inventory system is also present. Players have the option to use lethal or non-lethal approaches using different takedowns, and a wide range of weaponry. The levels are fairly open-ended so it is possible to complete a mission without even confronting the enemies.</p>", "metacritic": 45, "released": "2013-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T12:23:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/24d/24df5a8d70c80c15dade8304dd4370a5.jpg", "website": "http://www.deusex.com/TheFall", "rating": 2.68, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 217, "owned": 2489, "beaten": 109, "toplay": 30, "dropped": 74, "playing": 5}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 28, "ratings_count": 228, "suggestions_count": 511, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 230, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android", "PC"], "developers": ["N-Fusion Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Square Enix"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
