You have to find and pick up oxygen tanks and place them in the oxygen hub. You also need to put orbs on pedestals and throw the trash out. The rooms are filled with dangerous discs, avoid them at all cost. Complete all the tasks before oxygens run out and you win the game.</p>\n<p>BUT THERE\u2019S A DISC AMONG YOU\r\nUp to 3 players can be randomly assigned as traitor discs. A traitor disc can pretend to work like a scientist. They can pick up quest items and put them in a tight spot or hide them. They can move the oxygen tanks out of the hub. They can also transform into a disc and kill you. They will do everything to slow you down. They can use the trash passage to transport to other parts of the room. Find out who the traitor discs are and put anybody you suspect in jail.</p>\n<p>In Disc Us, it\u2019s not over until the game is over. If you get killed you respawn in the center hub. If you get voted out you can still get back in the game by convincing other players to use the key to open your jail.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T03:27:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd8/cd85840df58bf70581598e140d92586c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Keybol", "mwaayk"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
