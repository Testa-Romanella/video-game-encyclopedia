{"id": 91373, "slug": "vinylove-itch", "name": "Vinylove (itch)", "name_original": "Vinylove (itch)", "description": "<p><strong>Vinylove\u00a0</strong>is a small exploration experience set in one bedroom, focused on the links between the music we love and the memories they relate to.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We are releasing on Steam, September 10th!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>https://store.steampowered.com/app/924460/Vinylove/</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Until then the game is free here on itch.io! Thanks for supporting!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>As you proceed with the game, you will get to focus on ten moments of the protagonist's life and live them again by picking the right song at the right time on your records collection. You can explore the room to find out details that will reveal you another little slice of his story.</p>\n<p>As of now, the game is a very small experience that can be completed in under 20 minutes, if you know exactly what song to pick for every memory, so it's required to complete it in one session, as there are not save and load points.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Development stage</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game, meaning the whole small experience, is already completed and has an ending. Anyway, it could be expanded with more things to find, more rooms to explore, more things to do to have a longer experience and of course lot of polishing.</p>\n<p>I decided to publish it here in this first publishing phase just to test the public's\u00a0 response, planning to get it to Steam as soon as I have some positive feedbacks. As I said, the game is complete.. but, if I manage to have some earnings from it, it could be expanded to a full polished game. So, if you would like to see it growing from a small experience to a complete game and if you like it, you can always donate something to help me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What next?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The current version of the game will be free with the donation system on itch.io for the next weeks (maybe months, or likely forever), but if there will be any changes (such as putting a price or the game making it to\u00a0Steam) I'll be informing you about that. If you really love the game and would like to support, you may even receive a free key once (and if) it's officially published, just drop me a message or a mail and I'll be happy to write back.</p>\n<p><strong>We are officially releasing on Steam Store for just $2.99 on September 10th. The game is free on itch.io until a week before release date (September 3rd), so please hurry if you want to play it as it's still free (without the newest updates of course!).</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Those who donate will receive a free key at launch!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Warnings:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Contains strong language, references to alcohol and smoke.</p>\n<p>Also, please avoid comments like:<br/></p>\n<p>\"It's copied from/ based on/ rip off of/\u00a0Life is Strange/Marie's\u00a0Room/Gone Home\"<br/></p>\n<p>It surely has that vibe, and I was <strong>for sure</strong> influenced by the Life is Strange experience, but I didn't do anything pretending I invented it. So please, just enjoy if you like, ignore if you don't.</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/459/45949ce28718c76aac64b153ebfb2b20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 198, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Space Banana Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
