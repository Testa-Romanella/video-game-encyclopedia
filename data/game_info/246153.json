You control the man with the arrow-keys or WASD. Press space to jump. Press escape to go to the end screen.</p>\n<p>The man gets damaged when he hits a cactus or is caught by the wolf.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The wolf will speed up every time you find a treasure chest. If you don't find the chest within 10 seconds an arrow will appear and show you the way - but you will get more points if you find the chest before the arrow appears. You will also get more and more points as the wolf speeds up.</p>\n<p>Future enhancements:</p>\n<p>More levels.</p>\n<p>Online highscores.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fd/4fd382ed6252126c5b9e5a0de5db6111.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["granner"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
