{"id": 54166, "slug": "caltron-6-in-1", "name": "Caltron 6 in 1", "name_original": "Caltron 6 in 1", "description": "<p>Caltron 6 in 1 is a multicart developed and published in 1992 for the NES in North America by Caltron Industries, Inc. (credited as Caltron Ind. Inc.), a Taiwan-based video game company which was either closely related to, or simply a pseudonym for, NTDEC. In Australia, it was published under the title Real Players Pack by HES; this version is regarded by collectors as their rarest game. Dynacom released instead the cartridge as Multi A\u00e7\u00e3o 6-in-1 for the Brazilian market.</p>\n<p>As its title suggests, 6 in 1 consists of six different games in various genres, which mostly are popular clones of the era. It's composed by: Cosmos Cop, Adam &amp; Eve, Magic Carpet 1001, Balloon Monster, Porter, and Bookyman. These titles were all previously released as stand-alone Famicom format by NTDEC, often under their U.S. brand Mega Soft.</p>\n<p>The compilation has received poor reviews, with one reviewer claiming that all six games on the multicart are \"uniformly awful [and] barely first-generation NES quality\", even though they are more playable and are of \"much higher quality\" than other unlicensed video game compilations, specifically citing Active Enterprises' Action 52 as the comparative example.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:01:42", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["NES"], "developers": ["NTDEC", "Caltron Ind"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["BRA", "AUS", "Home Entertainment Suppliers", "HES", "NTDEC", "Dynacom", "Myriad", "Caltron"], "esrb_rating": null}
