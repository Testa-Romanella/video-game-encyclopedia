This is the perfect game for your next party or road trip!<br/><br/>The object of High Roller is to score the most points by rolling five dice to make certain combinations. Each player rolls the dice up to three times, while trying to make one of the thirteen possible scoring combinations. Each game has thirteen rounds, during which the player chooses which scoring combination to use. Once a combination has been used in the game, it cannot be used again.<br/><br/>The scoring combinations have varying point values. Some of the combinations are fixed values and others have cumulative value of the dice. A \"High Roller\" is five-of-a-kind and holds the game's highest point value of 50. Multiple \"High Rollers\" can be played on any open combination for an additional 100 point bonus.<br/><br/>A player's turn is over when they decide to score their points or until they have a scoreless throw (at which point the user must apply the turn to any open combination). When all five dice are scored in a turn, the player can roll them all again and continue to accumulate points. <br/><br/>If you like games like Yacht, Ten Thousand, Farkle, Craps, or any other dice game with a blend of skill and luck, then High Roller is the game for you!<br/><br/>High Roller Lite Features - Version 1.0<br/>- Solitaire Play Mode<br/>- Fun casino style graphics and sound effects<br/>- Turn animations off for fast game play<br/>- Shake to roll dice<br/>- Auto save game remembers where you left off<br/>- Instructions on how to play<br/>- Disable audio to enjoy tunes from your iTunes library<br/>- View online High Score Lists (upload available in Paid version)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:22:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd5/dd5fb5013b3f7162093a2e37034ac171.jpg", "website": "http://www.threejacks.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Silver Pine Software"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Silver Pine Software"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
