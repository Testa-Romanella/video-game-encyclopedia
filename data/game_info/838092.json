They should always be moving, being stucked in a dead end a snAIke dies and turns to stone.<br/></p>\n<p>SnAIke size is increased for every apple it has eaten. Once the snAIke is long enought, it will split into two smaller creatures. Also snAIkes may die of starvation, so don't put them in closed spaces for a long time.<br/>The game is over with the last snAIke is dead. A score is given for each alive snAIke every tick of the game.</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc0dgood luck\ud83d\udc0d<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>L-click to set put and delete walls<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Thanks Utopian for helping us with music and sounds, check out his soundcloud <br/>https://soundcloud.com/user-21340884<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T19:16:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff8/ff8cfbbb38896f5a8ff016863a494dc6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MaximusTG", "StarikTenger", "Robby-the-paladin"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
