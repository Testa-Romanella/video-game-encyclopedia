{"id": 464499, "slug": "dungeon-slacker", "name": "Dungeon Slacker", "name_original": "Dungeon Slacker", "description": "<p>A small roguelike inspired by \"Slay the Spire\".</p>\n<p>Help an adventurer explore a perilous dungeon, but since the Dungeon Master is too lazy to do its job, you are the one in control of the monsters and creatures that roam in this evil place. Make sure to keep your friend alive by choosing disadvantageous combinations of action for the enemies.</p>\n<p>Made for the GMTK Game Jam 2020.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I got inspired by this quote from the announcement video : \"Take something that developers usually have control of, and see what happens when you're no longer in charge\". I decided to create a game where the player does not control the character and where the game does not control the enemies.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately,\u00a0I did not have time to create a lot of actions and monsters, so the strategy is a bit lacking. Still an interesting proof of concept that I might revisit later.</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing &lt;3</p>\n\n<p>Follow on Twitter :\u00a0https://twitter.com/PeanutFreeGame<br/>Like on Facebook :\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/peanutfreegame<br/>Subscribe on Youtube :\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/peanutfreegame<br/></p>\n\n<p>Credits :</p>\n<p>Game by Antoine Berthiaume Dutil</p>\n<p>Art taken from :</p>\n<p>0x72 -\u00a0https://0x72.itch.io/dungeontileset-ii</p>\n<p>Kenney -\u00a0https://kenney.itch.io/kenney-game-assets-1<br/></p>\n<p>Music from :</p>\n<p>8bit Dungeon Boss Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T05:25:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/009/00977cde24b9455f9a188c060a0570e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Peanut Free Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
