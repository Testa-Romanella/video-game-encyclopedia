{"id": 25417, "slug": "puyo-puyo-2", "name": "Puyo Puyo 2", "name_original": "Puyo Puyo 2", "description": "<p>\n      The object of this head-to-head puzzle game is to clear your grid of \n      falling patterns, called puyos, by forming chains of four or more \n      same-colored puyos in a straight line or one of several geometric \n      patterns. What makes this a challenging two-player contest is the fact \n      that when you clear a chain of puyos from your grid, it drops a random \n      piece of filler onto your opponent\u2019s grid. The more puyos you clear, the \n      more you fill your opponent\u2019s grid, and if you can clutter up his grid \n      enough to fill it to the top, you\u2019ve won the game. An intriguing \n      backstory makes this an amusing experience for one or two players.\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
