It is an adventure game based on the apocalyptic theme and is played in 2D. I started this project off by researching into existing games, themes, art styles and compiling that information together to create concepts for my game idea. I then learnt some programming with C#, gained a basic understanding of the Unity engine and did some pixel art on Photoshop. The next few weeks consisted of putting it all together to create the game itself.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Positives:</p>\n<p>This game served as a good introduction to game development. It was easy to come up with the idea and executing it was not so tough as 2D with spritesheets is quite simple. I also learnt the basics of programming enough to be able to add very simple mechanics into my game. Pixel art was also very easy as I had prior image editing skills.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Negatives:</p>\n<p>Since I was completely new to game development, I struggled with making a quality product. I had to learn everything from the start which took quite a bit of time and patience. I also didn't push myself hard enough to try learning new things outside of our assigned tutorials which capped me at a lower quality of work.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Evaluation:</p>\n<p>I was quite pleased with what I managed to put together seeing as this was my first ever game. My design work led me to create a somewhat fun game, my art was good looking and fit with the theme I chose and finally my programming was alright. My biggest regret was not pushing myself farther since I could have had a much better start to game dev.</p>\n\n<p>Stats:</p>\n<p>Lines of code: approximately 668<br/></p>\n<p>How enjoyable was development of this project: 5/10<br/></p>\n<p>How much I learnt throughout this project: 7/10<br/></p>\n<p>Difficulty of this project: 8/10<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T08:58:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf4/bf46600c5d062b5fa0f84e46b292f846.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["0xDaniooo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
