This is a much darker and lore-intensive\u00a0universe than those two games. This universe is focused about the story and lore. (The lore and story of Myara isn't linked to Touhou nor Len'en by any means and is completely independant)</p>\n<p>The two protagonists are Hanase Koma,\u00a0a gentle and kind girl with an hatred against some types of youkais. And Miko Shiko, an understanding but sadistic\u00a0girl with a heavy focus on protecting the integrity of the world of Myara (but doesn't care about the mission she's given).</p>\n<p>During this adventure, the protagonist you play as will face very different foes who will sometime try to stop your progression or just play a bit with you.</p>\n\r\nThe Story\r\n\n<p>In a part of Japan that was sealed away in another world around 1925, the Myara Protection Agency (sometimes called Hidenobu) located in Kumamoto city, who's job is to protect this world from any danger, suspects that something is up at the top of the Lunar Mansion Mountain. A weird magic scent is being perceived from the very top of the mountain. You are sent by Hidenobu to investigate about this mystery and maybe find a way to resolve it.<br/></p>\n<p>During this journey, you'll discover something terrifying and put you in the center of a vast and strange story.<br/></p>\n\r\nFeatures\r\n<p>In this game, there is two options to fight back against enemies:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using your danmakus to fire at bosses and small fry</li>\n<li>Using your character's spell cards to apply effects to your danmakus, defend yourself and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you somehow get stuck in an ennemy pattern, you know you're gonna die very soon, you can press the X key to fire a bomb, clearing nearby bullets and giving you invincibility for a second or two, giving you time to escape!<br/></p>\n\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Keep in mind that these controls are by default (qwerty), you can change any keys you want in the option tab of the game.\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Arrow keys - Move around</li>\n<li>Shoot (Z) - Shoot/Confirm</li>\n<li>Bomb (X) - Bomb/Cancel</li>\n<li>Focus (Shift) - Slow your character</li>\n<li>Spell Rack (C) - Display the Spell Rack/Use a Spell Card</li>\n<li>Pause (Esc) - Cancel/Pause</li>\n<li>Spell Rack (A &amp; D) - Switch to Left/Right Spell Card</li>\n</ul>\n\r\nThe team\r\n\n<p>- Music: plug-c<br/>- Everything else that isn't music and some art: Tania Anehina</p>\n\r\nA word\r\n<p>Yes, I know, replays don't save. It's \"normal\". In the demo version, replays don't work and caused some insomnia. They will work in the final version, don't worry and sorry for the inconvience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T19:58:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c12/c12997850ce6cd271517cef36211519d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 260, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TaniaAnehina"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
