But your Vulcanite needs to harvest the power to kill the nightmare creatures. Therefore you are granted with the ability of travelling between nightmare worlds by a singular entity of the Old Ones. One world infested with machines, the other one made of pure energy. With the usage of the entrusted Katana Ikuto, which withstands the energy nightmare, you harness the power of the enemies energy blasts to fuel the Vulcanite and use their own weapons against them. You better hold out long enough to wake up from this nightmare, because dying in the Old Ones dream is as real as in any other world.</p>\n<p>Go nuts, go fast. In this first person bullet hell game you need to think fast and manage your ammo by switching between two dimension.</p>\r\nThis is a pretty challenging game.
