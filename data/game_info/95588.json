It is available for <strong>Windows</strong> and <strong>macOS</strong>.</p>\n<p>(Please use the\u00a0<strong>itch app</strong>\u00a0to install on <strong>macOS</strong>.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Versions for <strong>iOS</strong>, <strong>Android</strong>, and\u00a0<strong>GNU/Linux</strong>\u00a0\u00a0are planned.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I am updating the game often. Please see the <strong>devlogs</strong> for information on\u00a0the latest updates.\u00a0The price might increase as the game matures. (You will not lose access to the game even if the price increases).</p>\n<p><strong>If something doesn't work or you have any questions/comments, please use the forums below.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You only need the mouse to play. Click on shapes to change their color/state. The goal\u00a0is to match the outer color with the inner color in every shape. Every puzzle has its\u00a0own rules. The colors always change in the same order. The more colors you decide to\u00a0play with, the harder the game gets. You can have up to 9 colors at once.</p>\n<p>The game doesn't force you to play a certain way. You are free to play any puzzle you\u00a0want immediately.</p>\n<p>Move your mouse over to the bottom of the screen to reveal useful buttons.</p>\n<p>In order from left to right, the buttons let you: play again with a new pattern,\u00a0randomize the colors, increase / decrease the number of colors, grow and shrink some\u00a0puzzles, select the puzzle you want to play, and return to the main menu.</p>\n<p>A special note: The colored die (the second button) also shows the order that the\u00a0colors will change in. Also, when a puzzle can not grow / shrink, the buttons for growing and shrinking are not\u00a0visible.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>License</strong><br/></p>\n<p>pocico respects your software freedom.
