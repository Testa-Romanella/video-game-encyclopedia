{"id": 314500, "slug": "g-cruiser", "name": "G-Cruiser", "name_original": "G-Cruiser", "description": "<p>G-Cruiser is a hoverboard racing simulator developed in Unity as part of a game development class. There is one map, with two courses playable either during the day or at night, with an environment bonus for playing in the dark with a headlight. Upgrades for your hoverboard can be purchased with your winnings. It is a time trial with an intangible ghost that you can race against. Winnings are based on your time.</p>\n<p>The feel of the controls matches a snowboard, motorcycle, or fighter jet, where the bank angle determines how tightly you turn. Upgraded \"impulse converters\" can allow turns in excess of 9 Gs, so G-Induced Loss of Consciousness (G-LOC) is simulated. G-suits can be purchased to mitigate this. Top speeds for a fully upgraded hoverboard are in excess of 200 mph.</p>\n<p>The default angle of bank is realistic but can be disorienting/nauseating for some people. The game can be played in 1st person, 3rd person, or a 3rd person follow mode where the camera does not bank with the player. There is also a \"lean factor\" setting in the Options/Gameplay menu that can reduce the amount of bank. Mouse sensitivity is also a little high by default, but is adjustable in the same menu.</p>\n<p>A VR-enabled version is also available. The game seriously violates pretty much every VR anti-nausea design recommendation, but I think it's a ton of fun.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Mouse Horizontal Axis - Lean left/right to steer</li><li>Mouse Vertical Axis - Look up/down</li><li>W - Accelerate</li><li>S - Brake</li><li>Z - Change perspective</li></ul>\n<p>VR Controls (It's only been tested on Oculus Rift, with a Rift Controller):</p>\n<ul><li>Right Joystick - Steering</li><li>Right Primary Trigger - Accelerate</li><li>Right Secondary Trigger - Brake</li><li>A - Menu Select</li><li>B - Pause Menu</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T06:25:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff0/ff08be8d712c8e0859c0d3a0353c6187.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brendon LeCount"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
