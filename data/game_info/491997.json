Starting from that basis, extra care is at the order of each jump and movement, and if we add to this the progressive level of difficulty and the inclusion of different elements, we have a quite entertaining game, even in this phase of development.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T08:45:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d9/1d9372476569730ed2b77e5c44bd2e0e.jpg", "website": "https://orla.games", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 275, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ludus Games", "Orlando Almario"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Ludus Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
