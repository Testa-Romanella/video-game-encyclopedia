The inhabitants of this city are always dying, and the only way for them to recover health is to consume the heart of another human. However, as people consume more hearts they begin to lose their humanity and mutate into something else.</p>\n<p>Levels in the game are designed to some extent to be broken. It is completely possible to beat the game without utilizing game breaking techniques, but players who are willing to experiment with them may be able to upset the system that the city and the game itself operate under, upending expectations for their character.</p>\n<p>The game functions as a sort of 1-directional metroidvania: as the player mutates, some pathways in the city will open up while others become inaccessible. Players will be led on different paths depending on how they play and will likely have to play through the game multiple times in different ways to uncover the full story of what is happening in the city.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": true, "updated": "2020-11-02T18:56:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9a/f9ab7487efd0656cb34cc1b8a4485279.jpg", "website": "http://www.feebleforcegame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
