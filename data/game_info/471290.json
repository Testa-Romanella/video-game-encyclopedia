The theme for this week was \"Replay\".\u00a0 Flip Runner is a simple platformer made in Unity that fits the theme in two ways. The first is that when you get all the way through a level, it then flips the world on it's head and you replay the level again from the underside. The second way that the game fits the replay theme is that the player has a rewind mechanic that when the R button is held, it rewinds the players position.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>WASD to move</p>\n<p>Shift to Sprint<br/></p>\n<p>Space to Jump</p>\n<p>Space when on Wall to Wall Jump</p>\n<p>Hold 'R' to Rewind<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T03:20:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/657/65709a9dc103a710e93cd631a112721b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Killadave15"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
