What this means is that if you have a rubiks cube that you can't solve, this is your solution (without dissassembling the cube).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T12:30:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/362/362040368436759a53295aa0e3399e16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BardBarian"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
