As you can see, though, this doesn't really fit the theme of LD 41! That's because it was a bad theme in practice. My original idea was going to be to make a horror-esque game with Shakespearean/theatrical style writing, but due to time constraints I had to port this to Ren'Py from RPG Maker. This is short, sweet, and has some flaws, but I hope VN (and yuri) fans can appreciate it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45c/45cdae00882cc233e64f2d805dfa64cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Mikomi Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
