Innovative isn't it? Jokes aside, the important element in our game is the built-in battery of the ship. The player has to connect himself to a space-station to charge up his battery to fire way on these incomming asteroids. We decided to make it a <strong>Third-Person-Shoote</strong>r to give the player the real space feeling.</p>\n\n<p>The players mission is surviving as many asteroid waves as possible while always watching for the next space station to get your energy refilled.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>MOVEMENT</strong>\n</p>\n<p>W/A/S/D to move.\r\n</p>\n<p>Mouse to look around.\r\n</p>\n<p>Left mousebutton to shoot.\r\n</p>\n<p>Right mousebutton to use special ability.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>Glyphos<br/></p>\n<p>Ritzga</p><p>Schicho, CEO of Freshi Industries<br/></p><p>Vinlow<br/></p>\n<p><strong>SPECIAL THANKS TO</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Gothic</p>\n<p>Tohmis<br/></p>\n<p>Lord Zaruflex<br/></p>\n<p>Sythelux<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T23:11:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a45/a459fe4a307505e058c098f6cb968d1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["MyTechZone"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
