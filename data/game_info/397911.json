Each card in-game that you'll in your battle against the Czar\u00a0is a different historic event or situation that contributed to the Czar's downfall. May the odds be ever in your favor, good luck!</p>\r\nBasic game run through:\r\n<p>Upon opening the menu\u00a0you will select a difficulty from the top left (1 is historic) and then press 'Play' to begin the game.\u00a0 Once you're in the game there is a shuffle button (card on the bottom left) which you'll press to deal the cards to yourself. You then play your three cards (dragging them onto the earth to play them) and then press the end turn button (very bottom left) to end your turn and let the Czar attack you back. Then repeat until one of you is dead (zero health left). You may also use the power ups to aid you during your battle (they are the four light blue buttons on the upper left). The power ups\u00a0\u00a0can only be played once a game and provide, if played correctly, an immense advantage.\u00a0Along the way to switch songs, figure out abilities and more press 'RMB' to switch between the game and info tabs.\u00a0</p>\r\nSystem Requirements:\u00a0\r\n<ul><li>Screen aspect ratio must be 9:16</li><li>The game must be in full screen to play (small blue button in bottom right)</li></ul>\r\nBasic layout:\r\n<p><strong>Shuffle Button </strong>- Deals you your cards</p>\n<p><strong>Power Ups</strong> - Provide power ups in the game, these can only be played once</p>\n<p><strong>End Turn </strong>- Ends your current turn and lets the Czar attack you</p>\n<p><strong>Back Button</strong> - Navigates back to the main menu</p>\n<p><strong>Info Tabs</strong> - 'RMB' opens/closes the info tabs which harbor useful information</p>\n<p><strong>Play\u00a0 Button</strong> - Begins a game</p>\n<p><strong>Quit Button</strong> - Exits the game</p>\n<p><strong>Cards</strong> - Drag over the earth to play</p>\n<p><strong>CZAR Health Bar</strong> - Very top right health bar<br/></p>\n<p><strong>PLAYER Health Bar </strong>- Health bar right below Czar's health bar</p>\r\nDifferent Difficulties:\r\n<p><strong>1</strong> - The historic difficulty which is extremely easy to win - almost too easy.</p>\n<p><strong>2 </strong>- Moderately difficult.
