This is a game about a young adult, staying inside all day, trying to figure things out. Please be aware- there's nothing too explicit or graphic in this game, but it does mention topics and include portrayals of self-harm and suicide, so if you're triggered by such things, then please be careful.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T06:18:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/293/2937383611e0d2ab9c30bacaec85a9c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mythical"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
