Continue Conversing and No One Combusts is a co-op multiplayer game in which players try to defuse a bomb. One player is the defuser, and is\u00a0only able to look at the computer screen and interact with the bomb, while the other player is the expert who cannot see the bomb and\u00a0must read the manual and direct the defuser to correctly disarm the bomb!</p>\n<p>Continue Conversing and No One Combusts is an aptly named clone of the game Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes made by Andrew DiVittorio, Jordan Resin, Miles Rosenthal, Luna Wu, and Mike Zhang. Our version replicates the free-play bomb mode of Keep Talking with the basic modules. All models, code, and textures were made completely by us.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T07:25:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57d/57dac3778ad93476237c67a65f4c00a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Miles Logan", "GoblinRags", "LunaWoolf", "Gyiyg"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
