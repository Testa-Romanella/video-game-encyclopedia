You must jump, double jump and sprint your way through the world in your ever longing desire for cheese, fish and what ever else Babugee desires :)</p>\n<p>This game is in early development - but I want to make this game together with the community. Hence I'm dropping the first \"janky alpha\" here already. It is of course for free as of now, but once it grows into a more complete game I will give it a price.<br/>All and any feedback is greatly appreciated! I really do want to hear your thoughts and feelings on the game :)<br/></p>\n<p>In the first teaser demo, all you can do is jump and look around a small sample level. Babugee, like most cats, is scared of cacti - so you must avoid all the pots with cacti plants!<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>D-pad: move left and right</p>\n<p>Button A: Jump (you can press jump again while in air to double jump)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Who is this \"Babugee\"</strong>? <br/>Well, he is one of our friends beloved cat. Babugee was found abandon on the streets but now lives a healthy life in the posh parts of Switzerland :)<br/>In case you wonder what he looks like in real life, well here he is:<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Our other games</strong><br/>Pop-Pop</p>\n\n\n<p>Fight the mean lurky one-eyed fishes!<br/>Available at https://therussianbeargame.itch.io/pop-pop</p>\n<p>Nom-Nom</p>\n\n\n<p>A classic puzzle game for those with a sweet tooth!<br/>Available at https://therussianbeargame.itch.io/nom-nom</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T14:21:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/665/665368bd0d8a6f402a98cfa3159da95f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["therussianbeargame"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
