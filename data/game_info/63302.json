Find it and knock it down from the parrot\u2019s precarious perches so your cat can eat.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCat Food is a VR knockdown game. You are piloting a tiny rail car with a gigantic slingshot and, hopefully, enough ammunition to recover all of your cat's delicious food.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nA regular play through will involve selecting your ammunition type, aiming with your giant slingshot, and knocking blocks over in order to retrieve pieces off cat food. You can move your rail cart back and forth along the track in order to get a better angle on what you are aiming for.  Once you have knocked down each piece on a level you will move on to the next scenario. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game also includes a built-in level editor where you can place chose and place blocks, select the players ammunition, and place cat food.  You can save and share each level individually, or combine them into a set of chapters to create a story all your own for others to play through.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:56:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d0/8d01144682c503d9945459e6081aca16.jpg", "website": "http://www.intelligentprocedure.com/catfood.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Intelligent Procedure"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Intelligent Procedure"], "esrb_rating": null}
