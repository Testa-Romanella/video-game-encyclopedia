Once ready, the creator of the room can start the game! If you have the bomb, collide into another player to give them the bomb and then flee - if you don't have the bomb, then be sure to run and hide!</p>\n<p>Once dead, you become a ghost and can support whoever you want by getting close to them and cheering with the <strong>spacebar</strong>. Cheering gives nearby players a speed boost for a short time, so be sure to cheer loud and proud! The game ends when one monster is left standing, and will close the lobby after a short period of time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T07:41:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b6/7b6825ebab519036d5cd0d9dc7207ef6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sepheal", "Slapeyy", "CharlesAnz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
