This is just not what I expected to happen during the last week that I had here at Zongbee University. It was supposed to be a swift and easy week, I\u2019ve even been planning it since the first week I got here after all! At the very least I hope that you and I can get my little incident fixed before the deadline Friday!\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Even though this is certainly going to be a week without rest, I\u2019ll get through it.\u00a0</strong></em></p>\n<p>Romance, deadlines, the living dead, and a corgi. ZomB+ is an in-development visual novel following Kane as he traverses his last week in Zongbee University trying to piece together his scrambled thesis paper to graduate. Throughout the week, he must visit multiple locations to try and save his grade and secure his graduation. Only one thing might stand in Kane\u2019s way: the campus is overrun with zombies. There are many different paths that Kane can go down. Choose from a variety of choices that will dictate how the story unravels and shifts. Your choices will determine what is at the end of his story!</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy playing the versions of the game that we release as much as we enjoyed making them. So we cannot stress how much we wish to thank you for playing!</p>\n<p>The ZomB+ Team</p>Installation Steps\r\nPC\r\n<ol><li>Extract the ZIP file</li><li>Run <em>zomb.exe</em></li></ol>\r\nMac\r\n<ol><li>Right-click on <em>zomb</em></li><li>Select <em>Open</em></li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T08:38:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a87/a871e24ac75c49363456deba557e8181.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jay"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
