Stepping outside, you find a barren landscape of rocks and dust, distant ruins in the pale morning sun. High above, on looming cliffs, a ruined temple stands abandoned, sealed. What lies within? <br/><br/>Her voice echoes in your mind, a whisper...<br/><br/>'It's been so long, since I had a visitor...'<br/><br/>The path is long forgotten, seldom trodden. Will you find the way?<br/><br/>Developed by solo indie game developer Recluse Industries, Separation is first person adventure at its most ambient and atmospheric. A meditation on solitude, loss, and the spiritual path, Separation is a unique journey to a place of epic desolation.<br/><br/>Featuring a sublime electronic soundtrack by Vector Lovers, Separation is the ultimate chill out trip. <br/><br/>Play-through time: around two hours.<br/><br/>1 player<br/>400MB minimum save size<br/>DUALSHOCK\u00ae4<br/>PlayStation\u00aeVR Required<br/>PlayStation\u00aeCamera Required<br/><br/>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com/softwarelicense).
