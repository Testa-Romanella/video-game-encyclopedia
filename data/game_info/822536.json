You are a contestant in the arena of dice, throwing explosives at your creepy, cubic foes. When you hit them, they go flying, and end up either dead or as a weaker tier of enemy. Survive as long as possible!\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>A controller is highly recommended. Use Left stick / WASD to move, right stick / left and right arrow keys to turn, and X button / space to attack. The longer you hold attack, the further you throw your explosive!\r\n</p>\n<p>Third-party Assets</p>\n<p>Bungee-Regular font from Google Fonts, published under the Open Font License.</p>\n<p>See this project's Github page for the source code!\u00a0https://github.com/the-alex-g/PolyhedralArena/tree/1.0.0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T16:49:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e11/e11ed374ac8dbf370414319d47586276.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["the-alex-g"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
