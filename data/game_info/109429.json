We're planning to polish the game a bit further, so expect some updates along the way, but we'd love to hear your feedback\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe game blends a digital interface which is unbiased towards rules with a need for attention towards social cues and body language in a physical space. Players assume the roles of high schoolers who spend a week playing hooky in the woods, but little do they know that this simple innocuous getaway will turn sour once an curse begins to spread through the group.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAmong these high school archetypes is a hidden traitor, a twisted soul who calls the Necromancer's Manual their own - their goal is to secretly curse half of the group, while the others must find out who the Traitor is by using their character-specific roles and perform a ritual that will be deadly to a mere mortal.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<strong>MAJOR UPDATE INCOMING</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>COME BACK LATER</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Update already has:<br/>\n</strong>- Fixed random Networking disconnections<br/>\r\n\t- Re-connection after disconnection\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t- Random Eventz when choosing the tent (allows balanced 3 player experience)\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Yet to do:</strong><br/>\r\n\t- Translation into German (maybe more languages as well)\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t- New Font\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t- Release on Google Play (Later App-store)\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t- Probably we will find more stuff that has to be done\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b08/b08e18f2968460f62f09519f8402579e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["coinflip"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
