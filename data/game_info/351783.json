This is a collection of vignette games about those dates, and the comedy that comes with getting to know someone.<br />\nWhat the heck do you DO in these games?<br />\nIn We Met in May, you play as Nina while she&#39;s hanging out with her love interest, Jake. Nina and Jake get into various shenanigans together, which you play through as Nina. On one date, you may end up burying Jake in sand, chips and wine. On another, he may cook dinner for you! Each game is unique, and explores a different date between the two characters.<br />\nWho are these games for?<br />\nEveryone! But specifically, people who enjoy romantic comedy, small games, character-driven stories and just... funny stuff in general will probably enjoy this collection.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-07T18:38:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b41/b41a076f763c2751850c38662fd95d95.jpg", "website": "http://ninasays.so/may/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 2, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Nina Freeman", "Jake Jefferies", "Ryan Yoshikami"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
