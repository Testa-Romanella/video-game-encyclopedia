It's a 2D platformer with\u00a0 metroidvania concepts. This is just a small prototype, feel free to enjoy the trip!\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>You can see controls IN-GAME by pressing ESC key =&gt; Controls\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This version is designed for Keyboard + Mouse!<br/></p>\n<p>Gamepad\u00a0<strong>SHOULD </strong>work :D</p>\n<p>You can save progress and continue later,\u00a0 Game will save whenever you rest at an altar, and whenever you gain a new ability :)</p>\n<p>The proto should take between 30-50min to complete :D\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game concept is originally designed to run in Windows/Desktop, but since the prototype handles a smaller scope, this was not-that-hard to make WebGL\u00a0(thus browsers) compatible, we're still testing the web version, watch out for bugs!!!</p>\n<p>More to come!
