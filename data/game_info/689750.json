I could not for the life of me work out how Unity and C# works and thus most game mechanics were left incomplete or scrapped entirely. So, please forgive me for the screaming pile of horse excrement (in terms of mechanics and more specifically the lack of) of a game that I will now ask you to play. The main menu was built and worked in the editor but once the game was built, the Start button decided it didn't want to work and as a result, the menu was scrapped. There's no respawn for the character so if you fall to your death, you may as well actually enter hell as they'll be more to do. The enemies won't harm you and there is no end screen as I could not get collision to work at all in Unity (and am now going to avoid Unity forever)</p>\n<p>But after all of that, please play the game so you can experience the awesome music a team member made for the game and the beautiful art the art team developed:)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T08:48:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5bc/5bcb7711c745eebd5878fbeb7a4cc264.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["oktobermist", "Ben Short(up2059562)", "Matthew(2057343)", "up2067409@myport.ac.uk"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
