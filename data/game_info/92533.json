Supporting us in these crucial early days of public facing development where we\u00a0<strong>shake out the true form of the game</strong>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\r\nWho are we?\r\n<p>Jellyfish Games is <strong>four developers</strong> brought together by a vision. We've been busting our chops for years on our own dime to get Astrobase Command to it's current shape.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We initially ran an unsuccessful Kickstarter campaign back in '13, which only meant taking the longer road. We've been working on it ever since, putting out weekly updates along the way and growing our great community.</p>\n<p>In May '17 we ran a second <strong>Kickstarter </strong>campaign to take us to Alpha.\u00a0This time <strong>it was successful</strong>! So here we are!</p>\n\n\n\r\nWhat now?\r\n<p>With the <strong>game publicly available</strong> we can have a real dialogue with fans about what actually exists, and not just spouting unverifiable claims of awesomeness. The proof of the pudding is in the eating (or in our case, playing).</p>\n<p>This means that you as a supporter can <strong>get your hands on the latest build today.</strong> Join in now so your feedback has real impact on existing and upcoming features. Support us in the hunt for bugs as we add in more features to what is already a perfectly playable game. Take part in our efforts to change what and how games are made.</p>\n<p><strong>Oh, and here's some info about the game;</strong></p>\n\r\nWhat kind of leader will <strong>you</strong> be?\r\n<p>Astrobase Command is a <strong>player-driven procedural space station builder and management simulation game with a focus on characters with deep personalities. </strong>Where you can feel what it's really like to have the power and responsibilities of command.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Astrobase Command is not your grandfathers procedural game - not only are procedural characters and personalities entirely possible, but <strong>it's the only way to have true interactivity</strong>. Not having the NPC pick off a table of pre-authored responses lets our characters be more than one-dimensional cardboard cutouts constantly repeating the same three lines.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What this actually means is that<strong> in Astrobase Command your crew live their lives on your station</strong>. They have unique personalities that affect and are affected by the situations they face. They make friends, enemies, and even romantic relationships.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>With limited resources you decide what your crew does. You decide where they sleep, where they work, what they build, who get's recruited, what they do for fun, and who goes on missions.</p>\n\r\nWhy First Access?\r\n<p>Astrobase Command is a unique and original game with a whole lot of seriously innovative systems and gameplay. This means we want to spend more time making sure that we get it just right than you would with the average game.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>We will continuously update the game with new and upgraded features, bugfixes, polish, balancing, and more. </strong>This means players who join us in First\u00a0Access will get to help us shape the experience as we close in first in beta and then full release.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nClosed Alpha?
