Since I have zero programming knowledge and can't understand code, Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) with its Blueprint system provided me with the opportunity to try my hand at creating a game that I love. I am extremely grateful to UE5 engine for this.<br/><br/>During the development process, I conducted testing by releasing a game full of bugs on the Steam platform. I received a lot of help from player friends who patiently tested the game and provided suggestions. I am truly, truly thankful for their support.<br/><br/>The version currently online is still very basic, with professions, skills, equipment, materials, enemies, and maps continuously being added. The game itself definitely has many issues, and I hope everyone can understand and provide feedback so that I can make continuous improvements and adjustments.<br/><br/>After the official version is released, the testing version will not be canceled and will continue to be updated. However, the official version will be given priority for updates, with the testing version being updated once a month. <br/><br/>Apart from the difference in update timing, the leaderboards between the two versions will not be connected, and the testing version will not participate in future reward activities. However, there will be no difference in gameplay and content between the two versions.<br/><br/>For those who are willing to support me, you can purchase the official version, and I am sincerely grateful for your support.<br/><br/>Below is the introduction to the game itself:<br/><br/>\"Main Deity Space\" is a small game inspired by games like \"Vampire Survivors\" and \"Diablo\".<br/>The main theme is killing monsters, farming equipment, leveling up, drawing cards, farming materials, crafting equipment, upgrading followers, collecting pets, and so on.<br/><br/>Accidentally traversing into the realm of the Main Deity, embark on an endless cycle of slaughter.

The Main Deity's space also facilitates the exchange of various items, including gems, equipment, enhancement materials, and even skill upgrades.<br/><br/>You can also craft various needed materials, totems, and even followers through the Main Deity.<br/><br/>At the same time, the Main Deity also provides a storage vault, allowing you to save items before embarking on an adventure.
