(2019)\u00a0<em>Title of Research</em>. CC6001-40 Practice Based Project. Bath Spa University. Unpublished report - Report available on request.)</p>\n<p>This report aims to research how soft skills are beneficial to children and how storytelling is a good way to convey information about these soft skills to the children. The report also looks at eBooks versus traditional reading and how they can be used in schools as teaching tools. Interactivity is also a big part of teaching children different information and this report aims to look into how. To work alongside the online research an interactive story was developed to test children to see how it could help them to understand soft skills.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T17:42:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9f/c9f6aa089783ace59dded0076ac995c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ChloeLB"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
