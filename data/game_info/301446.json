But to do so, you can only count on five lives, various powers and your own skill.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You control a spaceship firing various types of lasers, depending on your progress in the game. Gain more firepower as you kill bosses, and collect special powers to deal more damage or protect yourself from the constant waves of enemies.<br/><br/>The Highscore is a pure arcade game developped around the \"Die and Retry\" concept. You shoot, you survive and you go as far as you can. When your life drops to zero, the game ends and your score is saved if your total number of points collected during the game exceeds your previous highscore.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:47:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cde/cde8f68603f26d9e285d736ec94166d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FredericDrago", "Frederic Drago"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Frederic Drago"], "esrb_rating": null}
