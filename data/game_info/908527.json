It's made entirely in raymarching and it's very short.</p>\n<p>It might take a minute to load, so don't worry if you just have black screen with music playing at the start.</p>\n<p>The theme of the jam was \"Another Dimension\" so I decided to go for something as otherworldly as possible, visually speaking.<br/></p>\n<p>There are a lot of things I didn't get time to finish or polish like the map not having physical limits are that damn cursor still showing... Also, the enemy AI isn't great.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls :\r\n    </p>\n<p>WASD to move\r\n    </p>\n<p>Mouse to attack nearby enemies (if they're weaker than you)\r\n    </p>\n<p>R to restart (if all enemies remaining are stronger than you, you can't win) <br/></p>\n<p>Note : the enemies' placement and relative strength are randomized at  the start. So you might get a bit easier or harder playthrough each  time.</p>\n\n<p>It is a bit performance heavy, I recommend playing it with Google Chrome. I made a gameplay video just in case : </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T12:20:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1fa/1faec2693da689f56cf0ec8c284e7dc6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Seldon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
