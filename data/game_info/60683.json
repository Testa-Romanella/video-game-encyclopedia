In SimCity, one builds a city and views its functioning based on simulation. In ElectricVLab, you build electric and electronic circuits and view their functioning based on simulation. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nElectricVLab offers a great collection of analog and digital electronic components to build the circuits. It employs 3D graphics, visual effects, and animations to provide informative, visually rich feedback about the functioning of the circuits. In addition to  regular electronic components, ElectricVLab also contains a variety of fun components such as fireworks, flames, fountains etc. Altogether, ElectricVLab makes the exploration of electricity and electronics fun, while also being educational.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92a/92a1a7aa8683810793d3d1e5b8298075.jpg", "website": "http://www.electricvlab.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["QuaSci Labs"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["QuaSci Labs"], "esrb_rating": null}
