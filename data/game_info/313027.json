When you touch something terrible and get hurt, a lil dark part of you(I call it \"a spirit\") will be generated.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wait those lil spirits became bright and click right mouse to recycle them.<br/>Remember, you have to get close to recycle each one of the spirits. Only after clearing all your souls, you can get to the next level. (Btw, I only made 2 levels this time.)</p>\n<p>So, good luck.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-29T04:23:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c4/7c42a11b38157fae46bc2d67dd2b3c6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["TasteLight"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
