I only knew about the jam a few days ago so I'm very happy I managed to finish it. (Just excuse it if it's a little buggy in places).</p>\n<p>Feel free to comment with thoughts, constructive opinions... and of course your high scores!</p>\n\n<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Clean off the dust that collects on the furniture to gain the most points within the time limit. The faster you clean off the dust once it begins to accumulate, the more points you receive.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Beware of dust bunnies!!</em></strong> If you allow dust to accumulate for too long, dust bunnies will form. These will deplete your score heavily once they arrive. You cannot get rid of dust bunnies unless you have a specific tool, so it's best to clean quickly to avoid them forming in the first place.</p>\n<p>As you progress, you will be given new cleaning tools. Different furniture requires different tools to clean effectively. For example, the cloth is great for cleaning standard furniture, but you might want to think about using the feather duster for those tricky to reach areas above head height! ;)</p>\n<p>How high can you score? And can you keep your score up during the \"bunny pit\" that is Level 15??</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><em>Move - <em>player follows mouse</em></em></p>\n<p><em>Clean - left mouse button\u00a0<em>when in front of dusty object (must be equipped with correct cleaning tool)</em></em></p>\n<p><em>Switch tool - choose tool using 1, 2 and 3 buttons at top of keyboard (not the numpad)</em></p>\n<p><em>Switch</em><em> off music - button on lower right of title screen</em></p>\n\n<p>All art, programming, design, UI, FX etc by ceprotypes.</p>\n<p>Music created in Beepbox.com.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T19:45:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19a/19aa3003dab68e018831fe853556c013.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ceprotypes"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
