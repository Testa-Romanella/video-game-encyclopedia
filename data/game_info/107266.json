{"id": 107266, "slug": "slizer-bms", "name": "Slizer: BMS", "name_original": "Slizer: BMS", "description": "<p>\r\n\tSlizer: BMS is a <strong>Real Time Tactics </strong>game with a <strong>sci-fi</strong> setting and a symbolic minimalist art style. It takes traditional RTS gameplay and <strong>removes economy and intense micro</strong> in favour of <strong>more complex movement and combat</strong>. The options menu allows the player to turn off these options for a more standard RTS experience.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tGameplay consists of two stages: in the <strong>Planning stage</strong> you pre-select units, place them in formations and set their directions, equip them with weapons, armors, and special features, and issue starting orders. In the <strong>combat stage</strong> you play as a traditional RTS but with added features emphasising positioning and trade offs between accuracy, speed, evasion, damage, and other factors. It also promotes the set up of traps and pre-empting enemy strategies.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe game contains a story campaign, a highly tactical aircraft only campaign, randomised fleet battles, and a permadeath mode. There are 40+ player units and two enemy factions.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOther than a few unfound bugs, some missing sound effects and a rework on the story campaign, the game is mostly complete. It will be released for free on Steam, and a paid sequel with a higher budget will be made after. I am looking for any feedback you may have (especially negative feedback) and any bugs you may find.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b6/2b67a485cb145e777bbf219ce0f1834f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["slizer88"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
