Your fallen crewmates are roaming the ship, and in their hazy state, will attack you upon sight. Avoid them at all costs, and if found, use your torchlight to blind them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T11:03:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8c/e8c37181f0653704bc6ac75f8cadd9d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jc", "dylankwok"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
