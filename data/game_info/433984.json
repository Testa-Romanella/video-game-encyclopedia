Little did they know of the havoc that that AI would wreak upon their RPG!</p>\n<p>---------------------------</p>\n<p>I wanted to add more (and ESPECIALLY in the sound department), but for my first game jam entry and my first really story-driven game, I'm quite proud of this and am positive that I can expand upon a great many of the mechanics hinted at here!\u00a0</p><p>(Yes, I tactually took the 15 minutes I needed to make Chameleon's Lo-Fi song using\u00a0 Sampulator.com, but didn't allocate any time for redoing my crappy SFX otherwise.
