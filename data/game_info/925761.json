Can you hear me? I'm sorry for the radio silence over the past year or so. I've tried my hand at making many projects, all of which have either failed or have been put on an infinite hiatus status. However, I have finally defeated my monumental game development block by \"cheating the system.\" I find I have a hard time focusing on 1 really long adventure game. So to circumvent this, why not make 5 short adventure (lovingly referred to as \"shortventures!\") games instead? That is what Superplanet KG is. I hope this planet is fun for you to experience. Creating it has given me life. So, let me tell you....<br/></p>\r\nWHAT IS THERE TO DO ON SUPERPLANET KG!!!!!\r\n<p>I'm glad you asked.</p>\n\r\n\"Monmouth Has Frozen Over And So Have I\"\r\n\n<p><em>\"I'm so hungry.\"</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>\"The world froze over about 1 year ago.\"</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>\"We're almost out of rations.\"<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Find\u00a0what\u00a0is\u00a0out\u00a0there\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0frozen\u00a0desolate\u00a0world.<br/></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the first shortventure that escaped the pages of my design document and into GMS. As the genre name suggests, it isn't very long, and will take first time players about 15-30 minutes to beat. Featuring a small little story that builds off of a little lore in the first MONMOUTH game, 2 worlds and a boss, I hope you enjoy this game.<br/></p>\n\n<em>\"Wait a second!!!! Where are the other games???? There's only one here!!!!!\"</em>\n<p>If\u00a0it\u00a0wasn't\u00a0obvious, I\u00a0am\u00a0slowly\u00a0developing\u00a0these\u00a0games.
