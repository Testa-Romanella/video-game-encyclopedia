Not only are most forced to work for and support their empire, but everyone is now being shoved into cramped housing with 24/7 monitoring.</p>\n<p>You and a group known only as The Fragmented have refused to obey the rules, and you find yourself shacked up in an old tavern on an ancient computer with restricted but secure internet access. Here you must assemble a team of up to 6 mercenaries to seek out high-ranking members of the tyrannical companies, \u201cextract\u201d information, and follow a trail that hopefully leads to the toppling of their hierarchy.</p>\n<p>Set in a cyberpunk version of Chicago, your vigilantes will traverse the city, exploring and fighting in broken down areas in a first person perspective akin to that of classic RPGs still being played today.</p>\n<p>Note: Only runs in fullscreen 1920x1080 right now!
