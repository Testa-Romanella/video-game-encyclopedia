If you are close by, message me, let's Game Jam together sometimes. :D<br/></p><p>This is the very first game I made without a tutorial.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The game has some known issues, the way I handled collision between player and obstacle was very hacky, and it shows while you play. At the time I was making it I only cared about actually completing the game in time and having something working to upload.\u00a0\u00a0I kept in mind this was my very first project, and there is no need to hold my self to unrealistic standards. Things can only get better from here. I've decided to keep joining as many Game Jams as I have time to join since they seam to be a way to force your self to rapidly learn and reinforce already learned concepts.<br/></p><p>While making this, I learned how to use CAT rigging and animation system inside 3Ds Max 2017. While I know how to model and texture in 3Ds Max, I have never rigged and animated.</p>\n<p>This game jam also made me reinforce many things I already knew how to do inside Unity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11b/11b7b810cb477e02ed2330c115cec168.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sunny Apples"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
