The game takes you on a quest to liberate the chickens from wicked Consumers. Currently, the game is in early access demo.</p>\n<p><strong>What exactly is this game?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>It's a 2D platformer mixed with a shooter - at times you will simply jump from platform to another, avoiding traps. At other times, you're going to confront the enemies. Take aim and fire! Just be mindful - which weapon to use? Maybe conserve ammo and fight bare winged? Or maybe you can simply run right past through? You decide!</p>\n<p><strong>So what's the story?</strong></p>\n<p>In the future, the evil people, called the Consumers, will rise to power and exploit the livestock to the fullest. But a few chickens will not have that! Join the resistance group and show those Consumers, who the real Immense Threat is!</p>\n<p><strong>Anything else?
