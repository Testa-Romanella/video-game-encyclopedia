There is an Algorithm that watches everything you do and say. It was built to protect 'National Security', but it was designed to watch out for and protect ordinary people, like yourself.</p>\n<p>When people fall through the cracks, that's where you step in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Concerned Third Party is a Powered by Charge game based on <em>Person of Interest</em>. It uses a streamlined version of Forged in the Dark rules to tell the story of an Admin, an Operator, and the Algorithm that shows them who to protect.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's up to them to determine whether their Target is in danger, or if they are <strong><em>a</em></strong> danger.</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p><em>This is an Ashcan Edition</em>, <em>which includes all of the core rules and some sample Conspiracies. I am publishing this as-is for now, but may return for further development in the future if there's interest.</em></p>\n<p><em>I would eventually like to include Sample Cases, more Player Abilities, and potentially more ways for Conspiracies to interact. As well as pay for some editing and potentially some sensitivity reading.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-05T01:58:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5aa/5aae8b84570273975285b236d02292bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["theinstagrahame"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
