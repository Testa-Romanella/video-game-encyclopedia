This is <strong>not a bullet hell</strong> where you need to dodge hails of bullets and patterns. Don't get complacent though, enemies will return fire. A well placed shot could ruin your timing and let that pesky missile drone through.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>ROGUELIKEY RUNS</strong><br/>Damage to the mothership is permanent, and if it's destroyed, you start from the beginning. Going for repairs will pass up extra cash or shiny new equipment.

You will be like a flying swiss army knife, picking the right tool for the job at the right time. There are always multiple solutions available for any situation. it will be up to you how you spend your limited resources in each level.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>OVERKILL</strong><br/>Pump excess lead into your enemies and see them explode into chunks of <strong>deadly shrapnel</strong> that can take out even more enemies. Get style points for chaining kills.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>TAKE A WINGMAN</strong><br/>Two-player co-op locally with controllers and keyboard. You can even play on the same keyboard (n-key rollover recommended)!<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>A SCI-FI CALAMITY</strong><br/>The Artificial Scientific Discovery Intelligence has gone rogue. In control of a massive facility with full fabrication capabilities, it constructed itself rockets and lifted off into space. It is now raiding nearby human settlements with swarms of drones for resources, presumably to further science at an unprecedented rate.
