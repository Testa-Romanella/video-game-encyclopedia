You will have to solve difficult puzzles to continue with the story and the game.\"</p>\r\n\r\nEthereum is a first person puzzle-horror scape game inspired in the streets and the art of japan mixed with a futuristic style. Many films like Blade Runner or Memoirs of a Geisha worked as inspiration to make the aesthetics.\u00a0\n\n\n<p><strong>The game is located in Japan in the year 3088, when the world has been consumed by machines and material things. The story is one of the main elements, so you'll find many things that will make you remember the memories of a geisha that you will know perhaps at the end of the game.</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>You'll see that bad things, that are related to the humanity and in part with the capitals sins. And, to the other part, a person (the geisha) that is scared and seeks revenge because she believes that is what she should do, because that\u2019s what the human being has taught her.<br/></strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Geisha means artist, person (sha) who masters an art (gei). In Ethereum we\u2019ll show to the world the truth about geishas, and the art that they were doing. There\u2019s always a untold and dark history between everything that isn\u2019t supposed to be bad. Like whoever in this world has a bad part.\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Explore a dystopian cyberpunk future \u00b7\u00a0<strong>Solve puzzles to know Geisha's purpose</strong>\u00a0and history\u00a0</em></strong><br/></p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>---- UPDATED TO V1.1 ----</p>\n<p>+ ATM Screen is now fixed.
