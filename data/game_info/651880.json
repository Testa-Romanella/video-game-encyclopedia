Now he's floating in space and needs YOUR help to get him out of this\u00a0pickle!<br/></p>\n<p>Well, getting him out of this pickle will have to wait for part two, because right now, Samuel is fighting for his life. Everybody knows that snakes can't survive long in space without apples, so its up to you to help him safely navigate the asteroid fields to eat enough apples to get back to Earth.</p>\n<p>NOTE: Although the game might mention \"space snakes\" several times, Samuel is an Earth snake, and that's why he needs apples to survive in space. Sorry, I guess everyone knows that, so I'll quit patronising you. Oh, he's also capable of shooting lasers out of his body due to being exposed to more radiation than usual. All snakes exposed to high doses of cosmic radiation gain this ability - look it up!</p>\n<p><strong><em>CONTROLS</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>WASD / Left Stick\u00a0- Awkward Earth snake in space movement</p>\n<p>Left, Right / L1, R1 - Shoot lasers out of snake's\u00a0left or right (3 segments or more!)</p>\n\n<p>Good Luck!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T23:38:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbc/bbcfafac248633c00c37693a71115184.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["MrFlamey"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
