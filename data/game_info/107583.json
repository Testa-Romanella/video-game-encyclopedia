With vibrant and clashing personalities, will everything work out? Who will Death end up with? Will she stop yelling at everyone all the time? Will Pestilence make more horrid puns?<br/></p><p>Update 4/9/2017:</p><p>Hey, Vince here. I know a couple of you have asked so I'm gonna do a short update. Jaime and I have been working on the game but it's been slow given other creative projects/life stuff (school related stuff for Jaime and me starting a new job). We discuss what we want to do with Flirting w/ Death often but don't always get a chance to work on it. </p><p>The concrete stuff; </p><p>-the game's first chapter is finished and we've moved on to the individual routes</p><p>-the endings have been fully outlined and we're working with the idea of not having set good/bad/neutral endings. Instead we're looking at doing two endings for each character with their own overarching theme instead of a concrete \"you got the good end/you got the bad end\" etc. </p><p>The not concrete stuff; </p><p>-We're not sure when this is gonna be done. It all depends on how our lives end up. We spit-balled summer 2018 but who knows when it'll actually be. This is the first long term project either of us has worked on so it's a little daunting. </p><p>Thanks for your patience with all this. As always you can get in touch with Jaime on Twitter @potatofuzz and myself @AStuffyMuffin </p><p>Thank you again,</p><p>Vince </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f7/7f7c1c5261fabdc6aba2f4fe1987ee1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Potatofuzz"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
