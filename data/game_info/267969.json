Each level is a set amount of time (a year, a few years, etc.). As you progress through the levels, the stage will update to hold your memories of events passed. Different events will add or take away certain towers. Breakups/Falling out with friends will remove some towers available, but promotions or marriage(s) will add new ones.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b8/2b84352e9e7669f76e69936d74b3ce18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["yliu180"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
