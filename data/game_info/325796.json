In PB &amp; J Picnic, the player moves both Mr. Peanut Butter and Ms. Jelly around the picnic table. But they always move opposite of each other.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So in this tiny mirror movement game, you must maneuver PB &amp; J to both land on their respective orbs at the same time\u00a0to score points. At any point, you can move them\u00a0to the same tile to connect,\u00a0making a sandwich and winning the level, allowing you to store the points you've earned.</p>\n<p>If you run out of time or fall off the picnic table (gross! Who wants to eat food off the ground?), you'll lose the level and any points you've gained in that level.</p>\n<p>You do not need to collect any\u00a0orbs to make a sandwich. The points you get from orbs let you access more levels.\u00a0There are 5 in total.\u00a0Collect all the orbs to get a little prize!</p>\n<p>This game was made by Luke Pierson and Austen Kinney in 4 days during the Extra Credits Game Jam 4.</p>\n<p>---CONTROLS---</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys: Move/Select Level</p>\n<p>Space: Begin Level/Retry/Continue</p>\n<p>Escape: Exit Level/Quit Game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T17:58:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb5/fb58a630cbfa843fe133a7083afd11c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bifflestein"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
