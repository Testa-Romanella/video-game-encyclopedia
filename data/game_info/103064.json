You are the President of the world's foremost economic and military superpower, the United States of America.</p>\n<p>Your aim is to achieve peace and prosperity, and to avoid economic crises at home and military conflicts abroad. You are responsible not just for the United States and its own prosperity, but also for peace and order in the whole world. Sorry, but there's no way to escape your responsibility for foreign affairs, and no way to insulate the USA from the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>The game covers the years from 1977 to 2024, a dramatic period in the history of the United States and the whole world. Almost everything has changed (or will change) during that time. But for better or for worse? That depends on your decisions, as you are about to take part in writing the annals of history.</p>\n<p>If you think that Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, G.W. Bush or Barack Obama made mistakes, you have the chance to be a better president in an alternative history. Good luck!</p>\n<p>NB: </p>\n<p>(1) Updated versions for Mac and Android with minor bug fixes have been added on 17.
