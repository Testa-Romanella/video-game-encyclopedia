Each will roll their dice against each other to determine the outcome. So lands with more dice have a higher chance of winning the attack or defense. If the attack succeeds, the land will be taken over with the amount of dice the attacker had minus one, which will remain behind. If the attack fails, the attacker will be reduced to one die.<br/>After the turn ends, the player receives one die per land of the greatest connected landmass. Avoid getting cut, and try to cut off your opponents!<br/><br/>Make alliances with players, and bust other alliances.
