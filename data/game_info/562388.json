The idea was to create an introspective game about working with \"other versions\" of yourself to solve puzzles where a single self is not enough. With more time I would have liked to add more of these story elements and better puzzles but experimenting with mechanics got the better of me. There are only two worlds currently as the planned third one didn't make it in time. Thanks for playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T10:28:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5bd/5bd5e489d7a8fa2bfd4b8de4d21f0c66.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["shhwing"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
