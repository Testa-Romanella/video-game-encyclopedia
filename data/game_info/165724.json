Wet wood turns to dry wood, emitting smoke. Dry wood turns to\u00a0coal, emitting wood-gas, seen as flames.\u00a0Coal turns to\u00a0glow, emitting sparks. Glow turns to ash. Watch logs burn away. Keep the fire going by adding wood, or kick back and set to the unreliable auto mode. Don't\u00a0add too many logs at once or they float in the air.</p>\n<p>You enjoy cozy digital fires?
