I challenged myself to fully develop a game from scratch in 7 days. This is the result! Criticism is appreciated - I'm not a game design major or even a coding major, I'm doing this for fun, but I want to be able to make\u00a0cool stuff! If you like it, definitely leave a comment! I love knowing that people enjoy my creations!</p>\n<p>This little game is inspired by PS1 style horror games, mainly Silent Hill, but also a lot of itch.io horror games I've played and loved.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>w, a, s, d - move<br/></p>\n<p>left ctrl - sprint</p>\n<p>That's it.\u00a0 Collect all 100 coins. Just try not to anger anything...</p>\n<p>Please keep in mind, there may be quite a few bugs. I tried to iron out as much as I could, but I wanted to stick to my 7-day limit.</p>\n<p>Also note, there are no options or settings. EDIT: pressing 1 will toggle the normal camera exposure, and pressing 2 will set the exposure a little higher, for those with dim/dark monitors.</p>\n\n<p>PS. There's a reason there are so many campfires... Perhaps they're not just for decoration? The monster will avoid going near fires. They're safe spaces for the first half of the game. Once they die out, they're no longer safe. This is compensated for by making the player's stamina regenerate twice as fast as before.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T07:45:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/879/8792992188e8b47b9f006cf00ed9626c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pyruus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
