There is a bunch of stuff playable here but it's not balanced, a lot of it is broken, and there is no online play.\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, it's still pretty fun. I think this game has a lot of great ideas and maybe one day I will make something like it again. Or someone will come along and give me 100k so I can finish it. We just don't know.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Developing a fighting game is one thing. Making your money back is another. Managing a community to keep the game alive\u00a0is yet another thing. That is, if you ask me, too many things to take care of while being 1 person with a full time job and other stuff to do. You understand. Anyway, please enjoy. Or don't. Don't let me tell you what to do.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T05:41:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f9/4f9291597e9d8aa6eabf178e7655fc9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gutter Arcade"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
