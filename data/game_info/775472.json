They live in harmony with each other in kingdoms divided among each animal. The High Tree is host to a settlement of beavers who live among dams and eat fish. In it lives Dusty, who has a knack for the slingshot. All was well in The High Tree kingdom until one particularly large beaver, who goes by the name Truckee, wanted to destroy it all. Knowing that the three dams located in strategically selected areas are critical to the survival of the beavers from The High Tree, Truckee destroyed them and scattered the logs necessary for their construction across the realm, making it extremely difficult for the beavers of the kingdom to recover. His intentions were known, but his reasons weren\u2019t. And he\u2019s not alone either. Truckee employed soldiers from other kingdoms to help aid him in his plan for catastrophe. Members from the koala, dog, and bear clans banded together under Truckee\u2019s cause, allowing him to spread his devastation across the kingdom. Sensing unwarranted and total destruction, Dusty knew it would be him that needed to stop Truckee and his evil minions before it was too late.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T10:05:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b1/1b135976f081ffdfbb5d949fe9508f10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["manny0730"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
