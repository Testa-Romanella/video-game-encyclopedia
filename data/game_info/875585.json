This is our first major crack at 3D game development and using the Godot engine. Our goal with this project was to create an action shooter with mystery puzzle solving mechanics. We were able to get the puzzle mechanics working but ran out of time for combat. We have plans to continue working on this project, adding mythological creatures to our Victorian-steampunk setting, more puzzles, areas and bosses. Gameplay is inspired by Resident Evil, Silent Hill, Undying and Bloodborne.\r\n </p>\n<p>For now, however, this is a preview of the game in it\u2019s current state. You can currently make it to the manor, but once you pass the gate there\u2019s only exploration to be had.\r\n </p>\n<p>Enjoy!  :]\r\n </p>\n<p>Devs: Chris (3D models, programming), Jessie(game design, level design) and Josh (shaders, fixing all the broken things)\r\n </p>\n<p>P.S. For those having trouble opening the gate:\r\n </p>\n<p>Read the notes &amp; your journal carefully and follow the trail of clues within them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T13:40:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d48/d4889d22dcdb8452a0642dd506c22acd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KingKarl"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
