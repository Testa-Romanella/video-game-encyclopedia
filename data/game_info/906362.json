There were quite a few planned features that I just couldn't quite squeeze in, but the game is\u00a0<em>playable\u00a0</em>and has a level timer so I suppose you could get some replay value from\u00a0 speed running those levels.</p>\n<p>I may still add some more features, but this is it for the game jam version.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T09:12:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a1/1a1e3718b50f3460ac6ee388139118c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tk_Dev_96"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
