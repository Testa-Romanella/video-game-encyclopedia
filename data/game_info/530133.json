Thanks to the Game Dev Underground team for organizing the Dec 2020\u00a0 weekend Game Jam.</p>\n<p>Since the game jam theme was 2020, I decided to create a simple retro game with a walking theme, since it felt like daily walks and hikes were all I got to do in 2020. Walks are relaxing right? Not in 2020 :(</p>\n<p>Use your WASD keys to move around, avoiding the mask-less people and traffic. You'll gain stress if you get too close to someone or get hit by a vehicle. Fill your stress meter and it's game over! Pick up a power-up to remove some stress. Press ESC to pause.</p>\n<p>I had planned on implementing other enemies - fire, murder hornets, election-deniers and UFOs but didn't have time to add these. A player goal would have been nice, such as picking up shopping but, for now, the screen will gradually get busier and the only way to complete the game is to lose - hey, it's 2020!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T09:26:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f0/3f06ac107395100a290787e102d587ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PixelShenanigans"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
