Yasmine always was the highlight of your day - the best friend who could lift your mood with the mischievous lilt of her lips, the partner-in-crime who would laugh the hardest whenever you got away with something and would trade all of your stupid jokes with even sillier ones of her own. The confidant who lent an attentive ear to any and all of your secrets\u2026 except one. That you had fallen for her. Hard. That whenever she spoke of her latest crush you would smile a brittle smile as you felt your insides crumble. That you knew your fat self would never number among those crushes, that she would never see you as more than a friend\u2026 that was Yasmine for you: Heaven and Hell in one gorgeous package. Honestly, parting ways with her after graduation was the most bittersweet experience of your young life. As for meeting her again\u2026 you are not quite sure what that will be like.<br/><br/>The years have been more than kind with her - they have been downright generous: she has matured into a beautiful, intelligent, fun woman\u2026 who is married to your best friend. And that might be an even thornier issue than it usually would, seeing as you will be spending a month living with them, all the while trying to navigate your loyalties, morals, and desires and trying not to be too obvious when you leer at Yasmine in her pajamas. Also, maybe you could try to channel that pent-up teenage lust into a more acceptable target? Like that newly divorced woman who keeps showing up or that wannabe influencer with the huge- you know what? This is an emotional, hormone-ridden wreck waiting to happen. I hope you enjoy the ride.<h3>GAMEPLAY</h3><br/>In terms of gameplay, this will be a relationship simulation with free roaming in key locations, interactive dialogs and mild stat building.
