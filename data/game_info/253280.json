Jill was a common clerk in an orbital cargo corporation. Her father, lieutenant of the Pioneer Corps, an organization dedicated to the exploration of new frontiers in deep space, disappeared without a trace in the Serendip-16 system. Jill understands that the expedition sent to find her father still hasn\u2019t investigated anything and suspects that the authorities are deliberately not seeking to put effort into the search operation. So Jill decides to search for the father herself. Actually, she is glad to do away with the gray routine. The employer lets Jill go and even gives her a small spaceship, a spacesuit and some supplies. Jill recalls her combat and pilot skills gained in EYE 7 Online, her beloved VRMMORPG, and sets off.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Arriving at the Serendip-16 system, Jill proceeds to search. Traces of her father are lost here, so she decides to check each of several small, stony planets, revolving around a local red dwarf. Very quickly, the girl discovers that she is not the first here, and not only stalkers from Earth can be found in this place...<br/><br/>Features:Unusual topographyIn this platformer you have to go through a large number of intricate locations - underground tunnels and caves with portals and even some representatives of an unknown ancient civilization.All that is mine, I carry with meYou\u2019ve prepared well before the expedition, taking a pistol (a civil model, but still better than nothing) and also:<br/><br/><ul><li>A portable nanofabrikator which can create various useful objects, including ammunition. The raw materials are minerals and the local fungal form of life, which grows on the arches of the caves. It is likely that in the dungeons you will find more powerful fabricators capable of producing an expanded range of items!<br/></li><li>Grenades which can destroy rocks;<br/></li><li>Jetpack which helps you overcome obstacles;<br/></li><li>And the real miracle of technology: a phase transition generator. It\u2019s an experimental device that Jill was given by her employer after he got to know that she was going to search for her father. With it, you can perform phase transition (an ability to go through material obstacles). However, be careful not to get stuck in the rock - it hurts!</li></ul>Unusual plotIn the caves and tunnels of these mysterious places you find the remains of those who were here before you. What mysteries do their electronic diaries keep? What purposes did they have? What will Jill find in the end, and how was her missing father involved in all this? Put together the mosaic fragments and uncover what was happening in this distant planetary system!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:52:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c3/2c3868b56a94ac1e2fc80e299b79896f.jpg", "website": "http://wonderboxgames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Wonderbox Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Wonderbox Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
