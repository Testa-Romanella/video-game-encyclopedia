The goal of each level (except for the last one) is to get to the exit. How you do it and what happens along the way is for you to decide. Sometimes.</p>\n<p>You can move with the WASD\u00a0 or arrow keys, and click on your followers to make them kill each other. This might come in handy at some point.</p>\n<p>Shepherd is a personal solo project. I designed the game and the levels\u00a0, created all of the models and animations, and did all of the programming.</p>\n<p>This is my thesis project for\u00a0the Visual\u00a0Game and Media Design MA program at The Royal Danish Academy, 2021.</p>\n<p>Thesis supervisor: Jakob Ion Wille.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T09:09:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/781/781818105e4d7736fd31eecd6bc3c3b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gideon Rimmer"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
