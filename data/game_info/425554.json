The game will have 4 players playing as the survivors on a newly discovered planet that was started to get terraformed and inhabited by humans. There will be a fifth player watching the survivers and controlling other enemy units to attack them. There will be a leveling system so you will get batter equipment and abilities as you play the game. The game will be created using the Godot game engine with blender for animations and modeling and Lmms for music.</p>\n<p>any donations that will be sent will help me invest more time on the game so I will be able to get it up and running.<br/>All donations will be credited for helping this game come to life :)<br/>I will add any updates and changes to the game on my youtube channel if you want to follow along.</p>\r\ncontrols:\r\n<p>W,A,S,D - to move</p>\n<p>Left mouse to shoot, Right mouse to aim</p>\n<p>E - activate control panels</p>\n<p>G - activate armor</p>\n<p>R - reload</p>\n<p>Shift - sprint</p>\n<p>Ctrl - crouch</p>\n<p>This is still a prototype and probably have a few bugs and animation problems that Im going to fix soon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T03:13:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6c/b6c9bb4fa320480c8ccd11388bfe8ea8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["joggy555"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
