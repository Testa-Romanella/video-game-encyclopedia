It began as a Flappy Bird Clone and has evolved quite a lot\u00a0 since, with bullet-hell/shooter mechanics being added this year.</p>\n<p>It's pretty janky and the art is crap but I enjoyed making it and I hope you can have some fun playing it.</p>\n<p>If you get bored of 2021 I recommend playing 2022, as the levels are a lot more diverse visually and mechanically, and Santa gets an assault rifle.</p>\n<p>I made everything except for the music, which while I know is royalty free I don't know where it came from, and I can't find out who made it. No-one will see this though and I can't make any money, so I'm not sure a lack of credit is too important.</p>\n<p>If you can't use the Web Version, I've attached a Zip file.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T12:19:31", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Gibberish Pretzel"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
