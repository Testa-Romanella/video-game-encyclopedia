The theme of the Jam is games with\u00a0Collectables and the theme is There and Back.</p>\n<p>The original idea for this game came from my daughter who presented me with a painting she'd done just a few days before the start of the jam. I\u00a0decided that it would be the perfect start...</p>\n<p>Aria is a little who discovers a strange creature outside her house who steals all the colour\u00a0from her world. She decides to go on a journey to get them back!</p>\n<p>The game is a platformer where the player has to collect colours to get out of each level.\u00a0 At the end she finds something special and has to come back through the levels to get home and defeat the nasty Colour Vampires along the way.</p>\n\n<p>Controls are Arrow Keys, Space to jump and Ctrl to fire (when you get rainbow power). It also supports an Xbox Controller.
