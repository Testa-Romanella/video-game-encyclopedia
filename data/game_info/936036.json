No one in their right might have anticipated the living god, Violo to take an interest in them. Now, each day is a matter of survival. Violo's fascination is infamously mercurial, and his eternal companion,\u00a0Vivere, is not pleased with sharing his lover's attention. Death looms overhead.... but so does the threat of finding the men beneath the monsters.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Will they survive? Will they escape? Will they stay?</p>\n<p>That will be up to you.</p>\n<p>The demo was made for Yandere Game Jam 2023.<br/><br/></p>\r\nContent and Trigger Warnings:\r\nContent Warning(s):\r\nTrigger Warning(s):\r\nGore\r\n<br/>Human Taxidermy\r\nHuman Dissection and Vivisection\u00a0\r\n<br/>Flesh Monsters\r\n<br/>Body horror\r\n<br/>Possible Death\r\nStockholm Syndrome\r\n<br/>Dubious Consent\r\nUnhealthy/Toxic Power Dynamics\r\nHuman Trafficking\r\n<br/>Kidnapping\r\n<br/>Human Experimentation\r\n<br/>Forced Imprisonment<br/>\r\nRestraints\r\n<br/>Obsessive Behavior\r\n<br/>Threat of Verbal/Physical Harm\r\n<br/>Being Rendered Unconscious\r\n<br/>Child Abuse\r\n<br/>Transphobia\r\n<br/>Ableism<br/>Chronic Health Issues\r\n<br/>PTSD Nightmares\r\n<br/>Mental Manipulation\r\n<br/>Emotional Manipulation\r\n<br/>Possible Torture\r\n<br/>Possible Starvation\r\n<br/>Possible Choking/Suffocation\r\n<br/>Possible Unwanted Piercing\r\n<br/>Possible Limb Removal\r\n<br/>Possible Eye Removal\r\n<br/>Possible Lobotomy\r\n<br/>Possible Transformation into Monster\r\nPossible <br/>Rapid Body Decay\r\n<br/>Possible Plants Expanding Through Body\r\n<br/>Possible Being Eaten Alive\r\n<br/>Possible Death of MC\r\n<br/>Possible Falling in Love with Captor Scenario.<br/>\r\nThe Love Interests:\r\n\r\n\r\nFull Game Features:\r\n<ul><li>Customizable first name, last\u00a0name, and gender for the main character</li><li>Partial VO for Violo &amp; Vivere</li><li>A pair of yandere LIs you can enter a polyamorous relationship with or a weird friendship</li><li>Multiple Endings<ul><li>Multiple \"Dead\" Ends\u00a0<ul><li>You'd better make sure that their affection doesn't drop too low.
