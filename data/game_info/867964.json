How do you \"Shong\" your opponent? You trap their king or move your king to the other side of the board.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSound simple? There's a twist. Each time you move a piece, the piece will flip between two movement patterns creating an extra layer of complexity when thinking multiple moves ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlay tournament mode and be greeted with seven different AI personalities, each one complete with a unique strategy.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nChallenge your friends to multiplayer online or locally.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCan you become the ultimate Shong champion?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T03:09:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0cc/0ccec8c0316cc256f908f90a41e10318.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ravenbluestudios", "Raven Blue Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Raven Blue Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
