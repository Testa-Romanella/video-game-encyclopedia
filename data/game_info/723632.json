And now i have this!</p>\n<p>But enough backstory, this is a little demo of the game I'm making where you can explore 3 maps; the city, an abandoned building and a weird museum.</p>\n<p>So yeah, i hope you guys enjoy it.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>WADS \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </strong>- Movement</p>\n<p><strong>Shift\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </strong>\u00a0- Run</p>\n<p><strong>Space\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0</strong>- Jump</p>\n<p><strong>Caps Lock\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 </strong>- Autorun<br/></p>\n<p><strong>E / Left Click</strong> \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 - Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Esc\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </strong>- Menu / Pause<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T06:57:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7d/f7d8cb64b68a3bebe82b984dbbbdb915.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 282, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tomthebastard"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
