{"id": 524610, "slug": "the-smuggler-strigopstudios", "name": "The Smuggler (StrigopStudios)", "name_original": "The Smuggler (StrigopStudios)", "description": "<p>For fans of single-player, grindy, stat based RPGs, The Smuggler will provide hundreds of hours of gameplay filled with rewarding and substantial leveling. Set in an urban environment, you can forget about crafting, magic, and archery; instead, spend your time leveling your larceny, pick pocketing, cage fighting, drug dealing, and narcotic manufacturing levels. Build your drug empire, unlock powerful permanent stat boosts, purchase real estate, and take over the city.<br/></p>\n<p>Available in both Free and Paid. The free version is exactly the same as the Paid version, except all skills are capped at 30 as opposed to 99. This means you can try the game out and play for hours and hours before purchasing. If you are enjoying the game, then definitely pick up the paid version, as this will allow you to max stats, find stuffed animals, fully build your empire, and reach new game+ (prestige).\u00a0</p>\n<p>I grew up playing the original, classic, oldest version of RuneScape. I've always wanted to play a grindy RPG set in an urban environment, and so I created it. The Smuggler is finally here! Thank you for everyone who plays, free or paid. I appreciate your support more than you know!<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T02:38:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d0/0d084f14d289e4e8e86127b8aea17e57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StrigopStudios"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
