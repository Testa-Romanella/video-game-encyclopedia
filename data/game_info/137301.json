{"id": 137301, "slug": "poikolos", "name": "Poikolos", "name_original": "Poikolos", "description": "<p>So. On intention.</p>\n<p>This game is inspired by what's called the Strategy Tactics genre, seminal<br/>titles being Final Fantasy Tactics, Fire Emblem, Front Mission, and Tactics Ogre.<br/>Great games.</p>\n<p>Nature of game dev though is not to recreate things, its to progress. To<br/>build on, expand and refine. As successors and sequels in the genre evolve,<br/>what we see is a high level of sophistication in systems and customization.<br/>Streamlined play experiences, deep levels of personalization and loadout.</p>\n<p>Take a look at the FFTactics Advance titles. Modern entries are fun,<br/>whimsical, colorful. Immediately accessible for all ages.</p>\n<p>Hard stop. However - The original Final Fantasy Tactics was a biting<br/>criticism of feudal chivalry and the medieval Catholic church. Tactics Ogre<br/>was deeply influenced by the Yugoslav war and the Bosnian Genocide. Limited<br/>by technology of the time, they still aspired to be mature experiences, to<br/>address conflict and ask difficult questions.</p>\n<p>That's the sort of experience I would hope to produce for you with this<br/>title (if I finish it). A conversation about morality in the context of modern mysticism,<br/>spirituality, science. It's about personal frailty - flawed people who<br/>intend to be better.</p>\n<p>On a hexagonal chessboard. With magic monsters. Don't judge me man. Shape<br/>of Water's got 13 Oscar nods, don't let weird scare you.</p>\n\n<p>Doing all the art myself so far. My stuff is a bit\u00a0cartoony for the tone.</p>\n\n<p>Game is in early alpha, which means it's playable but core features are incomplete and bugs are expected.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Love comments/suggestions/criticism.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>wasd / arrow keys :\u00a0pan camera<br/>space / enter :\u00a0advance<br/>click : select, issue orders.<br/>escape: unselect/cancel</p>\n<p>All Included music is made available by creative commons or open licensing.</p>\n<p>* If unlicensed music appears in the game, you do NOT have an approved distributable build.
