And with pretty complex and long features i ended wrapping out of it when i found i was running out of time. SIGH. <em>Better this than nothing!</em> Anyways.</p>\n<p>\u2726 \u2726 \u2726<br/></p>\n<p>This is my first published \"game\". The first translated in english, too (I'm latina, hello!).\u00a0I knew how to handle Twine years ago and messed around all type of ideas in it but never, EVER attempted to make something \"seriously\".<br/></p>\n<p><em>... I hope i don't regret sharing this.</em></p>\n<p>But, like the game's name: it was an ephemeral experience. A very enriching one.</p>\n<p><em><strong>I DOUBT TO GO BACK TO THIS</strong></em> in the near future because i already have a lot of stuff to care and my future depends of it.</p>\n<p>Still, thank you for coming and playing... or simply reading my struggle and hope you, if you really are into doing \"serious\" games... <em><strong>can do better than me\u00a0\u2665</strong></em> Cheers!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-25T03:19:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bfd/bfdc1ee84c9554192fbaa92bd2be692e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["The Gridbug"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
