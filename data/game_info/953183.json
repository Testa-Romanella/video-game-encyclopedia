While exploring through the galaxy on a stolen ship, he\u2019s hit by a stray asteroid and sent Hurdling towards earth. After the crash, Gumi wakes up in what looks to be an earth laboratory, his body a speck of it\u2019s normal size. They\u2019ve clearly done some sort of experiment on him as he\u2019s faster and lighter than he\u2019s ever been before, He can even rapidly shoot parts of his body off that would naturally regenerate. The shock of these new abilities quickly turns into terror as he realizes that they\u2019ve used parts of his body to their own gain. Rats, robot\u2019s, and what looks to be Gumi replicas are all swarming inside this lab.<br/></p>\n<p>Dreading what these scientists might do, Gumi devises a plan to escape from this lab and find his ship so he can high tail it off of this dreadful rock. Putting his mind to work, He realizes that he can use his newfound power to avoid the lab experiments and find a way to get to his ship. Along the way he can gather the lost part\u2019s of his body so he can return to his normal size and pilot his space ship. Putting his plan into motion, Gumi Blasts out of his containment as he slip\u2019s away from these enemies to find a way off this planet.   </p>\n<ul><li>Use Gumi\u2019s abilities to collect parts of his body and escape from this wretched lab\r\n  </li><li>avoid enemies using his newfound mobility and stop them dead in their track by attacking them from a distance\r\n  </li><li>Find useful power-up\u2019s that can temporarily give you the upper hand in combat.\r\n  </li><li>Pick up scatter parts of your ship and rebuild you ship to escape from planet earth\r\n  </li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p><p><strong><em>Game created by Ooze Productions</em></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T13:12:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc6/bc6ad8930e0ca97c000d461c669280cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["luzzyra"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
