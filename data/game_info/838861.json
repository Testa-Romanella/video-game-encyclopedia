An earthquake hits and drops crates from the shelfs. You can only catch the wooden crates. The fallen saws and iron crates kill the bunny.</p>\n\n<p>Keys are arrow keys left and right, the up key creates a dash/turbo effect.</p>\n\n<p>You have one minute to get a high score. Game gets faster every 10 seconds.</p>\n\n<p>Struggled with time on this one. The dash and animations took me a while to figure out but glad to learn some new skills. Enjoy.</p>\n\n<p>NB: My high score is 360, let me know if you can beat it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T23:56:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60f/60f951fcf9b78ffb4435dc12a1559dea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jam_mack46"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
