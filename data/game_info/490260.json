Despite this, I\u00a0learned a lot during this first experience with clients and visibility.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T06:20:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8df/8df08b3286a74a8fd6a9dfa4a0dfe534.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Louis Riveron"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
