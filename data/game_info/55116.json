It was later distributed for various home games consoles in 1992, and in 2005, it was included as part of the compilation Taito Legends on the PlayStation 2, PC and Xbox. It is set aboard a crippled space station that has been overrun by hostile alien creatures; there are human crew members that the player must attempt to rescue while destroying the alien creatures. Space Gun features simulated gore, giving the player the ability to shoot limbs off the creatures while blood splatters appear on screen. Various weapon upgrades can be found during gameplay. The music from the game is featured on several commercially released compact discs. It was fairly well received by critics both in arcades and when released for home systems. It was one of only a few games that supported a light gun peripheral for some of the home systems releases.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:01:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d8/9d829dca43b716aa71c8e173d5cd2381.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 251, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["SEGA Master System", "Atari ST", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Taito"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Taito"], "esrb_rating": null}
