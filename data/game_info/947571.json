The element types remain unknown.</p>\n<p>A few years later, scientists noticed an object approaching our planet.</p>\n<p>Several hundred ships broke into our atmosphere, but were stopped by the military forces of the earth.</p>\n<p>Angel: It's calling me.</p>\n<p>Angel: I'm going there immediately!</p>\n<p>We were powerless to stop her.</p>\n<p>Angel: Your planet has become my home, even if I am an alien. I will take your side. I will protect people.</p>\n<p>The game was supposed to have 3 different characters and 2 different endings\u00a0(turning against humanity or not), but the game jam was only 2 days and later we swiched to other projects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T11:41:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6e/c6e3d847dc266b120867be144a094bb4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xitilon"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
