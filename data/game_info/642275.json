In a  small town like this it\u2019s a huge case, and while you have to suffer  through the nightmares that <em>might not be <strong>just </strong>dreams after all</em>, it seems everyone has given up. Fortunately for you, there are still some people who want to help you... <br/></p>\n<p>While the main plot of the game is discovering what happened to the  protagonist's brother, the emphasis of the Hollowpass story is on the  relationship between the characters. Romance is an important part, but  not a necessary one.</p>\n<p><em>Warnings: blood, violence, mention of death, horror elements.</em></p>\n<p>The game's Tumblr blog.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you want to support the game, I have Ko-fi and patreon.<br/></p>\r\n_________________________________\r\nCharacters\r\n<p>You, the protagonist, are an older sibling of a missing person. While their age is set to be mid twenties, their appearance, name and personality are customizable.<br/></p>\n<p>There are two <em>main</em> Romance Options (their genders are chosen by the player) with a poly route (you'll be the 'catalyst', they won't end up together without you):</p>\n<p><strong>Maxwell/Maxine 'Max' Jones</strong>: a deputy, who started working recently  thinking they were going \u00a0to help and protect people, but the station  might not be exactly what they thought it would be... \r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Jamie/James 'Jay' Ryans</strong>: your childhood friend and someone your  younger brother used to look up to.\u00a0 While they might not be very friendly towards other people, you are one of the exceptions.<br/></p>\n<p>Other two characters are the <em>bonus</em> romance options (gender selectable as well):</p>\n<p><strong>Robin Clayton</strong>: gang leader.  Could be intimidating, empowered by their very tall height and yet be very charming, which seems to be a facade... Or maybe their tough persona they put up is their mask. But what one might notice is that they almost always seem... bored? \r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Dina/Dylan Maddison-Lee</strong>: went to the same university as you, now working as a criminalist. Might be your acquaintance, friend, rival or ex, who you meet a bit later in the story. <br/></p>\n<p><em><strong>Credits:<br/>Unsplash for the background image.</strong></em> </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T06:29:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66c/66c76b93ce185139df08ddffa1ed9f70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["birdiel"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
