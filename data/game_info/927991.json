The museum features art that was originally captured on a gameboy camera. The museum also has platform levels with art-burglar enemies. This game also has side quests. You can access a to-list by clicking start. The side quests include playing an N64 spin-off game in a villager's house, logging in to a virtual windows 95 machine, and reading books. Have fun exploring Beaumont Island and interacting with the villagers.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T19:11:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a01/a01ee900e16e6b70711190c6d860e06e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cassette Tape Perplexity"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
