The patch contained within, when applied to a development cartridge, returned the game to a playable state.\r\nNow, nearly 25 years after its cancellation, the world is able to experience what could have easily been a piece of gaming obscura, lost to the ages.\r\nPlease enjoy <strong>Witch Machine</strong>, a rediscovered piece of horror game history.\r\n\r\na submission for GBJAM 7.\r\ndefault keybindings:\r\n<p>- Z (\"A\"):\u00a0cursor function\u00a0<br/>- X (\"B\"): walk\u00a0<br/>- C (\"Select\"): item menu</p>\r\ncontributors:\u00a0\r\n<p>(alphabetical)<br/>- gilmore girls expert: austinbrook\u00a0 (@austindotorg)<br/>- music: max knightley (@maxiesatan)<br/>- heavy lifter: victoria lacroix (@arachonteur)<br/>- junior gilmore girls expert: gwen lawson (@lesbosmer)<br/>- flavor text writing:\u00a0mabel mabel\u00a0(@rintezukas)<br/>- fake ad copy editing: john l moore (@john_l_moore)\u00a0<br/>-\u00a0animation cleanup + bug testing:\u00a0jane underscore (@janederscore)</p>\n<p><strong>friends who requested credits but are not actually contributors:</strong><br/>- \"nemesis\":\u00a0tomomo\u00a0<br/>- \"adorable friend who did not work on this project\": leaf doggy<br/>- special thanks to an unnamed friend for emotional support\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-26T04:58:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a7/9a7206d5be0c348380df88407c061892.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["victoria lacroix"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
