Accompany Akara in a long journey that will take her to the deep bowels of Hell itself. Gameplay is fast-paced, many monsters and demons attack you frenetically while the player hacks its sword thrusting them away. There are hundreds of weapons, magic rings and potions. The story drives you through 8+ hours of gameplay meeting new characters and fighting ever stronger foes. A Nuclear holocaust, real-life alchemist Fulcanelli, a wandering historian and Hell based on the paintings by Mexican muralists all revolve around this exclusive adventure. The soundtrack is vast and changing as well as stages that range from frontier towns, tropical forests, stormy beaches and taverns in Hell.<br/><br/>1 player(s)<br/>30720KB Minimum<br/>Touchscreen<br/>Dual Analog Sticks<br/><br/>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com/softwarelicense).
