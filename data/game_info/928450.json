The zine was made using scissors, glue and a dash of blood, sweat and tears. Inside you'll find the anonymous voices of the Analog Survey collective and a selection of the finest mixtapes in the galaxy! From the long enduring Ghost Dance series to a classified artifact simply known as \"Peyter's Tape.\" This zine was designed with the Mothership Sci-Fi Horror RPG in mind, but is completely system agnostic.<br/></p>\n<p>Use Analog Survey as inspiration when planning out your next\u00a0 session, or hand it out to your players so they can immerse themselves in some interstellar music knowledge. Below you can stream a YouTube mix using the tracks from the \"Terran Classical Music\" mixtape.</p>\n<p>Physical copies will be for sale through Tuesday Knight Games soon!<br/></p>\n<p><em><strong>TERRAN CLASSIC MUSIC: A mix of Old Earth tunes about space.</strong></em></p>\n\n\n<p>\u00a0<em>Mothership RPG is a trademark of Tuesday Knight Games.
