As you explore the city, you will meet friends who came from different parts of the world: the Ghana Empire, the Vardhana dynasty(northern India), and the Sogdian Empire(Iranians). Each woman has her own dream and aspirations. Serwa is a business owner and a shaman; she's passionate about math and science. Anahita loves dancing and singing. She also visits the fire temple. Prisha is a talented writer that focuses on the tales of marginalized groups of people. She can speak Old Turkic with ease. Build a life-long friendship with these phenomenal women.\u00a0Meet them in the capital city to unlock their stories and understand the world they come from.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>\"<em>I think women's friendship can blossom into something beautiful. In Tang culture, men's relationships and ties are seen as the most important and valuable.\u00a0\u00a0And some people think only men are loyal, selfless, and self-sacrificing when it comes to their friends.\u00a0\u00a0But I think women's friendship can also be fulfilling, trustworthy, and we can do so much for our sisters and friends.</em>\"</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<em> - (In-game dialogue)</em></p>\n\n<p>Demons in the\u00a0game\u00a0are the byproducts of myths, prejudice, and falsehood of your time. They\u00a0are sometimes \"embodiments of less desirable cultural characteristics --- misogyny, racism, and classism.\" As a sorceress, you must obliterate demons and reshape the rigid system. [1] As you remove stereotypes, close the gap between social classes, and make changes in your world, you will realize that people are not so different from each other despite of our racial, ethnic, cultural, and gender differences. As a human, extend love and appreciation to\u00a0those who need them. And as a demon slayer, remove the symbols of hate and dismantle myths in your world.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>\"</em><em>If all the rules that confine women are set by men of the past, then it is time for me to reinterpret those rules again to set women free. After all, myths can be fabricated, histories can be reinvented, and the system must also be reshapable. \"</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<em>\u00a0- (In-game dialogue)</em></p>\n\n<p>Some characters have restricted\u00a0ability powers. For instance, a sorcerer who believes in Daoism will be able to use fire-typed abilities when his allies are men, and water-typed abilities when he's fighting with women. But what happens when his allies are nonbinary? As the player, you need to\u00a0guide your allies and take the role of a leader.</p>\n\n<p>Your four romantic interests all come from different backgrounds and social classes</p>\n<ul><li>A merchant that trades along the path of the Silk Road. He's a reticent man that enjoys subtle affection. He may be the son of the richest man in the country, but he knows that true love is above any monetary value.\u00a0</li><li>A\u00a0Daoist that slays demons and runs errands across the country. Passionate, honest, and speaks his mind. Like his Turkic ancestors, he's willing to fight side by side with women.</li><li>A\u00a0young, handsome general that defends the border. His valor has been recognized by all the people in the capital city. He's brave, yet humble.\u00a0</li><li>A bandit that used to be the youngest imperial scholar in court yet\u00a0stepped away from politics. He's proud of his literary skills and enjoys casual flirting.</li></ul>\n<p>You have the power to actively seek romance or the freedom to stay single.\u00a0But most importantly, you <strong>do not</strong>\u00a0have to choose any of your romantic interests\u00a0to achieve a happy ending. Sometimes it's about finding yourself and loving yourself in your own journey.</p>\n\n<p>Sign up for our email list to receive a free wallpaper.
