You have to keep moving. I've tested a game without this feature and forgot add it in last build.\u00a0I'm sorry for that ): <br/></p>\r\n\u00a0Submitted by TeNoR \u2014 5 seconds before the deadline\r\n<p><strong>UPD:\u00a0</strong>From rules in discord <br/></p>\n\r\nWe kept the option to upload new builds open to allow you, the devs, the opportunity to support as many platforms as possible. <br/>We ask for you to keep the changes you make to your games to a bare minimum in order to keep the jam fair to all.\r\nAs mentioned earlier elsewhere the discord server, if there are small bugs that made your game unplayable you can fix and resubmit.  This does not mean you\u2019re free to add new features, menus, levels, etc...  anyone caught doing this will have their submission disqualified and will be banned.\r\n<p>I add flash-browser version for all OS (befor game works only for Windows) with fixed this bug and changed world \"preess\" on \"press\" in tip.
