The deeper in the tree, the more powerful animal it is. You will need not just basic resources such as essences, but also rare artifacts.</li></ul>\n<p>The more animals you create, the better will be your technique. This involves less resources spent, shorter crafting time and eventually discovering new recipes. Those animals can be used as an ingredient, send to an expedition to gather rare artifacts or sold in the shop for money. Your hard earned cash can be used for upgrading magical essence collectors in the lab, which are producing basic crafting ingredients - essences.</p>\n<p>Created by\u00a0<strong>The Team Behind</strong>.
