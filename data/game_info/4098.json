It is the fourth installment in the series and serves as a direct sequel to Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>Sly Cooper&#39;s friend Bentley notices that the pages of the Sly family clan manuscript turn blank. That means that someone is changing the history of the clan. Sly and his friends use a time machine that brings them back to feudal Japan in order to fix the timeline.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Like the previous installments of the series, the game is a platformer with several stealth-action elements. The players control a set of characters, each of which has their own abilities and tasks to complete. It is possible to switch between the characters during the gameplay as the players see fit. </p>\n<p>Unlike the previous games, where Sly Cooper only unlocked new skills, in Thieves in Time, Sly is awarded new suits, that offer their own range of abilities. For example, using the archer suit allows Sly to shoot an arrow with a rope tied to it from his bow to get to hidden areas of the game.</p>\n<p>There is a number of hidden treasures and masks in the game. Each treasure found is later added to the in-game collection and has its own description. Bottles with clues in them make a comeback in Thieves in Time. Upon finding them, the player can unlock a treasure safe which contains several bonuses within itself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-02T17:18:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83d/83d046e6efe7a6d4a31a88177e2605b5.jpg", "website": "http://www.slycooper.com", "rating": 3.72, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 51, "owned": 781, "beaten": 148, "toplay": 46, "dropped": 62, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 100, "ratings_count": 212, "suggestions_count": 384, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 215, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "PS Vita"], "developers": ["Sony Interactive Entertainment", "Sanzaru Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
