{"id": 106596, "slug": "crosstown", "name": "Crosstown", "name_original": "Crosstown", "description": "<p>Crosstown is a 4-player, faux-retro action game for Xbox 360, inspired primarily by a Commodore 64 game called\u00a0Crossroards.\u00a0<br/><br/>Like Crossroads, it features an \"ecology\" of different types of enemies with their own food chain and primitive relationships. Unlike Crossroads, it features procedurally-generated arenas, a GLaDOS-like narrator named \"Piggy\", and a Borges-esque \"recursive\" presentation where the player is effectively controlling someone playing a game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Fun action games made by smart people: that was the driving spirit behind the 1980 arcades' early successes, and that's the driving spirit behind Crosstown. I highly recommend any fan of the old fixed-screen classics download Studio Hunty's gem as soon as possible.\" --\u00a0HonestGamers\u00a0<br/><br/>\"Crosstown combines the fugly, monocolored graphics of early home computers, the 'chess pieces gone mad' gameplay of early arcade hits like Robotron: 2084, and the sheer mindf*ckery of Portal for an experience that's well worth the dollar you'll pay, along with any hair you'll tear out while trying to finish it.\" --\u00a0Gameroom Blitz\u00a0<br/><br/>\"one of the better, and certainly one of the most reasonably priced, titles on the Xbox Live Indie Games service\" --\u00a01up\u00a0<br/><br/>\"Crosstown is a bit like a very frantic firework display ... this faux-8-bit maze adventure is well worth a try.\" --\u00a0Negative Gamer\u00a0<br/><br/>\"incredibly addicting [and] hilarious... wrapped inside a coating of nostalgia\" --\u00a0GayGamer\u00a0<br/><br/>\"crosstown is noisy, bright, chaotic, and costs one dollar... crosstown is worth discovering. i like when games give more thought to the purpose of death than \u201cthe player has to try again.\u201d i especially like a shooting game, which are becoming more and more impossible-to-play hard, that every player is guaranteed to see the end of.\" --\u00a0Anna Anthropy\u00a0<br/><br/>\"I wholeheartedly endorse\u00a0<em>Crosstown</em>. It looks old school but at its heart is an awesome action game... It\u2019s one of those titles where a simple design can lead to complex game play.\" --\u00a0Indie Gamer Chick<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca8/ca86780c2e4ff5f3d763f788ba3894d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["luvcraft"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
