For this, they are competing in some funny competitions, \r\nwhich you can re-enact using your Commodore C64/C128, in a group of up \r\nto 4 players!\r\nThrow your froggy friends into the pond by slapping them with your \r\ntongue, or eat all those tasty bugs before the other players are able to\r\n catch them!\r\n</p>\n<p>This great action game supports the \"Classical Games 4-Player Interface\", which you can buy online for little money, or you can even build one by yourself. More information about this device can be found here.<br/></p>\n<p>You can choose whatever price you would like to pay for the game, \r\neven $0.00! If you're more into physical stuff however, you can check \r\nout the \"Boxed Version\" on frogs.drwuro.com<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is a game for the Commodore C64 home \r\ncomputer. If you have no C64 or if you have no possibility to transfer \r\n.PRG or .D64 files to a real C64, you can use an Emulator like VICE to play it on your PC/Mac or similar (VICE actually supports 4 joysticks, btw).</p>\n<p><strong>Another Note:</strong> There will be a real Windows and Linux version soon, and possibly a Mac version too!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a8/3a8f61cebc949a51ca4ddb3d825eddfe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dr. Wuro Industries"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
