It was a surprising success!</p>\n<p>Not long after the release of EXAPUNKS in 2018 we started working on an NES port of HACK*MATCH, the game's hacking-themed action puzzle minigame. Little did we realize it would take us two years to complete and involve writing our own C compiler for the 6502. But now we're done and we want to share it with you!</p>\n<p>This package is the same as the \"digital-only edition\" tier from our\u00a0IndieGoGo campaign. It includes:</p>\n<ul><li>ROM files for the game (NTSC and PAL)</li><li>The game's source code and assets</li><li>The source code for our C compiler</li><li>Print-ready PDFs of the cartridge box and labels</li></ul>\n<p>If you want to know more about the development of the game you should check out this write-up.\u00a0We also still have a few physical cartridges for sale on the Zachtronics pop-up store.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T07:21:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e3/1e38aa79d97c7bf4ad3dab43d79d6be8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zachtronics"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
