Try to imagine what the game could be with more time and hard work.</p>\n<p>If you would like to see big improvements and more missions in the future (and trust me I have BIG plans) then please leave feedback, your ideas, and support the game.</p>\n<p>Please report any bugs here or using the in game bug reporter.
