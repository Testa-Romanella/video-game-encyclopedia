Just as the exploitation was at its end with 7,300,000 tons of platinum and 8,453,000 tons of gold extracted from the planet, a colonial wars started across the known terraformed worlds in 3283. Because of the strategic location, on the rim of the colonized world, LN 421 quickly became an important supply route for the Earth government.  <br/><br/>During the first three years of war, the military built their training and maintenance bases across the planet. The specific purpose of the installations are still classified. Two years after the war 3307 SET and the discovery of inertium166 material on planet LD 17 which is just 8 light years from LN 421, the colony was repurposed to a research center for advanced weapons division.   <br/><br/>The year is 3313 SET. Military ship  ISS ZEUS patrolling the outer rim received a subspace distress call from LN 421 for immediate evacuation.
