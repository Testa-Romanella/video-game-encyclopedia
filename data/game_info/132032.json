The intention is to show that it is not necessary to have fancy assets (usually paid ones) from the asset store when something like Google Blocks or similar are available (especially when there isn't time to use/learn Maya, Substance, etc..) and using Unity's effects setting could easily create an interesting game in a short time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Navmesh is what allows enemies and neutral creatures to move about. This is perhaps the fastest way to implement AI behaviour.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is the game source code.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ce/7cef9211072df396e15f01be1bdf5416.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bubblemelon"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
