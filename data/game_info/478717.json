Indeed, as a\u00a0paper plane even the smallest\u00a0collision with\u00a0the smallest cloud will be fatal !\u00a0</p>\n<p>Prepare\u00a0yourself to prove that you are the best pilot of RE-WIND Corp's and\u00a0complete all the \"always more\u00a0challenging\" levels.<br/><br/></p>\n<strong>ADVICE NOTICE</strong>\n<p>You are stuck on a level ? This notice will guide through the difficult parts of each level !</p>\n<p><strong>Level 1:\u00a0 Introduction<br/></strong>\"Nothing to declare Sir !\" If you are stuck on left right mechanics I can't do anything for you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Level 2:\u00a0 Introduction to Re-wind mechanics<br/></strong>The difficult part of this level resides in its end. You learn the Re-wind mechanism and how to repeat it multiple times in a row.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For this I'd advice to go to the last mill, grab it and then <strong>go up a little as shown below, before activating\u00a0your re-wind ability</strong>. It should help you go down to the perfect spot from where you\u00a0could go left.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Level 3:\u00a0 Sky is the limit<br/></strong>Once again I would say that\u00a0the difficulty of this level is in its end. You have to re-wind multiple time and the last path is not that big.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To pass this part easily with (almost) 100% success rate,\u00a0<strong>get to the second to last\u00a0mill with a re-wind\u00a0and then dose the right key input</strong> to drive nicely through the path\u00a0to the end zone.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Level 4: Storm is coming<br/></strong>Okay I admit it, this one is a bitch. The main difficulty of this level is tricky. You passed your first moving clouds and you start to see the next checkpoint but the path to get to it is quite small and you bump into something each time.\u00a0<br/>Well my solution is.. Don't try to reach for the mill ! <strong>You can pass directly inside the path by positioning yourself as shown bellow and press the left input key</strong>. Works for me every time ! The level should feel easier :)</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Level\u00a05:\u00a0 The end is nigh<br/></strong>Welcome in the last level ! Here everything you learned will be useful to you ! The main\u00a0difficulty of this level is to find your path through a storm of moving clouds. <strong>Here's the path I use each time:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><br/>Here it is for the advice note !<br/></strong>Don't hesitate to tell me if there are other moments where you can't go through, I'll edit this guide to add\u00a0 additional explanations !</p>\n\n<p><strong>Easy Controls:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Left/Right</strong>: Move<br/><strong>Space</strong>: Re-wind<br/><strong>Escape</strong> : Pause menu</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\n<p>This game was completely made during the <strong>Brackeys Game Jam 2020.2</strong>.\u00a0<br/>It is my first ever\u00a0finished game, and I am proud of what I learnt during this week.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T08:06:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d53/d536463af23031a7329fb01f3756aabe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Raphlette"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
