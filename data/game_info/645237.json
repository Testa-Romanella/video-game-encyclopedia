It's a space shooter game similar to something like Asteroids or even\u00a0Sinistar (Just not as fast paced and sadly no <strong>SINISTAR</strong>).</p>\n<p>I haven't touched this project since College so there is likely a lot of bugs and general issues with the game. There currently isn't a end or even death sequence within the game so getting past round 5 or dying will result in nothing happening and you'll need to manually restart it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls - WASD to move the ship, left click\u00a0to fire, and right click to use a bomb. Bombs are displayed below your health at the top left, with new bombs being acquired by destroying asteroids. Asteroids can also drop health. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T05:59:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbe/dbeb9f05316641dd3687bf90a64becff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adam Raybould"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
