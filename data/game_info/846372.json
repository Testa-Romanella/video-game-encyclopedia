Navigate your way through the various environments, avoiding not only the tables, chairs, and various furnishings of the local watering hole, but also the patrons and staff.  Just be careful not to make too much of a nuisance of yourself, else security will need to take matters into their own hands. <br/><br/>Two dozen unlockable characters, and multiple unlockable levels serve as the basis for the end of the night of overindulgence.<h3>Developer Notes</h3>No epic quest here, just a quick time waster casual game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T05:17:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a25/a25ec6d792cdef264f91171ea574097a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Amucity"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Amucity"], "esrb_rating": null}
