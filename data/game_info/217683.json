Are you already an advanced kiteboarder?  Are you a windsurfer that hasn't made the switch yet?<br/><br/>Learn kitesurfing, all the way from the basics to advanced maneuvers with 'Kiteboard' !!!<br/><br/>Kiteboarding (Kitesurfing) is taking the world by storm, it is the most extreme board sport ever invented and provides the greatest adrenaline rush possible.  However, it can be incredibly dangerous.  A giant kite, up to 20 meters, pulls the kiteboarder while they ride on a small board travelling up to 50 miles per hour and jumping over 100 feet into the air!  There is truly no other sport like kiteboarding.<br/><br/>Kiteboard features 20 real world class kitesurfing locations, including:<br/><br/>- Cabarete, Dominican Republic<br/>- Chicago, Illinois<br/>- Camber Sands, England<br/>- Pattaya, Thailand<br/>- Paracura, Brazil<br/>- Cairo, Egypt<br/>- Ishigaki, Japan<br/>- Cape Town, South Africa<br/>- Isle of Capri, Italy<br/>- Auckland, New Zealand<br/>- Avellanas, Costa Rica<br/>- San Fransisco, California<br/>- Key West, Florida<br/>- Hood River, Oregon<br/>- Monte Carlo, Monaco<br/>- Nuuk, Greenland<br/>- Hatteras, North Carolina<br/>- Perth, Australia<br/>- Teahupoo, Tahiti<br/>- Maui, Hawaii<br/><br/>More levels and moves will come with each update!<br/><br/>Kiteboard features:<br/><br/>* High resolution OpenGL 3D graphics<br/>* MP3 music player controls - play your own songs while you ride!<br/>* Full kiteboard and kitesurf training levels<br/>* Many different kiteboard jump moves and combinations<br/>* Hidden features and missions!<br/>* Multiple different kite designs<br/><br/>Just like real kiteboarding, you can depower the kite, boost huge airs, unhook from the chicken loop, edge the board hard, ride freestyle, ride nuking winds, and of course... send the kite into the power zone!<br/><br/>Feel the power of nature by harnessing the wind and experiencing true happiness with 'Kiteboard' !!!<br/><br/><br/>***** Warning *****<br/>Power kites can be dangerous. Because of strong forces that can be generated by sudden wind gusts, people can be lofted, carried off, dashed against water, buildings, terrain or power lines, resulting in what's termed a \"kitemare\".<br/><br/>Most kiteboarding fatalities are the result of being lofted or dragged out of control, resulting in a collision with hard objects including sand. It is possible to be seriously injured simply by hitting the water surface at speed or from a height.<br/><br/>Jumping and being airborne at inappropriate places (such as shallow water or near fixed or floating objects) can be hazardous.  Marine hazards include sharks, jellyfish, sea otters, dolphins, and even crocodiles, depending on the location.<br/><br/>Collisions with wind surfers, other kite boarders or water craft are hazards, particularly at busy locations.<br/>*****", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T11:59:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a30/a304231ec3afb6583dc4d7b82c4f8677.jpg", "website": "http://www.svntr.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Sea Venture"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Sea Venture"], "esrb_rating": null}
