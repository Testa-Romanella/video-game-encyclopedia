Today the dwarfs are moving to a new part of the forest and Chaos, the dark wizard, is set to stop it (because he got nothing better to do). </p>\n<p>Fight Chaos's army of exploding undead long enough for the dwarfs to build their homes. If the five dwarfs build their quarters, the dark mage will desist on his plans (because his soap opera will be about to start).</p>\n<p>Use your thunder spell to slay the undead. If you raise enough magical power by banishing enemies you will overload with magic, getting faster, stronger and repairing the damage done to the house! (for ... some reason). Beware, that the dark wizard's army will also get stronger over time!</p>\n<p>Have you got what it takes to make sure the dwarfs live happily ever after? <br/>(And, hopefully, not be eaten yourself in the process).</p>\n\n<p>Developed by Ian Letter for Mini Jam: 100.</p>\n<p>It was his third game in Unity and worked alone. He did take the process slightly more seriously this time (although, as you will see, not that seriously). The idea was to gain experience and push himself as a developer.</p>\n<p>The mini-jam has a theme overload, which is exactly what you must do to get stronger; get overloaded with magic! The mini-jam also had as a limitation to have Chaos. Well, the dark wizard is named Chaos ... the zombies appear on the map in chaotic ways ... and the new dwarf house induces Chaos every time they appear! This all counts ... Right?</p>\n<p>I hope you have a good time playing this game. I will make sure the next one is even better! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T06:05:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/324/3240a1857575ee436b275a3e8cbfbf0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Naix99"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
