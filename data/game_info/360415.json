When we heard the theme \"only one\", the first thing we thought of were things with only one dimension. So what better thing to base your game around than the engineer's best friend - good ol' trusty arrays!\r\n</p>\n<p>The game randomly generates unsorted arrays with 5 to 15 bars (elements), and a chance for a gimmick each time. Those include having to arrange the bars by volume, hue, brightness, color, saturation, and/or pitch frequency. Every move you make is counted as well as the total time you took. The game also features a seed system for challenging your friends to an epic battle of 10 levels!</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>- Left and right arrow to move the bar pointer<br/>- Space to select a bar, press space again to swap the bar with another one</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>Lead Programmer, Project Host, Artist:<br/>- Michele \"Kroporo\" (Darky1#1170)</p>\n<p>Gameplay Programmer, Creative Genius:<br/>- Henri \"J1NX1337\" (J1NX1337#8529)</p>\n<p>Music:<br/>Kevin MacLeod - Ambiment<br/>(Available under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported license. )</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T17:58:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d00/d0061723ca1f3a9b78457a64101d2587.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kroporo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
