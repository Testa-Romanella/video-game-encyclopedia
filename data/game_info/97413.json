Another key feature in this build is the abilty to swap Sunnie's costume (Press space). Now that this feature is in I can create a whole lot of costumes that can be unlocked.<br/><br/>Over the past 6 months I have been picking up various jobs and projects so progress on this room has been a bit slow. At the moment it is a bit barebone but is fully playable to the end.<br/><br/>As always, this is an ALPHA, there is placeholder &amp; missing sounds, music and animations. I don't really need to be told about these things as I'm aware and still working on it, but I would like to know of weird bugs that you happen to come across. I look forward to everyone's feedback and impressions!<br/><br/>I'm also looking for a composer/music guy who would like to contribute to the game. Also a voice actor for Sunnie, I wouldn't need any voice actor work until I'm almost done with the game, but I think it is a good idea to start thinking about it now.<br/><br/>If you want to contact me about anything, hit me up on Twitter, Deviantart or my e-mail.<br/><br/>Twitter: http://twitter.com/Poribo/<br/>DA: http://poribo.deviantart.com<br/>e-mail: paul.mahoney@poribo.com</p><p><strong>Controls</strong><br/>'W' 'A' 'S' 'D' - Move/Walk<br/>Left Click - Interact/Advance<br/>Right Click - Toggle Cursor Mode<br/>SPACE - Change to alternate costume<br/>Escape - Menu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e2/1e234a6b86019294f1e801dfc48705d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Poribo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
