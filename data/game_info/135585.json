It was created in 48 hours, by myself only. I hope you will enjoy.</p><p><strong>How to play:</strong></p><p>Put the pegs into matching holes on the boxes. You can get bonus points by putting a peg into a same colored block, two adjacent pegs of the same color, or two adjacent pegs of the same shape. To help you find the best matches, you have a hand of cards to play. Top symbol of each card represents what kind of peg you can play it on. Bottom symbol shows what that peg will then change to.</p><p>If you clear all the pegs before time is up, you can click the button that appears below the timer to collect the remaining seconds as points to your score.</p><p>Discarding cards:</p><p>You can discard a card by activating it (click on it) and then clicking the discard area. It costs you 5 points, but you get a new card after a 1 second delay that may help you out. You can also immediately redraw your entire hand of cards at a cost of 25 points.</p><p><strong>Future?</strong></p><p>I'm actually quite pleased with this little game, and I will most likely do some fixes and add a couple of nice features and touches to it in the future.</p><p><strong>Bug Fixes:</strong></p><ul><li>Fix: You should now be able to play correct color card on shapeshifted peg. </li><li>Fix: You can no longer redraw if you have insufficient points. </li><li>Fix: Redraw button was rendering on top of Game Over screen. </li><li>Fix: Cards should properly change if you click a new card with another selected. </li></ul><p>Let me know in the comments what you thought of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/651/65108f4c6396d8d0c161bb1863f22d9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["RealityCheck Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
