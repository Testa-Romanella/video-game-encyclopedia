They also use \u00a0some form of special technological shield that uses anti mater to invert the electrons\u00a0of the protons in the atons of the neutrons around the ship oxigen field to obliterate anything that invades it's personal space, \u00a0and \u00a0no technology \u00a0know to man is capable of penetrating their shield. Everything seens lost.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>UNTIL \u00a0one of the aliens crashes in one of the moon of Venus, \u00a0And scientists managed to invert engineer the technology into a human ship. \u00a0Said ship uses a similar shield to invert the electrons in the asteroids, Energizing then with a field capable of penetrating the alien shields. This is the only known way of hurting their ships.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>So its up to you, to reflect the asteroids back into their ships and save our planets.
