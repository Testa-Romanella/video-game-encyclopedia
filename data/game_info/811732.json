PLAY AT YOU'RE OWN RISK!</p><p>Hello traveler. Do you want to escape this dark land? If so, you'll have to enter a dark maze. Be careful, the most horrid of monsters awaits you inside...</p>\n<p>Quick note, shadows in this game are a little bit wonky, I used the experimental 2d lighting in Unity for this project, and so this is the best I could get it in the time that I had. Also, the game says that you can open up a map, that is false, it was a feature I didn't have time to implement. It was supposed to fill in as you progress.\u00a0\u00a0If you get lost, here is a map of the maze. As this is the full map and will contain spoilers for the path ahead, \u00a0I highly recommend\u00a0<em>not</em> using it though for the best experience,:\u00a0https://ibb.co/gRtYnXd</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T13:30:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f0d/f0d7f73041c6fe75ba402b49adfe0aed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Little Glyph Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
