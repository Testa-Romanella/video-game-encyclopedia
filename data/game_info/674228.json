{"id": 674228, "slug": "reptilian-rising", "name": "Reptilian Rising", "name_original": "Reptilian Rising", "description": "The timeline and everyone in it (that includes you) is under siege! Confront the Reptilian Rising in this 80\u2019s tabletop-styled game of squad tactics. Bring retro miniatures to life on battlefields across time. Fight against The Ouroboros through seven time periods, recruit the best of humanity\u2019s heroes, and upgrade your favorites for the fight ahead.<h3>Open the door, get on the floor, everybody shoot the dinosaur</h3>As if talking dinosaurs and flesh-hungry lizardmen weren\u2019t bad enough, your time-traveling heroes will have to battle a weird, wild army of invaders. Malevolent Manborgs, lethal Lazer Raptors, the terrifying Tri-Cannon (a bogus hybrid of Triceratops and minigun), and the diabolical Dictatorsaur.<br/><br/><h3>Great Scott! Dictatorsaur!?</h3>With three of humanity\u2019s worst villains sharing one giant dinosaur body, you\u2019ll need the best our species can muster to even the odds. Call up heroes from the dawn of history like Julius Caesar (et tu, Reptiles?), medieval masters of war, like Robin Hood (take from the rich, shoot arrows at dinosaurs) and great minds of super-science like Albert Einstein - all things are relative, but we\u2019re kicking the reptiles out of this family gathering!<h3>Time After Time</h3>There\u2019s more to time travel than hopping in a DeLorean, phone booth, or retro police box. In Reptilian Rising you\u2019ll use time energy on time-twisting abilities to throw the Reptilians for a loop. Create clones of your troops, call in reinforcements (we\u2019ve got Scarface on speed-dial), or create time-gates to rush your heroes across the map double time.<br/><br/><h3>Do The Evolution</h3>If you can turn the tide without causing a temporal paradox, you can replay missions to tackle bonus objectives, hop between time periods to uncover secrets, and more. Once you\u2019ve sent The Ouroboros back to chewing on their own tails, challenge your fellow commanders in online PvP. Admit it, you\u2019ve always wondered if Winston Churchill could take on FDR in a fight.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T02:49:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9da/9dadebbeef08ed7ccfede33d1a15e57f.jpg", "website": "https://www.reptilianrising.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 435, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Robot Circus", "Gregarious Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Gregarious Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
