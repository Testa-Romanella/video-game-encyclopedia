The loop was supposed to end in a minute, but weird time artifacts (and some weirder time-bugs) keep appearing, and whenever you collide with them the time loop lasts longer. To make things worse the strange physics of the loop makes you run faster near the end. Try dodging everything and eventually you'll be free!</p><p>LD47 URL:\u00a0 https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/ouroboros-3</p>Controls:\r\n<ul><li><strong>Left</strong>: move to an inner circle</li><li><strong>Right</strong>: move to an outer circle</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T08:37:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ba/8baaed436e111410614fc0a1c22b8cd7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wendel Scardua"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
