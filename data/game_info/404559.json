This reaulted in my entry, Quacking Time, where you play against up to 3 other players in order to win x number of rounds in a short but sweet terrority control minigame.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My personal goal for this jam was to have decent complexity in the game as well as having the game reasonably polished.\u00a0 This was certainly not an easy goal considering I was working alone and had to spend one of the jam days working on a university assignment.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>1-2 Player: Keyboard Only</p>\n<p>3-4 Player: Requires Game Controllers</p>\n<strong>Player</strong><strong>Movement</strong><strong>Jump</strong>1ASWDSpace2Arrow KeysEnter3Controller 1 JoystickController 1 \"A\" Button4Controller 2 JoystickController 2 \"A\" Button\r\n<p><strong><br/>Known Bugs:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Ducks who have the lock powerup and collect points can paint grey hexagons for around a second.</li><li>Ducks powerup cooldowns don't reset when a different pickup is grabbed mid-duration.</li><li>Ducks can fall slightly slower than expected.</li><li>Menu selection isn't completly responsive.</li></ul>\n<p>Overall, I'm rather proud of what I was able to make in the time I had, and it adds another unique game to my portfolio :)</p>\n<p><strong>Links:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Jam Page:</strong>\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/mega-jam-2020</p>\n<p><strong>My Portfolio:\u00a0</strong>https://jonathan.carter.games/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-17T02:12:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb2/eb2f5a207ad470503667121aa0bb98fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Carter Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
