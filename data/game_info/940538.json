I've taken an ultra-simplified set of systems from Nethack + \"The Circle\" from That 70s Show, so that the game is a conversation with randomly-selected choices. There's never more than 4 possible actions at a time. Playable on mobile or desktop.</p><p>Source here: https://github.com/dustinfreeman/blunt-quaternion<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T09:59:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d21/d21901b3d14f4170d4dd991067060505.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Escape Character"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
