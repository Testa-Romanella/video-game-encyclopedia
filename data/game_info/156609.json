Hitting the arrow keys will cause all the movable boxes to move in that direction.  Space bar will fire a shot, but you have limited ammo.  Blue boxes can be destroyed</p><p>Press escape to reset the level.<br/></p><p>This game is based on a puzzle type that appears towards the end of Undertale.  So if you liked those slide and shoot puzzles this has 17 more for you to try out. </p><p>10/5: HTML5 version was bugged, so I uploaded the Windows downloadable version.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/396/396df7486d10d419072143ff457660bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jdersch"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
