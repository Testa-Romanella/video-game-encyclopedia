Meanwhile, Kiriya is a shy boy who's only talked to Yuu in passing a few times; and certainly not while he was crossdressing! At first he even mistakes him for a girl...but maybe him being a boy is better after all? Plenty of hijinx lay ahead for our quirky lovers!<br/><br/>Cross Love is a short, kinetic yaoi visual novel that features plenty of laughs, cute scenes, and of course - lewd ones too. <br/><br/><strong>Characters</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/><ul><li>2-4 Hours Long<br/></li><li>High Resolution, Semi-Animated CGs<br/></li><li>Distinct Sprites, with lots of variations<br/></li><li>5 Spicy Yaoi Scenes</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:52:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19b/19b437e595efe2d047e01a93f83dca06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 285, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Top Hat Studios"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Top Hat Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
