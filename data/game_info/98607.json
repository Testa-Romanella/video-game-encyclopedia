{"id": 98607, "slug": "heads-or-tails", "name": "Heads or Tails", "name_original": "Heads or Tails", "description": "<p><em>Heads or Tails</em> is a two-player game where players place coins on a board and flip them! Players gain points if coins match. But wait\u2026 these coins are weighted, and some even have special faces, which grant a flat amount of points or grow and shrink your coin hand size. Figure out how to maximize your chance at points, while blocking your opponent from valuable matches. What are you waiting for? Grab a friend and try your luck!</p>\n<p>If no friends are nearby, add together red and blue's scores and try for a record!</p><p>Only a mouse required.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!
