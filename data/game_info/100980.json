It's a platform game about a tiny adventurer exploring a castle. You must get past the challenges set for you by the giant evil bird thingy. Your reward will be one gold coin.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>WHY WE MADE IT</strong><br/>\r\n\tThis game was made for Ludum Dare 28, and the theme was You Only Get One. The idea behind this was to have a castle full of rooms, each with a unique challenge revolving around the player only having one of something. It starts out quite well, but you can tell towards the end that time was running out on the game jam. This is a solo effort, hence the developer art \u2013 due to a total lack of art programs available at the time, all the graphics were made in Excel.<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>CONTROLS &amp; HELP</strong><br/>\r\n\t Keyboard - Arrow keys to move your guy. Use up arrow, Z or X to jump. Spacebar is your Action key<br/>\r\n\tGamepad \u2013 Left stick to move your guy, A button to jump. X button or Right Trigger is Action key.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tEach level has 1 of something, so your action button may do something different on each level. Action will always allow you to drag boxes out of the way. On the level with the giant boss, all you have to do is get to the other side (there are a couple of challenges to get to the top of the castle, but they are just for fun).</p>\n<strong>EDGE</strong>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tGameplay, Graphics,\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\tSound &amp; Music", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e13/e13736f2ce391d62ca4876683e756977.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Second Dimension Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
