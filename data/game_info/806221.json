(PaperBagley)", "description": "<p>Still in prototype phase!\r\n</p>\n<p>Welcome to my first attempt at a complete game! This game is like Pac-Man with some interesting features.\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\nMain Objective\r\n<p>The goals of this game are quite simple. At the start of every level, the map is\u00a0completely dark. You can only see the player and the enemies. Playing as a ball of fire named Ember, you need to light all torches in the level and get to the exit. Sounds simple, but the enemy water droplets will put out those torches and come after you at the same time.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nRules\r\n<p>You can light torches by running into them\r\n</p>\n<p>Any torches put out by water droplets will need to be re-lit\r\n</p>\n<p>Once lighting all torches, head for the exit and get ready for the next level\r\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Use the arrow keys, or WASD to move Ember. That's it!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nFYI\r\n<p>I am mostly working on this game as a way to better my coding skills and be able to pass the time. I will be posting devlogs as long as I am able to create more parts of the game.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T21:17:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07a/07af4e4709b90a14bb787bba14731791.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PaperBagley"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
