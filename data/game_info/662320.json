I believe that you all have read &quot;Where&#39;s Wally?&quot; before. Does playing our game bring back your childhood memories? Here in &quot;Sophia the Traveler&quot;, we strive to make sure that every frame is a painting. You will never be short of wallpapers anymore!<br />\nThis version contains 10 different scenes. More than 1800 character assets, over 300 sets of character animation, more than 100 sequence animation &amp; SFX, exceeding 100 European buildings (including 8 iconic buildings of Venice), and nearly 300 sound effects have been integrated into the game, just to create the complete and lifelike Venice in our dreams.DETAILS<br />\nDubbing in all kinds of languages: We&#39;ve recorded human sound effects on our own in many languages, including Mandarin, English, Italian, French, Cantonese, Minnan and so on (we are from Fujian Province in China, our hometown language is a must).<br />\nFun animation Easter eggs: We&#39;ve designed lots of fun and quirky little Easter eggs in the game, which will definitely surprise you during gameplay.<br />\nPlans for a sequel: Tang Dynasty in China, France, the Netherlands or somewhere else! Come to our community and vote for the next destination you want to go!ORIGINAL IDEAS<br />\nI really wanted to make a cozy game full of love and joy.<br />\nTo me, Venice on the water is one of the most romantic cities in the world. I still remember seeing the romance movie &quot;Everyone says I love you&quot; that happens in Venice when I was very young. From then on, I have always wanted to see Venice, but sadly the trip never happened for various reasons. Someone might wonder how I can make this game without actually having been there. For three years Google Maps and piles of travel books have helped me see every corner of Venice.<br />\nAnd now, we&#39;ve created a girl named Sophia, who loves life, music and good food. And hope that she will take us all to Venice through this game.<br />\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/MWbwZSY<br />\nTwitter: @ThermiteGamesHQ</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-11T09:15:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10c/10c8160ec624533563e64ab9fde26abb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 234, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Migo Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Thermite Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
