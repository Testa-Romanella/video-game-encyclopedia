You have a long-standing business arrangement with the yam provider Sam-I-Yam, but lately your pigs have been reporting deaths and sicknesses after eating the yams. You have a sneaking suspicion that you may be getting scammed.</p>\n<p>Your mission is to identify all of the scam yams and destroy them before your pigs eat them. Make sure not to destroy any of the normal yams or else your pigs will get angry.</p>\n<p>Controls: Click/tap on a yam to destroy it. You must click <strong>directly </strong>on the yam to destroy it (otherwise your laser will miss).</p>\n<p>You will lose the game if 3 pigs die or if you destroy 3 non-scam yams. You can win the game by making it through all 7 levels.</p>\n<p>Team:</p>\n<ul><li>Andrew Hung - Programming</li><li>Matt Boerner - Music</li><li>Quintin - Art</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/972/97259feb489b17c72d4211653e4eaa06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["chipfunk89"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
