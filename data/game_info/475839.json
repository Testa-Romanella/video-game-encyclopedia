Its goal is to enable game design students to explore the intricacies of balancing different weapons in first person shooters. It is a multiplayer game, and one player needs to serve as the host. All players need to be in the same network in order to connect to each other. The game then allows players to fight in teams against each other.\u00a0The host can change the values of all weapons which allows learners to try out if they can balance weapons against each other while maintaining their own distinctive feel.</p>\n<p>Please let us know if you are planning to use this project as part of your Game Design teaching!\u00a0We'd love to hear your feedback (and that of your students) to further improve Balancing FPS.</p>\n<p>Balancing FPS was developed by Yannick Luthiger as his\u00a0bachelor dissertation.</p>\n<p>Supervisor: Prof.\u00a0Dr.\u00a0Richard Wetzel</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T05:17:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4d/a4d75580fe6b20b5c5359639c73b4d17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["gamedesigngames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
