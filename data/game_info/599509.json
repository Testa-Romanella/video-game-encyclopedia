Right now my plan is to release new versions here up until I\u00a0feel it is good enough to publish on newgrounds.</p>\n<p>CURRENT VERSION: Alpha 1.0</p>\n<p>Welcome to Homing Egg! The eggs are coming after you, shooting from a cannon, and the worst part; they're EGGsplosive (i am very sorry)</p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY:</p>\n<p>Run from the eggs using the arrow keys</p>\n<p>Jump over the eggs using Z (or space if you want to look like an idiot hahaahahhahhaa)</p>\n<p>Click to navigate menus</p>\n<p>If the egg touches the ground, it gets obliterated from the universe. Use this to your advantage!</p>\n<p>PLANNED UPDATES:</p>\n<p>An actual functional shop</p>\n<p>Different gamemodes(?)</p>\n<p>Difficulty selection</p>\n<p>Skins that give you perks (but also take away some things. For example I have plans for a hat skin that makes your hitbox larger but you get double points.)</p>\n<p>Maybe multiplayer</p>\n<p>Better visuals</p>\n<p>(ALL OF THESE UPDATES ARE SUBJECT TO JUST NOT HAPPENING)</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>actually i made all the music and everything but also thank you to the people in the Gdevelop discord server for tips on actually coding the game...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T06:49:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd6/cd6292fdecb9581c0f2f2557c701c1fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SourdoughGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
