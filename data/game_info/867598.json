The industry was booming with new electronics everyday. After a while though, the outlets started to get tired of supplying energy for the humans. They begged for help, but the humans didn\u2019t listen. So, the outlets got angry. Every time a human plugged in an electronic device, their energy ran through the cord and took over their body. Soon, the entire city was infested with evil outlets. The outlets realized that they should also take over the other cities. Then they\u2019d be unstoppable! But, there\u2019s one thing that stands between them and the world. Your team.<br/></p>\n<p>Together, you and your team must shoot plugs into the outlet-infested people to electrocute them!\u00a0 Reconnect them to what they were meant to be!\r\n</p>\n<p>You\u2019re the last hope!\r\n</p>\n<p>Create a world on one device(Preferably a computer with a large screen), and then join that world on separate android devices or computers. Type in the world code to enter the world. Start the game. Then, start slinging plugs! You can change the vertical trajectory of the plug by changing the vertical angle of the phone.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T15:48:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b96/b9669483c8272eb948658995c6770f4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["Andya-2008"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
