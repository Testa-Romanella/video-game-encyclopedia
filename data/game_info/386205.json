In this puzzle platformer you help the happy-go-lucky alien Gadwok move crates from the company hangar onto incoming space trucks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fill the daily quota to keep the company from going bankrupt! The crates have various shapes and properties making it a challenging task.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some crates bounce, some float in mid air and others turn invisible when you look directly at them. Most challenging of all - time is running out, all the time!\u00a0</p>\n<p>How you fill the quota is up to you, as long as the crates end up in the right zones on the ship you get paid. Will you stack carefully to optimize the space or go wild and throw crates hoping at least some will end up where they should?\u00a0</p>\n<p>The most important part is that you have fun doing it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-25T07:05:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e89/e8949984d0841df750e3ae1c6147ef87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Stellar Twelve"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
