{"id": 474614, "slug": "distant-shores-saga", "name": "Distant Shores. Saga", "name_original": "Distant Shores. Saga", "description": "<p>It's called \"Distant Shores. SAGA\". The game made in Renpy with the style of classic animated films. In this game you'll be playing for several different characters(males, females, futas) and their stories are conected to each other in one huge world with different races and creatures. In this game your choices matter and they will determine how will your story develop. Your choices could save lives or lead to a premanent death of some characters, so be sirious about it. The stories take place in different parts of a historical fictional world where you will encounter many characters with different stories, goals, personalities and races.</p>\n<p>I have huge plans for this game. I've already have a script for 2 seasons with 13 chapters in each. Right now I'm making chapter one, it's about a woman who's trying to remember who she is while overcoming obstacles.</p>\n<p><strong>Content:</strong></p>\n<p>M/F, F/F, Vaginal, anal, blowjob, lesbian, milf, futanari, creatures, Impregnation, orgy, gangbang</p>\n<p>All content is avoidable, you can always stop anything you don't like.</p>\n<p><strong>Plans for future:</strong></p>\n<p>Unity engine, battle system, stats and skills, animations, voice acting.</p>\n<p>I also have another projects in my mind but now my priority is Distant Shores SAGA.</p>\n<p><strong>Why you should pledge?:</strong></p>\n<p>I'm not an artist so I have to pay for the art you see in my game. Also, I have a full time job and this game is my hobby, but I dream to gather a team and create that kind of games full time. Your pledges will speed up my work tremendously and you will see lots of new arts and features. If everything goes well I'll hire additional staff to improve quality and speed up the development.</p>\n<p>P.S. English is not my first language so there will probably be gramatical mistakes, until I hire a professional translator.</p>\n<p>Links: PATREON<br/></p>\n<p><strong>\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0436\u0435 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0435.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T06:37:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/159/159829e57361f7e7c0d3932f54b33754.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["TD13"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
