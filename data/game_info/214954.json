Thanks! :D</strong></p>\n<p>This is a <strong>fighting game without player agency nor punches</strong>, instead you tap different rhythmic patterns to dance with sweet poses.\u00a0Chain them to perform a <strong>combo</strong> and bust a move that serves as <strong>dodging</strong> for the attacks of the opponent. Be careful to make the right choice or you could end receiving a punch triying to dodge a kick.\u00a0 But over all... don't miss the <strong>groove</strong>!\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6e/c6ece45166fa1485fa5c2b6ab3a37999.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Random Games"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
