I actually entered this jam because I have never made a horror project ever and wanted to challenge myself. To be honest this one was wayyyy outside my comfort zone. So please be gentle if you can hehe.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The project is not really scary, it\u2019s probably more \u201cbleak\u201d. In short, it has some horror elements without being scary.\r\n  </p>\n<p>I started way too ambitious and so ended up cutting so many of the features I had planned. I really struggled with the time.<br/></p>\n<p>Stuff removed was:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>The intro and outro cutscenes had to be changed to single text based screen scenes</li><li>Use of the inventory system \r\n  </li><li>Generally more action</li><li>Larger game area for exploration</li><li>The player would be able to respawn by sacrificing an item they are carrying. \r\n  </li></ul>\n<p>Either way I hope it is still at least a little interesting to play.\r\n  </p>\n<p>I hope the performance is ok too. I really struggled to get it working how I wanted it to. And the filesize is unfortunately a lot higher than I would have liked. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Yikes I just had a look at the other submissions and mine is nearly 10 times the file size of some of the others :-( . Maybe later I can figure out how to streamline the sizes better in Unity and resubmit.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Many thanks for checking it out anyhow. All the best.\r\n  </strong>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Design, Logic, Characters, Story designed by Circumpunk-KKB <br/></p>\n<p>Unity Engine:<br/></p>\n<p>Other Resources:\r\n  </p>\n<p>Available from Unity Asset Store\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li>Playmaker by Hutong Games\r\n  </li><li>Horror FPS Kit by Thunderwire Studio\r\n  </li><li>Tail Animator by Fimpossible Creations\r\n  </li><li>Gaia 2 by Procedural Worlds\r\n  </li><li>Camera Filter Pack by Vetasoft\r\n  </li><li>Decrepit Dungeon Lite by Prodigous Creations\r\n  </li><li>Chainlink Fences by Kobra Game Studios\r\n  </li><li>Survival old House by Nikolay Fedorov\r\n  </li><li>Old Building by Rusik3DModels\r\n  </li><li>The Wasteland LITE by Aquarius Max\r\n  </li><li>Scary Sound FX by Anthon\r\n  </li><li>Horror Ambient Sounds Pack by Luka Kotar\r\n  </li><li>Flatkit by Dustyroom</li></ul>\n<p>Other models Available from Sketchfab available under Creative Commons Attribution\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li>Android, all animations by L3v3n\r\n  </li><li>Black Demon by simonemaccari\r\n  </li><li>Eye Animation by dissipated.prod\r\n  </li><li>Cam\u00e9ra 35 mm Bell and Howell 2709 by TECHN\u00c8S 2019\r\n  </li><li>Mannequin by Kishan\r\n  </li><li>Camera-Appareil photo Yashica mat 124g by Kamyu0\r\n  </li><li>Surveillance Camera by FoxFX\r\n  </li><li>Mannequin Robot Female by TNTPredarno\r\n  </li><li>Haydee Female Base by TNTPredarno\r\n  </li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  All models modified, adjusted and rigged where necessary using Mixamo\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T06:43:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f48/f48c1ebe4d75007c2a518404625e3485.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Circumpunk"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
