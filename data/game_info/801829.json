It certainly had (many) flaws, but, to this day,\u00a0I still find it fun to play. So, I decided to team up with a couple of wonderful friends to remake the game, and we ended up adding a ton of awesome features and improvements.</p>\n<p>However, the core gameplay is still the same, and the original description still holds up:</p>\r\nCellfish is a\u00a0fast-paced game where you play as a cell and try to survive as many waves of incoming bacteria as possible.\r\nNew features\r\n<p>This time around, you can take advantage of the same power-ups as before, as well as one new one. We also added a new enemy type, as well as a tough (and quite annoying) <strong><em>boss battle</em></strong>!</p>\n<p>Cellfish now features an updated score system, and an in-game\u00a0<strong><em>online leaderboard</em>\u00a0</strong>to keep track of the best players.\u00a0</p><p>Make sure to download the game to play it to its full potential! A few features, including the leaderboard, are only available on the Windows version, not on the Web version.<br/></p>\r\nLocal co-op multiplayer\r\n<p>The game can be played in singleplayer mode, but also in a<em><strong> </strong></em><em><strong>local co-op multiplayer\u00a0</strong></em>mode. One player uses the keyboard &amp; mouse, while the other takes a PS4/Xbox One controller. You'll have to work together to survive\u00a0the ensuing\u00a0pandemonium!\u00a0</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Afonso Mota\u00a0-\u00a0Programming &amp;\u00a0Game Design, with Unity</li><li>Ivo Duarte - Art, with Krita</li><li>Jo\u00e3o Pereira - Music</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T09:29:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b85/b8552da1e0b4de15285a67d4c62e23e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["afonsom20"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
