Well... actually you destroy them anyway. But you only get score and power if you go fast enough.</p>\n<p>Use the up key to boost yourself, or collect enough to activate your ability with the choo choo button! (or... collect even more until the bar turns blue... ehehehe)</p>\n<p>Made for the VimJam 3 with the theme\u00a0<em>Turn up the Heat</em>.<br/>My game is only trying to capture this feeling of turning up the heat. Preferably with many explosions, and lots of game juice/energy.</p>\n<p>Have fun! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T17:49:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dcb/dcba614ee75ff6fa9213b82cdd8b344b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pampogokiraly"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
