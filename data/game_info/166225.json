For those who don\u2019t know, the theme was to make a game based off of one of the xkcd webcomics or \u201cWhat If?\u201d articles. As you might imagine, I chose for my project the \u201cWhat if?\u201d article \u201cA Mole of Moles\u201d. It\u2019s a short witty piece on what a mole(the unit of measurement) of moles(the small furry critter) might look like.<br/></p>\n<p>A Mole of Moles is an idle/clicker game with level mechanics. It can be played either actively or passively in the background (however, like any JS game, it will slow down if not an active tab). Buy upgrades and click on the Mole Hole to produce moles. Click on the Thresh-mole-d button when you have enough moles to level up and raise your Mega Mole-tiplier! Try to get to 6.02 x 10^23 moles! It\u2019s exponential-tastic!</p>\n<p>I made this game myself in 72 hours for the xkcd game jam using no game making software or templates. Just me and atom, html, and JavaScript. I made all the assets art and such, except the music which is from DL Sounds.\u00a0 The game is otherwise ~100% complete and playthrough-able.</p>\n<p>Check out the article it is based on here:\u00a0https://what-if.xkcd.com/4/</p>\n<p>Play on Newsgrounds:\u00a0https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/70235</p>\n<p>Source\u00a0Code at Github:\u00a0https://github.com/PatrickBD/Mole_of_Moles</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af3/af3366ce195970073d8af2471a66e739.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Valkling-Friend of All Things"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
