{"id": 659592, "slug": "twisting-tower", "name": "Twisting Tower", "name_original": "Twisting Tower", "description": "<p>Twisting Tower is a single- and multiplayer platformer where players try to escape a randomly generated tower. The twist (pun intended) is, that individual rooms, as well as the entire tower can be rotated by the players to get an advantage for yourself or\u00a0order to hinder one another from progressing.</p>\n<p>Escape increasingly bigger towers in singleplayermode, starting at a tower that is 4 levels big, it will keep increasing in size.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Or face off against other people in multiplayer-mode (This might be unstable as we couldn't fix all bugs, if it doesn't work, just try the singleplayer).</p>\n<p>The first and last floor of every tower will always contain a door and a key respectively and both rooms will always stay upright / can't be rotated. The goal is to pick up the key and bring it to the door in order to win the race. Dying to hazards will result in you dropping the key and being transported back to the door (if the whole tower was rotated you might have to travel down now!). You can snatch away the key from other players by touching it.</p>\n<p>Escaping a tower will earn you a key. Use your keys to buy new colors for your character.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Powerups:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Swap Rooms\u00a0</em>(ladder icon):</p>\n<p>Swaps your current room with a room\u00a0 somewhere above you. Doesn't work in ladder and key rooms. Also doesn't work if above you is only a ladder or a key room.</p>\n<p><em>Rotate\u00a0</em><em>Tower </em>(bricks icon):</p>\n<p>Rotates the entire tower.</p>\n<p><em>Soar upwards\u00a0</em>(raised hands icon):</p>\n<p>Gives the player a strong upwards boost. Can be used in mid-air.</p>\n\n<p>---------------</p>\n<p>game made by:\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://itch.io/profile/tamoo<br/></p>\n<p>https://onidomie.itch.io/<br/></p>\n\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T13:32:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fd/5fd56a143d90d72a430d76ded366b770.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Onidomie", "Tamoo"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
