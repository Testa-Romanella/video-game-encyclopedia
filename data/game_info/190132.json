Dodge torpedoes whenever possible, as each torpedo takes away one life. For every 20 subs you kill, you gain a level. Every second level gets you another life. Each sub increases your score by one, and every sub you let get to the opposite end of the screen decreases your score by 2. It gets progressively harder as the levels increase, notably:<br/></p><p>at level 3 the subs start spawning from either left or right side (randomly)</p><p>at level 6 the subs increase their speed</p><p>at level 9 the subs increase their speed</p><p>Sub spawn time, torp spawn time, sub vertical position are all picked randomly based on what level you are on.</p><p>If you manage to beat the game, you will enable an enhanced graphics mode. You can also just unlock this by pressing L+R+A on the title screen :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/888/8881a59d926969a6c42d9251ea133ee4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["xorrbit"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
