You save it by taking the lights power and navigating the dungeon.</p>\n<p>The catch is to reach the surface you need to use the power. Try and keep it alive.</p>\n<p>I've been wanting to play with the 2D lighting, so this was a good excuse. I experimented with the changes in light depending on how much power was used.</p>\n<p>Ran out of time to really see this program through. I had one level finish and the bones of a game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T14:28:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e94/e9431d358a5968bc3f4806e5b943d60e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fry11"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
