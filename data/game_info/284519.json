I uploaded those games to Glorious Trainwrecks rather than here. But now, they are coming to ITCH for the first time!!</p>\n<p>If you like my stuff, you can download this pack and play those games without having to download them all seperately!</p>\n<p>This pack contains\u00a0<strong>10</strong>\u00a0small games! There are 3 games not included: Flamingo Quest, which was released seperately, <em>LOCK HORNS</em>, which didn't make any sense to anyone who didn't know who it was a parody of, and <em>Mystery Of Glow-Peak</em>, which will be in volume 2.</p>\n<ol><li><em>Clone Fu</em></li><li><em>Volcano Island</em></li><li><em>Cool Slide 1</em></li><li><em>Game Made While Procrastinating On Another Game</em></li><li><em>Caught Between Dimensions</em></li><li><em>Crawl Into A Hole!</em></li><li><em>Terrible Lectures</em></li><li><em>My Castle's Haunted!</em></li><li><em>Binky C.L.I.X A.k.a Binky And The Blustery Day OR Binky And The Pie*</em></li><li><em>Last GOTY 2018</em></li></ol>\n<p>All in all there's hours of games in here. Some such as <em>Caught Between Dimensions</em>\u00a0and <em>Last GOTY</em>\u00a0have save features, so there's a lot to do in them. The saves appear as text files in the game's folder. They all begin with an underscore so they go to the top of the folder.</p>\n<p>Controls for each game are usually detailed in the game itself. But if you're stuck for what to do: arrow keys, Z,X,C, esc, are the default buttons in a lot of them.</p><p>I know these games are free elsewhere, but leave me a tip if you feel I\u00a0deserve it!</p>\n<p><em>*Binky C.L.I.X, the 9th game, features characters and models created by Mariken G, who is credited in-game, but also credited here</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-14T03:32:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfd/dfd08423ea2d8efbd0da58c93cc9f278.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheWaether"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
