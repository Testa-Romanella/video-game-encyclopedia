You can move your block on the left to any path you like and then press fire to launch it down the path. If it stops next to a block or blocks\u00a0containing the same number, they will merge to create a block of double value. Each extra block merged doubles the value further, and newly merged or moved blocks can also combine with blocks next to them to create long chain-reactions. The game ends when any of the blocks reach the left hand side.</p>\n<p>Press 'M' to toggle music on/off.</p>\n<ul><li>Written in KickAssembler using Sublime Text,\u00a0CharPad and SpritePad.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Music by Richard Bayliss (reworked slightly to free up channel 3 for SFX - sorry Richard!)</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Testing by Michael Streleski (if there are any remaining bugs this is down to my impatience\u00a0to finally get this out of the door!)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T06:27:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f5/2f5ab5dafc7df54287bd0c74872845ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arla Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
