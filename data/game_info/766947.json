In <strong>TimeCave</strong>, you play as a clockwork robot who is struggling with time. It has a wind up key in it's back and that is the source of your life power. The key acts like a watermill under waterfalls to recharge it's energy. Do you think you can delay the death, or even something greater?</p>\n<p>Controls are simple, you can hold <strong>[A/Left Key]</strong> to jump left or<strong> [D/Right Key] </strong>to jump right.\u00a0Be careful with the charge though!</p>\n<p>P.S. There are sound glitches (I think) in browser version so I recommend to download it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T20:23:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4af/4af1513957c5943dcd3b9539d4f431df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Karahan", "Kovalski4"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
