Well, you sure don't hear that every day. What happens will happen and unluckily for them, the usual buddies were thrown in the mix. They will need you to help them beat 100+ familiar challenges in order to get back home. Good luck!</p>\n<p>This is a game where you dodge enemies and obstacles and try to get to the goal. Final Challenges is a compilation of the best levels in the Brutal series (Brutal's Challenge DeluXe, Brutal - Halloween Challenges and Brutal - The New Challenges). This game is simple at first glance but with mechanics like quickdashing, parrying, level jumping, and pushblocking, you'll have fun trying to beat the levels as fast as you can. However, patience is still key for first-timers and experts alike.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T06:40:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78e/78ee1d5689d9adee3771949defb9ab96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bloodmoon Devlopment"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
