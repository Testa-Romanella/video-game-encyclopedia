For the jam, I decided to do my take on a \"<em>Candy Crush-esque</em>\" puzzle concept game (<em>minus the match-3</em>... haha.) <br/></p>\n\n<p>While in development, I decided that I wanted to release a larger version of this project --\u00a0<em>hence, the \"Demo\" title</em> -- with many more levels, abilities, obstacles, trophies, leaderboards, and more! Big thanks to Firith for putting this gamejam on and getting me so inspired!</p>\n<p>If you enjoy the game, be sure to follow me for details on when the full-version will be released! I'll  be tweaking it for the rest of the month, so probably early-mid April! All  feedback and suggestions welcome in the comments! I want to make this  great!\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing!\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>-RJ</p>\n<p>\r\nSEEDZANDTWIGZ | Twitter | Youtube</p>\n<p>----------<br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Note before playing: No Tutorial!</em></strong><em> - I ran out of time towards the end of the jam... but I've inserted a \"Help\" section in the game which explains all the rules that can be toggled with a click or the \"H\" key. I've included those \u00a0instructions below along with some gameplay and control notes!<br/></em></p>\n<p>----------</p>\n\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In the game you must <strong>Harvest</strong> as many flowers as you can to build up your score. The game ends when the timer runs out, or if flowers on the play field stack up too high.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong>:</p>\n<p>Left Mouse: Click Flowers and Use Abilities</p>\n<p>Hotkeys (1,2,3,4,5): Another way to use abilities <br/></p>\n<p>Esc: Quit to Menu/Quit Game<br/></p>\n<p>----------<br/></p>\n<p><strong>HELP/TUTORIAL</strong>: <br/></p>\n<p>As stated earlier, I ran out of time for a proper tutorial (I will be adding one into the full version!) Below you'll find all the information you need to play the game:<br/></p>\n\n<p>**The <strong>Master Flower</strong> at the top of the screen changes colors every few <br/>seconds</p>\n<p>**<strong>Click flowers that match the Master Flower</strong> to harvest them</p>\n<p>**When the Master Flower is rainbow colored, you may harvest any flower<br/></p>\n<p>**As you progress,<strong> the speed of the game will increase</strong></p>\n<p>**TIP: Two or more of the same flower stacked in a column will auto-harvest <br/></p>\n<p>**<strong>Use your abilities</strong> beneath the playfield to help you clear flowers faster</p>\n<p>**You can click abilities or use their hotkeys (1,2,3,4,5) to activate them when their cooldown expires</p>\n<p>**Hover over abilities to see what they do (in the tooltip section)<br/></p>\n<p>**The game ends when the time expires or when flowers reach the white line near the top of the board<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Press (H) to hide or bring up this menu in game.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- - - - - - - -</p>\n\n<p>Thank again for playing! I hope your harvest was plentiful! And please let me know any comments or feedback you may have for the upcoming full version! <br/></p>\n<p>-RJ\r\n</p>\n<p>  SEEDZANDTWIGZ | Twitter | Youtube\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T06:28:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c32/c320e2d87fcf4bc2238e893637493fb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 237, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SEEDZ AND TWIGZ"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
