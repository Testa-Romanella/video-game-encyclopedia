The cities of man are lorded over by\u00a0giant monsters known as the Nephilim. Each of these Titan Kings are as much as five times the height of a man, and so\u00a0powerful that they can lay waste to entire armies by themselves. But this power has made them cruel, and they treat\u00a0their human subjects terribly. In turn, the humans squabble and treat each other poorly as well. Slavery and murder are\u00a0common, and it is truly a dark time.</p>\n<p>You are the human leader of Lasthallow, a small settlement of hunters and farmers, a task you have grown to love.

The rest of your\u00a0village is loath to risk angering that Titan King, and as such make no move to try and save their kin. So you decide to\u00a0call for volunteers, and begin to train them with swords and bows. Very few answer the call at first, and most of those\u00a0<br/>are lured by the promise of steady food. It isn\u2019t much, but it\u2019s a start.</p>\n<p>Zeurus is sure to have more men, that are better equipped. But if you don\u2019t try, your people will spend their lives in\u00a0slavery, kept from those they love.
