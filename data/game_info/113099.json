We've just released my debut game, David, a physics-based platforming boss-fighter, on Windows and Mac (and iOS soon), and we think it's really rad! I'd love it if you give it a play. Have fun!</p><p><em>(Find this info and more at http://www.fermentergames.com/david)</em><br/><br/>You play David, an awfully small abstracted chosen hero tossed into a blissfully simple world overrun by giant culminations of evil physics-beasts (largely inspired by Shadow of the Colossus). As David, you are given a slingshot-esque gift that you will have to use to conquer these colossus foes. Hold, aim, and fling to attack (Angry Birds style!).<br/><br/>Think Limbo + Shadow of the Colossus + Angry Birds.<br/><br/>Features a 9-level campaign, a survival/arena/rpg mode, a secret basket-ball-pit minigame, and hats! (Additional levels and other content are in the works.)</p><p>\u201cLong story short: it's really awesome.\" - Touch Arcade</p><p>// <strong>Trailer Video!</strong> https://vimeo.com/88035024<br/>// <strong>Screenshots!</strong> http://www.fermentergames.com/david/<br/>// <strong>Press-kit!</strong> http://www.fermentergames.com/press-david</p><p>// <strong>Release Date:</strong> Out Now! <em>(TBA for iOS)</em><br/>// <strong>Price:</strong> $2<br/>// <strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, MacOSX, iOS<br/>// <strong>Where:</strong> DavidIsAGame.com (direct)</p><p>Thanks so much.
