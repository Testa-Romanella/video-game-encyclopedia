See what drama your four years hold, will there be betrayal? Romance? Sick backflips?? Probably. And lots more!<br/></p>\n<p>But remember, you have to graduate top of the class to go on to the real Olympics, which means your classmates are your friends, but ultimately your competition. Do you have what it takes to accrue enough Connections, Chums and Cred?</p>\n\n<p>Preparing for Paris is heavily influence by Meguey and Vincent Baker's\u00a0<em>Apocalypse World\u00a0</em>and\u00a0<em>Firebrands\u00a0</em>mechanics. You can find their games here.<br/></p>\n<p>I also want to thank Quinn Vega for writing a Firebrands hack\u00a0<em>For the Honour\u00a0</em>which had some really evocative prompts that helped me with my own.</p>\n\n<p>Preparing for Paris was written for the 2020 Okashicon x ninjaHELL Productions Anime TTRPG design contest, and was a finalist in said competition! Thank you to the organisers for running the competition, without which this game would not exist!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T04:42:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cea/cea56e73f9ba391a80ba03d8cf848bda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["breathingstories"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
