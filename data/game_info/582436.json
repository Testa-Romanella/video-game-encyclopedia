If you get stuck watch the gameplay video.</p>\n<p>Made for Kindred Community Jam #6.</p>\n<p>This is my second game jam, since I started doing some game dev this year.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The web build is kinda broken, so I recommend downloading the game.</strong></p>\n<p>The audio is stuttery (for me atleast) and there is lots of random lag.<br/></p>\n<p>I also realised that the secret ending doesn't work in the build. If you flew too high you would get a quote about Icarus, but instead you just get a black screen.</p>\n<p>Also the Linux version apparently has no audio.</p>\n<p>Sorry about all the problems, I hope you still enjoy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Inventory: E / I</p>\n<p>Move: WASD / arrow keys\u00a0(/space to jump)<br/></p>\n<p>Mine / Place / Use: LMB</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>By Berez\r\n</p>\n<p>Godot Engine, SFX made with Leshy SF Maker.</p>\n<p>Ram sound from Feliyan Studios.</p>\n<p>Fonts:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Basteleur by Keussel</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Techna Sans by Carl Enund</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Sinistre by Jules\u00a0Durand</p>\n<p>Kindred and Janna for hosting this wonderful jam :)</p>\n\n<p><em>Baaaaa!!!!!</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T18:32:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c6/2c627b0ff001a7dadb0d0f650d4f2744.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Berez"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
