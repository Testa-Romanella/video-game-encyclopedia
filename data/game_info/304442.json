Future episodes will be based on real life experiences but from the perspective of a plush animal cow as she watches, interacts and observes her owners on the highs and lows of their lives.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first episode will be about the adoption of Betsy the cow. This was made during NaNoReno 2019. My hope is that it'll bring joy and laughter to those who play the game as this is my first time creating via Ren'Py.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you happen to spot any errors, please don't hesitate to let me know!</p>\n<p>You can follow me on my social media channels and my website below:</p>\n<p>Website: Red Lotus Designz<br/>Facebook: @redlotusdesignz<br/>Twitter: @redlotusdesignz<br/>Instagram: @redlotusdesignz</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong><br/></p><p><em><strong>Please do not sell or redistribute the game as this is copyrighted by me.
