{"id": 21450, "slug": "synonymy", "name": "Synonymy", "name_original": "Synonymy", "description": "Synonymy is a non-profit, educational word game narrated by Richard Dawkins where players are challenged to find a path between random words through their network of synonyms. By taking the synonym of a word, and then a synonym of that synonym, and so on, you can ultimately arrive at any other word in a language.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game supports multiplayer, and weekly challenges in which users can compete globally on set start and end words. Every time a path is uncovered by a user, it is tweeted from @synonymygame and posted to our Facebook page. All profits go to educational charities. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nA visualization of the game's network can be seen here -- http://tinyurl.com/med6g8b -- In order to compute relative distance, all synonyms were mapped using 3d graphing software, as if each word were a planet that had a gravitational pull proportional to its number of relationships to other nodes. Above is a 2D representation of that model, a 40,000 x 40,000 rendering.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMusic by Daduk", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:05:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/026/026ab7e7ed2ff549acce91c0a4e3fed2.jpg", "website": "http://www.synonymy-game.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 82, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Cinq-Mars Media", "Christopher Cinq-Mars Jarvis"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Educational"], "publishers": ["Cinq-Mars Media", "Christopher Cinq-Mars Jarvis"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
