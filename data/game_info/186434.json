Now, armed with a gun, you have to kill the ghosts without killing any civilians.<br/></p>\n<p>Ghostcam is a \"spot the differences\" game, where you have to click invisible moving ghosts after finding them on a static photograph of both them and normal people.<br/></p>\n<p>Team submission by bojidar-bg, kennyG and Obmai89/AuRiX.</p>\n\n\n<p>Since time was a bit short, the background of prototype Godot engine icons still stands.
