The intention of this demo is to showcase the player abilities in a series of timed challenge rooms. Save the frogs as fast as you can!<br/></p>\n<p>The final game will be much more about discovery and exploration, as the frogs (and many other secrets) will be spread throughout the game world, but this is a great way to dive in to get an impression of what the game feels like. If you enjoyed the demo, and you're interested in supporting the full game, you should check out the Kickstarter page.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/853/853dbc10c7798a68d33443f783ffb289.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tootiredstudios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
