{"id": 939669, "slug": "of-acid-and-iron", "name": "Of Acid and Iron", "name_original": "Of Acid and Iron", "description": "<p>\"Of Acid and Iron\" is a Roleplaying Game where you fall into the role of Cernos Talonswallow, an adopted dracokin, under the care of his uncle, Erickson Ironbeard. Raised in the peaceful lands of Gradia, where nothing really happens, Cernos grew up helping the people of the village with everyday tasks, but, despite being kind at heart, felt most at home in the forest, or at the forge, with his uncle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even with those mild comforts, he had a rising need to step out into the world and become an adventurer. He hopes to one day find his parents, and ask why they left him with his dwarven uncle. What his adventure has in store for him, however, is much, much more than just being a hometown hero...</p><p>This game is still in early development - I might never really complete it, but it's something I'm really passionate and hopeful for turning into a much bigger world than is currently shown on the game. If you notice anything sorta... bug-gy, or otherwise not supposed to happen (Besides reaching a point you can't progress), let me know!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T20:27:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f1/8f123a4489315528df422c57a21269c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EnderWolf513"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
