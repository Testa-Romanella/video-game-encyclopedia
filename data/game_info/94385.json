There is no interaction possible from the player, but the entities present in the pond will behave and interact together in different ways.\r\n</p><p>If you are on Windows, you can put a mini version of the pond anywhere on your screen, checking its evolution just by glancing at it from time to time while doing something else. (If you know how to do this for Mac and Linux, please contact me!)</p><p>Be sure to read the Controls.txt to learn how to switch between modes and manipulate the aspect of the pond.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>Ghost Pond is an alternative \"aquarium\" desktop version to Shoal, an interactive projected installation developed at the Critical Hit incubator during summer 2015.</p><p><em>The project Shoal was made possible through the Technoculture, Art and Games Research Center's Critical Hit: Games Collaboratory and the support of Concordia University and Dawson College and financial contribution of the Minist\u00e8re de l'Enseignement sup\u00e9rieur, de la Recherche, de la Science et de la Technologie.</em><br/></p><p>Shoal was developed by Kailin Zhu, Owen Bell, Tobias Wehrum, Tony Higuchi and I. Hope Erin also worked on the first prototype. We plan to show the installation at different festivals in the near future. More about Shoal.</p><p>Although I worked on Shoal, the original project, with a bunch of awesome people, the entire contents of Ghost Pond available here were created by me after Critical Hit.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b2/5b2121f63aa5b8aeaf14f255815ed8cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Titouan Millet"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
