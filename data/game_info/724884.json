They allow a very simple yet powerful method to control various devices, ranging from servo motors to thermostats. They are also very very easy to code, and very easy to manipulate the response by changing the values of the gains (KP, KI, KD). The basic idea of a PID controller is that you have a desired \"setpoint\" that you want a system to reach, starting from an \"initial point\". The PID controller determines how to modify the actual state of the system over time using the difference between the true and desired states--the \"error\". Three modifications are\u00a0\u00a0used: one based on a proportional relationship to the error, one based on an integrated sum of the error over time, and one based on the derivative of the error. Thus we get the name \"P\", \"I\", \"D\" controller: it just is a shortened name\u00a0for \"Proportional\", \"Integral\", \"Derivative\" controller.</p>\n<p><em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</em></p>\n<em>Arturo Urquizo, CC BY-SA 3.0</em>\n<p><strong>Read more about them on Wikipedia!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T08:41:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a7/0a76055b95756f683b83f42420dd3c3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["rezajamesahmed"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
