The cold atmosphere between the races has lost sustainability, and all the races are now preparing for an expedition to the World's Roof. <br/><br/><br/><br/>As you prepare for the expedition to take over the powerful relics located at the World's Roof, a wandering wizard comes to help you fight the battles. <br/>Remember, with your troops, you must be the first to take over the World's Roof's relics before others.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>With the help of the Wizard, you can briefly monitor the battlefield and control your troops. <br/>You can identify each of your troops with tin dolls with different appearances. <br/><br/><br/><br/>All troops have their own movement/attack patterns. <br/>In addition to the attributes and characteristics of the troop's powers, these movement and attack patterns are also essential factors that you need to consider in strategy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thoroughly plan your strategy and win. Effectively win the battle by moving troops where the enemy can't counter-attack and quickly retreating to a position the enemy cannot follow. Strategies like this will matter. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Magic can be a key that completes your strategy. <br/><br/>With magic spells, you can either protect or strengthen your team. You can also choose a strategy that destroys enemies with magic attacks. <br/><br/>Your magic combination also plays a vital role in the battle. Even within the same collaboration of troops, strategies vary depending on which magic spells you cast and in what order.<br/><br/>There are 4 races that you can select for your troops. Each race has its own strengths and weaknesses. <br/>Make up for the shortcomings of the race with the skills and magics of other races. <br/> <br/>For some kinds of races, making use of their strengths first, or making up for their shortcomings first, may determine the success of the early stages of the expedition.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>There is another way to strengthen your troops and magic skills. <br/>RELICs provide special effects and synergies in ways that can't be obtained from other sources. <br/><br/>With relics, you can increase your income during the expedition, add beneficial effects before starting a battle, strengthen certain types of troops &amp; magic powers, and weaken your enemies. <br/><br/>You can only activate a limited number of relics, but they can be replaced at any time except during battles. <br/><br/>Choose and use relics according to your needs and circumstances.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li> CHESS-inspired turn-based strategy game mixed with card collection genres. <br/></li><li> (Based on our current updates) Select your troops from 4 races <br/></li><li> Race-themed areas <br/></li><li> 7 types of unique troops and 10 types of unique magic powers per race<br/></li><li> More than 10 types of troops and 20 types of magic shared among troops<br/></li><li> More than 20 kinds of relics </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T02:40:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/940/94026103230c666384f0d34c01cc419b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 494, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BlueTale"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BlueTale"], "esrb_rating": null}
