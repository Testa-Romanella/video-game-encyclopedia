With the help of the Rock Fairy himself, she travels through the demon's home world to get her talent back. Along the way she frees other rockstars that have shared a similar fate. The game is split into two parts, the first is a dungeon crawler as you fight through demonic body guards. The second part is a rhythm based rock battle against the bosses of the levels. You get new abilities and power ups as you progress and free other rockstars. As the game progresses, Selene realizes that while her talent might fade, her Mojo will always remain Righteous.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-21T04:20:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d71/d71d290df85436b79d5a01362f0b094b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 221, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Why Not Fail Again?"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Why Not Fail Again?"], "esrb_rating": null}
