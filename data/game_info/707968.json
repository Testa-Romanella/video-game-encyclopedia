They aren't impossible, they are just hard to do, but people daily make these things in UE4 nowadays. They do it, cause, guys look, it's possible now these days. That's what all we're yet doing, we've made progress as you see from the video below. We're on that, adding new mechanics, new features everyday. And after end of the project, we're actually going to get a free,\u00a0good, fun modern <strong>military simulation</strong> game. And it'll be free! It just takes time to add things one by one. And <em>SOWO </em>development is staying on that thing. End of the main real day, you're getting on the battle without of wasting moneys to just have fun.</p>\r\nWhy?\r\nFun + learning != money //['!=' means 'is not' programming XD]&lt;div class=\"open_grepper_editor\" title=\"Edit &amp; Save To Grepper\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n<p>OR</p>\n<p><strong>To get fun + learning, nature\u00a0didn't made them to get by paying money.</strong> I truly believe it's really important to take, so I take it and won't be \"charging money from you guys just to give you for fun and give you this kind of good games.\"</p>\n<p>So understanding on those points, <em>SOWO</em> is focused on all the mentioned things to be done, for free. As we're adding so many things, maybe you can say it's <strong>a lot realistic experience you'll be getting when we've the finished day!</strong></p>\r\nProgress:\r\n<p><strong>Currently <em>SOWO </em>is being made</strong>, but again, it's not the all of the game. Real things aren't here yet, because you know it isn't finished yet:</p><br/>\n<p><em>With that, to help us to give you such realistic game and problem-free fun experience, for free, I request to give us feedback to improve this game, for, you'll. Your suggestions will be requested, (but please don't tell us to do out-topics, e.g. Fantasy elements, Outer-worlds etc.) keep them fit-able with realistic fun military simulator category, it'll make both you (players) and\u00a0us (developers) happy :)</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T11:25:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a27/a27dd8c3609818c0165e3316aa077a87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jumma Game Developer"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
