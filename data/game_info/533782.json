{"id": 533782, "slug": "santas-empty-sack", "name": "Santa's Empty Sack", "name_original": "Santa's Empty Sack", "description": "<p>This game was made for the\u00a0LynXmas 2020 game jam, a 15 day long game jam without final rankings for no other purpose but to have some fun and make some Xmas cheer! All entries into the competition had to be 32KB or less.</p>\n<p>The game was coded in about a\u00a0week using CC65, ABCmusic, GIMP and a couple of other support tools.</p>\n\n\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>Move Santa left, right, up or down on the screen. Once you are standing over a present, press the A button to crouch and pick it up.</p>\n<p>The squirrel will defecate so avoid stepping into his poo, it will stick to your boots and\u00a0slow you down!</p>\n<p>Every time the squirrel drops a present, it will try to hurry to get it back so get it before he does, or you'll lose points! Every time you recover a present,\u00a0the squirrel's frenzy level increases, once his frenzy has reached its maximum, he will run around extremely fast trying to confuse you.</p>\n\n\r\nAtari Lynx Development\r\n<p>If you are interested in developing your own games for Atari Lynx, check out the\u00a0Programming Resources\u00a0page. Lynx is one of the easiest retro game consoles to get started coding with, so if you have an idea for a game, don't hold back, code it for the Lynx!</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>I would not have been able to create this game without the following free graphics assets. Even though I didn't use every single frame, my sprites and animations were heavily inspired by these.</p>\n<ul><li>Santa Claus - Free Sprites</li><li>2D Pixel Art Squirrel Sprites</li><li>2D Pixel Art Santa Sprites</li></ul>\n<p>I'd also like to thank Sarah from Sarah Pointing Music Studio\u00a0with helping me understand the Jingle Bells sheet music so it can be translated into ABCmusic for the game (and then I heavily altered it to suit my own style of course!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T09:04:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a9/6a9773ec79f20300c627b4023027931d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Atari Gamer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
