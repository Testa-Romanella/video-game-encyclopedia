Charge your shot power by holding the fire key down (Z for P1, Down for P2). Once you reach the desired power level, release the key, and\u00a0the aiming arc\u00a0will slowly rotate. Press fire again, and a projectile will be launched! The projectile will then explode if 1) it collides with the terrain, or 2) the fire key is pressed, detonating it prematurely.</p>\n<p>This game is based on Zee Artillery, an MSDOS game by Kurt W. Decker.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-05T06:51:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41d/41d955b8998be30fa52ca14b52effe0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GlisteningCipher"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
