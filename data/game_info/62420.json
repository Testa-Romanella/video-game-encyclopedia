Now Lisa/Joshua Nelson have been promoted to Captain, but an increase in rank comes with greater responsibilities.  Even without the threat of the Descorians, the colony is at risk of collapsing due to limited water supplies, food scarcity, and political instability.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAdditionally, there are many alien factions scattered throughout the planet competing with Nelson and her/his team for the precious resources.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOf greater concern is also a series of earthquakes which have scientists worried that the planet is on the verge of a big change, one which could wipe out all life on it.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLike the first title, you'll need to save your colony of Planet Stronghold from all kinds of threats.
