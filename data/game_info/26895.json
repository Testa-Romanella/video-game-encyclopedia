In this game, 16 figures from across history fight for the title of the world&#39;s strongest. In previous installments, the amount of time you held a button down determined the strength or weakness of an attack, but that system has been removed in this game. In addition to a more orthodox fighting-game approach that enables weak, middle and strong attacks using different buttons, this game includes new elements such as the Hero Gauge, Extra Attacks and Guard Breaker Attacks, adding an exciting new layer of strategy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1995-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-18T13:21:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/987/9872049d45aa1bd903835bad9f9b50ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 526, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["SEGA Saturn", "iOS", "Neo Geo", "Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["SNK"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": ["SNK", "D4 Enterprise"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
