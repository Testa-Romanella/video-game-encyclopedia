This is actually my first game. It's nothing special. It literally has 2 colors. But it's free, super lightweight, and, as a bonus, comes with Python! (I'm not converting to C, C#, or anything like that until I know there is a point.)\u00a0 Upload a screenshot of your highscore, and if yours is the highest (well, lowest), you get a feature! Yay. Anyway, about the game. This is a type-and-response type game where you pick a number and the game creates a number between 1 and that number. If you take the 1000000000000 challenge, then your highscore will be saved.
