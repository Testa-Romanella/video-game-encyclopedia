You can fight, collect items, and talk to people.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is made in Bitsy, both coded and drawn by myself. The sprites are all real words from \"Blissymbolics\" (either old or new style), which is an international language mostly gaining popularity in schools for the people with learning disabilities, although many of the symbols are in common use at airports, movie theaters and on the internet these days as well.</p>\n<p>Originally I was trying to make a game based on a certain legend about a monster that kills and eats an old lady's brains and then lives in a cave, and the villagers go in to fight the monster. But that's too difficult for me to make right now, so you really only have the monster. Also the game doesn't have an official ending yet, but once you beat the monster you've unofficially won.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T02:39:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78c/78c74455a70a09c84f810d4e71baa57e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sequoiae"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
