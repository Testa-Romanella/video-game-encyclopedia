It allows you to create code-free AIs and save them in the pico-8 project format (as well as .ai and .txt)! And also export it to OBJ (not real, but which can only be read by AI Tool Ultimate). You can also create your own maps and post them on social networks with the\u00a0#ai_tool_project\u00a0tag using screenshots that will be saved to your desktop after each save! For more information on how to use the tool read the readme file in the tool folder! Have fun using AI Tool Ultimate.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T12:02:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3cb/3cbf97c1bb06a58073e3b5747636448a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Pixel"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
