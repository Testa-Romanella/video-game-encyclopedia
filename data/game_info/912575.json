Depends on your task. In this case, you need to understand that the zombie's behavior will also change.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T14:19:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f09/f0918956a55295d2ca45802384a30c82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JohnsonDigital"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
