On the plus side, she has unlimited ammo and plot armor. On the other hand, the only vehicle she can afford after such insane purchases is a bundle of balloons.\u00a0Maybe she won't be able to beat the invading aliens, but hell, she'll take down as many as she can before she's forced to blow up another three more balloons!</p>\n<p>This game was developed in Unity within 48 hours and was a submission for the Game Maker's Toolkit jam. It was designed to fit the \"Dual Purpose Design\" theme. It ranked<strong> </strong>56th out of 768 entries overall.</p>\n<p>The dual purpose mechanic in this game is the player firing their guns to navigate their balloons while using the bullets to defeat aliens.</p>\n<p>This was the first game I worked on as the sole programmer and it allowed me to learn how much I could create on my own within 48 hours and also to appreciate the benefits of having more programmers to work with. The game had a lot of features planned but had to be scoped down due to time constraints. Overall, it was fun to test my capabilities as the sole programmer.</p>\n<p><strong>This game is available to download at the bottom of this page.</strong></p>\n<p>&lt;-- Back to Chan Yuen Theng's portfolio<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Role</strong></p>\n<p>Game Programmer</p>\n<p><strong>Contributions</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Below are the details and my thoughts on my contributions to this project.</p>\n<p>Programming</p>\n<ul><li>Player movement system\r\n</li><ul><li>The player is hung on the\u00a0balloons and is propelled by their guns to swing side to side.</li><li>A hinge joint component on the balloons and attached the player onto it.
