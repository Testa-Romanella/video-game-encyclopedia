Jam 3.0<br/>Theme: Failure is Progress</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Move: Left and Right Arrows or A &amp; D<br/>Jump: Up Arrow or Space<br/><br/>This is a short puzzle platformer. You play as Randy the Reaper and you must collect the lost souls in each level. These rooms will cause certain death to anyone that tries to navigate them. Good thing you're already dead. When Randy falls on spikes, gets turned into a bubble or set ablaze, he will respawn like new but also leave behind something as well.\u00a0<br/><br/>Get the Music from the game.</p>\n<p>Everything was created during the jam by:<br/>Drewpy: Music and Sound<br/>WhiteVault: Art<br/>Vimlark: Programming</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T13:42:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7be/7beddfb8c591343e1cb288b817f7f66c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Vimlark", "whitevault", "Drewpy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
