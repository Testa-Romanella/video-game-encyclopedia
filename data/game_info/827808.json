Amelia woke up and found herself in a strange place. She needed to escape here as soon as possible.</p>\r\nGame play\r\n<p>Players control Amelia to solve many puzzles and fight with the gun in their hands.</p>\n<p>After her death and rebirth, Amelia gained the ability to cross the two worlds. She needed the ability to solve various puzzles and escape there. In addition, there are two guns, pistols and shotguns in the main process of the game. In addition, you can get a submachine gun and another powerful shotgun by solving the two hidden puzzles of the branch line in the game.<br/></p>\r\nGame status\r\n<p>The game is incomplete. At present, it takes only half an hour to about an hour. If many people like this game, I believe I will continue to complete it until I am satisfied with the final product. There may be some bugs in the current playable content of the game. If found, I hope you can actively put forward. In addition, English is not my mother tongue, so there may be some problems in the text.</p>Warning:\r\nPlease do not use the installation in the itch client to experience this game, which will lead to a bug and prevent you from entering the game. Please download the zip file provided here directly. I don't understand the principle of itch client installation, but from the error situation, it seems that it is caused by replacing the high version nw.js that doesn't conform to my game.\r\nHow to play\r\nDefault key position\r\n<p><strong>\u2191\u2193\u2190\u2192\u00a0 - Move\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</strong><strong>Z -Confirm / Interactive\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</strong><strong>X - Menu / Cancel\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</strong><strong>SHIFT - Dash\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Q\u00a0 - Page up / Flashlight\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0W\u00a0 - Page down / Ability\u00a0\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>C\u00a0 - Switch shooting mode\u00a0 \u00a0V\u00a0 - Switch weapon mode\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</strong><strong>X\u00a0 - Attack in\u00a0 battle mode</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1\u00a0 - Open items quickly\u00a0\u00a0 2\u00a0 - Open equipment quickly</strong></p>\n<p><strong>E\u00a0 - Use items quickly\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0F\u00a0 - Replace magazine manually</strong>\n</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p><strong>QAQ Studio</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Made by OOOsandan\u00a0 with Rpg Maker MV,\r\n </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Thank Beiji for making character pictures.</strong></p>\r\nGraphics\r\n<p><strong>MalibuDarby    Horror City</strong></p>\r\nplugins\r\n<p><strong>Drill_up\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Atelier-Rgss\uff08mog\uff09\u00a0 \u00a0Yanfly Engine \uff08yep\uff09</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Lagomoro (\u5c0f\u4f18)\u00a0 \u00a0Hudell\u00a0 \u00a0\u30c4\u30df\u30aa\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u4ec7\u4e5d\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Galv</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Terrax\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0MPP\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Biud436\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Ganfly (gt50)\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0QChan</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ryusa\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rrocraftynation (DEX)\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0SAN\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0SumRndmDde</strong></p>\r\nSound effect\r\n<p>https://soundeffect-lab.info/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T13:56:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a2/8a2da975c7a6e76d3fc7d94da4aa7b52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 272, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OOOsandan"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
