It became this game.<br/>I worked on it for about 1 week on my laptop and forgot to post it, until now.</p><p>The game was supposed to have a bigger \"playarea\" with different zones and enemies, but due to limited time and other reasons, i scraped those ideas and it became this which is not to bad to be honest.</p><p>You are a human, trapped in the apocalypse. You have weapons already, but you need to find ammo and food. Luckily, there are cabins scattered around the area you can loot from.<br/>You can even find other humans (npc's) that wanders the wasteland and killing zombies as well, however, if the humans die, the turn into undeads as well.<br/>The environment is generated randomly.</p><p>The goal is to survive for as long as possible. Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f4/4f4c20e412a1eb1b6a9a742554cb7dc2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eroxxie"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
