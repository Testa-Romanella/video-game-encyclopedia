All of the graphics, spritework, and programming are done by the creator. None of the soundtracks are officially made.\u00a0</em><em>This project has been moved from fangame to indie game status recently. Yes, this game was previously known as <strong>Sonic and the Mayhem Master</strong>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>WARNING:\u00a0</strong>I highly recommend playing the SAGE 2020 demo. It will teach you the ropes as the current version is more of a test demo without a proper tutorial. It has a hour long content, but it is very buggy and unstable than the new one.
