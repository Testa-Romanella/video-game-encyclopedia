These few but precious items she gathered before her Mother went to Witherington End Asylum are all she has left of her. Within the box, there is also an ornate bottle full of a strange dark liquid with a faded but inviting label promising to transform her into her most perfect self. But this is a dangerous concoction that never should have been brewed by her alchemist Mother, let alone fall into the hands of her only child. <br/><br/>Wiping away her tears, Dawes lifts the bottle out of the box and without a second thought, she drinks the potion. Seconds later, her balance falters and drops the bottle. As the few remaining drops drip into the soil, she stumbles to the ground, her eyes facing the now empty bottle. As she begins to lose consciousness, her attention is briefly caught by blurry small print on the label before she closes her eyes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Warning: Can cause memory loss, paranoia, hallucinations, insanity and death.</strong><br/><br/>Dawes slowly regains consciousness as sounds of birdsong, and the unhealthy groan of her computer fill her ears.
