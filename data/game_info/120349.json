This is my first completely released game and it's been a great experience working with so many kickass creative people over the 10 (11) days of the cyberpunk jam. Big thanks to the people who directly contributed to the project.\u00a0Rimon Bar for helping me with animation and\u00a0Tommy Fullerton for the last minute music assist.</p><p>\r\n\tAll money donated will go directly to the itch.io marketplace who run jams like this all the time and have made this site for indie developers to showcase their stuff in a super ethical and very professional way. Consider chucking in 5$ for the cause.</p><p>\r\n\tThanks!</p>Windows users<p>\r\n\tJust download the windows version, extract the .zip and run the exe file.</p>OSX users<p>\r\n\tJust download the mac Application and run it</p>Linux users<p>You will need to install love first, please run:</p><p>Debian based systems:</p>&gt; sudo apt-get install love\r\n<p>Fedora based systems:</p>&gt; sudo yum install love\r\n<p>Then once you have download the *NIX version of HOODSTOMPING you can use love like so:</p>&gt; love HOODSTOMPING.love\r\n<p>If you have any issues installing please contact me on twitter and I'll help you out!\u00a0(my phone usually squeaks cutely in the case of @ twitter messages)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93e/93e90da73e7f38d1cfa0e4046b7c7835.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["senpusha"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
