At many points in my life, my perfectionism has acted as a wall, a physical barrier almost, that restricted me from doing and creating the things that I wanted. I wanted to make this game to work through some of these emotions, while also creating something that I hope resonates with others.</p>\n<p>All art credit goes to Emily McGee.
