It is a top-down arcade-style\u00a0 space-shooter game where the enemy AI evolves using a genetic algorithm. That is, enemy attributes such as speed, fire-rate, and\u00a0dodge abilities are evolved each wave\u00a0using crossover and mutation (described below)., two concepts that apply to real-world genetics in reproduction\u00a0.\u00a0\u00a0Whichever enemies perform the best from one wave will be used to produce the enemies of the next wave.</p>\n<p><strong>Crossover</strong> - take two parent genomes to produce a child with a genome based on those of its parents.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Mutation</strong> - genes are altered in some way after crossover to produce new behaviours.</p>\n<p>I think it's interesting to think about how the AI could automatically adjust based on the player, since whatever the player's tactic is will affect how well an enemy does, and as such how the next wave is generated.<br/></p>\n<p>As mentioned, this is the first game I've ever made, so any feedback on my game would be great!\u00a0Any cool ideas for where this genetic algorithm idea could be applied more interestingly?\u00a0Let me know! Now that I have the understanding from this basic project, maybe I'll work on something a bit more fun to play that uses genetic algorithms\u00a0in the future.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you're interested in how this works, the source code can be found at\u00a0https://github.com/ThomasFisherSE/Evo-Strike.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ae/5ae545dad7c4b545eee6ad8c02683040.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ThomasFisherSE"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
