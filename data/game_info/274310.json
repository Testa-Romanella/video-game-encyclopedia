Why? Doesn't matter, just get cracking!</p>\n<p>Ugly fishy monsters will try to stop you, but a good smack from your axe should solve that problem. Grab the gold and get out - leave nothing behind.</p>\n<p>This game is an entry for Ludum Dare 43, made by a team of two in 72 hours.<br/></p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>- Move with the WASD or arrow keys.<br/>- Left-click to attack with your axe.<br/>- Right-click to throw gold. This costs gold!</p>\n<p>- Gather as much gold as you can. But beware: carrying all that gold makes you slow.<br/>- Greed must be managed -- sacrifices must be made.<br/>- Gold is your health, score, a weapon, and a burden. Manage it well - run out and you lose.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p><strong>Mika Molenkamp</strong>: Programming, audio implementation, additional art</p>\n<p><strong>Sam Minh Ly</strong>: Level design, balancing, artwork</p>\n<p>freesound.com &amp; bfxr for sound effects</p>\n<p>'SF Proverbial Gothic' by ShyFonts Foundry (shyfoundry.com)</p>\n<p>'Telegrama' by YO Fonts (yoworks.com)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bff/bff222c018829f8949badbed9181604b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BinarySpark"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
