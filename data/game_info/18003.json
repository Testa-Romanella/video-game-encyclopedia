After a year of living abroad, the game&#39;s main character, 21-year-old girl Katie Greenbriar, finally returns home, waiting for a warm welcome from her family. But somehow, she finds that there is no one in the house! Where is everyone? What happened here? This will be seen in Gone Home - a unique adventure game.</p>\n<p>This game is an interactive investigation. You will need to analyse the details of the most ordinary-looking house, learn the history of the people living here. The primary task is to reveal the mystery of what happened, using everything that is possible, as the house has a lot of interactive elements, which allows you to interact with the environment entirely.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, simple movements create an atmosphere of almost inhabited home, as well as expertly crafted light and sound.
