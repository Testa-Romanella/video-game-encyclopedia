{"id": 954395, "slug": "car-parking-challenge", "name": "Car Parking Challenge", "name_original": "Car Parking Challenge", "description": "<p>Drive around 8 highly detailed levels and park in the designated spaces of each. Beat a level fast enough and you could get a world record time! Arrow keys or WASD keys to drive. Space (optional) for brakes. When parking, you need to align the car within the rectangle marking with a P on it. When green, you are correctly aligned, so stay still for 1 second to win. [M] - Toggle music Games can be saved for later. Use the top buttons in the level selector. Do not post them in the comments. Touchscreen mode is available as well. Enable it in the level selection. The player is not properly focused. Click back in to the project. Why is this game so hard? It is a car parking <strong>challenge!</strong>\u00a0The title says exactly that so I'm not sure why it is expected to be not. Apparently level 6 is impossible.\u00a0 This looks like [insert game]! Maybe it does. I take inspiration from all sorts of places. Also, the graphics are not ripped from any game (talking about Nitro Type specifically, stop saying it is). See below for the credits of where they came from. Why is the car so slow? / Why is braking so bad? You don't need to drive really fast when trying to park. Neither do you need to brake 100%. Therefore, I didn't make that a feature. [space] to brake harder does exist though. There's a glitch preventing me from playing/beating a level! This game is not compatible on Chromebooks and Apple devices. I can't do anything about it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T07:28:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c0/9c02139049b0ff272a3807ac71298131.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GvYoutube"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
