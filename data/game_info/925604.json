Thanks!</p>\n<p>Blu the blue bird is in trouble. As he's eating his lunch, he gets a mysterious text on his phone that sucks him into a world of microgames. How many can you beat before you give up?!</p>\n<p>In case you've never played a WarioWare game before, the premise is simple. You play a series of tiny games, known as microgames. If you win one, you score a point. If you lose one, you lose a life. Lose all your lives, and it's game over. As you progress the games will get faster and there will be boss games. Your goal is to score as high as you can.</p>\n<p>Currently there's only nine games and one boss. In the final version of this game there will be many, many more games, as well as different modes to try.<br/></p>\n<p>My personal best: 73.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T07:43:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dff/dffddfd12f51247cca5f3d1f8cd3e825.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tailfeather Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
