Each player starts at a different location and must compete with one another to race for the goal points at the end of each section of the course. During the race players who perform parkour actions over obstacles will earn points, and continuously chaining together parkour actions will trigger a combo which results in additional points. Once any one player has reached four goal points the race ends and the player with the most points wins.</p><p>Gamepad recommended.<br/></p>\n<p>Learn more about this and other games I made on my website:\u00a0https://davidkzhu.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa1/fa175bb2e6ea7936d64845bf68d006fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["davidkzhu"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
