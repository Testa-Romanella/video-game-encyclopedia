It's set in a childhood room full of memories for you to explore.</p>\n<p>For this game I experimented with the artstyle. I opted to go for 2D sketch -&gt; 3D model workflow, which ended up being cooler than I thought! As someone who doesn't do art as a main profession, this was my biggest challenge during these 3 days, and the one I'm most proud of.</p>\n<p>The game is heavily inspired by games like Life is Strange, and Marie's Room. Let me know what you think! Hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>Tip: try collecting all different memories ;)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T09:07:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3b/c3bcb68bcd8c18734a2a0ff0bd1db887.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Virtual Turtle Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
