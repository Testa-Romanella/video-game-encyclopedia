When the wave hits the planet, press the spacebar and listen to sound being added. But be careful, when another planet with a different color hits the wave, it loses music.\u00a0When the level is complete you can listen to the music you've just created.</p>\n<p>Made in 48 hours, during the Global Game Jam, Netherlands, Groningen. Locally it won for best art and a price for overall best game.</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>Art: Mimosa Lehtinen<br/>Audio: Bruce Woodward<br/>Design: Vasil Kichev<br/>Programming: Pieter Jagersma</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/625/625657779791552523890d4c2e2d0b13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["casualdutchman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
