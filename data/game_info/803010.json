It follows the story of a 13 year old girl on a quest to save her brother. Set in a Dystopian world where every year, the government selects a child every year to be sacrificed to a monster that lives deep within a cave to prevent it from causing destruction.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's my first fully made game and my first time making pixel art.\u00a0 The story and art is original however, I used YouTube to create the\u00a0code (occasionally adjusting it for my needs). I used code from: Brackeys, BlackThornProd, MikeRoeGames, Alexander Zotov and Jimmy Vegas.\u00a0I also used 2 font assets from 1001 Fonts.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T12:39:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2cf/2cff2a36e172b0fe849cf67200fa526c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ishaanj2008"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
