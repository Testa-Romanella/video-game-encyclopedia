He\u2019s a professional security guard who\u2019ll take on any job if the price is right, and he\u2019s been involved in any number of top secret operations with high stakes and large financial rewards.<br/><br/>During one particular job, however, Yori receives quite the shock. While protecting an important, high classified briefcase whose contents are a mystery, Yori is accosted by a thief \u2013 and this thief is no ordinary criminal.<br/><br/>This thief is, instead, a beautiful young woman. She has a curvy body, a pretty face, long, silky hair\u2026<br/><br/>And she\u2019s wearing a bunny suit?!<br/><br/>That\u2019s pretty crazy \u2013 but what\u2019s even crazier is her ability to stop bullets with her bare hands, her superhuman speed, and her augmented strength.<br/><br/>Just who is this bunny girl, and what does she want with this briefcase?<br/><br/>Yori is uncertain \u2013 but one thing is for sure. His life is about to be turned upside-down.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Satomi is the first bunny girl Yori meets during his misadventures, and she\u2019s by far the most powerful. Satomi is cocky and self-confident, but she has the abilities to back up her boasts, and she \u2013 like Yori \u2013 is a professional in her job.<br/><br/>Satomi is ruthless when she\u2019s on the job, and she\u2019s willing to go to whatever lengths required to succeed in her missions. Behind closed doors, however, she\u2019s a kind woman who takes good care of her allies.<br/><br/><br/>Riko is a cheerful, bubbly girl who might be something of an airhead. Instant noodles are her idea of fine dining, and she\u2019s easy to please with her happy-go-lucky attitude.<br/><br/>Despite her upbeat personality, however, Riko cares deeply for the plights of those who are downtrodden, and she\u2019s made it her life\u2019s mission to take down scummy businessmen who prey on the weak and the vulnerable.<br/><br/>\u2026Oh yes, and she\u2019s also a bunny girl who can mindjack people. That\u2019s also a thing.<br/><br/><br/>To Yuka, might makes right, and she\u2019s not afraid of using violence to solve her problems. Her parents were duped into forfeiting their home when she was a young child, and she\u2019s developed a dislike of fraudsters ever since. Afraid of being vulnerable, she\u2019s resolved to fight on the side of justice, no matter the cost.<br/><br/>Beneath her brash exterior, however, Yuka is surprisingly sweet-natured: something Yori soon comes to discover.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-28T03:13:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/add/addbd0927b378656a35928f60856e5aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 337, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Winged Cloud"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Winged Cloud"], "esrb_rating": null}
