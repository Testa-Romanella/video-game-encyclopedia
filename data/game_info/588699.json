Inside the pinata, is some candy... and another Pinata?!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your hand is displayed at the bottom of the screen. There is a mana count near the bottom left. Mana is gained over time. By clicking the Mana button, it toggles the Autoplay feature, which will randomly play cards when the mana is full. Playing cards will damage the Pinata, and the pinata will drop candy.\r\n</p>\n<p>The candy can be used to purchase cards from the shop! Generate a set of four cards and pick one that you get to add to your collection. Generating more powerful cards costs more, so get killing on those pinatas.\r\n</p>\n<p>Use your collection in order to build your deck.\u00a0 Decks must have 20-30 cards with a limit of 15 copier per card.</p>\n<p>HARD RESET: Hold Q and B then press P and then refresh the page.
