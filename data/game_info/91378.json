In fact, Lenin caters to all the\u00a0<strong>symptoms of depression</strong>. Worse, his mother does not understand why his son was born this way, and the whole village despises him and treats him cruelly. At school, he suffers bullying and can\u2019t concentrate on class.<br/></p>\n<p>Now, hopeless about life, certain situations seem to awaken in Lenin something that is not of everyone\u2019s reality, but only of his. Something he will discover to be the part of\u00a0<em>something else</em>.</p>\n<p>Besides, Lenin will find other\u00a0<strong>species of animals</strong>, which may help him to understand himself.</p>\n<p>However, things are getting dangerous and Lenin needs to take care with his actions (<em>your actions</em>).</p>\n<p>Traveling between normality and a\u00a0<em>strange place</em>, Lenin will have to face his inner fears and enemies \u2013 and often, the outer ones as well.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</strong><strong>Facebook\u00a0| Tumblr\u00a0| Twitter\u00a0| Website\u00a0| Discord Server</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Install instructions</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>-\u00a0</strong>Download the winrar file 'Lenin - The Lion (Demo V.0.1.9 or 0.2.0)' and save the folder 'Lenin - The Lion (Demo V.0.1.9 [or 0.2.0])'\u00a0 onto your computer.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>-\u00a0</strong>Inside the folder 'Lenin - The Lion (Demo V.0.1.9 [or 0.2.0])' there is application called 'Lenin - The Lion (Demo V.0.1.9 [or 0.2.0]).exe'.
