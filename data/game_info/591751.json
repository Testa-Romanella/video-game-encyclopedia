Anyway, here's some instructions to play the game!</p>\n<p>HOW TO RUN THE GAME</p>\n<p>This game is a real NES game! Therefore, it must either be run on a real NES/Famicom, or on an emulator.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, I have included MESEN, which is a pretty decent emulator :D</p>\n<p>Just drag and drop \"minemayhem.nes\" into the MESEN app and you should be ready to go!</p>\n<p>--- STORY ---</p>\n<p>Landslides suck. Especially when they happen while you're in a mine...</p>\n<p>Our top miners are stuck, and they need *YOUR* help to get out of the deep crystal mines!</p>\n<p>Also, I don't know how important that is, but apparently the landslides released some monsters from</p>\n<p>the depths of the Earth. Better get a blaster!</p>\n<p>--- CONTROLS ---</p>\n<p>D-Pad: Move your character</p>\n<p>A: Use your Jetpak</p>\n<p>B: Fire your Blaster</p>\n<p>START: Confirm choices</p>\n<p>SELECT: Not used</p>\n<p>--- TIPS ---</p>\n<p>Keep an eye on your Oxygen Gauge! Don't forget to grab some Oxygen Tanks along the way!</p>\n<p>Once you rescue all of the miners, get back to the top as fast as you can! Your remaining</p>\n<p>oxygen is worth plenty of points!</p>\n<p>You don't have to fight all of the enemies! Pick your battles strategically</p>\n<p>--- CREDITS ---</p>\n<p>This game was made entirely by Antoine Fantys</p>\n<p>Mine Mayhem is TM &amp; (C) FG Software, 2021.
