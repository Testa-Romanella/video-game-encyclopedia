Like Snood, it is non-violent, intellectually challenging, and non-confrontational. Snoodoku is based on Latin Squares, more recently developed into a game known as Number Place or Sudoku. Similar games are found in newspapers and puzzle books. Snoodoku takes the puzzle a step further, by: Using the Snood characters rather than boring old numbers; Providing a simple user interface that keeps track of your play for you without getting in the way; Providing a scoring system that rewards accuracy primarily and then rewards speed to make the game a bit more competitive; and Giving you easy-to-use tools to help you play. Snoodoku has 5 levels of play - Child, Easy, Medium, Hard and Evil.<br/><br/>Instead of posting a poor rating, please send bug reports to us at snoodoku-android@snood.com - we welcome your feedback!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:02:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/399/399a4cff34e4db1e8e396ea0e6e3cd21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Snood"], "genres": ["Family", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Snood"], "esrb_rating": null}
