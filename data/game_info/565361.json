(just don't delete your cookies!)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls are: WASD to move click to shoot R to restart.</p>\n<p>Enemy's have different AIs: Cowardly (Green square) stays behind, Tankie (Pink hexagon) Will move slowly towards the Tower while shooting, Hydra (Red rhombus) will split into three after being killed. Don't kill to many hydras too quickly or you will be flooded with enemy's!</p>\n<p>Please report any incidents of the game being to sluggish as this is a known bug and I need to know who has this to narrow it down. Also\u00a0I recommend\u00a0you\u00a0download rather then run in WebGL as for some reason it only works in Dev Mode on itch.io.\u00a0Apologies for all these bugs as I was late for the Jam and I don't have much time left to fix them. Doesn't mean its not fun! Sometimes I can't put it down while testing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T04:43:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89c/89cd5f50a3f4f1b516034f5cd9d522ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Goose and Honk"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
