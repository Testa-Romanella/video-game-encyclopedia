And it&#39;s downright evil. Most of the levels are designed to confuse you, and the solutions aren&#39;t always that easy to figure out.<br />\nMove around with the arrow keys and press Z to interact with stuff (There are in game instructions, but they might not be that easy to interpret). There are eight levels total, good luck beating them all!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2007-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-19T00:59:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/321/321a83ee74f2975bba493343498496ab.jpg", "website": "http://cactusquid.com/games/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Dennaton Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
