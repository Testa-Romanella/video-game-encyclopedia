Equipped with advanced technology but limited resources, they must build to survive.<br/><br/>Sigma Draconis is a colony building game which focuses on building and resource management.  It is designed to be quite challenging but also fun and relaxing to play.<h3>World</h3>The game features procedurally generated maps with vegetation that grows and spreads over time, free roaming wildlife, and resources for your geologists to reveal.<h3>Resources</h3>Primary resources in the game include organics, ore, stone, and coal.  Vegetation and exposed rocks can provide what you need to begin with, but later your geologists will need to find buried resources that you can mine.<h3>Food</h3>Nutrient mush can be easily manufactured but is detrimental to your colonists' happiness.  Some native plants have edible fruit which can be harvested by a botanist, but for a sustainable food supply you will need to grow your own crops.<h3>Power</h3>There are various ways to generate electricity in the game, and successful power management is vital.  The nights are long and very cold on this tidally locked world, and your colonists may die if fuel reserves are inadequate.<h3>Colonists</h3>Each colonist has one of three skills, all of which will be essential to the success of your colony.  Colonists also have individual perks which can effect them in different ways.  Various factors such as workload and diet can affect the happiness and productivity of your colonists, so these must be carefully managed.<h3>Objective</h3>In the current version of the game, the final objective is to build and launch a rocket.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T10:18:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab0/ab0c0c4dd2ca8b2b7e03c6b4b397b256.jpg", "website": "https://sigmadraconisgame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Draconis Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Draconis Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
