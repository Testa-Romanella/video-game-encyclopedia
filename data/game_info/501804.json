Honestly, I can't say for sure exactly how much time I've spent on this, but if it's over the limit it isn't by much.<br/></p>\n<p>It's made in #GDevelop, and comes in at just under 1mb.<br/></p>\n<p>The flowers and animals in this project come from https://wikimedia.org</p>\n<p>The police character was pieced together with https://charactercreator.org<br/></p>\n<p>You play as a handicapped person, or a cripple, depending on your level of political correctness. Using love and happiness, defeat Gender Roles and Police Brutality.</p>\n<p>The sky ahead is red and foreboding; the sky behind is a pretty soft blue color. Adversaries drop out of the sky in front of you, but in your wake it's nothing but flowers, kittens, puppy dogs, and rainbows.</p>\n<p>Use the up button to accelerate.
