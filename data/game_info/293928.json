It\u2019s not the roar, but the light that comes with it.\u00a0<br/>In that I briefly see strange shadows dancing around my bed, too fast to understand what they are.<br/>I\u2019m still not used to this house, maybe this is the reason my imagination makes those scary things.<br/>Tonight will come a storm. I hope nothing happens\u201d</p>\n\n\n<p>The Saving Light is an horror game telling the story of a little girl, lost at night in the house her family recently moved into. Something is not right than night: a growl coming from outside her bedroom scares her and other strange happenings makes her believe that there is someone\u2026 or something in the house.<br/>But what can she do, if the Shadows themselves are chasing her? Light can weaken them, but not defeat.<br/>Trapped in a nightmare where everything she knows is now twisted, like the novel \u201cThe Dark Fairy\u201d her mother used to read her.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-15T05:54:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/302/302a56b7dc92635fa82ba877eba1e147.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mystic Lantern"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
