It combines the hack-n-slash action of Sotidrokhima with the calculative strategy gameplay of The Finnish War. The story centers around the Finnish national epic Kalevala, and connects its events to modern day, as well as with characters from the Finnish War and Sotidrokhima.<br/>The game can however be enjoyed by anyone, even those new to the two preceding titles - or Finnish mythology.<br/>Finlandsaga is well self-aware of its odd premise, and takes it all the way. Blood will fly, gore will spurt, and a rocking soundtrack sends our heroes off on their epic quest to save Finland.<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>combined hack n' slash and RTS action<br/></li><li>blood and gore galore!<br/></li><li>rocking original soundtrack<br/></li><li>mow down hundreds of enemies with effective special moves</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-16T04:27:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdd/bdd25c3e2b6cdb3020c59452787adf69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AcroGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["AcroGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
