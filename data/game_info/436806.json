You\u2019ve been selected to Beta-Test a new game, created by a new game developer here at Florida Poly! What is Beta-Testing? I\u2019m glad you asked! Beta-Testing is an important step in any game\u2019s development, where the potential players play the game to make sure the game is both functional, and fun to play.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>How to Play:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Look at the level provided for you to solve and determine what actions the character needs to take to get to the goal.</strong> In this step, you are creating \u201cPseudocode\u201d. Pseudocode is what programmers create before writing the actual code, to ensure they understand what needs to be done.\r\n  </li><li><strong>Assort the provided functions into the order necessary to complete the level.</strong> REMEMBER: Code reads DOWN FIRST. Here, you are using a custom block-based coding language called \u201cPoly Blocks\u201d to write the code that will determine what actions your character will take.\r\n  </li><li><strong>Hit the \u201cRun Simulation\u201d button and test your code.</strong> Now after you\u2019ve spent the time to write your program, you get to run the simulation and see if you accomplished your goal. You should watch this step carefully, taking note of where any problems may arise.\r\n  </li><li><strong>If the simulation fails, repeat steps 1 to 3.</strong> If and when the simulation fails, don\u2019t be discouraged! Failure is a huge part of coding and the creative process involved. All it means is that you made a mistake somewhere, and have to re-work your solution.\r\n  </li><li><strong>If the simulation succeeds, congratulations!</strong> You\u2019ve successfully written a code to navigate the level, and must now begin the process again for the next level.\r\n  </li><li><strong>While you are running your simulations, look for any parts of the game that could use improving, or that just don\u2019t work</strong>. This is the step that was mentioned earlier called \u201cBeta Testing\u201d. If you find anything, be sure to let one of the creators know!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-27T04:25:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ff/5ff5c3cb1674145db7fca1e130194cb4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["keeganjohn"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
