The gravity is quite low, as a consequence, the gameplay is rather floaty. The player is purchassed by a backhoe, so he tries to escape across the city. He needs to avoid obstacles as well as collecting \"followers\". Each time a follower is gained, he stands up next to the player. Therefore, the whole hitbox increases. This characteristic is the main focus of the game.</p>\n<p>The funny part of the project is that; of all the things I made, only the most important one left: The followers don't follow you. Yes, this game is a lie. It would be add at the same time than the 1.0.0 version.  Also, sorry for the current bugs ;)<br/></p>\n<p>Neverless, I'm eager to continue this project in order to improve it in all ways. I hope you also look forward to see what this potentially could turn into in the future. <br/></p>\n<p>Have a great day :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-16T03:05:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3e/c3e6855395b092b4c833e9f423cec145.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Club Programmation"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
