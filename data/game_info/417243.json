{"id": 417243, "slug": "smooth-submarine", "name": "Smooth Submarine", "name_original": "Smooth Submarine", "description": "<p>Smooth Submarine is a naval warfare simulation which has some arcade style as well.\u00a0Tactical view is combined with the strategic view.</p>\n<p>Your enemy is a fleet of frigates and destroyers. Destroyers have cannons, depth charges and active sonars. Frigates have cannons and passive sonars.</p>\n<p>An active sonar: Can detect you by sending a sound pulse and listening to its reflection.</p>\n<p>A passive sonar: Can detect you by listening to your noise.<br/></p>\n<p>Your purpose is to gain as much points as possible\u00a0by sinking or at least harming ships. Frigates try to follow a straight line as a convoy\u00a0and destroyers attack you to protect the frigates.\u00a0Frigates bring twice as much points as destroyers.</p>\n<p>The game displays an orange range to indicate how far your enemy can detect you with their active sonars. Also\u00a0a red range\u00a0is displayed to indicate\u00a0how far your enemy can detect you either by sight or passive sonars.</p>\n<p>Your submarine has torpedoes, cannons,\u00a0active sonars\u00a0and passive sonars. Your periscope and\u00a0sonars will detect targets either as visual ships\u00a0or as symbolic white circles depending on the accuracy of detection. Properly using the orange and red ranges while adjusting\u00a0depth and speed, you can get close to your enemy without being noticed and sink a full fleet.</p>\n<p>There are many tactical motives you will be able to discover. Just\u00a0press H or click the Help button and the game will display detailed help.</p>\n<p>Here you can play a single mission. But if you want to play campaigns and submit your scores, you can visit the game's home page:</p>\n<p>Smooth Submarine - Home Page</p>\n<p>(The game is\u00a0hosted on a\u00a0free service\u00a0so it may popup other windows.
