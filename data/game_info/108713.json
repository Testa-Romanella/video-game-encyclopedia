Made for SteamVR / HTC Vive.</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>If you don't have VR: </strong>Although this game is meant for VR (SteamVR), you can still play it with keyboard and mouse, but clumsily. On the title screen, just hold the spacebar or left mouse button for 3 seconds to advance. This game has only been tested with HTC Vive. Just keep in mind that the game is designed for VR camera/controllers with natural six degrees of freedom, and the keyboard/mouse controls are a very poor substitute for it - so please do not judge the game by the clunky keyboard/mouse controls.<br/></em></p>\n<p>I made this game in 48 hours for Pastel Jam, where the challenge was to make a pastel-colored game. I only had time to make two levels so far. More to come if there is interest.
