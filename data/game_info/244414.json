But beware of shadows because they will slow you down since less energy is provided in the dark! Also firing your laser beam reduces your energy available for acceleration!<br/></p>\n<p>You can either download\u00a0the Unity 2018 source code or the build for win64. When downloading the unity source,\u00a0you may want to start the RiverRace scene which contains the main demo level, the other scenes were used for\u00a0development purposes.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>Developers: Christopher, Dimitri, Alex,\u00a0Loris, Patrick, Laura\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a49/a4904dc8e1000f29918b5f5e4f709cdb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["desty012"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
