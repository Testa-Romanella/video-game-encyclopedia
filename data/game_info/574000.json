Commissioned by NEW INC, Rhizome and Nokia Bell Labs, <em>Networked Ecosystem</em> takes machine vision and sensing data collected by Bell Lab\u2019s experimental robots and sensors and repurposes it to drive a 3D environmental simulation.</p>\n<p>In <em>Networked Ecosystem</em>, natural phenomena have been replaced by digital and artificial systems as forces that drive development: Electricity/battery = sustenance, WIFI signals = nutrition, Lidar data = fire/heat. Data Organisms populate this digital ecosystem as native life forms in the form of bots, AI\u2019s, and avatars. Visitors to this networked landscape develop new kinds of digital senses to experience data as environmental changes, and interact with the simulated world and each other in an ever-changing online environment.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T07:28:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/300/300602a1448583c5a5cde9ade8d0d91a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 241, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["networked_ecosystem"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
