In Splitzball, you can split your player in two, and recombine them at-will.</p>\n<p>You have access to the following abilities:</p>\n<p>Charge - When combined, you will charge until you let go of the button. You will be unable to change direction while charging. If you collide with a player that is holding the ball, it will be knocked from their hands.</p>\n<p>Dash - Gain a speed boost when split while you hold the button down.</p>\n<p>Split - When you split, the split players will move in the direction of your thumb sticks. If you are holding the ball, it will be thrown at the average angle of the split player angles.</p>\n<p>Combine - When split, holding down the combine button will drag the split players together.</p>\n\n<p><strong>(Now works with the keyboard, but it's brutally difficult. A controller is highly recommended.)</strong></p>\n<p>Controller Controls</p>\n<p>Left Stick - Move Combined Player / Move Left Split Player</p>\n<p>Right Stick - Move Right Split Player</p>\n<p>Left Bumper - Split Player</p>\n<p>Right Bumper - Combine Players<br/></p>\n<p>Left Trigger - Charge (Combined) / Left Player Dash (Split)</p>\n<p>Right Trigger - Right Player Dash (Split)</p>\n<p>A - Select (Menu)</p>\n<p>Start - Start (Menu)</p>\n<p>Left Stick / D-Pad - Move (Menu) /\u00a0Switch Team (Lobby)</p>\n\n<p>Keyboard Controls</p>\n<p>WASD - Move Combined Player / Move Left Split Player</p>\n<p>IJKL - Move Right Split Player</p>\n<p>Space - Split Player</p>\n<p>Space - Combine Players\r\n</p>\n<p>Left Shift - Charge (Combined) / Left Player Dash (Split)</p>\n<p>Period - Right Player Dash (Split)</p>\n<p>Space - Select (Menu)</p>\n<p>Enter - Start (Menu)</p>\n<p>WASD / Arrows - Move\u00a0(Menu) / Switch Team (Lobby)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/591/59118d1cd41f35cab0e0cd724b5f2e12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Syldarion"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
