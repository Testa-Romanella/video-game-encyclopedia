You must survive by raiding their camps around the map for food and supplies.\u00a0</em><br/></p><p><strong>ASSETS USED (NOT MINE):</strong></p><p>STP Survival Template Pro, Emerald AI 3.0, Ultimate SFX</p><p><strong>Significant changes:</strong></p><p>- Weapons/Tools:\u00a0Pocket Knife, Tactical Spear, Range Tomahawk, IFAK Medkit</p><p>- Camp Art: Blue tarp standing tent, green lean-to, tan fabric tent, wood burner stove</p><p>- Container Props: Red, olive, and white metal barrels, wooden crate, burlap sac, tall and wide cardboard boxes</p><p>- Food Stuffs:\u00a0Baked Beans, Tomato Soup, Chicken Noodle Soup, Pork Chunks, Beef Stew, Tuna, Sardines, Orange Soda, Cola, Fizzy Soda, Aquari Water, Glacial Water, Red Boar Energy Drink, Quadshot Coffee</p><p>- Enemy:\u00a0Pink slipper maniac with a machete. Basemesh by MBLab for Blender, clothing, rigging, texturing, and animating done by me.</p><p>- Level/World Design: Expanded the forest map into a much larger map as well as placing trees, carving paths, placing grass, and creating the camps.</p><p><em>All 3D art made using high-low poly workflow in Blender with texturing made by me in Substance. </em>2D food labels made by me, based on real brands but no source material used from them. Nutrition label and can tab images\u00a0sourced from an open-source png. Weapon/Tool models were made as a personal\u00a03D art exercise at an earlier date, but never used as work for another class or project.\u00a0<br/></p><p><strong>Insignificant changes:</strong></p><p>- Integration of STP with Emerald AI 3.0</p><p>- Replacement of SFX where needed</p><p><em>-\u00a0</em>Minor tweaking of Main Menu to remove unwanted features<br/></p><p>- Rebalancing the design of the loot system</p><p><strong>Bugs:</strong></p><p>- AI movement is extremely rugged, sometimes idle posing instead of walking, or vise versa. Player detection is very inconsistent. Enemies can be killed by the player, but do not do damage to the player for an unknown reason. Documentation was limited and followed as much as possible, but a solution to this bug or a source has not been identified.</p><p>- Sometimes wooden crates have an obscene amount of wooden arrows in them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T16:49:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ba/3ba21be08e3f2e91457180ca4f93b951.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["susgamedev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
