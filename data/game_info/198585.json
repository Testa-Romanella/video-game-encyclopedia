I listed that as Windows only, but in reality it should work for any OS as long as you can use Game Maker on it... I don't think I used any Windows specific functions.</p><p>Of course it's all free to download but, eh *cough* feel free to toss a little tip my way if you liked it! ;0</p><p>Happy 15th Anniversary, Ludum Dare!
