Developed by the team Standard Grayt, thank you for playing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Topic: Lost &amp; Found</p>\n<p>You're here, with endless ocean spreads around you, and a boat, or a submarine, somewhere nearby. Feel free to move towards it, but beware, things change, maybe not every time, when you move under the sunlight, and you are really lost.\u00a0<br/>Find your location based on the changing water and get to your exit.\u00a0Good luck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>How to play :\u00a0</p>\n<p>1. The game will not show the player's avatar, you need to figure out the current position based on your logic and memory.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. The map is an endless loop, nothing stops you from moving around.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3.\u00a0Each tile may change between two states:\u00a0\u00a0the brighter one\u00a0and the dark one. The exit is marked with a vehicle token.\u00a0</p>\n<p>4.\u00a0Moving onto a bright tile activates a specific tile combination on other tiles, but moving onto a dark one won't.\u00a0</p>\n<p>5. When you get the feeling that you're on the exit tile, try getting on the boat and see if you're correct.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T05:09:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c5/7c5d197f27dad949c6ed4b84e03cbc17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Rosaita W", "zym625", "SnowTV \u96ea\u82b1\u724c\u7535\u89c6\u673a"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
