I created it and spent about 24 hours working on it during the\u00a0utGDDC Fall Reading Week Jam 2017. A month later, I worked for about 14 more hours on it (yes, I timed myself) over a period of 12 days, for a total of 38 hours of development time. Both the 24-hour and 38-hour versions are available for download here. The 24-hour version has been modified slightly to use the finished version of Cell2D 1.5.0, rather than the in-development version that it was created with, but the aesthetics and gameplay (including the glitches) are unchanged.</p>\n<p>Echo's sound effects were generated with\u00a0ChipTone, and its music was composed by Shaun Bellamy.</p>\n<p>Both versions of Echo were updated on 2018-01-02 to include README files and the appropriate licenses.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd4/cd46d268b243a42469ffe9baa29aa3ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["AndrewHeyman"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
