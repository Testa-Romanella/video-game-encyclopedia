It took me only 1 day to make it, it wasn't a hard experience. I just had to play with coding a little bit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Poustris is not my first game! I have a lot of games that I made but didn't share with yall! I am practicing for years now not for Poustris, but for Unity Development.</p>\n<p>I have started working on a horror game project \"SATANAS\", my biggest project ever. It will take a couple of years to make it... I'll do my best! Follow me on itch.io or @BrawlerakiYT on Twitter for more</p>\n<p>This game isn't the best game I ever made, it is just a practice game for everyone.</p>\n<em>THIS GAME IS GREEK!</em>\n<p>Just a reminder that this game contains Greek Words! A fact is that: On the right top corner when playing the game, is the QUIT BUTTON to exit the game without pressing ESC or ALT + F4! But, you choose how to quit!</p>\n<p><strong><em>ENJOY MY FIRST TETRIS FAN-MADE GAME!</em></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T04:03:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/083/0830ef527dfc6c528b1458ef233c117c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brawleraki"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
