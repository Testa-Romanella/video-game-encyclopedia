Harvest the trees for wood to build and upgrade your cabins or use the wood to mine rock which will enable you to upgrade your cabins even further thus producing more saplings!</p>\n<p>Grow your trees, grow your village, tame the wilds, so far my best effort is a city of 132 houses!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>W, S, A, D \u2013 Move Camera\r\nMouse wheel \u2013 zoom in / out\r\nESC \u2013 Quit game (no warning, it just quits!!)</p>\n<p>Your tools are located in the top left hand corner.
