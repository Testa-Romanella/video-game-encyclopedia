Even physics and collision had to be done by ourselfs.</p>\n<p><strong>Game Synopsis:</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cAfter years of war, the evil shadow creatures managed to overthrow the peaceful slime kingdom. What\u2019s left is a single blue slime, determined to find his lost slime friends and restore the slime kingdom before the shadow kingdom captures each and every one of them.\r\n</p>\n<p>A lighthearted side scroll puzzle game with aspects of modern jump and runs sends the player into a mysterious world full of adventures. Help the blue slime find the hidden keys along the maps, solve the puzzles and save his friends!\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Story:</strong></p>\n<p>The story revolves around the little blue slime that lost all of his family and friends during the war against the shadow kingdom. Some off his friends are still kept captive in cages around the world. With this heavy burden on his shoulders he started to travel the world and set all his friends free!</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong></p>\n<p>It's a multidimensional scroller (left, right, up, down) with obstacles to stop the players achieving their goal. The player has to find a key, which is unfortunately locked away. The only way to get to the key is by finding a switch. After collecting the key the player has to reach the cage somewhere in this level and finish the game. Players can lose too by hitting the spikes under the obstacles, which causes the slime to plop and the game ends.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusio:</strong></p>\n<p>It's really just a little game with a single level and I won't expand on it. Still I wanted to share it with you peeps :)</p>\n<p>So have fun &amp;&amp; good luck on mastering the elevation mechanic! It's hard but freaking rewarding as soon as you get it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T16:35:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/469/4695c360f8934baff8502aaa25a46dda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dekisenpaitm || PixelArt || Gamedev"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
