{"id": 306110, "slug": "worlds-at-war-monitors", "name": "WORLDS at WAR (Monitors)", "name_original": "WORLDS at WAR (Monitors)", "description": "A horde-mode flying-game striking a balance between near-simulation flight-physics and arcade control-simplicity, with some up-and-close action when you want a quick fix of combat flying and are bored with locking on dots on the horizon. The missions are short for a burst of fun. There is no story-line, simply different scenarios and objectives. If you enjoy a bit more advanced flying, but hate reading long manuals to get off the ground, this game is for you! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nNOTE: There are 2 versions of the game: one that supports both VR and monitors, and a cheaper version that only supports monitors. With either version, if you have an ultrawide monitor you will appreciate the fact that this game, unlike most all other games on the market, is not distorted on your monitor!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ed/8ed51792a020219b72896febb778340b.jpg", "website": "http://www.muddypixel.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 269, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Muddy Pixel"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Muddy Pixel"], "esrb_rating": null}
