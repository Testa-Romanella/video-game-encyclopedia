The player must race against five NPCs, but there is a twist to the race. Instead of racing to the finish line, the racers must hurry and catch portals. The game will start with six racers and five portals. Each round portals are lost. Using the portal will send the racers back to the starting line. The racers that don\u2019t get into portals are eliminated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-08T04:26:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e0/7e0c1fefeaa0819867bf67443add342a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Laurender"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
