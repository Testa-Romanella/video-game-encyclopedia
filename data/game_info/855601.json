(Mom comes back home) Why don't you try to find it out?</p>\n\r\nHere are 3 little endings. There are 11 more to discover!\r\n\r\nFirst 3D Game:\r\n<p>This was my first attempt to make a 3D game. So as you can see I use a lot of free assets, amateur lighting. I tried my best tho. The game was a bit large since I don't know how to optimize the performance within the 14 days. It was quite challenging since I was quite busy doing other stuff so the actual working hours on this game is less than 12 (including watching tutorials). So, thanks for playing, thanks for the support. And I am Racso, from Hong Kong 2022/ 9/23.</p>\n<ol><li>Make a sandwich</li><li>Drink milk</li><li>Throw books</li><li>Vomit on sofa</li><li>Watch Dragon Ball Z</li><li>Make some more sandwich</li><li>Drink more milk</li><li>Basically you don't have rules.
