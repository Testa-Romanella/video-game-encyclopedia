You are in control of a retro-fitted scouting vehicle which has been modified in order to combat this unexpected threat. Your only effective source of light this far from the sun is the camera drone that hovers far above your tank, automatically following it around.<br/>The mazes are mostly composed of pipelines that are invulnerable to your makeshift weapon.<br/>The open ends of these pipelines are the mazes' weak points, and the 'core' at the heart of each maze is also vulnerable, if you can reach it. Clearing an area will buy you some time to upgrade your icetank using salvage from the destroyed mazes before moving on to the next area. Expect to meet ever increasing resistance as your unknown enemy will also have time to fortify their positions. Who knows what tricks they may have up their pipes?The default controls \"out of the box\" are: WSAD keys for moving; mouse or arrow keys for aiming; and left click, spacebar, or left control key to shoot. The default setup also supports moving and shooting using a joystick (or the left stick of a standard gamepad). Pre-built control configurations (\"presets\") for twin-stick play using a gamepad/controller are provided for XBox 360 and PlayStation 4 compatible controllers. All controls can be further customised as required.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:51:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3a/d3ad10f92ef1c7f084480ef9f8acb237.jpg", "website": "http://www.yargybot.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 193, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yargybot"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Yargybot"], "esrb_rating": null}
