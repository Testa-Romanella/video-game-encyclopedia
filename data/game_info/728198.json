But Fate has already spon\u00a0a new thread of fate.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unaware through\u00a0your long sleep, the right to call the cave your solely home has been forfeited. Because\u00a0Spider's have claimed it as their nesting Lair. To take a single hit corresponds for\u00a0you, as a slime, the weakest species with immidiate death. Seek advantage in places to hide and then sneek by them unnoticed and find the way out of the cave. Keep going, even if the path becomes difficult.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This Adventure will require braveness, but not just of any sort.\u00a0<br/>Successful will only be those, who's Soul is filled with:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Slimy Courage!</p>\n\n<p>Observe you environment throughly and maybe you will be lucky in finding the secret in each Level (Not in the Tutorial). And as to what they are, I can offer a slight hint:</p>\n<p>One you might\u00a0like to visit but in the near future.</p>\n<p>One will help you just once in overcoming an awaiting danger.</p>\n<p>And one I recommend to help out after your escape from here, in his own little adventure where up and down may or may not be reversed.</p>\n<p>That is all. I hope you have fun with this short game!</p>\n\n<p>For now the Game is only available for Windows PC's (Mac and Linux Support are soon to come), but has full Controller Support.<br/>To play just download the file, unpack it and start the\u00a0 .exe!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T07:15:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6cc/6cca1a4a3b2cdf37cc86af6449099a6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NanoArk."], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
