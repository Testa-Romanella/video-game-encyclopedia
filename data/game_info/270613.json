They will save your life.</p>\n<p>- Characters do not have expressions yet. This will be worked on.</p>\n<p>- Combat balance may be\u00a0 somewhat off. Especially on harder modes.\u00a0Feedback on this will be accepted gratefully.</p>\n<p>- Getting to Rank 5 will make your life a touch easier for both bosses present in the demo.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/731/7314e32925f6bde378959d31f57da960.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 229, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MirageV"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
