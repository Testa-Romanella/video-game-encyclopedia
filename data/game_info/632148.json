Dying or winning then fades out into the lose/win screen. The game world is introduced via the start screen as it shows a snapshot of the map with the enemies you will face patrolling.</li><li>UI: Menus use a consistence coloring theme and will fade in and out</li><li>Animations: Every action has an animation from moving to shooting and reloading. Enemies will also \"jolt\" when they take damage</li><li>The game has a consistent look. All materials go together and nothing really looks out of place.</li><li>Immersive environments: Everything is lit pretty well. Most actions have sounds attached to them such as when reloading there is sound for taking the clip out, putting it back in, and then pulling the charging handle. Models are all good quality and all fit together. Animations make sense are and transition into each other in a smooth manner.</li></ul><p>Fun or enjoyment:</p><ul><li>Theme:\u00a0My theme was infected, thus I made a zombie game centered around the zombies being the \"infected\".</li><li>5 Why's: Why are there zombies? There was an outbreak that caused many people to turn. Why gun pickups? You need weapons to fight zombies. Why on a bridge? You need to make your way across to escape into the countryside. Why a hud with health and ammo? You need a way to keep track of the damage you have taken as well as the remaining ammo you have. Why end inside a gated area? You made it to a safe zone.</li><li>Thoughtful: The game makes players feel a sense of nostalgia because it makes use of many things that were found in left for dead 2.</li><li>Replayable: The game has some reliability because until you learn the system it can be easy to be overwhelmed by the zombies.\u00a0</li><li>Recommendation: A player would recommend it to a friend because its a fun little game that fits in a horde shooter esc genre. The screenshots also are action packing showing off being attacked by the horde.</li></ul><p>Posted to Itch.io</p><ul><li>Itch.io page has 3 screenshots</li><li>There is a trailer video thats roughly 30 seconds long with no text in the first 5-10 seconds.</li><li>Itch.io page is themed with background colors and a banner</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T03:53:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d41/d41a5974326c2173801242cc51854bd0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Milarhol"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
