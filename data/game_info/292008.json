That was the start to start expanding the concept, until we finally decided to set the game in an underground dwarven city overrun by a goblin armada. The player controls the main character and the hero of the story, TechnoDwarvin, an epic dwarvish hero featuring an epic weapon, a steampunk chainsaw that he uses to gore away anyone blocking his way. Out of mead and homesick, the hero makes it back at home, to find his beloved city overrun by the pesky goblins and his father, the King Dwarximus Maximus being hostage of the Goblin Warlord, the evil throne usurper that invaded the peaceful dwarven city.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21a/21acecaf1a3c79d890aed89159bce3d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Motoko", "Akaired", "CptBlackPixel"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
