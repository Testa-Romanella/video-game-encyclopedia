Unfortunately,\u00a0 acid spills have rendered the factory dangerous and created aggressive mutants\u00a0\u00a0both inside and out.</p>\n<p>In level 1, you must get the game token to shut gain entrance into the core of the factory to disable the spill. You'll start outside and have to obtain the blue key to enter the factory wall (on the right). Once inside, obtain the red key to access the game token.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In level 2, we experiment\u00a0with procedurally generated content (PGC).
