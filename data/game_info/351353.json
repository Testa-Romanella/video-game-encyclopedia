Watch out for pesky locks that spawn periodically and impede your progress! The game is over when you can't place any more shapes.<br/><br/>This game is very easy to pick up and play with simple, intuitive mechanics that can be learned in 5 minutes... but deep enough to provide a challenge for those looking to master every level.<br/><br/>Planaris 2+ has the following key features:<br/><ul><li>3 Classic game modes: Normal, Multiplier, and Survival</li><li>A \"campaign\" mode with a non-linear progression of over 50 levels with different shapes, sizes, and rules.</li><li>3 Different powerups to earn: Bombs, Line-Bombs, and lock-clearing Keys</li></ul><br/>Planaris 2+ has several advantages over Planaris 2:<br/><ul><li>Steam leaderboards</li><li>Steam cloud saving</li><li>All new levels available in campaign mode</li><li>Better visual fidelity, fullscreen and 4k support.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/173/173d97be961bcbfcd21f77153d04e34e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bryce Summer"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bryce Summer"], "esrb_rating": null}
