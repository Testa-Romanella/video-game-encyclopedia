Rain destruction upon their foul legions by <br />\n      ordering your troops effectively and overpowering your enemies with new <br />\n      Super Commanding Officer Powers. Then, see how your tactics stack up to <br />\n      your friends\u2019 in 4-player battles\u2014all with one Wii U\u2122.</p>\n<pre><code>  Take control of more units and battle on more maps than even the   \n  original Advance Wars had to offer. More terrain means more options, and   \n  more options means crazier creations. So employ every feature of the   \n  robust map designer to craft punishing maps, and then challenge the CPU   \n  or your friends on the battlefield. After a few battles, take your   \n  hard-earned points to the Battlemaps shop to purchase new maps,   \n  challenges, and Commanding Officers.  \nThis classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance. We hope you&amp;#39;ll enjoy the new features (including off-TV play) that have been added to this title.
