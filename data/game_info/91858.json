Be careful what responses you pick...<strong>or else!</strong></p>\n<p>-Hours of gameplay!\u00a0</p>\n<p>-A bonus once you finish all the routes...</p>\n<p>Passion High 2.0 is now released! There's much more content jam-packed into this release, although due note that 2.0 is still not the final version, so none of the routes are complete. However, in their current state, they should give you a good idea on where the game is headed as we march closer and closer toward completion.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note that in its current state (2.0), Passion High uses a lot of third-party resources such as sprites, backgrounds, music, etc.</strong>\u00a0<strong>This build is more of a proof-of-concept than anything, so please keep that in mind.\u00a0\u00a0Team Requiem DOES\u00a0NOT take credit for anything right now other than the script and characters.</strong></p>\n<p>We have an artist working on custom sprites and are currently in the midst of finding new members for our team to work on background art and music. All pre-used assets have been credited, so please check out the ReadMe for more details.</p>\n<p>Also note that as this is an unfinished game, there may be bugs, glitches, typos, etc. Please make sure to report them as soon as possible, especially if they're game breaking. There is only person working on the script at the moment, so mistakes can happen.</p>\n<p>The game is free, and we have no plans to ever make it otherwise,\u00a0but any donations are greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p><strong>CURRENT PROGRESS</strong></p>\n<p>Script Writing: 50%\u00a0<br/>Sprites: 20%<br/>Background Art: 0%<br/>CG Art: 0%<br/>GUI: 80%<br/>Logo: 100%<br/>Programming: 75%<br/>Music and Composition: 0%</p>\n<p><strong>KICKSTARTER COMING SOON!
