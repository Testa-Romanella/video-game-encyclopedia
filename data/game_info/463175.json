This was a college project made in 2014. It is finally finished and fully playable. The objective is to diffuse six bombs in a nuclear facility while stabilizing a nuclear reactor. There will be many obstacles along the way. Do not run out of time and find the fastest way possible!<br/><br/>The game was made with unity 3.5x.\u00a0It is fully 3D and has a three floor stage.<br/>I really hope you guys give it a chance and enjoy it. Hopefully all bugs are settled. We want to make it a hard yet fun experience. If you manage to master the game, you can probably complete it in 15 minutes or less but it will take some practice. So be warned my dear scientist. You are in for a race against time.<br/><br/>There are four mini games within the game.<br/>1.\u00a0Door unlock game like guitar hero<br/>2.Wrench deposit game, Tap space really fast<br/>3.Extinguish fires, like Galaga<br/>4.Bomb Difuse, Maze Game</p>\n<p>I would love any feedback you can provide. If you love it, I would love to know. If you hate it, I am sorry and please tell me why. I just want to make fun games and need your help. After all these are for you.</p>\n<p>Thank you,<br/></p>\n<p>Your friend Gabestronaut.<br/></p>\n<p>Please feel free to check out and reach out @<br/>www.Gabestronaut.com<br/></p>\n<p>www.Facebook.com/Gabestronaut<br/></p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvCrxff-HyHGQNZr8RqQpUg?<br/></p>\n<p>(I need 100 subs to name it.
