Become a master archer, collect the best equipment and win!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFEATURES:<br/>\r\nArchery Club lets you pick your favorite bow and play in exciting, multi-part matches! During each one of them you\u2019ll play at least two out of three possible game modes:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nShortbow - a quick, 30-second long round where your reflexes and fast aiming skills will be put to the test.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLongbow - a longer round with 3 shots for each of the players. The distance to the target will increase after each shot, so you\u2019ll have to be mindful of gravity and wind!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCompound bow - a more strategic round, where you\u2019ll have to decide which targets to shoot. Those that guarantee better score may be way harder to hit, so decide carefully!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach match is played as a Best Of 3 with those game types selected in random order. You\u2019ll have to master all of them if you want to keep winning and climbing up in the ranks!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T02:58:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6cc/6ccbb07b4586f839241dd0c47bc08104.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 243, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["BoomBit"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": ["BoomBit"], "esrb_rating": null}
