It combines teleportation with beat-em-up combat. I\u2019m hoping to get some attention on the gameplay, so that I can fund and develop a more polished, exciting pitch. Art is not my strong suit, but you need great art to spark interest,\u00a0even at this early stage.<br/></p>\n\n<p>A superhero origin story, set against the backdrop of the protests, riots, and pandemic of summer 2020. In the form of beat-em-up. With teleportation.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest thing is animation. I bought a great asset, and even chopped and twisted it to my needs, but one thing I can\u2019t find for the life of me are grapples. And I have a lot of grapples planned\u2026</p>\n\n<p>So you know how beat-em-ups typically have a slight wrestling influence? A German suplex, a jumping pile driver, the random boss fight in a wrestling ring? I plan on dialing that up well past 11, and combining it with the already fun and established teleportation mechanics. Air to air grapples, so you can catch an enemy off a wall bounce with a Diamond Cutter. Fundamental moves like the Irish whip, so you can whip the opponent across the screen, teleport, and meet them on the other side with a lariat. Running grapples, launch grapples, grapples that can be teleport canceled, solo-tag team moves, the list goes on.</p>\n\n<p>Help could be in almost any form:<br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Sharing </strong>- If you know someone that would like to play this, pass it on</li><li><strong>Connections </strong>- If you are interested in working on this, please contact me.
