This game shouldn't take long, depends on how you play it and how much time you put into it, if you want to donate since like I could put it on steam or something its very much appreciated! I doubt it though, its too bad to be steam worth.</p>\n<p>Modding should be capable if you use the source code, or possibly the UndertaleModTool. Don't reupload the game though, I will not allow that.</p>\n<p>Oh yeah!\u00a0Also try to play it WITHOUT an Autoclicker, if you play it without an Autoclicker and beat it, you did good!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T05:54:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/140/140e65f79126968bc7142b6902e257d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jay M."], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
