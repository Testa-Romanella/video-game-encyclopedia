The controls are WASD, or arrow keys.  damage is based on impact speed (impact speed is split with whoever is going faster taking less damage)  but hitting the wall means you take 100% of the impact.  which is really the main way to rack up more damage on them cause trying to win on balance of impact speed all the time is hard.  damage is tilted in favor of the player by about 20% to make it easier cause its HARD to win with it truly equal on both sides</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T03:36:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/777/777dbb410045f45274d22f699e21c263.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JWoodrell"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
