You need to get to the top of the level as fast as possible, using standard platformer movement but also a set of cards.<br/>Cards allows you to place different platforms in the world. Be careful, you don\u2019t have an unlimited amount of them in your deck! You can only place object on hooks or (relatively) near preexisting platforms. And, when the timer runs out, it isn\u2019t a game over but you won\u2019t draw cards anymore (although you can still use those  in your hand). If you can\u2019t reach the end because you ran out of cards, hit the reset button!<br/>Once you\u2019ve used a card, it won\u2019t come back, but discarded one will, eventually.<br/><br/></p>\r\nControls :\r\n<strong>Jump/Go up ladder</strong> : w, up arrow key<br/><strong>Go down ladder</strong> :\u00a0  s; down arrow key<br/><strong>Go left </strong>: a, left arrow key<br/><strong>Go right</strong> : d, right arrow key<br/><strong>Free view</strong> : hold ctrl or alt and move mouse<br/><strong>Activate card/place object </strong>: left mouse<br/><strong>Discard card/cancel placement </strong>: right mouse<br/><strong>View deck or discard pile </strong>:\u00a0  left mouse on it<br/><strong>Open menu </strong>: Tab", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2cb/2cb70846df56f88d0aefb025f8a65d65.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["0uicmoi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
