The only thing that surrounds you is the whiteness. You don't know who or what you are.<br/>\r\nAll you see is that when you walk you leave a trail in the white nothing. What does it mean? How do you get out of here? Is there anywhere for you to get out to?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFAQ : <br/>\r\n1. What is this game?<br/>\r\nThis is not a puzzle game. <br/>\r\nThis is more like a treasure hunt or ARG. This game hides and obfuscates as much as it possibly can. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nA puzzle game would give you mechanics and expect you to solve something. <br/>\r\nThis game lies to you and gives you nothing to go by. Once you figure out what you have to do, the rest of the game is trivial.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nA puzzle game is clever, fair and self-contained. <br/>\r\nThis is obtuse and dumb. Once you figure out the subject matter, you have to an internet search to solve the rest of the game. You cannot solve the game without knowledge of certain things which are not presented in the game itself.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere is an A-HA moment though but I don't expect everyone to decipher it. Once the secret is revealed, there won't be a point in playing this game. So stay away from spoilers in the comments, if you want to try this yourself.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:54:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a0/1a09277f009a42b1638456859795f118.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xavier Ekkel", "SKZA"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["SKZA"], "esrb_rating": null}
