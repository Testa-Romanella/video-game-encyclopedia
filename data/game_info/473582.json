This is similar to most city building games, however, Metropolis Manager also makes use of elements of Human Geography. For example, a Central Business District (CBD) will spawn for every ten commercial buildings and brings upgrades to the surrounding areas. These districts are actual elements of cities in real-life and often are a pull factor that brings more people to cities. In the game, this is represented with buildings being able to be built near the CBDs even if they are not next to roads. Residential and agricultural zones will also be upgraded due to the increased demand of living space near the CBDs.</p>\n<p>Features of the\u00a0Current Version (1.0):</p>\n<p>-Basic city building (zone placement, building construction, and taxes).</p>\n<p>-A happiness system.</p>\n<p>-Random terrain generation.</p>\n<p>-3 random events (financial crisis, protesters, and rioters)</p>\n\n<p>Projected Features in Upcoming Updates (Note: these updates are not guaranteed, but I will edit this page to inform viewers if there are any changes):</p>\n<p>-Additional actions by rioters and protesters.</p>\n<p>-Spelling corrections.</p>\n<p>-More sounds.</p>\n<p>-War as a random event.</p>\n<p>-Apocalypse game mode (This is in the far future, but I plan on adding it once the other updates are completed).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T02:48:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4c/a4cb457af5555cd9eee3b6106675bc30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LDGamingExpress"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
