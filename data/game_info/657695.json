I originally released this game in 1996.</p>\n<p>Outliner is an Asteroids-style action game for one or two players. It\u00a0was an evolution of Roton, Xenex, and similar rotary shooters, here distinguished by two player co-op and combat modes, and the hi-res wireframe look. My 18th Amiga game, it was one of my last Amiga games and one of the most technically sophisticated. I remade this game for PC in 2002.</p>\n<p>Supplied in ADF format for use with\u00a0Amiga emulators, and in RP9 format for use with Cloanto's Amiga Forever and other RetroPlatform\u00a0emulators.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T04:38:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54a/54aa6c25fa4004fe82c3114d5b1ad7b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mark Sheeky"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
