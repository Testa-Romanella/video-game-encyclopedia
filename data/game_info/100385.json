This essay is on not only showing the creative work of Jon's past that has gone forgotten, fallen down an internet memory hole, but on how his work all has ripples on itself, a continuing line of influence, be they obvious or subtle. Ranging from a fascination with sports itself, with the cosmic questions of the universe, or simply doing things that are only possible in the medium of the internet.</p>\n<p><em>Pay what you want - including nothing at all!
