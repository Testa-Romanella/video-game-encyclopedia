This is a strategy game as the levels quickly get progressively harder and more complicated, hence if you are stuck use the 'T' key to skip the level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are nine levels split up into 3 categories, basics, hard\u00a0/ adventure and the end where you complete an insanely hard level spilt up into three to make it easier. Completing levels are done by using the creature on one side to help the other creature to get to its objective on the other side and vice versa.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>- WASD or arrows</p>\n<p>- Space to jump</p>\n<p>- Right click to flip the board (move to the other creature / side)</p>\n<p>- Left click interacts with red or yellow blocks</p>\n<p>- R to reset a level</p>\n<p>- T to skip</p>\n\n<p>Good luck</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T10:19:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1b/d1b04cde3641243068539702a4126426.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FreddieJBH"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
