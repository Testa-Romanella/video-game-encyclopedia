Here, you can plant a handful of different plants, and then watch them all grow (or you can switch to a different tab and come back in a few minutes. I won't judge.).</p>\n<p>To start planting, press a key that corresponds with one of the empty pots. Then, all you need to do is hurry up and wait for your plants to grow. Once a plant has finished growing (you will see an exclamation mark(<strong>!</strong>) next to it), press the corresponding key again to harvest and sell it.</p>\n<p>Once you buy the trophy for 100 G, you'll win the game.</p>\n<p>NOTE: The game will pause if you switch away from this tab, and you will make no progress unless you switch back. If you're going to switch to a different tab,\u00a0I recommend playing this in a separate window.</p>\n<p>ADDITIONAL NOTE FOR MOBILE USERS: This game assumes that you're playing with a keyboard, but otherwise is fully playable on mobile.\u00a0If you tap the screen, you'll\u00a0bring up a virtual VIP 8 keypad, which is much different from a keyboard.
