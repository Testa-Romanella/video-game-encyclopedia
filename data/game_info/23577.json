With rapid moves and split-second decisions, use your tail and an array of offensive and defensive power-ups, such as the energy beam or the spiked shield, in order to turn your opponents into a rain of exploding particles.<br/><br/>The rounds are short, and the tempo constantly high throughout game. Once a round is finished, it takes but seconds to jump into a new game and get back to bashing your friends.<br/><br/>\u2018Easy to pick up - hard to master\u2019 has become a bit of a clich\u00e9, but nothing explains the core of Cosmic Kites better.
