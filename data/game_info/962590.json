It has gained recognition and popularity among numerous users, including some celebrity artists, as an essential game for their daily exercise and stress relief.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe three core elements of the Mutrix are music, sports, and immersive visuals. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n---------- Music ----------<br/>\r\nThe game features over 50 songs in various genres such as pop, rock, electronic, rap, and traditional Chinese music. Each song's chart is professionally crafted by musicians to match the movements and rhythm requirements of the sports coaches, aiming to provide players with a satisfying experience of moving to the beat of the music. Additionally, the game supports the import of third-party song charts, allowing players to enjoy their favorite songs in a simple way.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n---------- Sports ----------<br/>\r\nIn terms of sports, different difficulty levels and exercise intensities, including light, moderate, advanced, and professional, are designed by sports coaches to meet the diverse exercise needs of users. The Mutrix has also developed a calorie consumption calculation system that calculates the number of calories burned during each exercise session based on the user's movement trajectory and intensity. Extensive testing with various sports wearables has shown that the calculated values align closely with those displayed on the devices.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n---------- Visual ----------<br/>\r\nFor visual immersion, the game incorporates a level-based gameplay where each level represents a distinctive and well-known city, such as Xi'an, Hangzhou, Shanghai, and Ordos. The Mutrix team conducted on-site research and created songs and charts that align with the cultural and historical background of each level. Players can fully immerse themselves in a visual and auditory feast, for example, fans of the Jiu Bao Band must try the Ordos level, and fans of Hangzhou should not miss the song \"Battle of West Lake.\"<br/>\n<br/>\r\n=======================<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTo enhance the game's replayability, the Mutrix introduced the \"Extreme Challenge\" for high-level players, which consists of consecutive songs with increasing difficulty levels, testing who can persist until the end. The \"Theme Challenge Tournament\" provides a competitive stage for music enthusiasts to compete for rankings.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFinally, the team is developing a multiplayer social competitive mode, where players can create their own avatars, change outfits, and immerse themselves in outer space scenery with a view of nebulae through windows. They can chat, listen to music, and engage in exciting PK battles with other players on the same stage.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Mutrix team is committed to continuously updating the game with new activities, combining gameplay, sports, and fitness with fun and popular events, ensuring a balance between exercise and social interaction.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n---------- Contact ----------<br/>\r\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, or would like to meet other players, please add the following contact information:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDiscord: mutrix_7uvr#0890<br/>\r\nWeChat\uff1aYDWLYJH<br/>\r\nQQ group: 739527324", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-23T04:13:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5c/f5cdc7020d47bfba023137f0df807347.jpg", "website": "http://www.7uvr.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 293, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["7U.Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports", "Casual"], "publishers": ["7U.Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
