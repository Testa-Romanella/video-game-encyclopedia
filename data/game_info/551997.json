In Low Batteries you control a small robot will a small battery; you can run, jump, and shoot your way through the level but be careful cause shooting your gun lowers the amount of battery you have which in makes it harder to run and jump. So the less you use your ability the more you can run and jump. Anyway I hope you enjoy!!</p><p>*The Music, Sfx, and art were made by me*<br/></p>\n\n<p>Note: There is a glitch where you are unable to wall jump with W but I was unable re-export the project before the jam's deadline</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T12:12:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f8/8f8c719d36a410909c4fb9166743e428.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Streetlamp"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
