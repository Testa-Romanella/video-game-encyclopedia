Who is he and where does he belong?</p>\n<p>Hold up - what's that just popped through the letterbox? It's an invitation to a party! Also included is a map with \"Very Important\" written across the top. PI scratches his head feeling puzzled. Who sent it and which other guests will be there?</p>\n<p>Driven by curiosity and seeking answers to his questions, he embarks on a voyage through the forbidden land of MATHEMATICS, encountering odd numbers, sharp triangles, perfect circles, turtles, runners, Fibonacci rabbits, bits and bytes, scary agents and what's this? Naked guys in baths?!</p>\n<p>What is the probability of passing a vector field and being struck by a butterfly? And who is that guy, showing his tongue, spitting formulas?</p>\n<p>Only one thing for it... guide PI through this crazy minefield. At least he has a non periodic laser that may help in some way. All the time, PI's strength is depleting so don't forget to let him eat PIE often! </p>\n<p>Will PI have the PARTY of his life? His fate lies in your hands!</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T21:58:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9e/f9e03415711bfdd34a35a04e4702439f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZXAMAZE"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
