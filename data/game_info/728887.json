During your last mission there was an incident in which the <strong>control system was\u00a0</strong><strong>destroyed</strong>. The <strong>emergency control system</strong> was activated, which limits the agility of the ship. Consequently the only way to control the ship is <strong>one single button</strong> using the so called <strong>navigation indicators</strong>. Luckily the weapon system switch to <strong>auto mode</strong>, so you just need to take care of moving the ship carefully. <strong>How far will you come</strong>?</p>\n\n<p>At the bottom of the screen, you have the <strong>control bar</strong>. The activator is moving from left to right and back\u00a0all the time, highlighting so called <strong>navigation indicators</strong>. When you press the <strong>\"F\" key</strong> while an navigation indicator is highlighted, you move the ship to this position.</p>\n<p><strong>The same way you can select menu items.</strong></p>\n<p>The ship is firing <strong>automatically</strong>. Some enemies need <strong>multiple </strong>hits. You can take up to 5 hits, before the game ends. Destroying enemies and\u00a0moving from one position to another will increase your score.</p>\n\n\n<p>This game was developed as part of the One Button\u00a0Game Jam 2022.\r\n</p>\n<p>Furthermore it was developed almost entirely live on stream on my Twitch channel:\u00a0https://twitch.tv/vojay\r\n</p>\n<p>If you would like to know more about the development process I am happy to welcome you in my stream.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Asset Sources</strong></p>\n<p>https://grafxkid.itch.io/mini-pixel-pack-3<br/>https://gvituri.itch.io/space-shooter<br/>https://vectorpixelstar.itch.io/space<br/>https://free-game-assets.itch.io/space-shooter-game-ui-pixel-art</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T10:05:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14f/14f1c47a49b4f1f11fb81d2db7a69e96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["vojay"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
