You will find yourself on a series of ever more elaborate missions to destroy promising space targets. <br/><br/>Over the 54 levels the game features we are introduced to six different galaxies, and the challenges each hold. Tractor beams that ruin your missile trajectory, force fields that bounce everything strait back at you and even the ever shifting gravitation fields of the stars rotating around themselves will all work in consort to totally screw over that well planned shot!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/548/548222c07993f383106d0ee855ee1a35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DrunkAnimations"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
