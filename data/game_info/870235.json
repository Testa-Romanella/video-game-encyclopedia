Big, strong and skilled in combat, Baxter is something of a protector to your party. Despite having the ability to conduct and expel electricity from his body, he typically resorts to traditional fighting. He swore to keep you alive and safe until the very end and he's determined to keep his promise; even if it kills him.</p>\n<p><strong>Rae Calvert</strong> | 31 | F | Genetically Modified -\u00a0The Brains. Skilled with the ability to manipulate the elements, Rae is the only reason your party has managed to survive as long as it has. She's handy and resourceful, putting up with very little and always equipped with multiple backup plans. Like Baxter, she made a promise to keep you alive but be sure to treat her right... hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly Lightwood</strong> | 30 | F/M/NB | Android -\u00a0The Enemy. Ruthless and analytical, their only goal in life is to kill you and they will stop at nothing until they do so, even if it means taking down everyone close to you first. Do you have what it takes to give them a change of heart or will your mission end before it's even begun?</p>\n<p><strong>Blair Hadden</strong> | 27 | F | Human -\u00a0The Wildcard. Sweet and charming, there's nothing Blair could do that could make anyone hate her. She may not have been part of your group from the start but her innocence (and the fact that she's eight months pregnant) makes you want to protect her with your life and, considering what you need to do, it might just come down to that.</p>\n<p><strong>Alaric Vance</strong> | 29 | M | Genetically Modified -\u00a0The Leader. Cold, hard and aloof, Alaric is the leader of a group of rogues that cross your path. He doesn't take too kindly to strangers and equipped with the ability of death sensory, you and your party reek of trouble. He's a formidable fighter and once in your corner, will do everything within his ability to make sure your mission is a success. That is if you prove yourself worthy to him.</p>\n<p><strong>SugarCube Template\u00a0by\u00a0</strong><strong>Nyehilism</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T08:47:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ae/9ae12909a0e0bc5736b57ccfa19f10b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["whatchique"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
