Move through rounds by beating your previous score, and create more and more elaborate levels. May you get lucky, but never too much</p>\n<p>Made in 48 hours\u00a0for the GMTK 2022, with the theme <em>\"Roll of the Dice\"</em>.</p>\r\nRules\r\n<p>The rules of the game are explained along with it. But refer to this section if you need more detail.</p>\n<p>A game of _Pachinko Suites_ is divided into several round. The goal is to go as far as possible, to eventually get the largest score.</p>\n<p>In each round, you throw the number of dice you have in your hand, and let them bounce in the level. Each time a dice bumps against an element in the level, it score 1 point. Once all dices are stopped on the ground, we count their total points, and apply their effect depending on the top face. If the sum is equal or higher to the previous round score, you can continue to the next round!</p>\n<p>There are 4 special effects a dice can have:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>New item </strong>(blue circle): Place an item (either a platform or a bumper) in the level before the next round. You'll be able to bump against them to score points!</li><li><strong>New dice\u00a0</strong>(green square): Get an additional dice in your hand. More dices means more potential scoring and bonuses! But also more risks\u2026</li><li><strong>Bounce pad</strong> (pink triangle): The dice will change into a one-use bounce pad for the next rounds. When a dice lands on it, it score 1 points and is thrown in the air to score even more points.</li><li><strong>Discarded</strong> (red star): The dice is discarded and its value is 0. You don't want to land on that face!</li></ul>\n<p>Also note that dices can not stay forever in the air! If they get stuck or stand for too long above the ground, they'll get eliminated.</p>\r\nAssets<p>Game made with\u00a0<em>Godot</em>.
