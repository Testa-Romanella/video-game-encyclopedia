The theme was \"Death is Only the Beginning\", so naturally I did something with the undead.</p>\n<p>This is the first game jam I've participated in and it was a good experience. For the first couple days, I was trying to do something completely different and was frustrated that I\u00a0might not be able to complete it. After some thinking and re-scoping of the project, I was able to put this together in the time I\u00a0had left. I'm incredibly proud with what I was able to achieve and hope that other people enjoy their time with my game.</p>\n<p>Any comments, criticisms, or suggestions are greatly appreciated.
