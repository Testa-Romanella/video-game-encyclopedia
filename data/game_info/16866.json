Cast your vote today!<br/><br/><strong>Frequently Asked Questions:</strong><br/><br/>Q: Why are cats running for President?<br/><br/>A: Twenty years ago, America's political system became so corrupt that it almost destroyed the entire country. In order to prevent the nation's collapse, the Supreme Court was forced to ban all humans from politics. Cats were the natural replacement.<br/><br/>Q: Is it true that cats simplified the political process?<br/><br/>A: Yes! Instead of having a long, drawn-out nomination system, they only have primaries in three states: Meowa, New Clawshire, and South Catolina. In addition, the Democat and the Repawblican political parties have been eliminated and replaced by the Fancy Furballs and the Sharpclaws.<br/><br/>Q: What gorgeous cats can the main character fall in love with?<br/><br/>A: There are six main storylines in this game, one for each candidate.<br/> <ul><li><strong>Kale</strong> is a great candidate, but he has a hard time standing out from the others.
