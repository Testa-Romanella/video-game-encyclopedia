It's up to you to save your friends and escape Yunder's Farm of terror!</p>\n<p>Our Savior: Recorn Culted is a remaster/sequel of the original Our Savior game, a\u00a0Patreon exclusive of mine that sort of flew under the radar for most folks. This version of the game offers a variety of new content to spice up the gameplay flow, artstyle and overall be a much more pleasant experience.\u00a0Our Savior was designed to be a sort of Slender clone, in the sense you gotta find and rescue 7 friends and avoid a group of enemies stalking you. The twist here is each enemy has their own unique style of hunting you! One may be attracted by startled crows, one may lay beartraps around to trap the player, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Seven different challenges to complete, beating each challenge will unlock new enemies and modifers for Arcade Mode.</li><li>Arcade Mode is a brand new mode which allows you to pick and choose which gameplay elements will be present in your playthrough, aswell\u00a0as a chance to experience more story elements not present in Challenge Mode.</li><li>The original cast of characters have returned, as well as two new frightful foes that will force the player to develop new strategies and ways of dealing with them.</li><li>Stealth is an important aspect of the game, but if you get caught in a corner with no way out, tossing a bit of TNT will blow all your problems away for a period of time. Just be wise about how and when you use it.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T05:59:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce4/ce4960945e1d8e91d57761f05c4425ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dave Microwaves Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
