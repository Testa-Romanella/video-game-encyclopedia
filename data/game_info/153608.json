Don't freeze! Fight your way through 3 stages and a boss to save your girlfriend! You play as Iglu, a snow coat wearing dog who shoots tennis balls (don't ask us why) and you must protect yourself from Snow Ghosts and the terrifying Snowhead! Collect the required amount of dog biscuits to satisfy Bribe Dog so he will let you move on! Make sure to rest near a fire pit to keep warm (look at your coldness bar on the top left!). You can also collect Hot Water Bottles to boost your warmth a bit. Remember... the colder you are... well... it's bad because you die.</p>\n<p>NOTE: The game is a bit harder than anticipated but it's not impossible! Might need to be tweaked a bit.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/>A / Left Arrow - Left<br/>D / Right Arrow - Right<br/>W / Up Arrow - Jump<br/>Spacebar - Shoot<br/>B - Bark</p>\n<p><strong>Objectives</strong><br/>- Collect the necessary Dog Biscuits to move on the to the next stage<br/>- Keep warm!
