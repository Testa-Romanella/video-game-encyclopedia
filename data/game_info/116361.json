Somehow through the process the game morphed into a quite different tone and in some bizarre events we wound up with a monkey backseat-driver simulator racing game.</p><p>We tried our hardest to implement multiplayer but alas, it's not there yet. However there's some shitty AI to compete with and also laptime. However due to a glitch in the waypoint system, not everyone seems to be able to cross the finishline.</p><p>Hopefully you find some joy in this laughable mess of a game we made over a weekend.</p><p>The Codemonkees team!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/151/151618ca4c00473cb8a24a295e7d04ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["aegirinn"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
