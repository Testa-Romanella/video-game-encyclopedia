{"id": 736173, "slug": "2-spicy", "name": "2 Spicy", "name_original": "2 Spicy", "description": "<p>Along with standard light-gun shooter elements found in games like Virtua Cop and Time Crisis, 2 Spicy features other concepts that are usually found in other types of games, mainly third-person shooters. The most apparent is the ability to move between specified cover using two foot pedals located below the bulk of the cabinet (an evolution of the foot pedals which move in and out of cover in Time Crisis). The cover also degrades when it is shot; eventually it will break and inflict damage on the player using it. When a player follows the opponent with the cursor long enough it will zoom in and cause your shots to inflict more damage.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2007-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T18:15:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f28/f2838729f72450023c080dfec4fcb891.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 255, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["SEGA"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": null}
