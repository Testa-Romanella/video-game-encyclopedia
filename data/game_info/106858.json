Steer your boat and do maneuvering tricks\u2026 or go straight ahead!</p>\n<p>Remember. Try to keep away from those pathetic swimmers. All they want is to get inside yar boat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0But their pathetic bodies weight and you cannot travel with many of them bastards!</p>\n<p>Enough about the game, let\u2019s talk what will happen with this game. I wish to improve the AI of the swimmers as well as add more dynamic point counting system. Some achievements and challanges will come in handy too.</p>\n<p>Eventually, it should appear on the Android Market (eee I meant Google Play) and/or App Store. So look out, mates!</p>\n<p>This is my submission for\u00a0Ludum\r\nDare 42.</p>\n<p>Hope\r\nyou will enjoy it!</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Eric</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/021/0218c48b3a57d7a4638ede9e4b1d8f17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["ekulbiej"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
