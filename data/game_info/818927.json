Some of the elements that are inside the game are provided by the engine itself and should not be used as a factor when rating the game. This includes:</p>\n<ul><li>Pause Screen</li><li>Win / Lose Screen</li><li>Level Select</li></ul>\n<p>Everything else was made by me under 48 hours.</p>\n<p>Also, although the game is playable on a browser, controls might appear janky in certain situations as the engine is more catered to mobile devices. However, this shouldn't affect your overall gameplay.</p>\n<p>If the game doesn't load at first, just reload the webpage.</p>\n<p>Play as a knight and traverse through puzzle-filled dungeons with the help of your trusty dice! Use your dice to indicate the spaces you have to move as you solve your way through 24 levels.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p>WASD / ARROW KEYS - Move</p>\n<p>SPACEBAR - Jump</p>\n\n<p>A submission for the GMTK Game Jam 2022 - Roll of the Dice</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T14:07:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/586/58695d7d0139c1150d5ce3d5e52397a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Spolarium"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
