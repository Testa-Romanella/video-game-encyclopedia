After being lured into a seemingly abandoned mansion the main character finds themself trapped in a large cave system filled with monsters. Run, jump, and use a hook shot to evade enemies as well as slash and shoot using a newly found knife and crossbow.<br/></p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>The majority of the game's controls are explained in-game</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Exit using the escape key</strong></li><li><strong>Press R to restart from the title page</strong></li><li>Move left and right using the A and D keys</li><li>Jump using space</li><li>Sprint using ctrl or shift</li><li>Hook shot using Q, aim with the cursor</li><li>Attack using the left and right mouse clicks</li></ul>\r\nPost-mortem\r\n<p>Our team has learned a lot while making this game including the good and bad. We learn different programs that help put this game together most notably Gamemaker Studio 2.\u00a0 Aspects like shaders and object parenting were learned too late for the code to change. As we learned more aspects in class the better our game-making skills got. We are very proud of the hook shot, damage fatigue, and manipulation of collision objects.</p>\n<ul><li>The<strong> hook shot</strong> was a major cornerstone of the game as it was the first real code besides basic movement and collision. With this, we were able to plan the rest of the game around its unique movement.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Damage fatigue</strong> was a result of us trying to stop players from just spamming attacks. This change forces the player to have a rhythm when attacking to get the most out of their damage.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>We were able to manipulate object interactions to have only one collision object. We used this to spawn and remove specific collisions to advance and lead the player.</li></ul>\n<p>The genre of the game also changed as it\u00a0was originally planned to be a Metroidvania where items like the crossbow would be given later and involved in exploration. This was changed as the crossbow became an integral balance with the knife's high damage short range.</p>\n<p>All in all, we think these changes lead to a better more streamlined experience.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T18:26:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d99/d9967f8b3fdda6b9653105dec60ea37f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CompSciBoi"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
