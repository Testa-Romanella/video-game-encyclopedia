This is version 1.2, the 7DRL builds are linked below.)</p>\n<p>Gob! is a turn-based shoot-em-up, made for the 7 day roguelike challenge: 7DRL 2017. Your quest is to get a high score.</p>\n<p>Use W,A,S,D to shoot. Cursor keys to move. Space bar to wait. 1-7 equips / unequips spells to your shots (they activate in the sequence you equip them).</p>\n<p>There's sort-of-mouse-controls: click to move to an empty square, or shoot an occupied one. Right click to shoot in a direction. Click on yourself to wait. It didn't like my graphics tablet - watch out for that (or just use keys).</p>\n<p>Being made for a game jam, it is what it is. I feel I could do more but I've had other things I want to make.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c25/c2501b55c8dd331e4de9ae834c268d47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["st33d"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
