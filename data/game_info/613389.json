As you absorb atoms, you\u00a0<strong>transform\u00a0</strong>into new elements.</p>\n<p>Played entirely with the mouse. Hold down left click to charge up, then release to dash in the direction you're aiming. Hit the nucleus of an atom to absorb it, but if you hit its orbiting electrons, you die!</p>\n<p>Made with Game Maker Studio 2 in 2 hours, 55 minutes.\u00a0Design and code by Levi Pinkert.\u00a0Logo and playtesting by Ella Pinkert.
