I encountered a few more issues, probably due to my inexperience with Godot 4's changes. I mainly created this to try and relearn some of Godot, and get used to the changes. Hopefully the issues that I experienced in Godot 4, which persisted into the final build, can be fixed later.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T14:42:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/221/2210abdffa0f1e189812754ce933c300.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["borboss"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
