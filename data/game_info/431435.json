The theme of the game jam was \"Keep it Alive\", so the action takes place in an ambulance, everything goes fast and you have to help your patients! Stabilizing them! Well, the protagonist may be a lil' extreme in his actions, but if it means saving lives, it' totally worth!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Each mini-game uses the mouse. controls are explained right before it starts.</p>\n<p>The concept of the game was heavily inspired by Warioware, mini-games in quick succession, simple commands and over the top action mixed with ridiculous situations and some humour.</p>\n<p>Due to our tight schedule, we decided to only make 2 mini-games but at least the concept is here! And it was fun to make, which is the important part here!<br/></p>\n<p>Made by: Damien Picard, Duy Kevin Nguyen, Floriane Nguyen, Julien Delwaulle, Cl\u00e9ment Delwaulle.</p>\n<p>Code and art will be release in Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T09:17:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d7/5d7138b054ec80a092405008438bd64f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Elmeri"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
