You get 100 points for every correct answer and -10 points for any wrong ones. You have only 1 minute to try to get as many correct answers as possible.\u00a0The game will randomly choose between addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.</p>\n<p>There's a rudimentary highscore system for you to challenge yourself.</p>\n<p>You can click the buttons to enter the correct number or use the numpad on your keyboard. Escape will quit to the main menu and escape from the main menu will close the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/816/8165ebb66e30f205f9a348e75ee41dd7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Skully B"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
