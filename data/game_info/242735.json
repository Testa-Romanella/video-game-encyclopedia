Made by Reinaldo Vieira.</p>\n<p>Fly through tunnels, navigate mazes, surf through sewers, shoot space cats on the moon, and enjoy the tranquility of nature. That is what Rat Tale is about.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I am working on this game alone and I am at a point that I\u00a0need people to test it and see what they think of this game so far. All comments and criticisms are welcome, so please, tell me if its too cheesy!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Play with a gamepad for best enjoyment, but full keyboard + mouse :) support is enabled as well. WASD to move and mouse to look.</p>\n<p>Right now 5 levels are unlocked but level 2 is unfinished. The other levels are \"finished\" enough for a pre-alpha release, but, they are stable. (The final game will have more levels.)</p>\n<p>Access the\u00a0graphics menu from the main menu through options.</p>\n<p>Graphics menu\u00a0can also be brought while playing a level\u00a0by pressing 0 (that is a zero).</p>\n<p>If you ever just want to quit the game press escape and you will return to the level select, from there press the return button and then quit button. After that you will need to calculate how many parsecs it would take to just kidding, you quit the game but the real question is: are you a man or a mouse?</p>\n<p>Also, press H to toggle hats.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/917/91777108919dc4303747d682a5c60d75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ImagineGames"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
