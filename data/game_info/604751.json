I spent a total of 2 months planning, designing, illustrating, writing a script, and coding to build this game. I am a one-man team but I enjoy the challenge.\u00a0\u00a0I was actually in and out when I was trying to build the game due to my school schedule but I managed to pull through with hard work and determination.</p>\n<p>This story is just part one. In part 2, We will create more scenes as well as a longer storyline.</p>\n<p><strong>I only have a few simple rules and words for all my gamers:</strong>\n</p>\n<ol><li>The game is free to play and for personal use only so you can download and play the game for free.\r\n</li><li>But If you would like to post a game through video or any type of video on youtube or on twitch or to stream please buy one coffee from my Ko\u2011fi account or donate any amount here :).\r\n</li></ol>\n<p>(This is to support me in creating more games like these in the future).<br/></p>\n<p>https://ko-fi.com/mionharune<br/><br/></p>\n<p>*Help me spread this game to every haikyuu!! Fans by posting a selfie with the start page and use the hashtag\u00a0<strong>#orangemarmalade</strong>,\u00a0<strong>#hinatashoyootomegame</strong>, or\u00a0<strong>#haikyuuotomegame</strong>. All promotions in TikTok are also greatly appreciated but please DO NOT spoil the game!</p>\n<p>*Also, for every gamer please don\u2019t hesitate to tag me whether it's on Instagram, youtube or TikTok because I would like to make a special thanks for all players by the end of the year!
