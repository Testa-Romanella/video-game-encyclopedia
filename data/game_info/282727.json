Global tensions have risen to breaking point as the great nations of the world struggle for power. We don't know which nation struck first, but we do know that everyone retaliated. A barrage of nuclear missiles were launched all over the globe and have left the world devastated. Only the irrefutable domination of one remaining super power can save the world from total destruction.\r\n</p><p>Please note - this game was made for a game jam in a limited time, so there may be bugs.\u00a0 Also the Ai isn't quite as developed as I'd hoped, so don't expect the most challenging game you've ever played. That said, we hope you enjoy.</p><p>This game was made by :<br/></p>\n<p>Lewis Fiford   </p>\n<p>Adam Edwards   </p>\n<p>Evan Wardell   </p>\n<p>John Louigi Quintos   </p>\n<p>Aryan Abed   </p>\n<p>Arnau Frago\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f9/6f91bf8ec0d943b0f633207d868ed2ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lewis Fiford"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
