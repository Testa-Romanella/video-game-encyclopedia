The problem is she can't remember it.<br/><br/>The people around her don't remember theirs either. Like her, they're all trapped in what seems to be the same dream without a name\u2014just a number. In order to leave this place, you must \"awaken\" to your real name.<br/><br/>Much to Eight's relief, she finds a familiar face. Just by looking at him she knows he is her brother, even if neither of them can remember each other's names. She believes they're trapped in a dream; her brother thinks differently. Little by little they piece together their scattered memories to \"awaken\": how it ends depends on who you think is right.</p><p>---</p><p><strong>Available in Thai:\u00a0https://wez.in.th/game/thosewithoutnames</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d6/6d6b4f62c4132ec5e7a332dd36b3dc6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["yuucie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
