There are different wheels, cars and motors that can also be chosen by people. The cars need to finish the different types of maps, the land shapes are different so maybe the first car is really fast in one map but it cannot even finish another map. This game is developed for children who are interested in cars and also interested in physics. Children can learn both the logic of physics and build their own cars in this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T02:44:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86b/86b0930fa0780834b7817507278b25ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JohnTYF"], "genres": ["Racing", "Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
