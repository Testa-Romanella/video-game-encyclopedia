They are sequels to the Game Boy Color game Robopon. Their simultaneous release is similar to how the Pok\u00e9mon series of video games are released in pairs of games (such as Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue) to promote inter-connectivity between them.<br />\nThe games are a sequel to the earlier 2000 Game Boy Color game Robopon Sun. The Robopon bears much similarity to Nintendo&#39;s series of Pok\u00e9mon games, and thus is often considered to be a Pok\u00e9mon clone, but also bears similarity to the lesser known Super Nintendo Entertainment System game Robotrek, released by the Japanese game company Enix (now Square Enix).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2001-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T20:03:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f53/f53372519b7bd4c31ac30d8d67deda1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 2, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance"], "developers": ["Red Entertainment", "RED Company"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Atlus", "HUDSON SOFT"], "esrb_rating": null}
