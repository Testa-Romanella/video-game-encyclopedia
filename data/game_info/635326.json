Every level presents a new challenge that you can solve in a variety of creative ways while experiencing a cute slice-of-life story about the wonders of childhood. Sweet Dreams Alex draws inspiration from the maze-building of classic tower defense games and the construction-based puzzle-solving of modern games like Poly Bridge and World of Goo. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs a Dream Architect, it\u2019s your job to keep the 5-year-old Alex safe in her dreams. To do this, you build a maze in her dreamworld to keep the Nightmares from her until the morning arrives. Use a variety of fun structures to build a labyrinth full of intricate Rube Goldberg-esque chains of traps and distractions.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLife is crazy. Sweet Dreams Alex is a peaceful game to take a break with. You don\u2019t destroy any monsters, but just hold them off until the morning. You don\u2019t battle some terrible evil; you just help Alex process her days and get a good night\u2019s sleep. The game\u2019s plot is a simple slice-of-life story about Alex discovering the world\u2014and all the adventures she has on the way. There are no antagonists (except for a group of particularly nasty ducks) and the tone is consistently light and happy. Sweet Dreams Alex is comfort food in a challenging world.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T03:48:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a2/1a21cba6d7dbe142da59b4a656384c43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Philipp Baumgart", "Leonid Poliakov"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Philipp Baumgart"], "esrb_rating": null}
