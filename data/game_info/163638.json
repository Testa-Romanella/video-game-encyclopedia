Unique lifeforms grow and compete for survival and reproduction. Each lifeform is made up of segments, all of which use joints and physics for movement and pivoting. The highly-refined and intricate muscle and movement system from \r\n\tEvol Pedal has been brought over for Version 2, with almost all of the core code rewritten. Lifeforms will evolve better movement and structure in order to survive in this harsh environment.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSegments can have any color, each holding different values for Attack, Photosynthesis, and Defense. RGB (0-255) color codes allow for countless color combinations. The more red in a segment, the more damage it will do. The more green a segment has, the more health it will contribute to the lifeform. The bluer a segment, the more damage it can deflect from enemies.<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tAny amount of lifeforms can be tracked, controlled, fed, copied/pasted anywhere, or killed at the same time. Settings can be adjusted during game-play, and the sandbox will automatically adjust to any window size. Or, set it to Infinite and give them unlimited room. As lifeforms run low on health, their color will fade.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tDon't just watch: Zoom in and out, spawn random lifeforms, add gravity, build walls and dividers, add (Anti-)Gravitrons to attract or repel lifeforms and create unique environments.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tContact | Evol Games | Soundtrack 1 | Soundtrack 2<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a02/a025009a2574158528a9f71d94fc17bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Evol Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
