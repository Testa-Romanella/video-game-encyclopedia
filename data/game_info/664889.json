Roaming into the spaceship, and Interacting with holographic terminals maps, you need to find a way to land into safe space... or is it already too late?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can run the demo using different graphics quality levels and test some graphics features of Unity High Definition Render Pipeline. Also, we provide a benchmark mode that runs a simulation of the demo and reports simple results.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you are interested on how the project was made, you can also download the full Unity project to learn, mod, reuse, or explore the content.
