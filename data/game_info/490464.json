It is a real business - survival sandbox. The game aims at building an empire of underwater explorations and monopolization of underwater exploration market in the Atlantic. To achieve that we play the role of a seeker of sunken ships from II WW that were transporting most precious loads as well as older, merchant ships and warships lost without the trace. <br/><br/><br/><br/>In the game player has to his disposal an official map of wrecks sunk in the Atlantic as well as a list of ships and warships that haven\u2019t been localized yet and which disappearance is shrouded in mystery until this day. To achieve the goal you have to carefully administer the cash given at the very beginning of a gameplay. In the game, player may buy exploring ships and commission construction of new ships in specialized shipyards. Each of exploring ships may be freely equipped in any known, modern kind of underwater exploring equipment, including bathyscaphes and 3D technology. During the gameplay it is also possible to buy and rent ships to transport the loads, take loans in the banks, sell recovered wares on Mercantile Exchange or auctions. Invest money, buy estate, shipyards, hire spies to invigilate moves of competition, commission sabotage, bribe employees. Everyone will be able to lead their own research and take on exploring commission from private collectors, governments and Navy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If you are a risk taker and you like to feel the thrill of excitement you may always start exploring the seabed in closed military areas or on wrecks, where exploring expeditions are prohibited by the international law. However, don\u2019t think it is going to be easy as each quest is not only the profits but also costs together with many unpredicted events.<br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-10T16:52:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89c/89c5f9ad22e25e83148cb1ce4108f784.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 264, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WarZoneLab"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PlayWay"], "esrb_rating": null}
