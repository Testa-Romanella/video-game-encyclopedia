This demo was made for the 2023 Indie Game Dev Competition hosted by Game Developers @ UNC Charlotte</p>\n<p>Neverence is a platformer inspired by games like Celeste (and Pac-Man even) where you have the ability to fly at any point but must manage your flight stamina meter to get through obstacles. Taking the time to learn and understand the controls and movement system will be very important as your character has many\u00a0intricacies and technical aspects to their movement. There's plenty of variety in difficulty for both casual players and platforming proficient players along with many secrets and collectibles. I encourage anyone interested in this game to please comment with any feedback or suggestions they have for the game.</p>\n\n<p>Controller recommended</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T07:47:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc3/dc322d1593ad76255bb04e32d010f9e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["drewby"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
