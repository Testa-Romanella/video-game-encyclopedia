Philip with his A.I dog named D must embark on a journey to find those responsible.\u00a0</p><p>I was inspired by missed messages so I got into visual novel.\u00a0 Although light years\u00a0away from being that amazing... This is a short calm point and click adventure game.\u00a0It is set to have at least 3 different endings that depends on the choices you make in game.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>P.S. This is a work in progress. The plot is done. I just didn't have time to complete it. There are about 2 working scenes here. It stops at intro of spaceport scene 3. I have 12 scenes. I'm hoping to finish this by next week when work and life doesn't bother. Thank you for playing. Have a wonderful day.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits:\u00a0Art by me,\u00a0 Texture from unsplash,\u00a0Sound from freesound.com,\u00a0Unity game engine and adventure creator</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T04:38:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/907/9079ad3b35c9232e3374734122a2a8b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nocshiftgames"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
