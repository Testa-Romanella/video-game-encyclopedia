Try to get the score as high as possible.<br/></p>\n<p>In less than  48 hours for the 2019 GMTK Game Jam we created our first rhythm game. Be aware that this is a rough prototype, so you might run into bugs, like music desync issues and overall rough gameplay. We couldn't implement a lot of the more advanced gameplay elements, because we underestimated the complexity of a rhythm game. But we learned a lot and that's what game jams are all about right? <br/></p>\n<p>We hope that you'll enjoy our little project!<br/></p>\n<p>3D Art: Nubes <br/></p><p> Programming: Reneah <br/></p>\n<p>\r\nMusic from:\r\n( https://filmmusic.io/)<br/>\"Werq\" by Kevin MacLeod (https://incompetech.com/)<br/>\"Realizer\" by Kevin MacLeod (https://incompetech.com/)<br/>License: CC BY (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T17:42:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/127/127009e6cb43a2ffd6f3ba8008240ad3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nubes"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
