The waves will get increasingly harder with different enemy types and projectile speeds.</p>\n<p>There are also pick-ups that the player can use to help them through their journey. There is the Rapid Fire pick-up, which makes you shoot considerably faster than usual. This also activates instantly from the moment you pick it up, and lasts for a set duration.\u00a0There is also the Shield pick-up, which the player can activate whenever they want to avoid taking damage from enemy projectiles.\u00a0Finally, there is a Bomb pick-up, again that the player can activate whenever they want. This creates a massive explosion on the screen and destroys all enemy ships in play.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T05:19:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/793/79347be6f3d50d934d9edff935da4b2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZyaxitronED"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
