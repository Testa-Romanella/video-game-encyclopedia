However the game is a bit different in that every time you jump to the ceiling gravity flips to the opposite end of the room, causing your character (the long boy, haha) to alternate gravity every time you press the space bar. You can get points by either gaining distance (and your speed increases as you move)\u00a0or collecting white spheres.\u00a0</p>\n<p>SIDE NOTE\u00a0-\u00a0If your really confused on the whole long boy thing, just google it. It's really just a dumb meme,\u00a0you won't get the FBI on your IP address I swear.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dad/dad2c25d45061b6d88b8c0326436b39c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["ACLIU"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
