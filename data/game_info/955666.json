You will be amazed by the weird answers, you will be surprised by your bold attempts, um... Of course, you may click the exit button in confusion-as a confused cat.<br/><br/><br/>Hi Pizza! Hope you like the easy and convenient mouse control mode. You can even bully your second whisker in the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Well, Pizza! Before the sun goes out, the cruelest thing I can think of is to bully a fat round cat!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Uh...Only humans are foolish enough to follow the rules - walking on the same path in the same shoes every day. Yes, that's silly! Cats are good at leaving their footprints on the ceiling!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hope you like Morandi colors, Pizza. There won't be a cooler choice to present a supercilious cat!<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T07:12:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/481/4812e8a3487abf7e082c84251c7cb261.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AutumnTower Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BD Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
