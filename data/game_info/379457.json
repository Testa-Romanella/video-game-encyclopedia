Before leaving, the caretaker at the orphanage informs Deirdre she was nearly 4 years old when dropped off there, much to the surprise of Deirdre who thought she was left as a baby. The caretaker then tells Deirdre of the night she was dropped off and gives her a key to a treasure chest in town that \"only she can open\". A suspicious, but well-intentioned man brought her to the orphanage in hopes that she would be safe from harm there. He left money and a key that he instructed the caretaker to give it to Deirdre when she was of age to leave. However, opening the chest only generated more questions (and complications) for the young and confused Deirdre. The letter inside that accompanied her combat gear pointed her towards a town of great distance from her home. With her first lead being so far away, she now has the task of trying to get herself halfway across the continent safely, but fortunately, she is not alone!...well, \"fortunately\" may be putting it strongly.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe story details the comedic and (hopefully) inspiring tale of a girl trying to discover her past, all the while trudging forward with the help of her 3 newfound, whimsical friends. With the simple intent to find out who her parents are, Deirdre will unknowingly dismantle the largest conspiracy of her era. All with the help of a cast of colorful and humorous characters that are guaranteed to make you less bored than you were prior.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFilled with reference humor, tastefully shattered 4th walls, and a prodigy mage who thinks her pet chicken is a cat...what more could you ask for in a circa-1400's fantasy setting?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T02:46:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2c/b2c377c9e183d8ef6c1c0d286e8be058.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 74, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Andrew Dousay", "Ancient Earth Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Andrew Dousay", "Ancient Earth Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
