Our task was to develop a 3D-platformer, inspired by the arcade classic \u201cMarble Madness\u201d over the duration of the semester.</p>\n<p>Postmortem (Fragment Jam 2019):</p>\n<p>Even though the game is finished gameplay wise (and it was even shown at our annually exhibition of student works), I still would have liked to expand on some of its aspects. <br/></p>\n<p>So I thought it would be nice to submit this game for the 2019 Fragment Jam. Because I spent most of the time on programming and level building I didn\u2019t have the time to make better materials and textures as well as less blocky environments.</p>\n<p>I mainly replaced most of the ugly placeholder textures with a slightly-less-ugly grid texture and tried to use lighting to give each of the three levels somewhat different looks. I also added some free and some self made audio, to give the very plain environments some personality.</p>\n<p>Fun fact: The title \u201cMarble Boi\u201d was initially only a (somewhat memey) joke and intended as a placeholder, but in the end everyone was referring to it by that name so changing it wpuld just have felt wrong.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T08:41:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/193/1938a8273936e292762312d3f41451a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SchwahnDev"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
