Don't let the ball fall down and smash all bricks on the screen in order to advance to the next level, all while listening to melodious music embedded to make the experience fun for you. Manage speed of the ball, predict its movements and watch yourself being engaged with the keypad as you will be busy trying to prevent the ball from going off-screen!</p>\n<p>No matter how good games become over generations, the lovely feeling we get from playing the classical ones never gets older or less lovelier! Somewhere deep we all have always loved the classical early Nintendo , GameBoyAdvance and Atari. Thanks to technology, today we have a great access not only to play those titles again, but also to have a look at other fun games meant to be a tribute to the classics. This game aims to be one of those.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a fresh developer's first foot into the game development industry so all criticisms and suggestions are appreciated. This game is absolutely free but in case if you wanna help/support this fresh developer and wanna see more of his titles come forth, then donations are welcome too!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T04:49:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64e/64e77e975baf9ea8bbffd8b2d516948e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pranav Kulshreshtha"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
