He wakes up in a morgue with significant amnesia as to what he was doing that resulted in his near-death\u2014in fact, he was thought to be literally brain-burnt, which he himself felt as if he was when awakened.</p>\n<p>*Jake builds up &quot;karma&quot; from killing enemies - on a steady basis from killing regular enemies, and in large chunks from beating bosses. This karma can then be allocated by the player into different attributes, skills, and magical powers. Physical attributes include basic factors as how many hit points Jake has. Jake also has the ability to learn new skills, such as &quot;negotiation&quot; and &quot;leadership,&quot; which allows him to haggle prices and to retain the loyalty of henchmen.</p>\n<p>(Source of Description - &#39;Shadowrun Fandom Wiki&#39;; &#39;Shadowrun (SNES)&#39;</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1993-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-16T05:24:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/629/6293d1992594820c1383529974a8c975.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.17, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 7, "owned": 5, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 6}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 314, "game_series_count": 6, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["SNES"], "developers": ["Beam Software Pty"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Arcade", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Data East", "Laser Beam Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
