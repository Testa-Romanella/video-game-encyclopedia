Due to a hurricane in the night, the bee awakes to find the landscape barren.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>As the bee, you must collect pollen from flowers located around the environment and deliver the pollen to the beehives. When this happens, you will be rewarded by getting to witness the regrowth of the environment.   </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy exploring the environment, discovering the different foliage areas, exploring ruins, and reviving the valley. And most of all, relax and enjoy the experience. As a collaborative project all members worked incredibly hard to put this project together, we really hope you enjoy the final product.
