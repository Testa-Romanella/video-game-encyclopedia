I've started and dropped only 4-5 games since last year. Finally realized that without a deadline, I won't be able to finish what I started. So I participated at one by myself and made this game for the topic of Shoes in 2 days.</p>\n<p>There can be multiple glitches and bugs, there is way more area that needs to be fixed and polished - especially graphically and in terms of\u00a0level design\u00a0- but I think its not that bad for someones first game.</p>\n<p>Any feedback is welcome. Thanks,</p>\n<p>Sami \u015eahin</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T07:25:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a4/3a4b3256d3a3d0eeaa01ebd5a8ad3b4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["samisahin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
