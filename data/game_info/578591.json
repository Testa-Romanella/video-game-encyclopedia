{"id": 578591, "slug": "puzzle-box-itch", "name": "Puzzle Box (itch)", "name_original": "Puzzle Box (itch)", "description": "<p><strong>What is puzzle box?</strong></p>\n<p>Puzzle box is a simple puzzle game where the player can control every cube at once, this makes for difficult puzzles where the player has to account for every cube before making their move.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>What can you expect?</strong></p>\n<p>The game consists of 8 worlds, with 1 of them being optional. There are a total of 112 levels, split between mandatory and bonus levels. Every world will have the player explore 2 or more new event tiles, which liven up the puzzles in those worlds. Bonus levels make use of dropped mechanics, which didn't fit in future worlds.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A few examples of event tiles are:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Movement Pad:\u00a0</strong>propels the active cube forward into the direction shown</li><li><strong>Button</strong>: opens the linked tiles when stepped on</li><li><strong>Rotation Pad:\u00a0</strong>Rotates the active cube, sothat it may move in other directions</li><li><strong>Prism</strong>: Inverts the controls of the active cube, sothat cubes may move in opposite directions</li></ul>\n\n<p>I've added 2 additional downloads, one which will open all worlds and one which will instantly unlock all levels. This is done sothat the player has the option to skip certain levels if they get stuck on them for too long, but since it's not advised to skip levels, it's on a higher price.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T05:14:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cdc/cdcad37aa823224627ca340024e262d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alme_Studios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
