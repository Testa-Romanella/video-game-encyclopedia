Unlike many co-operative games, the simultaneous, real-time nature of the game helps prevent group-think. This forces players to make decisions with minimal feedback and prevents one player from simply running the show. Your turn never ends, and is only limited to what you can accomplish in 15, 30, 45 or 60 second intervals.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:19:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f3/0f3f3c8dec4d1f3296931e79476ee266.jpg", "website": "http://www.bfrgames.com/damagereport/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Radical Bomb"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": ["Radical Bomb"], "esrb_rating": null}
