I know it, you know it, there's no use skirting around it. Now that we're a whole year in, one thing that I realized I've missed the most was just simply going over to a friend's house and talking. It didn't matter what we did, there's a calming happiness that I got from going over and hearing about everyone's lives. That's the feeling NightOut attempts to recreate, the simple environment of seeing your friends after a while apart.</p>\n<p>This game was made utilizing PixelCrushers' Dialog\u00a0System for Unity. It is meant to act both as a short narrative experience and a deep-dive into the capabilities of this plugin. I utilized the plugin to create dynamic conversations between individuals as a way to facilitate normal conversation, story progression, and quests. This was also my first endeavor into Unity, and I utilized this opportunity to create a short narrative experience.\u00a0I hope you like it!</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed this game, feel free to check out my other works on my Itch.io page.
