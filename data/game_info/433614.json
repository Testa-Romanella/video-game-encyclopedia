Her best friend Wormikyu happens to be a tentacle/eyeball monster. Lure other magical girls to your friend's tentacles to let it feed. Can you defeat all 6 magical girls while keeping Wormikyu alive?</p>\n<p><strong>VR REQUIRED</strong>: Do not download this if you don't have VR. Supported VR platforms:</p>\n<ul><li>Oculus Quest (use Sidequest to install the .apk file)</li><li>Steam VR on Windows (Tested with HTC Vive)</li><li>Oculus VR on Windows (Tested with Oculus Rift and Oculus Quest in Link mode)</li></ul>\n<p>No Windows Mixed Reality because I don't have that.<br/></p>\n<p>Made in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 46 and Magical Girl Game Jam. Themes are \"Keep it alive\" and \"My very best friend\".</p>\n<p>It's still a bit rough, but that's all the time I had for the LDJAM. I might continue working on a different build for Magical Girl Game Jam, which has a later deadline.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You can use either hand or both hands with the following controls<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Flying: Press the VR controlleer's front trigger to make Violet fly to the tip of your transparent wand. Keep it held down to have her follow your wand as you move it around. Fly though a building fast enough and you will damage/destroy it.</li><li>Firing: Push the touchpad button (on the HTC Vive) or the A/X buttons (Oculus) to fire a burst of magic at where the tip of your wand is. Hold down the button to keep firing. Firing at other magical girls will hurt them. Firing at buildings will damage the,\u00a0not that\u00a0you\u00a0care\u00a0about\u00a0collateral\u00a0damage.\r\n</li><li>Reposition world: squeeze the side grip button and move the controller, as if you are grabbing the world and dragging it, while you stay still.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Known Issues in LDJAM build: </strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Violet sometimes loses the ability to shoot. Not sure why.</li><li>Performance requirements are a bit intensive for the physics sometimes, and during level load. It may cause a few seconds of lag and very low framerates first while things are settling down before it is ok.</li><li>Not balanced - I didn\u2019t even get a chance to play through to the win/lose conditions during the jam. So it could just be too easy/hard. I only slapped together the win/lose conditions, life amounts, and enemy girl spawning in the final minutes of the jam. I know that the monster continues to lose life after you win. I probably should have left it more as a sandbox. I had too much fun making the aesthetics and building destruction system, and hardly spent any on the larger game loop.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Tools: </strong>Unity, Blender, Substance Painter, GIMP, Audacity<strong><br/>Third-Party Assets</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Music: Electric Cellos  by Rafael Krux.
