A shitty day on a shitty job. But a Squid has been killed, and someone's got to clean up the mess. So go over there and get this murder solved.</p>\n<p>At least, that's the plan. But I didn't get this one finished before the jam deadline. I've got a pretty nice homemade raycasting engine with a\u00a0procedurally generated city and\u00a0procedurally generated citizens, but no actual plot - yet. I'll try and get it added before the rating gets going.</p>\n<p>If you suffer bad performance (I didn't get around to optimizing the engine), try the stand alone .exe version. That one should work for most modern windows systems.
