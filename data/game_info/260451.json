Tapping the screen uses your attack move (which starts off as howl until you buy a weapon). Double tapping the screen uses your special move. Passive abilities are always active (like extra life, longer jump...). <br/><br/>As you jump up you will collect coins. These coins can be used in the store to buy new guns, special abilities or passive abilities. Once you buy something in a store, you have it forever and can put it in your loadout. Your loadout consists of your weapon, your special move and your passive ability. For example, you could pick a shotgun, epic howl and extra life as a loadout. <br/><br/>To take out enemies you can either jump on their head, use your attack, or use an offensive special move.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:59:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b2/7b25dd8aaadf1d66e4e09eadb94b372c.jpg", "website": "http://www.couragewolfjump.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Rocket Splash Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Rocket Splash Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
