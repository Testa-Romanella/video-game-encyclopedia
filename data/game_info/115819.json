Only you, with your mastery of the tummy laser can save them!</p>\n<p>Tummy Lasers is a twist on the classic arcade shooters of the 80's. The protagonist \r\n\t<em>(a fluorescent-yellow feline with a weaponized tummy)</em> is controlled by rotating left and right,  with the recoil of your bullets pushing you in the opposite direction. Holding down the fire button produces a steady laser beam that allows you to hover and glide across the level.<br/></p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis unusual control scheme is fun and challenging, but with a little practice is surprisingly elegant and affords a high degree of fine control. You can swoop between enemies, narrowly maneuvering past a missile before shooting your target out of the air. By combining the regular shot with the laser, you can even string together kills to build up your multiplier!</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>More than 15 action-packed waves set over 4 distinct worlds</li>\n<li>10+ Alien monsters to battle against</li>\n<li>4 giant bosses</li>\n<li>Novel control scheme</li>\n<li>Save kittens to unlock new playable characters</li>\n<li>Keyboard &amp; Xinput controller support</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/529/5290ca58de291a2bf5214b6cff878af5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ed Mullins"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
