The player's goal is to get to the portal at the end of each level before the enemies can stop you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The player can interact with blocks by pushing on them, or walking into them. Green blocks move one tile, ice blocks slide until they hit a surface, and locked blocks are unmovable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can fight back against the pesky enemies by crushing them between two surfaces! That's all, and Good Luck!</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Menu Background Music</p>\n<p>Game Background Music<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T05:16:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e05/e05233cbdaa67a38aa5e05fa650d1bbd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Blue Birdy"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
