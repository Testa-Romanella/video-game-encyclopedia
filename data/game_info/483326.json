It is very basic and easy, just left click in the white floor tiles, then select which faerie it will summon. Every 20 seconds you are able to place another circle. Kill Rhite before Rhite kills you. You will automatically cast magic missles on any faeries that get close to you and want to harm you.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T03:52:30", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BlueBeard22"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
