Will you be able to find some before the shops close?\r\n<p><em><strong>A short interactive hunt for coffee set during the COVID-19 pandemic.</strong></em></p>\n<p>This game was written nearly a year ago (Feb-March 2020), when most of the world was only beginning to adopt lockdowns\u00a0 to contain the spread of COVID-19. I wrote it at time when coffee shops where I live hadn't made up their mind if they should\u00a0stay open for takeaway or hunker down until the lockdown lifted. This also explains the somewhat light-heartened tone of this game.<br/></p>\n<p>It must be stressed that this game is a work of <strong><em>fiction</em></strong>.
