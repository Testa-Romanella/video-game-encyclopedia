Our shelter. Today, this is the whole universe! <br/><br/>And it's okay. We're surrounded by our favorite sacred things. Each one has something kind and magical to offer.<br/><br/>And we'll be okay. Let's practice some #SelfCare together. Let's start with a little breathing exercise...<br/><br/>Breathing slowly connects us to our body and gives us life. Mmmmmm. We can breathe for as long as we'd like. There's no hurry. There's no end. We breathe and we listen to ourselves.<br/><br/>In this universe, our goal is simply to feel better. There's no winning, no failure, no score. No difficulty, no ads, no notifications. There is just us and our feelings.<br/><br/>Join us here, in this room, for a few moments. This room is our escape. &lt;3", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-29T21:33:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/268/2680ab562d277adfb2f6cc295ad66fc2.jpg", "website": "http://truluv.ai/selfcare", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Tru Luv Media"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Tru Luv Media"], "esrb_rating": null}
