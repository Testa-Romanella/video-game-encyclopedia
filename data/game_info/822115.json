You and an opponent start with 3 dice, and immediately roll\u00a0them. After that, each round you get to choose to reroll 1 dice to help increase your overall total.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Whichever side has the lower total\u00a0loses HP. (Both sides lose HP if a tie occurs).</p>\n<p>Simple!</p>\n<p>However, there are a few extra rules at play...</p>\n<ul><li>If you roll the minimum or maximum number on your dice, the dice changes!<br/><em>Example: If a d6 rolls a 1, it changes into a d4. If a d6 rolls a 6, it changes into a d8.<br/></em>This can increase all the way up to a d20! Additionally, the new dice immediately rerolls, which means it can transform multiple times a round. Also,\u00a0if a 1 is rolled on a d4, HP is lost!</li><li>Every other round, you get to choose between two upgrades that change your dice pretty dramatically.\u00a0<em>Examples: One dice instantly becomes a d10. All d6's get +2.</em></li></ul>\n<p><strong>If you lose all your HP or cause your opponent to lose all theirs, the game is over.</strong></p>\n<p><em><br/>Note: Press F11 to toggle fullscreen if desired<br/></em></p>\n<p>We made this game in 48 hours in Gamemaker Studio 2\u00a0for the GMTK Game Jam 2022, pouring our blood, sweat, and tears into it.
