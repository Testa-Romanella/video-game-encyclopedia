Easy, Medium, Hard, Impossible and Endless. The goal is to get a score of 1000 for the difficulties levels and you play against your high score in the Endless level. (Legends have it that the creator of the game could only make it to 1500m in endless mode) Good luck!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can use the AWSD keys or the arrow keys and the space bar can also be used to jump.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is Lemon Tree Studio Inc.'s first mini-game and was made by Joel Diab.
