We wanted the game to focus on moving between different zones to perform different activities.</p>\n<p>The theme also inspired the general aesthetic of the game as \"In the zone\" also reminded us of exclusion zones and radioactivity, hence a radioactive pet rock.</p>\n<p>The game can be played with either the mouse or touchscreen.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy our little project!
