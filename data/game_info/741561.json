PSU was loved by many, and hated by many. SEGA seems in large part to want to forget PSU ever happened, but we will never forget it. Many who sought after ways of reviving their beloved game ultimately failed in the end. Marmalade, the lead developer of Clementine, has put in years of hard work and dedication to the Clementine project to enable thousands to relive the fond memories of playing PSU online once again. No amount of thanks can show our appreciation towards him.</p>\n<p>This resurrection could not have happened without the support of our community. Thank you to all who have supported us, whether it be from simple testing, or donating to our Patreon; your support is what has allowed Clementine to come to fulfillment. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you! We hope to see you around the Gurhal System.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-19T22:22:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d88/d88ad21ef9352387fe515abe1158e4cf.jpg", "website": "https://psu-clementine.net/community/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 231, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
