The operation mode is similar to Minesweeper where you click on the grid to unlock the surrounding grids, which requires you to be bold, choose reasonable routes and find the hidden levels in the dungeon so as to challenge higher levels.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Currently, there are 7 occupations to choose from. You can choose 1 main occupation, 2 sub-occupations, and build your favorite skill combinations.<br/><br/><br/><br/>New skill library, talent system, buff system and relic system.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Explore the secrets deep in the dungeon on random maps.
