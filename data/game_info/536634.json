I don't know what to say more.<br/></p>\n<p>There is only one level. Well, we are only on the Pre-Alpha 0.0.3. My goal is to make an actual level, where they can kill you, and you have to kill them.<br/><br/>I really don't know how to explain... this. To be fair with y'all, this game was purely made so i can learn how to use Unreal Engine 4, and is not really meant to be played, momentarily. I don't know if I'll continue this project.<br/><br/>If you are a developer or simply someone that needs the name \"Among Drip: The Videogame\" for his game on Itch, I can change mine with no problem. This game is more of a shitpost than anything.
