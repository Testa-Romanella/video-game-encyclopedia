Press r, backspace, or esc to reset the map.</p>\n<p>Note: As this is a very early prototype, this version is much different than the release version will be, as one of the main game mechanics is still missing. In the release version there will not be infinite cities, but instead an expandable city; there will also be a bit less control over the engine power.</p><p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>rzu\u0142f\u2122 : bug tester</li><li>azkoonn : bug tester</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T07:28:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9c/f9cd6fb3a7741560d4a338eb70be52fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jcodefox"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
