It contains only 8 rooms and various puzzle elements. I made this on Windows but it should work on MAC and Linux.\u00a0Oops.\r\n</p>\n<p>It is a simple puzzle game focused around planning your moves based on what the dice in the large skull show. You play as a small skull that can roll around and flip levers.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>There is lots of confusing elements because of some poor design decisions and time restraints. To make up for some of that, I'll add some info below.\r\n</p>\n<p>Use WASD and E to move / interact. Use ESCAPE to restart level.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you get stuck or decide to revisit the game later, or just get bored, you can use CTRL + F to skip a level or CTRL + R to go back a level.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Below are some game related tips.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>General:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The levers each have unique borders that correspond to an eye-die.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Red levers can only be pulled once.\r\n</p>\n<p>Green Plus adds the die to the eye, Red Minus removes the die from the eye.\r\n</p>\n<p>Doors and traps with dice labels will activate when the corresponding eye matches.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Room 4 and onward:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Golden flooring tiles have special effects, based on the first eye.\r\n</p>\n<p>Hearts make you invincible to fire and spiders.\r\n</p>\n<p>Arrows make it so the dice do not roll down while on the tile.\r\n</p>\n<p>Eye tiles are deadly.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Room 6 and onward:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Keys have unique shapes that correspond with the first eye.\r\n</p>\n<p>Keys can only be picked up when the first eye matches the shape.\r\n</p>\n<p>All keys must be picked up to open key-gates.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Room 7 is a bit convoluted.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>That is all, thanks for checking out this page! - FruitGhost</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T14:42:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b5/8b570e5722012378d25d0d25171bb2ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FruitGhost"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
