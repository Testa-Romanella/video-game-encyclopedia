For example, the 'Eye' tells the 'Leg' to chase other creatures around it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>#How does it\u00a0evolve?</p>\n<p>When player finishes creating a creature, an unique byte array (DNA) is created to represent the creature including its behaviours and body pieces.</p>\n<p>When two creatures mate with each other, their DNAs are mixed to form a new one. This new DNA is used to create the offspring, inheriting the characteristics from its parents.</p>\n<p>Overtime, weak creatures die and strong creatures survive. Thus strong\u00a0creatures produce stronger offsprings.</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>--- Clicks on the Crafting Table to create creature.</p>\n<p>--- Five\u00a0types of body piece\u00a0can be used: Muscle, Eye, Leg, Mouth &amp; Talon.</p>\n<p>--- Creatures will attack creatures with different DNAs.</p>\n<p>--- After creatures have gained enough energy, they can mate with each other to pass their DNAs to the next generation.</p>\n<p>More Information: https://www.dannydaisun.com/pixel-monster</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-28T03:15:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/348/3484095339b804a5dd4adeaa3c86bc2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dannydaisun"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
