Lily enters her grandfather\u2019s footsteps as a young archeologist. Her epic quest for the ultimate treasure, fame and glory begins in a small town, below the garden of their own house. \u201cLily\u00b4s Epic Quest\u201d is an innovative enhancement to the match-3 genre. Next to known match-3 mechanics, you clear a path for Lily through different ground layers. Removing blocks will make space for Lily\u00b4s path towards the center of the earth. Explore eight magical worlds on your search for rare gems and artifacts and find over 200 collectables. Some of the gems and artifacts are common and others are very rare. It is up to you to collect them all. The game offers traditional match3 principles but with a free roaming playfield. The player decides where to dig for gems or how to solve 115 puzzles. Additional tools will offer more options and provide access to new parts of the world.</p>\n<p><strong>This game is also available on\u00a0STEAM.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Match 3 with free roaming playfield!\t</li><li>Explore eight beautiful magical worlds and 115 puzzles\t</li><li>More than 200 treasures and helpful items\t</li><li>Hidden doors and powerful tools such as power-drills and dynamite\t</li><li>Exciting minigames included</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Minimum system requirements:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>OS:\u00a0Win XP/Vista/7/8/10</li><li>Processor:\u00a02.5 GHz</li><li>Memory:\u00a02 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics:\u00a0256 MB</li><li>DirectX:\u00a0Version 9.0c</li><li>Storage:\u00a0512 MB available space</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed9/ed9d0c8f07faaa2c2949b9306d1faf78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 204, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Libredia"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
