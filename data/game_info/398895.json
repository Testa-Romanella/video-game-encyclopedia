With only a deck of magical cards, each infused with unique spells, you're tasked with navigating the ever changing halls before you finally encounter the mastermind behind this devilish machination!</p>\n<p><em>Sleight</em>\u00a0is a Virtual Reality roguelike, developed for the VIVE and Oculus Rift, where players fight against mechanical enemies in a procedurally generated Victorian manor. Using a magical deck of cards, players cast spells on themselves, enemies and the environment around them in order to defeat their foes. Throughout the\u00a0 game players will build a specialised deck, and their strategy, as they defeat rooms of enemies and find new cards. Waiting three floors away, there is a battle for the ages, but they must be careful,\u00a0for if they fall they must begin again!</p>\n<p>Credits:\u00a0<br/>Designers:\u00a0Jacob Bloem\u00a0and\u00a0Jake Haydon\u00a0<br/>Programmers:\u00a0Tyler Marcelis,\u00a0Erick Watson\u00a0and\u00a0Ben Hilder\r\n<br/>Artists:\u00a0Hudson Liebelt\u00a0and\u00a0Daniel Hood</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-16T03:40:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92d/92de87ab869a1fe83cf10d86b8d63899.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JakeHaydon", "Erick Watson", "Tyler Marcelis", "Cutting Cards", "Artamis", "WolfieOnFire", "DefaultDann"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
