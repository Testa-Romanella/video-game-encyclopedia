The powerful Giants enslaved the other races, but Humans fought back. King Arthur, leader of knights, finally became the master of Edin. With Edin united, the Tower of Babel was built in attempt to reach Heaven. Enraged, Teon imprisoned King Arthur. Chaos ensued, and Humans dropped like flies. <br/>Finally, the brutal King Attila took over the throne and brought terror over the world. The Undead rose, and Edin was shrouded in darkness. <br/>Still, the light of justice never faded.
