(Side note\u00a0:\u00a0The starting room isn't supposed to have fairies but I\u00a0left them in while testing and don't want to rebuild. If you find it too easy, try playing without using those fairies!)</p>\n<p>- Enemies (and pots)\u00a0drop coins when defeated. You can't spend them on anything, but see how many you can collect.\u00a0It can also be\u00a0useful to not collect them instantly, as enemies can't move through them ;)</p>\n<p>- The game ends when the boss is defeated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T18:55:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a5/8a5acfa0b469d9d449d4c2ae299c9aa2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cyanilux"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
