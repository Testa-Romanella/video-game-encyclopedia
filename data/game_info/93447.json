Our focus is to produce quality, story-centric titles that feature rich, three-dimensional characters and complex, original plots. We strive to create a meaningful journey for players to undertake in each of our games, conjuring an atmosphere similar to that of a movie or novel but with the added dimension of interaction. <p>We do this because it's our sincere belief that it is the personal connection players form with a game that makes it a success. It is with this philosophy in mind that we approach game development, and we believe that our work stands out as a result. </p><p>We have already released several commercial adventure games, with more titles in active development.<br/></p><p>Links</p><p>Facebook<br/></p><p>Twitter</p><p><strong>Website</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/698/698f70e7daa3ca3a96bbb7ebe7dc9852.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Unimatrix Productions"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
