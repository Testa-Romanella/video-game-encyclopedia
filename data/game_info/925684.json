So this game is an roguelike (but without the procedural generation) where you need to complete four phases to reach the end.</p>\n<p>I was low on time so the game is very incomplete and there's not even a custom scene at the end. Maybe I will comeback to develop it a little bit more, because it's definetly not in state I wished it was, but it was really fun creating it this week and I think it has potential I just need to use more time for polishing. I used most of the time I took to polish to create the run animation and it stills looks bad, I could have used that time for more useful stuff.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T08:16:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d4/7d45aa75fe1dfb62f8c102d353e81837.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Douglas Asted"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
