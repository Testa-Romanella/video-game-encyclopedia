Each of the worlds contains four difficulty levels.  Each of these levels is completely different from any of the others.  There is a complete range of challenges, for every one of the sixteen screens that makes up a world has hundreds of puzzles for you to solve as you try to collect all of the treasure without ending up crushed under a rock.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1987-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:50:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/799/7991cc7ebae90e49fb913d03f9ec03ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 5, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 270, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC", "Commodore / Amiga", "Atari ST"], "developers": ["First Star Software", "Synergistic Software"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": ["Mastertronic"], "esrb_rating": null}
