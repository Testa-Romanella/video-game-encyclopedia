A brick will be destroyed if a ball bounces off\u00a0it. The ball's speed will also increase gradually as time passes (although not too much at a time).\u00a0While this game may seem easy at first, it can actually be quite difficult as the game proceeds, so don't underestimate it!</p>\n<p><strong>Power-ups:</strong></p>\n<p>Power-ups will spawn randomly in the space between the paddle and the bricks. If a ball touches a power-up, the power-up will be activated. The activated power-up will reset the timer without removing any of the existing effects. Below is the list of power-ups that will spawn:</p>\n<ul><li>Yellow (lightning symbol): Makes the ball faster for 3s</li><li>Blue (snowflake symbol): Makes the ball slower for 3s</li><li>Red (plus symbol): Adds an additional ball</li><li>Black\u00a0(arrows pointing outwards): Expands the paddle for 3s</li><li>White (arrows pointing inwards): Shrinks the paddle for 3s</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Gold Brick:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A gold brick will spawn in each level. Breaking a gold brick will spawn a Purple (restart symbol) power-up, which will slowly drop down. To activate the power-up, collect it with the paddle before it hits the bottom edge. Once activated, the ball will be respawned and all other existing balls will be destroyed. However, it will travel at its original speed (without power-ups) upon touching the paddle.</p>\n<p><strong>Levels:</strong></p>\n<p>Once all the bricks in the level are destroyed, you will proceed to the next level and the bricks will be respawned. With each level, the number of times a brick must be hit to be destroyed increases. (E.g. Bricks in level 1 requires 1 hit to destroy, \u00a0Bricks in level 2 requires 2 hit to destroy, etc).</p>\n<p><strong>Score:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Your score is calculated by the number of times the ball hits the bricks (do not need\u00a0to destroy).\u00a0 A new highscore is set when your score is higher than your previous highscore</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T02:23:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/698/6986abe321a87454a86ddba905fbb038.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["kj1808"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
