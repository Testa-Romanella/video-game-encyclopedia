If you successfully hit your opponent with an Attack, Mash your Attack button to form a Combo.</p><p>Use your Special button to perform a Special Move. Each character has 3 Special moves that they will perform in order at first, then randomly after the first 3 Specials</p><p>The randomness are like Modern Tetris randomness, so you can only do the same Special twice, and the maximum dry period of a Special is 4 moves</p><p>Each Character's 1st Special Move, AKA the first one you do, is Unblockable. So remember this move when you are trying to punish a defensive opponent</p><p><em>How is this adhering to the theme?</em></p><p>- Well, it's a bit loose I admit, but I want to try to capture the CHAOTIC nature of button mashing in fighting game. I originally don't have any good ideas for this jam, but after YouTube recommended a couple of fighting game videos I remembered that time when I and my cousin went into a mall and played Tekken Tag Tournament 2. We played for a while, laughing and screaming despite not knowing how most of the moves worked, all while mashing away to our victory. It's a really fun memory, and I kinda wanted to make something as a tribute for that. That and Killer Instinct's Ultra Combos from those afformentioned YouTube videos.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T20:44:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80c/80c560134da848f042ca9d65a25472dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["T-MotiF"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
