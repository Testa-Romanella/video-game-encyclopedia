If the tales were constructed for someone or something else's benefit? When Ragnar, a great viking warrior, falls in deadly combat, he arrives at Valhalla in the afterlife. Only the Great Hall of the Gods is not a hall, but a mysterious machine with unknown purpose, fueled by the Soul Steam of the fallen warriors. With the help of a mysterious sentient artifact known as Rock, Ragnar ventures forth with one goal: to escape this accursed machine and return to Midgard.</p>\n<p>[Requires controllers to play] [1-2 players locally]</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>- Emre\u00a0Can (Level Designer)</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Guilherme\u00a0Bandini (Producer &amp; Video Animator)</p>\n<p>- Ian Norton (Level Designer &amp;\u00a0Technical Director)</p>\n<p>- May Kwan (Concept Art, Narrative &amp; Research)</p>\n<p>- Sam Pollock (Game Design)</p>\n<p>- Vitaly Starush (UX Design, In-Game Art &amp; Art Director)</p>\n<p>- Joshua Randal (Programmer)</p>\n<p>- Mackenzie Wilson (Programmer)</p>\n<p>- Ryan Johnson (Character Animator)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae5/ae50d9e46457fc41b8247f7f9f38822e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CappuccinoGuil"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
