They have seen your flag and they are coming for it. <br/><br/>Plan your defence and wait for the incoming horde. Can you best the thieving band of players? <br/><br/><br/>A mashup of classic platformers and tower defence-like games, Super Tower Defence World flips the table and puts the player (you) in charge of the kingdom's defence. <br/><br/>Control the camera with your arrow keys, and use your mouse to place \"creep spawners\". But be warned - your finances are limited! Place your defences wisely! <br/><br/><br/>Art by Kenney (kenney.nl)!
