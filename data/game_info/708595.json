{"id": 708595, "slug": "the-rusty-sword-kickstarter-island", "name": "The Rusty Sword: Kickstarter Island", "name_original": "The Rusty Sword: Kickstarter Island", "description": "<p>The Rusty Sword: Kickstarter Island is a demo for our\u00a0currently in-development game, The Rusty Sword: Runelock Island, soon to be on Kickstarter. It contains a small island overworld, a full-size dungeon, and is a standalone quest that will not be in the full game. Gameplay is designed to resemble classic Zelda titles, graphics are designed in a 16-Bit style akin to the early 1990\u2019s, and the music is designed to sound upbeat and energetic, like many classic titles.   </p>\n<p>In this demo, players must find the Kickstarter Trophy and fight countless monsters along the way. Use bombs wisely! There are several paths that can be opened with them, both visible and hidden. We absolutely want to encourage exploration and multiple play-throughs. \u00a0   </p>\n<p>Did we mention that we already have the game running perfectly on a Nintendo Switch?   </p>\n<p>\u00a0   </p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong> </p>\n<p>Although The Rusty Sword can be played with a keyboard, we recommend that you do play with an official Xbox controller. Any XInput controller should work, but we don't currently have button re-mapping in-game and can't guarantee buttons on other controllers will map the same. However, using another software, like JoyToKey (https://joytokey.net/en/), to map the buttons on a controller of your choice to the keyboard assignments below works great! \u00a0   </p>\n<p><strong>Move</strong> </p>\n<ul><li>Xbox Controller: Dpad or Left Stick \r\n</li><li>Keyboard: Arrow Keys or WASD      \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0      \r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Attack with Sword </strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Xbox Controller: A \r\n</li><li>Keyboard: Spacebar or Z \r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Lift/Throw Objects</strong> (bombs, bushes, jars, signs, certain rocks)<strong> or Read Sign</strong> (make sure to face front of sign)   </p>\n<ul><li>Xbox Controller: B \r\n</li><li>Keyboard:      X\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Use or Equip/Unequip Item 1 </strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Xbox Controller: X \r\n</li><li>Keyboard: C\u00a0 \r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Use or Equip/Unequip Item 2 </strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Xbox Controller: Y \r\n</li><li>Keyboard: V\u00a0 \r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Inventory Menu </strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Xbox Controller: Start \r\n</li><li>Keyboard: 1\u00a0 \r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Settings Menu</strong> (in-game)   </p>\n<ul><li>Xbox Controller: Back \r\n</li><li>Keyboard: 2\u00a0 \r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>UI Confirm </strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Xbox Controller: A \r\n</li><li>Keyboard: Spacebar or Z\u00a0 \r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>UI Cancel</strong> </p>\n<ul><li>Xbox Controller: B \r\n</li><li>Keyboard: X\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>FEATURES</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Non-linear adventure structure with multiple ways to      get to most places.\r\n</li><li>Several monsters and traps to encounter.\r\n</li><li>Designed around single-player, but entire game will be playable      in two-player mode.\r\n</li><li>Awesome graphics and music.\r\n</li><li>Several display options, including widescreen and classic      aspect ratios.\r\n</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS</strong> \u00a0   </p>\n<ul><li>Download and unzip \"Rusty Sword Demo.zip\" \r\n</li><li>Open \"Rusty Sword Demo\" folder \r\n</li><li>Run \"Rusty Sword Demo.exe\"\r\n</li><li>Trust exe if prompted \r\n</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0   </p>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong> \u00a0   </p>\n<p>We are charging to download the demo to maintain our trademark for \"The Rusty Sword\", and\u00a0very much appreciate any feedback on the demo from the community. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T14:04:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a0/2a07d66efd52d145cc8c340cd16aec7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Plowgames"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
