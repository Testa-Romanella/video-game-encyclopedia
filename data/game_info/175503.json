Imagine that each person in this room is a member of your family, or your closest friends. Each of them will ask you for help, they are carrying something, and it is heavy. They need you to take it from them. You can take the burden by holding down the letter on the keyboard, that corresponds to the letter on the burden. However it can be difficult to help everyone at once, but you want to try your best, because you love them.</p>\n<p>\"Could you carry this?\" is about the personal experiences of designer Matthew Allen, brought to life with the artistic talent of animator Aidan Solly.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3eb/3ebb78c60c3bd74403c2574d9ee6f295.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matthew Allen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
