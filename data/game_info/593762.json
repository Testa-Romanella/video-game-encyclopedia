{"id": 593762, "slug": "carnage-carnival", "name": "Carnage Carnival", "name_original": "Carnage Carnival", "description": "<p>\u00a0 Carnage Carnival is a 3D survival horror collection game taking place in a haunted carnival.\u00a0 A ghoulish clown is holding the player hostage at his prize booth until the player collects all the prizes.\u00a0 To collect these prizes, the player must complete a variety of levels found within the carnival.\u00a0 Each level contains tickets for the player to pick up, which can then be exchanged for prizes at the prize booth.\u00a0 The levels take place in various different sections of the carnival, such as the\u00a0 maze.\u00a0 Each of them are designed to frighten the player and contain a new mechanic for the player to navigate.\u00a0 The player must collect as many tickets as they can and reach the end of the level before they become too frightened to continue, lest they become trapped in the clown\u2019s carnival.

finish.\u00a0 Each member of our team faced unique challenges and worked to adapt to them to create the best game possible.\u00a0 A few of the things we originally planned on including became increasingly unrealistic as the project progressed.\u00a0 Fortunately, we were able to come up with exciting new replacements for anything we missed.\u00a0 For example, our maze level was originally intended to be a mirror maze.\u00a0 After this idea caused major lag issues for players, the maze was entirely transformed.\u00a0 Instead of mirrors, multicolored walls were used to make every area feel distinct.\u00a0 Mysterious blood stains patterned new places, and startling surprises such as jack-in-the-boxes and moving walls of arms were strategically placed throughout the environment.\u00a0 The maze even saw the addition of new, spinning sections of walls meant to disorient the player and slow them, and even their enemies, down.\u00a0 These changes expanded the maze into something more detailed and complicated than we had originally anticipated.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For every script written for Carnage Carnival, there were several bugs that needed to be worked out.\u00a0 We ran into countless strange errors during development, including things such as boats spinning wildly out of control, ghouls getting stuck inside of walls, players becoming invincible to attacks,\u00a0 and objects falling straight through the floor.\u00a0 Our programming team, Alexandra Barrett and Tabitha Troup, worked tirelessly with help from our producer, Danielle Anders, to fix these errors.\u00a0 From these errors, we learned a number of different things both about Unity and game development as a whole.\u00a0 When it came to Unity, we learned plenty more about collisions, events, culling masks, object instantiation and transformations.\u00a0 When it came to game design, we learned that open communication and teamwork are the best ways to overcome any obstacle in the creation process.\u00a0 Having a reliable team that was dedicated to creating a great project was the major force that allowed us to succeed.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Both of our final two teammates, Jacob Kasparian and Ashley Zimmerman, played large roles in the completion of our game as well.\u00a0 Jacob, our level designer, created the level layouts seen in Carnage Carnival.\u00a0 He planned out impressive areas such as the Haunted House\u2019s meat locker and the sprawling expanse of the Maze.\u00a0 This effectively provided the rest of the team with the game\u2019s backbone, which was then enhanced through code and artwork to breathe life into the gaming experience.\u00a0 Ashley, our artist, provided that artwork as well as the sounds heard in the carnival.\u00a0 Every bone-chilling growl and twisted tune was created by her.\u00a0 Her artwork can be seen on every menu in the game, as well as on the game\u2019s UI.\u00a0 When asked what they learned from this experience, Ashley and Jacob said that time management was a major part of any video game creation.\u00a0 Without properly scheduling due dates and work times, a project can quickly fall apart.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Despite having to cut many of our original plans, such as the rollercoaster level which ended up being more boring than frightening, and spending hours fixing the bugs that arose in this game, we believe our successes outweigh our struggles.\u00a0 There are many portions of this game that we are very proud of that worked better than we had expected them to.\u00a0 A good example of this would be the jumpscares and chain effects from the Haunted House.\u00a0 Testing that level has always been the most exciting part of this game, as many of our jump scares still spook us despite us already knowing that they\u2019re there.\u00a0 We particularly enjoy visiting the theatre and meat locker sections of this level.\u00a0 The jarring disappearance of the restrained Pierro and the gentle jingling of the chains the player can push through always makes our hair stand on end.\u00a0 We believe Carnage Carnival turned out to be a certifiably scary yet fun gaming experience and hope you enjoy playing.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n</p>\n<p>Credits\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Alexandra
