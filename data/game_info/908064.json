All of us in EU have felt the isolation via the lockdowns and the cut from other human beings. This is the isolation some of our fellows feel as DHH in the society for all of their lives.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>PERIEGESIS is aiming to help adults who already are or intending to work in cultural vaults to communicate via visual language with a very large percentage of humanity which includes DHH people. This will not only benefit DHH but also the upskilling of adult workers or adults who want to develop further skills thus having better chances of finding a work. PERIEGESIS is also aiming to bring closer these cultural places to DHH. If museums are to be made attractive to a special target group, this means creating new groups of visitors, and thereby generating more income and more publicity. It is widely accepted that language (in any form -visual or oral) is one of the most important instruments to communicate ideas and feelings.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T09:12:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e1/5e10b793678603af22702ff1de038550.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Challedu- inclusion | games | education"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
