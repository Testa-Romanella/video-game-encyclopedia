The idea of the game is from the 80's, but using modern mechanics such as stealth based AI. The catch is that the lady gets faster and better at seeing you, after you collect each coin, thus making avoiding her harder.</p>\n<p>Try to stay in the dark.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b5/4b5877f59ffc1b5c31964b67f7a855c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["aarreentertainment"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
