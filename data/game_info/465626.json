Sometimes your keys die and you have to press them repeatedly (In that direction) to get them to work. Sometimes your cat jumps on your keyboard and you have to shake your hand (press any key) to shake it off. The goal is to find the banana in the maze. Good luck!</p>\n<p><strong>Developer Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>We wanted to kind of make a game similar to 5 Nights at Freddy's, but while you are playing a game instead of about to die. The cat jumps on your keyboard, your Mom coming in to turn off the computer on you, knocking over a glass of drink. Instead of just pressing keys fast, you would have to look around and click on the things stopping you from your important gameplay. We just kind of ran out of time. We do have the game playing part, and some things messing up your play, so enjoy what we did get in.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T09:31:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6d/e6da5dbb72644836f4333087934e0d94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Caliber Mengsk"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
