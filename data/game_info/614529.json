It was created under the theme of \"Inutil\" (useless). And so our game is quite literally a useless game, with pointless questions. This has graphic representations of gore and moral choices, be warned.</p>\n\n<p>The only thing I've done in this project was strictly the coding, I take no credit for art or narrative or even voice acting.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T07:34:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/544/54444f1658aae48c27ede41b5106d6df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dev-at-work"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
