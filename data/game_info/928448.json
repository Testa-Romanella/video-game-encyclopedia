{"id": 928448, "slug": "demonarium-alpha", "name": "Demonarium - Alpha", "name_original": "Demonarium - Alpha", "description": "<p>Demons prey on the life force of others and Demon Hunters prey on the monsters themselves. In this world, a lonely Demon Hunter of unknown name has done something no other Demon Hunter has done before, and found a way into the realm of the enemy, the Underworld. <br/><br/>Play as the Demon Hunter as you venture deeper into the Underworld to find a way out and potentially, end the menace once and for all.<br/><br/>Demonarium is heavily inspired by Gungeon and The Binding of Isaac and shares similar features, like the somewhat fast paced shooting when entering new rooms, and the search for better items and equipment, however here, the idea is to also consume demons and gain their power, but you'll have to \"regulate\" your corruption VS power balance. <br/><br/>Since it is still a work in progress, many features are subject to change, and content will be added with time.<br/><strong>Current features (as of v2.3 Alpha)</strong><br/>- The tutorial stage (Stage 0)<br/>- The basic layout of stages and Stage 1<br/>- The initial gun for each weapon type (pistol, rifle, shotgun and bow)<br/>- The very basic consumable items<br/>- Power ups (invincibility, one-shot-kill bullets, infinite ammo clip)<br/>- Most necessary systems for the rest to be implemented on top :)<br/><br/><strong>Planned features<br/></strong>- A total of 4 main stages plus a few special/secret stages<br/>- Several consumables with distinct and leveled effects<br/>- Moaaaar guns of each type currently implemented, with unique effects for each<br/>- More distinct enemies on the spawn lists (most enemies will be stage specific)<br/>- Bosses<br/>- COUCH MULTIPLAYER (maybe an online multiplayer also)<br/></p><p>Thank you for looking into the game! Feedback is highly appreciated.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T23:06:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f29/f29280a70112961e608dd8b371266c36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["WentBinaryGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
