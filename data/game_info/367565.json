It's unfortunately\u00a0not as good as my previous entries to the previous iteration of this jam, especially Magician's Assistant but nonetheless, I had fun.</p>\n<p>Wasted most of my time on the map and the opening cinematic and unfortunately didn't have enough time to polish up the gameplay after the cutscene :( Was my first time participating with GameMaker too, it's been a while since I last used it and I'm still not really used to GameMaker Studio 2 so I lost some time messing around with layers and autotiles</p>\n<p>Also available for download is the GameMaker project file for those who want to see the game code.
