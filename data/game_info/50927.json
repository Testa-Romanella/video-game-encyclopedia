The Empire sent an army to investigate, but it was destroyed.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou assume the role of the Envoy, secretly serving the Grimoire Council, and must assemble a small strike team to investigate what is happening, and put a stop to whatever evil is lurking in the Caste of N'Mar.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWith the help of Karen, Queen of the Amazons, you'll need to recruit a team of people, united by a common goal, from all corners of Aravorn.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game plays like a RPG with an innovative social talent system that lets you take advantage of your enemies' personalities. You can bluff, intimidate, coerce and even get a cease fire during some battles. Killing all enemies is no the longer the only option at your disposal.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFour bisexual romance options (Nuala the nomad, Vaeril the fallen druid, Sylrissa and Enok the nagas) and one lesbian romance (Leena the amazon) and one homosexual (Jasper the pirate).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFor the first time in any Winter Wolves game, you can sleep with more than one love interest. Of course, be ready to face any possible consequences! Another innovation is that after you choose your final love interest, you'll also get two more bonus scenes with relative pin-up CG as couple.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game has also a suggestive content option (featuring full nudity in some romance CGs) that can be turned on/off.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/570/57000ea6e03c6b15ba04a6050e70b902.jpg", "website": "http://winterwolves.com/cursedlands.htm", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 11, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 11, "achievements_count": 48, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 419, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Winter Wolves"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Winter Wolves"], "esrb_rating": null}
