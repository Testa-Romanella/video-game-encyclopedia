This VR music experience takes you on a journey to a dreamlike world in space. Experience the song True Believer from the  new rock musical by Rob Rokicki (The Lightning Thief, Monstersongs) &amp; Sarah Beth Pfeifer (The Lightning Thief).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nExperience Marianas is a wild Sapphic rock musical adventure about one woman\u2019s journey to escape an oceanic cult. The piece is a high-octane darkly comedic examination of systems of control and how we struggle to define out identities within them.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEnjoy this ca. 5 min long ride through space and afterwards we invite you to stay a bit longer in this dreamy world if you like. True Believer is still in its workshop and demo phase, but we wanted to share this experience with you and your feedback will be valuable in helping us write the next chapter of this journey.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTrue Believer VR is a collaboration between musical theater and game artists aiming to combine the best of both worlds. We hope you enjoy this short, but with heart created experience, which we hope will be the first of many.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T02:38:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c8/8c87ae4e6b78210c204911632b62e853.jpg", "website": "http://robertrokicki.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DK"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["DK"], "esrb_rating": null}
