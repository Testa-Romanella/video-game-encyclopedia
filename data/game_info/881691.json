This is a local multiplayer game, there is no single-player mode. The game contains 16 levels. <br/><br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nInstructions\r\n \r\n<p>Use the arrow keys to move your cursor.\r\n Press the O button and a direction to place an arrow on the grid. Mice and cats will follow the arrows.\r\n Steer the mice into your rocket (the red or green circle), and steer the cats into your opponent's rocket.\r\n Mice score 1 point, or 50 points for a gold mouse. Cats remove 1/3 of your total score.\r\n The round ends after 3 minutes and then moves to a new random map.\r\n The results of the previous 10 games are shown on the left. <br/></p>\n<p>You can see the button mapping by clicking the little controller icon at the bottom-right of the pico-8 window. The defaults are:</p>\n<p>Player 1 (red)</p>\n<ul><li>Move - arrow keys</li><li>Place arrow - hold the Z or C key then press a direction</li></ul>\n<p>Player 2 (green)</p>\n<ul><li>Move - ESDF</li><li>Place arrow - hold the TAB or W key then press a direction</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li>Press \u2b55 and a direction to place arrows \ud83d\udd3c</li><li>Send \ud83d\udc01 to your \ud83d\ude80</li><li>Send \ud83d\udc08 to your opponent's \ud83d\ude80</li></ul>\r\nSource Code\r\n<p>You can view the source code in the cart on the Lexaloffle BBS here.<br/></p>\n<p>I haven't included the pink mice which spawn random events and don't  plan to. This was made as an exercise to learn Pico-8 and to have some  easy-to-understand code to show to students learning Lua and Pico-8. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T12:25:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e22/e22af5dd2eab3b8f802095c43ce206c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["monoRAIL"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
