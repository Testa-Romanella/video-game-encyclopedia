This theme is expressed in\u00a0both the input and the gameplay.</p>\n<ul><li>The boat moves by pressing the A-S-D-F-J-K-L-; keys, and you get the best results when you sort-of roll through them, cycling the rowers' paddles.</li><li>The gameplay involves the classic idea of video games cycles:\u00a0the obstacles move and become temporarily passable with some regular periodicity.</li></ul>\n<p>The goal of the game is to row your way home, through the gauntlet of obstacles in the lowest time you can manage! Each oar is controlled with one key, one of A-S-D-F-J-K-L-; (the home row on a QWERTY keyboard).</p>\n<p>Rowing is definitely not a simple means of movement, so if you are having trouble getting moving, press V. This turns on vector drawing. The vectors\u00a0correspond to the force from\u00a0each oar's row--hopefully this will help you come up with the rhythm(s) you need to make it home! (Pressing V again will turn off this feature.)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-08T05:13:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/453/453892f388f910d65535eea87e560302.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["epiblitikos"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
