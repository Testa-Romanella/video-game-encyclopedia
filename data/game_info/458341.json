All is not as it seems, however, as depending on which direction <em>Hood</em> faces, the world changes to present different challenges.<br/></p>\n<p>\n<strong>Threshold is currently in development. </strong>We are currently looking for funding to help us continue developing the game. Our current plan is to work on the game when we can, using what funds we can gain from sales here on <em>Itch.io</em> to help fuel our development costs. A <em>Steam Early Access</em> release is also in the works. Itch.io buyers will get <em>Steam</em> keys.</p>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T04:28:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7da/7dae723b4e807320ea7097107b0acc14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["QuadraTron Games", "wampapup", "zenasprime", "QuadraTronGamesLegion"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
