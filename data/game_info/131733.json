Currently there is only one game mode added - \"Adventure\" in which there are no enemies, just you and up-to 4 other players, navigating through the vast maze trying to escape! There is the option to choose your in-game username and also an in-game text chat, in order to communicate with other players.</p><p>There is also the ability to customise your character in-game, (in the multiplayer mode only). Press the 'R' key to change your characters skin. There is a hidden perk for different skins, so keep your eyes open!</p><p>I also added a level unlock system so you now have to work your way through the levels in singleplayer. Don't worry, the levels save after you complete them so if you close the game you won't have to start at the beginning!</p><p>I also added a new AI, this time as-well as having the ability to shoot back at you, you will encounter several units who have armed themselves with shields! These enemies will take an extra shot to defeat!</p><p>A pause menu has also been added (singleplayer only) which allows you to customise a few useful settings.</p><p>And finally, I have added a further 3 levels in singleplayer mode. There is alot more updates coming soon, including the multiplayer 'Slayer' mode and level creation/customisation.</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Color's Labyrinth. I have attached some screenshots to the right of this page.</p><p>If you need any support and/or have any questions, don't hesitate to leave a comment or email me at: raww@thedumbestdinosaur.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b25/b250fd6906944795b044d7a3ad4dca8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Dumbest Dinosaur"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
