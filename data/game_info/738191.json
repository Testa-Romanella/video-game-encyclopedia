Bradley. </p>\n<p>Gameplay is similar in style to Bradley&#39;s earlier Wizardry games. Players control a party of characters through a first-person perspective and fight turn-based combats. Outside of combat, the game is real-time. Characters can join guilds that give exclusive quests, and each character maintains their own individual quest log. Guilds also allow characters to switch classes. Characters can switch classes as many times as they like but can not return to a class once they change from it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T04:00:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31b/31b5199d1ccede3a9d6af71f935626c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 2, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 286, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Heuristic Park"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Activison"], "esrb_rating": null}
