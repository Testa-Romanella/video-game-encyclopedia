No one knew where it came from and no cure could be found; this caused many people to give up on learning magic in fear of losing their life.<br/><br/>Despite this, magic was still an important element and whie there are those who have given up on it, there are a few who continue to practice it. Whether it was for a noble cause, to be rewarded generously with fame and fortune or mere curiosity, magic persisted. Those brave\u2014 some would say, foolish\u2014 individuals were invited to the capital. The Kingdom of Liestrum holds a competition every 15 years to find the strongest magic users and offer them the position of Royal Mage and serve the kingdom.<br/>\n<br/>Many mages join due to the fortune the kingdom offers. You, on the other hand, will be using the Selection as a way to get back to the man who destroyed your life. You'll take everything from him, just like he did to you.\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Features:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>A customizable MC;\r\n</li><li>Choose your gender (male, female, non-binary [also open for trans people]), pronouns (neopronouns are available), personality &amp; appearance\r\n</li><li>Romance 5 different Characters: 3 male, 1 non-binary &amp; 1 gender selectable\r\n</li><li>Learn the truth about the Corruption.\r\n</li><li>Pursue your plans for revenge or forgive those who hurt you once you learn the truth.\r\n</li><li>Be Dirinha's hero or be the villain and let it burn.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Romantic Options:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>The Sun's Warrior[M]</strong>: Prince Alistair Verlice; King Y'ldir's first son and heir to the highest throne in Liestrum.\r\n</li><li><strong>The Moon's Confidant[NB]:</strong>\u00a0Prime Emrys Kintar; King Y'ldir's second born; Liestrum's brightest scholar and a future ruler alongside his siblings.\r\n</li><li><strong>The Star's Adventurer[M]:</strong>\u00a0Prince Paschal Valian; King Y'ldir's adopted son; a future king and the future Scouting Leader of Liestrum's army.\r\n</li><li><strong>The Kingdom's Assassin:[M]</strong>\u00a0Officer Nikolai Melgren; Liestrum's finest warrior, an elite fighter not entirely affiliated with the Liestran army.\r\n</li><li><strong>The Empire's Viper[F/M]:</strong>\u00a0Diviner Seiraya O'lidhren; The former Royal mage; a skilled magic user &amp; aid to King Y'ldir.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Links:</strong></p>\n<p>Tumblr\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T12:54:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af1/af13f9c0da7ff37756491c77af36b1d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nine"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
