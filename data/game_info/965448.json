Its game engine is based on the fan-made Sonic Worlds engine.</p>\n<p>Inspired by the design of the classic Sonic platformers, Sonic Axiom distinguishes itself with fantastic visual aesthetics (albeit many of those modified from pre-existing resources), impressive and diverse level design, and a huge amount of content for a fangame: Three playable characters (Sonic the Hedgehog, Miles &quot;Tails&quot; Prower, and Knuckles the Echidna), eighteen full-fledged levels, nine bosses, and seven original special stages, each with a Chaos Emerald you can collect or ignore.</p>\n<p>Dr. Robotnik is back to his old tricks, turning animals into robots, industrializing pristine environments, and generally making a mess of things. Are you a bad enough &#39;hog to teach him a lesson?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-25T15:11:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c7/7c72e3b1ef5f61e3bdaec9b30da7b3f0.jpg", "website": "https://gamejolt.com/games/sonic-axiom/194688", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 184, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
