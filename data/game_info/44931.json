Progress in the Club and don\u2019t forget its number one rule: do not interact with the spied specimens. Do Not Feed the Monkeys.<br />\nBrowse social networks, wikis, websites, newspapers, online stores\u2026 and use chat and email tools. Once you\u2019ve got information about the spied people\u2026 will you intercede in the name of justice, will you sabotage their dreams, or will you sit idly by while the world burns?<br />\nWhatever you do (or don\u2019t do) will have consequences!<br />\nMONITOR hacked surveillance cameras<br />\nPRY INTO the lives of dozens of subjects<br />\nINTERACT (or not!) with fun, sad, horrific, surprising, dramatic, or sci-fi themed narratives<br />\nDECIDE THE FATE of the subjects: will you help them? Will you expose their most intimate secrets?<br />\nBROWSE social networks profiles, wikis, websites, newspapers, online stores... Use chat logs, email tools and more!<br />\nMANAGE your resources: will you spend all your savings on buying more \u201ccages\u201d, or will pay rent? Are you healthy enough to work? How many sleepless nights can you stand before collapsing from exhaustion?<br />\nREPLAY to experience different climactic endings<br />\n&quot;The Primate Observation Club\u201d is not a wildlife conservation society as the name would suggest. It is a front for a shadowy group used to watch others through surveillance cameras and compromised webcams. Tired of your ramshackle apartment, dull existence and boring jobs, you\u2019re accepted into the exclusive organization, so you can pry into the privacy of the \u201ccaged monkeys\u201d as they go about their lives\u2026<br />\nThe Club urges you to not interfere with those observed, though you need to progress in it to access the mythical \u201cBig Primate Cage\u201d. But... will you resist? Will you help those you\u2019re spying on, extort them, expose them, or will you follow instructions and just watch?<br />\nWhatever you decide to do, or not do, there will be consequences!<br />\nDo Not Feed the Monkeys includes a little of uncensored pixelated violence and pixelated nudity. It might not be suitable for younger players or photo-realistic nudity lovers.</p>", "metacritic": 77, "released": "2018-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-11T21:43:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cef/cef4e36ef6ecf82f9e36e32fb0f9c612.jpg", "website": "https://donotfeedthemonkeys.com/", "rating": 3.87, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 137, "owned": 1389, "beaten": 148, "toplay": 43, "dropped": 70, "playing": 23}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 91, "ratings_count": 209, "suggestions_count": 242, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 211, "platforms": ["Linux", "Android", "PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One", "PC", "macOS", "iOS"], "developers": ["Alawar Entertainment", "Fictiorama Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Alawar Entertainment", "Alawar Premium", "BadLand Publishing"], "esrb_rating": null}
