The fire brigade must extinguish several fires as fast as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBut it's also very nice to just drive around and make stunts and drifts in the 'free drive'.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWorld Records (best rounds, fastest jumps) get saved online.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach vehicle has an onboard camera so you can drive or fly where ever you want (in the radius of the transmitter). The camera can be toggled on and off  or switched to a 3rd person view on the vehicle.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt's easy to use and you just need 5 keys to play the game: W,A,S,D or cursor keys to drive and E to enter/exit a vehicle!<br/>\r\nTo fly a plane you additionally use the mouse.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are more keys for additional functions like horn, light, flip a vehicle, toggle the camera and some others and you can easily learn these keys by pressing F1.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRC Fun City is a pure singleplayer game for children from 6-106 years :)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e6/7e68b0898bbee60c14aa2a480243489a.jpg", "website": "http://www.agger-interactive.de/rc", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 345, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Lotte|EoD"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Sports", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Agger Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
