I couldn't think of any responses to the prompt that were interesting enough to me. I had thought that the prompt required you to be a villain, but it only says you are not The Hero.\u00a0So I ended up making a game where you assist a hero.</p>\n<p>This was the first time I tried 3d animations. My hope had been to emulate the dead cells appearance\u00a0 (needs more lighting to get closer). Rather, it began looking like Donkey Kong Country. That's a great art style, but not what I wanted. I tried moving away from that style by scaling down the sprites.</p>\n<p>I'll try getting into sound for my next game jam.</p>\r\nIn conclusion\r\n<p>It's honestly in pretty rough shape at the moment. Thank you for taking the time to play my game! Any feedback would <strong>greatly appreciated</strong>!!!</p>\n\n\n<p>Resources:</p>\n<p>Medieval font for main menu -\u00a0https://fonts.google.com/specimen/MedievalSharp?query=medieval</p>\n<p>Balsamiq Sans for all other text -\u00a0https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Balsamiq+Sans?query=balsami</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-24T07:46:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf8/bf8225bb5e0568a103608871c3622c85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jerbaloot"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
