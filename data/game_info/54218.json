{"id": 54218, "slug": "somari", "name": "Somari", "name_original": "Somari", "description": "<p>Somari is a side-scrolling platform video game, originally released in 1994 for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). An unlicensed port of Sega&#39;s 1991 Sega Genesis game Sonic the Hedgehog, the game was sold primarily around Asia, Russia, and other regions where pirate NES cartridges were distributed. Like the original, players venture to defeat the mad scientist Doctor Robotnik, who plots to turn the animal population of the fictional South Island into evil robots. Unlike the original, the game features Nintendo&#39;s mascot Mario as the main character rather than Sonic. The title is a portmanteau of &quot;Sonic&quot; and &quot;Mario&quot;.<br />\nSomari was developed by the homebrew developer Hummer Team. Very little is known about the game&#39;s origins; it is theorized to have been based upon extracted source code from the original game and its sequel that was back-ported to the NES. The title has caught the attention of contemporary video game journalists, who have commented upon its accurate recreation of the original game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-03T09:15:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/133/133772cc8b4ec47ccfef25f7666407fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 251, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["NES"], "developers": ["Hummer Team", "Dendy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": ["Ge De Industry Co."], "esrb_rating": null}
