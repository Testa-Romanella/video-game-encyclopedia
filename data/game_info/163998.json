I do not want to keep this experience to myself and I'll be happy to help out and advise any developer who needs some help or inspiration.</p><p><strong>Tips:</strong></p><p>Don't walk off the edge, I did not place colliders in this build and you will not be teleported back up. You'll have to restart the scene.</p><p>There's literally nothing to do besides walking, picking up the bow, shooting arrows and watching them despawn. Don't set your expectations too high.</p><p><strong>Known Bugs:</strong></p><p>You can often spawn arrows without reaching behind your back due to a collision issue with the 'Quiver Volume'</p><p>When an arrow ricochets and the normal is not equal to the upwards vector, the arrow will not ricochet but keep its velocity</p><p>Arrows can sometimes clip through the ground due to wrong values in my raycast hit detection</p><p>The controller turn black sometimes, no idea why this happens, guess I'll have to make black the default color :P</p><p>When pressing the right touchpad during decelerating you will get a short speed boost</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ef/2ef806b728decc817c66dd71e8bc4397.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["degrees"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
