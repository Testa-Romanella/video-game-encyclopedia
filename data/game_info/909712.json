Are the bunnies doomed to be prey to the space cats? Or will they find some way to escape their destiny? Their fate lies in your hands.</p>\n<p>There are 4 evolutions of bunnies:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li><em>Normal bunnies</em>\u00a0\u2013 need you to harvest carrots for them. If there is a sufficient surplus, the bunnies will breed like \u2026 well, you know.\r\n</li><li><em>Smarter bunnies</em>\u00a0\u2013 can use tools, which make them more productive. You will still need to harvest carrots and ore from the mines for them.\r\n</li><li><em>Autonomous bunnies</em>\u00a0\u2013 can harvest carrots and make tools for themselves. But you control the proportion of bunnies that work on carrots and mining.\r\n</li><li><em>Sentient bunnies</em>\u00a0\u2013 can perform research. Researching can lead to a new civilization level, which boosts productivity and improves the productivity of all future tools.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Notes:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>The graphs are all log graphs, which means that constant linear increases look like they plateau.\r\n</li><li>Mining and research at higher levels requires more and more bunnies.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Also, a hint for the end:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>One way to get to the highest civilization level is to set research to about 10% (and equal levels of carrots and mining) and then leaving it there until you mine one big mega tool. After that, you\u2019ll see a population explosion and you won\u2019t need any more tools.\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T20:24:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e07/e07cca37b2659286e61557a75820fe51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MachWerx"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
