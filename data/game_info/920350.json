{"id": 920350, "slug": "underroot", "name": "Underroot", "name_original": "Underroot", "description": "<p>Underroot is a turn-based RPG game about defeating enemies and discovering why many of Memphis' icons are underground and controlled by mysterious figures. The turn-based combat happens simultaneously, as you enter the commands you want your party to make, and then after all decisions are made all the actions happen at once. There is also a \"Track Combat\" system: Each player exists in a lane and whenever they enter a \"season\" in their lane they get buffed, rebuffed, or damaged based on the season.\r\n</p>\n<p>Underroot was made for the 2023 GGJ. I used the theme: root, to refer to my own roots i.e. the city of Memphis (the various seasons happening at random times, the city memes like Basspro shop pyramid being mid, Elvis being a thief, and the tap water being mythical). The game was developed solo and made in Unity Engine 2021. It features artwork made using Midjourney and edited by myself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T10:27:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/131/131a84059cb043dc08583f80d5c51bb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KindSpark"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
