They could lift more, move farther, and didn't tire. But now, thanks to the power of teleportation, technology will soon replace technology and the human worker will once again become the staple of warehouse operations.</p>\n<p>This Sokoban style puzzle game tasks the player with reorganizing various warehouse storage units with the help of a new teleportation gun. This tool will swap the player's position with any crate they are in line with, thus allowing for great organization speed. However, thanks to some ongoing maintenance and some displeased robots, today's shift may not be so simple.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T22:28:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66f/66f6a9fe9401576717a6c3a450554a9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["QUGDDT"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
