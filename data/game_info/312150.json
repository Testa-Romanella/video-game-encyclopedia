The game is pretty casual and easy at the beginning but later it gets quite difficult. You have separate commands for left and right boot and with that, you will be able to maneuver and overcome all obstacles.</p>\n<p>Rocket boots is side scroller action platformer specifically made for mobile, the character is controlled with only 2 buttons and thus eliminating drawbacks of mobile controls. I believe this to be a nice combination of retro arcade game and mobile platformer.</p>\n<p>This is my first game so I hope guys like it, as a first-time indie game developer any comment or feedback is most welcome, feel free to send me an email at zatomat@gmail.com or come to my discord channel https://discord.gg/nFtd3h7.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/320/32070cb509d130ca2dd37f635b987c49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["zatomat"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
