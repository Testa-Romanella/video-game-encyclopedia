Use the arrow keys to turn around and drive forward and backward. When you encounter an enemy tank use the space bar to shoot a bullet. Bonuses like better weapons and life will appear for a short time so drive fast to collect them. You score points by destroying enemy tanks. During the games events will be spawned in random places on the map. The events usually will appear for a limited time and then disappear. The more you survive the invasion, the changes of getting good events go down, while the changes of getting bad events go up. Therefore, eventually you meet your demise.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T04:31:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c83/c8372ab335c71a9a7c34e2720f57018b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cheer"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["cheer"], "esrb_rating": null}
