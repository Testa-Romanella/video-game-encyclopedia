A tribute to Conway's <em>Game of Life</em>.<br/></p>\n<p>The <strong>game's objective</strong> is to keep alive as many people and viruses as you can while also maintaining a balance between population and free spaces. :open_mouth: <br/>In order to do this, you'll need to use the given resources (placed in the top right corner of the screen) and deploy them on the board. When you use a resource, the next one pops up.</p>\n<p>People age, and eventually die. When two people are next to each other they have some chance to breed. When a healthy person is close to an infected one there is some possibility that it gets infected.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong><br/>- Hospital: When an infected person steps on it, the hospital disappears and the infected person is cured.</p>\n<p>- Infector: When a healthy person steps on it, the infector disappears and the person is infected.</p>\n<p>- Quarantine wall: People cannot move through a quarantine wall (thus, you cannot set a wall over a person). Beware, because wall occupy free spaces. Use them to make quarantine zones.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T08:52:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ca/3cabbb1f34bd6440c0fb1eca3c132791.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["ALFXogo"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
