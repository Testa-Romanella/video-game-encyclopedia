The game uses a LUT to simulate red green colorblindness in a game where those are the only colors and players need to use the menu by pressing P key to adjust the visuals to perform better in the game and turn down any distracting overly loud audio.\u00a0 For research purposes, try one playthrough without using menu and see how long it takes and how many game overs you get before winning. Then try with the menu and note how long it takes before you win.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Survey Link once game is completed: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScidBWHhpUfk1eT8IqJDQOcZN1K5C5xsZ56Txh5...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T10:11:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c1/4c1f31c2d7219b25179167c96fe7cb4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Itiswhatitis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
