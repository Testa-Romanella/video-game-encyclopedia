Players go down in battle bunkers deep underground to kill to kill. Every man for himself or a team of killers versus a horde of mutants. Local multiplay, singleplay, online highscores and lots of unnecessary violence.</p>\n<p>What makes Kill2Kill unique is the 45 degrees auto-aim mechanic. Characters aim at their closest enemy automatically, but only as far as the best of 8 directions. This way players can fully focus on their movement and further develop tactics.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f03/f032e695843121ab3c2c83c51ce5cd14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Keeweed"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
