This short game centres around filling the dowry trunk; only after the trunk is full can a\u00a0girl marry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Set in a mysterious time and place, the <strong>horror inspired</strong>\u00a0story is the beginning in a series of projects set in this folkloric\u00a0land.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Full Disclaimer</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game is still <em>Work-in-Progress</em>. The story can be finished, but it lacks proper texts, a better narrative and polish on the 'cinematic'. However, this should not stop you from enjoying a good game experience that's <strong>mostly</strong> bug free.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you have any feedback on the game, please <strong>rate &amp; review</strong> so that we can take into account any of your thoughts and ideas. We'd love to develop this game with your help. :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-30T05:05:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab1/ab1157ee6a12c222f2208dedb6b877a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Cosmic"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
