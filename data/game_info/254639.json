The player will use the different abilities granted by the gods<br/>\r\nto make his way between enemies, and make it<br/>\r\nthrough the various traps and puzzles that comprise the pyramid.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach year, while the mortal world is oblivious to it, the gods of ancient<br/>\r\ncivilizations celebrate a reality show in which a champion, chosen at random<br/>\r\nfrom among humans, must pass a series of tests without even being aware of<br/>\r\nparticipating in a Divine Reality Show.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPeter Buttinson, an insignificant security guard, frustrated with his work at the<br/>\r\nNatural History Museum in London, has been awarded the golden ticket in a box of<br/>\r\ncereals, and the prize is to visit the Great Pyramid of Egypt.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUpon reaching the pyramid he discovers Anubis and Bastet, in charge of organizing<br/>\r\nthe tournament. They present him with the challenge of crossing the pyramid and<br/>\r\nreaching the deepest part of it, and in return, they will grant him the wish he wants.<br/>\r\nWithout informing him that he is really going to be a simple puppet in the scheme<br/>\r\nthey have set up. Peter, who dreams of being a true adventurer, accepts the challenge<br/>\r\nwithout hesitation.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAlthough the two gods had worked out this plan together, they disagreed on only one<br/>\r\nthing: Bastet believed that it was perfectly possible for a human to succeed in<br/>\r\ncrossing the entire pyramid, while Anubis believed otherwise. So, Bastet will help<br/>\r\nPeter by giving him a powerful bracelet that he can use to invoke some of the powers<br/>\r\nof the goddess. On the contrary, Anubis will try by all means to prevent Peter from<br/>\r\nsuccessfully completing the tests and leaving the Great Pyramid.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWill he be able to reach a place on the podium of heroes?", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:52:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21e/21eb5f53b1fcdd8594c28c2eecac95d1.jpg", "website": "https://www.esat.es", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 461, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ESAT", "Mighty Papaya"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ESAT"], "esrb_rating": null}
