{"id": 585984, "slug": "skbn", "name": "SKBN", "name_original": "SKBN", "description": "<p>SKBN is a sokoban clone called SKBN. The 128kB ROM contains the 1043 levels of the Microban and Sasquatch collections by David W. Skinner, as well as the 139 levels of the Dimitry &amp; Yorick and Sokogen-990602 collections by Jacques Duthen.<br/></p>\n<p> In this project, I focused mostly on making sure that all levels in those sets would be playable, even large ones.<br/> <br/> To achieve this, the engine supports different tile sizes: 24x24, 16x16, 12x12, 8x8 and 4x4. The 12x12 engine was the most challenging, as the two grids of 8x8 tiles (native) and 12x12 tiles (virtual) create interesting complications, combining vertical and/or horizontal splits. The required tiles are built on-the-fly while displaying and playing the level.<br/> <br/> The 4x4 engine is useful for previews, but also for very large levels. But those may not be very playable unless you use an emulator or an RGB-connected display.<br/> <br/> The in-game menu has options to undo a move or the last push. The history can hold 1000 moves.<br/> <br/> Of course, solving more than 1000 levels in one session is unthinkable (probably) so the completion status of the levels is saved in battery-backed SRAM, or directly on flash, if the game is running on a compatible design such the raphnet-tech reprogrammable cartridges.</p>\n<p>This game was a smspower.org competition entry in 2021: https://www.smspower.org/forums/18409-CodingCompetition2021SKBNByRaphnet<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T11:46:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c04/c0462f8dcc9ffbb4e95e3fdb5026fa5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["raphnet"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
