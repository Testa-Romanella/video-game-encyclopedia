You will need to use the envirement to your advantage. Once defeated you will be able to choose if the creature should be banished or invited to live with you. If you choose to invite them, they will settle close to you and work with you to build a settlement.</p>\n<p>(This is the idea for the game, the current version is limited because i used the jam to build all the systems like two save and load systems and the battle system. All the ground work is done and systems are ready to be optimized along with adding more characters and building the village system.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T11:18:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/615/6151b885d6328d1e079d1991984858e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gamingturtle"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
