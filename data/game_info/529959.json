I had a lot of fun making this, and hopefully you can wring a few minutes of fun out of this, too. At the end of the day, it's literally just a maze game. Or maybe a pac-man clone if pac-man wasn't eating and the ghosts were all on steroids and merged into a single, terrifying demon.\u00a0<br/><br/>The music is thanks to Patrick de Arteaga, under Creative Commons license.
