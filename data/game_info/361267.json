This is a tank game where you can only move on one axis. Coincidentally, you can also control your tank using only one hand (you only need to use the arrow keys). It has a very arcade-like feel to it, hence the name. It is possible to play against a friend or play solo against endless enemies.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>Player 1: Left/Right arrow keys to move, up/down arrow keys to shoot.</p>\n<p>Player 2: A/D to move, W/S to shoot.</p>\n<p>Press Enter or Spacebar to select on menus.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:49", "background_image": "https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzIzNTE3NjcucG5n/original/fxU13r.png", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["buskerdog"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
