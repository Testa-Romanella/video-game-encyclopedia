Your goal is to establish a beachhead by building an interdimensional portal for your armies waiting to cross over. Once you arrive on Earth, your team discovers that building a portal will be harder than first thought - You will need to explore these unknown lands for resources, research technology to adapt to the new conditions, conduct ground missions, deploy interceptor craft to take out enemy aircraft, build and grow your bases and more. All while remaining concealed from Humans as much as possible.</p>\n<p>Features</p>\n<ul><li>20 territory locations to capture with procedurally allocated mission types.</li><li>9 Mission types with approx. 30 objective types.</li><li>Command and control your operations from the globalscape. Launch missions, deploy interceptors, build bases, tap into resources and raid enemy resources. Speed-up or pause game time with play controls.</li><li>Auto or manual missions - Once your craft reaches a mission location, you can select \u2018Auto\u2019 or \u2018Manual\u2019 mission. Auto allows you to delegate the mission and stay focused on the Gameboard. While Manual mission will launch the isometric combat game mode.\u00a0</li><li>Territory expansion - Grow your territory by sending your dropships to explore locked regions &amp; new mission types. Choose the best times and locations to explore as it ties up your dropships, preventing them from being deployed on missions.\u00a0</li><li>Craft waypoints - You can set waypoints for your craft to follow - a great way to avoid a region that is hostile to you.\u00a0</li><li>Card-deck approach to craft management with a limit of 8 craft: Dropships (Mission deployment), interceptors (patrol skies or attack enemy craft) and supply craft (resource collection via refineries and resource veins)</li><li>Heavy resource management - Gained via missions, resource veins and the marketplace.</li><li>Craft upgrades - the order in which you add upgrades to your craft will change how they affect that craft. The wiki page outlines all the possible combinations (there\u2019s a lot)\u00a0</li><li>Human processing - Convert captured Humans into food, power cells or followers to help you build your portal.\u00a0</li><li>Research tech tree - A full research tree, some with prerequisites requiring item/intel collection on combat missions or other projects to unlock. Many unlock new facilities or advancements. Players need to complete research to progress to the end-game.</li><li>Build and grow bases - Expand base operations by building new facilities, manage power demands and enable/disable facilities when power consumption outstrips production. Sell facilities. Operate up to 3 bases.</li><li>Isometric \u2018action\u2019 missions</li><li>Assets are uncompressed for modding. These are NOT final, will be working on these with the community - join in the conversation on Discord.</li></ul>\n<p>Developer Notes:\u00a0</p>\n<p>The goal of this game is to be the invading/aggressive party trying to invade Earth. I have always wanted to recreate X-Com but make some significant strategic changes to put a greater focus on the strategy outside of the combat phase.\u00a0 You will also find there are elements of card deck games - not too heavy but enough to help with strategic planning.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I have left the sprites and audio in readable formats so you can mod them, send me screenshots/videos\u00a0 I\u2019d love to see what you come up with. Also the mission outcomes and other items are logged in text files, which could help determine better balancing. Depending on interest, I\u2019ll be exposing the configurations for modding - it is no small task so I\u2019d like to know if it would be used before delving into it.</p>\n<p>Creating a game of this depth takes a lot of time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Take a look at my feature roadmap, which outlines planned features still to come - depending on your feedback! https://retributioncomics.com/scars-of-seven-video-games-pre-alpha-launch/</p>\n\n<p>Update:</p>\n<p>4K disabled - causes weird crashes - need to investigate.
