They believe that this will solve all of the world's environmental problems, and so they steal a time machine and travel back in time to try to tear down your machine.  The goal is to shoot the hippies with your cannon before they reach your generator.</p><p>This is my entry for the Ludum Dare 36 Compo, which means that every single part of the game (art, coding, sound effects, music) had to be made by one person in 48 hours.
