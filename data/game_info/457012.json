You have to choose the opportune time to switch between ships.</p>\n<p>For each wave of enemy, your defence force is tasked with holding off the enemy\u00a0until Asteria orbits into the radiation from the systems pulsar star, which renders the enemy ship inert.<br/></p>\r\nHow long can you hold off\u00a0<em>The Rusts</em>?\u00a0\r\n\n\n\n<p>It has been 600 years since<em> the Rusts</em>\u00a0first appeared above Earthen skys blocking out the sun as their biomechanical ships decended. What originaly drew<em> the Rusts</em>\u00a0to Earth was unclear but what was clear, they were going to exploit our resources, Mankind included.</p>\n<p>All it took for humanity to finally band together at one was an alien artificial intelligence\u00a0occupation force. For 200 years, humanity fought against\u00a0<em>the Rusts\u00a0</em>while secretly working on a last ditch effort,\u00a0<strong><em>The Asteria Initative.\u00a0</em></strong>Develop tech which would allow a small colony ship to escape Earth and rebuild in the Perseus star system.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The only snag in their plan was how to ensure humanities ships were not rendered inert from the pulsar stars radiation bursts.\u00a0 Scientists finally discovered a way in which ships could alter its phase for a short time, so theoretically, the radiation burst would be harmless <em>(but there was no way to praticially test it from Earth)</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>70 years later the colony ship was launched with 500 people\u00a0to the planet of Asteria. After 300 years, Asteria colony was founded.\u00a0Asteria was to be humanities last place of hope against\u00a0<em>the Rusts.\u00a0</em>Knowing that the pulsar star would hide them for some time, the colony made sure to make the most of this time. Building homes, getting defences ready and manufactoring ships capable of with standing the radiation of the pulsar star.</p>\n<p>30 years passed before\u00a0<em>the Rusts</em> finally found Asteria. Now it is time to defend this planet you now call home. Your task, hold off\u00a0<em>the Rust</em> forces until the planet makes its revolution through the Pulsar radiation.\u00a0</p><p>Nicole Sijnja - Art, UI, Programming</p><p>Time Oliver - Sound, Programming</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T02:42:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbc/cbcd8f3b0bb18224d93133340972b902.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Cheese Kittea"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
