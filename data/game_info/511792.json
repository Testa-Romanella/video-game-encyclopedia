In the truest sense, these are games for slot machines, or ported from them to other platforms. But over time, the definition of this genre has become more vague and now almost any game in which there is a fast gameplay can be called arcade, in which there is practically no plot, many lives or the opportunity to revive.<br/>The game is easy to control.
