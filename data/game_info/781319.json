This is the first game me and my team ever made so any feedback is welcome.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Goal of the game: Collect all 3 orbs in each level while escaping the rising lava that is about to swallow you. If you have all 3 orbs collected you can go through the portal at the very top of the level and advance onto the next level. There are 6 levels (two lava, two poison and two ice levels).</p>\n<p>The controls: A and D to move and SPACE to jump. You can double jump and wall jump also.</p>\n<p>Hope you have fun let me know if you completed it :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T17:52:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f4/3f411f7b5f9467cdca80d72efb3e78f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Phearo"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
