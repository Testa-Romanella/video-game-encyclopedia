It'll drain your funds (starting from 4). Luckily you can clean that stuff.</p>\n<p>-- buttons --</p>\n<p>What do they all do?</p>\n<ul><li>* '^^^': Hide audio controls.<br/>* Drain: The water will rise, then you'll have to drain. A little or a lot? Well, it'll cost you!<br/>* Pump: Not planning to swim? You better pump. A bit or a barrel? You'll have to pay.<br/>* Clean: Toxic goop galore. The funds'll run out this way! A bit of cleaning doesn't hurt... except in your wallet. But better now than later!<br/>* '||': Pauses the game, but not the audio.</li></ul>\n<p>-- camera --</p>\n<p>As an extra treat, you can move the camera anywhere you want (non-euclidean space exempt from this offer).</p>\n<p>* w,s,a,d: Controls as normal (sort of).

If shift is enabled, it rolls just like in the game over screen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T02:29:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/010/010ce0d41aa54f3c2b06262d13b659c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["remco"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
