The project started in September. Some of us bought the Oculus Rift and we were very interested in this technology that's why we choose to make an Oculus Rift game. We are aware that tons of technical demos are created each month by the community and we wanted to use our knowledge in Game Design to create a game with real gameplay, not a technical demo. That was our first priority.<br/><br/>We are part-time students, some of us have an internship so we work on the game when we have free time and when we are at school. Moreover we are aiming for a short game. (about 15min)</p><p>You can download the game, but you may not be able to play it. You need an Oculus CV1</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b2/9b2d287d78c5e59d7bece64aa471fa80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fangh"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
