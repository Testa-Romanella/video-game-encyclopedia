So you won't actually be able to help the cat escape because this is a reverse infinite-runner game. The cat moves on its own and the player manages the board by placing and removing tiles. Keep the cat running for as long as you can to beat your high score! But beware, the cat might wander down an unfortunate path, so you will need to react to its choices as well as plan your actions.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab9/ab9d8a5b5addaeba608426c3135eaa00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["phdang1"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
