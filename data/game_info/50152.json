This hot pile of garbage!  Enjoy a mishmash of random ideas that have popped in my head over the past decade, shoved into a 2D-Platforming game!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlay as the heroic Super Bugman, a uhhh blue thing that is completely average and stomp your enemies, or play as other characters (*when you unlock them) who have other abilities!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWell, it's a game!  Jump, pick stuff up, place it down, throw onions, and use special abilities.  Play through the (non-existent) Story Mode, have fun in Creative Mode, tackle the Procedural generated Chaos levels, and even design your own levels in the level editor.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70a/70a092b1d93926171565c65ea01a8132.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SyKoHPaTh"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SyKoHPaTh"], "esrb_rating": null}
