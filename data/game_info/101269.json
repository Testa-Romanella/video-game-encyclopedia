Watch out for skulls, the trade off for playing more / expensive cards! Weapon cards will up your strength until you attack (clicking the wheel or going past the yellow notch), while spells and items will affect characters right away. Try to kill as many enemies as you can!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T11:39:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/633/633ad3b7def8f87ea10afa9c9a2b5c36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nik_sg"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
