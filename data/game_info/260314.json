Try to clear the whole board in each of these fun Mahjong challenges. <br/><br/>Play Mahjong in a bamboo forest, the deep sea, or in fantasy realms. Or forget about settings entirely and focus instead on tile design itself with the monochromatic or doggy-themed games. <br/><br/>Perhaps the layout is more your thing. Tap away at stacks shaped like animals, tiny monsters, or abstract patterns. There are also special varieties of the game that include matches that must be made across different-colored tiles. <br/><br/>Even better: this classic board game will help you strengthen your analytical skills while you also improve your mental dexterity.<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>- Well-design levels<br/><br/>- Play with hints &amp; rematch help<br/><br/>- Addicting play &amp; time killer", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:59:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abe/abe5e1edd347d3ced63fd0a1344d4ba9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Xuehui Wu"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Xuehui Wu"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
