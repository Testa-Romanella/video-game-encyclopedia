I've been working on it since 2016 but I've mostly been tackling technical things, and creating a framework for all the content I have planned. In its current state the game is fairly shallow, more a proof of concept than anything, but I now have a solid base to build more mechanics on. I'm working on the game by myself alongside a full-time (non-gamedev) job.<br/></p>\n<p>The exact end result I want to achieve is still very much in planning \u2014 the things I'm most decided on in the game are the kinds of emotions I want to evoke in players. Wonder, excitement, the sense of exploring an unknown world, gaining more confidence as you journey through a varied landscape. The rest will unfold as I go.<br/></p>\n<p>I intend to keep the game free as long as it's in alpha \u2014 foreseeably, a year or two at the very least. <strong>Donations welcome!</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>PS: Yes, there's a way to get rid of ghosts. </em>\u00a0\ud83d\udc7b</p>\n<strong>Get email alerts for new Way Beyond releases</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79c/79c6919c72449b003b751cf70ae47630.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["B\u00e1lint Magyar"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
