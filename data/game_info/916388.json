I need some really puzzly/mathy/Rubik's-Cube-thinking people to check it out.</p>\n<p>This is a browser game to be played with a mouse.\u00a0Click the tiles to try and match them all to the same color. Toggle a few different music tracks (or muted), animated background or none, 'pixel' or 'glossy' graphics style.</p>\n<p>To be honest, this might be more of a proof-of-concept (just an idea I had) than something that's<em> actually fun to play</em>, but here it is for people to try in any case.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T16:04:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fa/3faf53f59c3a22df861d7790854460de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TinyBookshelf"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
