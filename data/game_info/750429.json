It&#39;s virtual scat porn. It&#39;s gross, offensive, and meant to elicit strong feelings that range from disgust to amazement. It is not meant to be used to incite hatred against a religion. It is meant as a statement of free speech absolutism, refuting the idea that any religious, historical or political figure should enjoy protected status above that of everyone else. Defacto rules born of fear that limit criticism of an idea or person only serve to increase resentment toward that idea or person. I refuse to be part of that cycle of hate.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-13T10:17:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/562/5623f926f8cb17dfd465c5fbb06124e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.67, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 15, "toplay": 11, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
