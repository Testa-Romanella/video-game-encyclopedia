Quite a regular dude, but a nice guy. He likes to go out at night with some friends, grab a beer, do a little partying. He\u2019s also into skateboarding, playing video games, and eventually catching a movie at the theaters, especially super hero movies. Had a couple of girlfriends, but right now he\u2019s not in a relationship, just dating a girl he met at a friend\u2019s birthday. Actually, Bruce does not have a lot of free time, since he works as an assistant at Circle 9\u2019s HR department. A job he is certainly not very found of\u2026\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt's a Long Way To the Top (If You Wanna Be a CEO) is a modern 2D platformer, a dystopian adventure set in a corporation, all done in pixel art and with a nostalgic 80s / 90s vibe. Through level repetition mechanics and skill building, you will face some very gnarly corporate enemies, chit-chat with some secretaries, and find out that not all is as it seems. Sounds pretty crazy? Well, you can bet that working at Circle 9 is not quite normal!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n* Rogue-lite adventure in a contemporary dystopian setting<br/>\r\n* Innovative game dynamics, with exclusive get-hit-to-earn mechanic<br/>\r\n* Wholesome, home-made pixel art visual<br/>\r\n* Immersive sound effects", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-12T10:46:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43f/43f008e7cbcc805172c934e5bf41055d.jpg", "website": "http://monstercrossingstudio.com/#itsalongway", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Monster Crossing Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Monster Crossing Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
