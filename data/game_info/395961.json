{"id": 395961, "slug": "ghostris", "name": "Ghostris", "name_original": "Ghostris", "description": "<p>My entry for the 35th GMC Jam, Ghostris is a puzzle game where the blocks you place down are haunted and will do stuff behind your back as you try to clear lines. You need to think not just about how to match up blocks, but also how to deal with the blocks' movement patterns, and react to ghosts showing up to interfere with your puzzling. Sometimes the wandering pieces create chain reactions saving you from certain doom, other times a piece moves into your way at the last second,\u00a0preventing you from setting off that combo you set up.</p>\n<p>Can you survive the Ghostris? Can you figure out the way to deal with the many curses raining from above? Can you even get enough lines to increase the speed even once? Ghostris is not for the faint of heart - player beware, you're in for a scare!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-02T04:55:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5a/a5a39169444da779d8cf7ee21f2a2663.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yal"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
