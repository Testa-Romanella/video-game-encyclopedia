The theme was \"Non-Competitive Games\".<br/><br/>Click on the grid to add dust to the room. Spend dirty dollars to purchase various room messy-fiers!\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>Post Jam Thoughts</strong><br/>I wanted to use some kind of algorithm to drive the main gameplay loop, so I used cellular automata with just a few very simple rules to add visual interest to the game. Otherwise, the rest of the game is nothing fantastic code wise\u00a0and absolutely disgusting in some parts. That being said the amount of refactoring I\u00a0would need to do for the code to be clean I don't think is too much.\u00a0<br/><br/>The design of the project is pretty solid, with a strong foundation laid out. Other than limited replay-ability due to lacking content, I think the core gameplay loop is cookie-clicker adjacent, with some different, in my opinion, more interesting visuals.\u00a0<br/><br/>All assets made by me, made in Unity.\u00a0<br/><br/>Code:\u00a0https://github.com/ShoujiKanenobu/messyclicker</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T08:17:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0dc/0dc97b51ca336eb3d89c52f0aa11eba6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Shouji"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
