This means, <br/>you as a player, have to navigate through a maze of bullets with not <br/>just one, but two ships at a time! Good luck!</em></p>\r\nStory\u00a0Setting\r\n<p>In the game, you play as two of your favorite seacreatures. SquidFace is a young and adventurous squid who isn't afraid of getting into trouble.
