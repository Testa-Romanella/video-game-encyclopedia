I was inspired by how similar my emotions felt between the roguelike and battle royale genres. The search for items, the unknown encounters around each corner, and the hunger clock- be it a enclosing ring or a dwindling food supply- are shared by both genres and form a very similar core to me. I wanted to explore that more by bringing some of the battle royale mechanics into a roguelike. Hope you enjoyed!</p>\n<p>Follow me on Twitter at @IAmSlogo or comment here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-15T04:10:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e61/e6159016f4b414201b5c9363639f766b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Slogo"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
