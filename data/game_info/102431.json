Select Chris the vampire for an exploration of (non-sexual) intimacy through magical means, or Suzanne the werewolf for more physical but playful cuddles.</p><p>Suzanne can be selected as a sexual partner near the beginning of the game but be aware that this is a purely cosmetic option.\u00a0It only changes a few sentences and the additional options it reveals in her route are unselectable. While I originally planned to add a sexual path with Suzanne\u00a0to the game, I have decided to put it aside because I feel like the game already accomplishes its goal, and sex scenes wouldn't particuarly add much to the themes at this point. I also wish to focus my efforts on newer projects, or older ones that do not yet achieve their goal in their current form.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4a/c4a56fbba4db295b33a5bcb76c20c7e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Suryce"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
