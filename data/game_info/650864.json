Each night you are given a list of things to fix, and it is your job to fix them... and then escape the monsters that haunt the arcade. Each night you receive a note with a list of things to fix, and then you must move around the arcade fixing those things while evading the arcade's 5 mascots to try to escape with your life for 6 nights straight. Armed with nothing but a flashlight and the tools to fix the electronics that break, you're in for a tough night, and a life of reoccurring nightmares, or no life at all.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T14:13:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20d/20d667cc8b994267ef72739adcab17b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Derpynoob"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Derpynoob"], "esrb_rating": null}
