Your goal is to survive battle after battle and heal your party members. When it's Shedinn's turn, press the Up or Down arrow keys to move the action cursor, and press the Right arrow key to select the action. Press the Left arrow key to return to a previous menu.</p>\n<p>Feel free to share your high scores with me. :)</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>My five friends, including the DM, for the characters they made and played during our fun campaign.</p>\n<p>The developers of Godot, a really cool game engine that allowed me to make this.</p>\n<p>#arcade #rpg #retro #survival #strategy</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T07:55:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/596/596ed64c49658f5090683d176402210b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gildrop"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
