Have about 12 player animations done, but could only get 7 in to actually work so the game is really unfinished.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tJust a few clicks exist at the moment and it plays out by itself so nothing really to do at the moment. Can click head, back, rod, trophy and fish. Will fix up this week after work if I get the chance to add all the rest in and actually give the player more options.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tUpdated with more animations and I've changed the layout a bit more. Also added sounds.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/972/9726c8c69761daf04f9c991058b9bfa6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Franklin's Ghost"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
