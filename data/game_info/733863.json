The game is like a 3D bullet hell. The ship has two speeds and flying at a more sedate speed reveals the blue coloured asteroids in the field, while going faster reveals the red asteroids in the field. You can hit any sort of asteroid at any time so knowing when you should be switching is key.\u00a0</p>\n<p>At the start of the game, and whenever you hit an asteroid, you will be set to an even slower penalty speed but you will be able to see all obstacles during the cooldown time, before transitioning back to the slow speed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Race against yourself and friends to set the fastest time. I know a ship that can make it in under 12 parsecs.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Space -\u00a0\u00a0to switch between slow and fast speeds\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Escape - Pause screen with controls\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Backspace (while paused only) - exit game\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>WASD - strafe to dodge asteroids</strong>\n</p><p>Credits:</p><p>Programming: Daniel Korsah, Paulius Bieksa</p><p>Music: Paulius Bieksa</p><p>Foley: Daniel Korsah</p><p>Models: Ebal Studios (Modular Spaceships), Mark\u00a0Dion (Asteroids Pack)</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T08:22:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d9/0d9c5d0dc8217571fdbea8db0e131642.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rocketman Dan"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
