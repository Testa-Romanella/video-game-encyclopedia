In Thinker, the Tajilis Empire is faced with a real threat after years as the greatest empire of the Triangulum. Robots with advanced AI can rebel against the empire and begin to steal money from King Nathanael. Fearful of losing his sovereignty, Nathanael sends one of his soldiers, known as the Thinker, who will aim to save the empire from the robotic threat. The Thinker will have to get the access keys of the robots so that Tajilis manages to remain sovereign in the Triangulum. But the keys are well protected by the robots, so only a thinker would be able to recover them. What's up? would you be able to save the Tajilis empire? If he can, he will be remembered forever as a hero, as a legend and, of course, a THINKER. What are you waiting for? Let's save the empire!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-19T04:42:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f52/f5268b54c946b89e23511090e3e0b73c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matinho"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
