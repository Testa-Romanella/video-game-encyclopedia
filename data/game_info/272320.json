You play mini golf as a wizard trapped in a dungeon while avoiding deadly traps and fighting off monsters. The game was inspired from our childhood. The long and the short of the story is they don't let you whack things with a putter in real life, so we made this game. The game will continue to be underdevelopment so expect future updates!\u00a0We hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Programmer/Designer- Brian Pangburn</p>\n<p>Artist- Chris Pangburn</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/200/200a917288b4642206e43ce4aa42d397.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["theamazingb"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
