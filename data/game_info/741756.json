The plot is entirely made up by me.</p>\n<p>Plot:<br />\nIn the small hamlet of Elkedor lives the Baker family, isolated and almost &#39;&#39;inexistent&#39;&#39; for the townsfolk. Arold, family man and lawyer with no fame, enters in a difficult time of his life between alcoholism and a falling apart marriage. His days began getting filled by drinking more and more, while his wife and their two children, Sarah and Thomas, started to get detached and cold. One night the two went missing. Desperate at the thought of losing them he decided to investigate until, thanks to clues found in the house, succeeds in finding a hidden passage. Lies, compulsions, and hatred are the summary of what underlies in the ambitious Baker family.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T04:15:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b7/2b7b58640e9b42aa853ca3771941c03f.jpg", "website": "https://rpgmaker.net/games/10289/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
