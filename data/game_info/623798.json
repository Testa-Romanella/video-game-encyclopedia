Do you still play with blocks? We're not here to judge. In fact quite the contrary! We want to feed that deep desire to bust block structures apart and you don't even need to clean up afterwards!<br/></p>\n<p>In this game you play as a toy car on a table top  where you can collect stars to get a high score or just drive for fun and demolish structures. <br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n\n<p><em>A small project created by two students for a 4 week long analytics based assignment.
