You can shout, yell, scream at your minions and it works! I mean that they become even more angry, deal more damage and start act like a total fools... Well, sometimes it's not the best way out because ability to recrut more minions is limited. Better take care of them. <br/><br/>During the game you will find lots of random items that will allow you to improve your army. Thanks to them you will be able to change your poor little servants into machines of destruction!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6f/a6f274d4fc1d328ef02a306d44a29e5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 264, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Undead Army"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Undead Army"], "esrb_rating": null}
