You need to click on cells to turn them 90 degrees clockwise, and let the mouse empty rows (eat a piece of cheese in each one) for the empty row to disappear. The row vanishes as the mouse leaves it. New rows keep falling down. As soon as they fill the board, the game is finished. That's all.</p>\n<p>To compete against other players, click the menu button, enter a player name and\u00a0 password.\u00a0When the game is finished, you'll see the top players' list.
