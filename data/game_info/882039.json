You play as the Captain, a daredevil psychopath that lives for the thrill of the kill and the need for speed. As the Captain you want to clear the levels as fast as you can and with as much lethality as you can. Points and score is awarded for completing levels fast and with a higher body count comes a higher score and rating. So grab some guns, put on your sneakers and jump into the chaotic city found in TRAWL.<br/></p>\n<p>Greeble Team:<br/>Dunstan Dalin - Programmer<br/>Ashley Rickett - Programmer<br/>Leroy Moore - Artist<br/>Toby McLatchie - Artist<br/>Fraser Craill - Artist<br/>Paige Williams - Artist<br/>Joshua Strother - Artist</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T14:55:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb1/cb1176fe941cf89f0affc555dff24b5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Greeble"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
