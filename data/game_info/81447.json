It allows you to draw a second time!   Play Video Poker \u2013 three hands at a time!  Place your wager, 1 to 5 credits for each hand, then tap \"Deal\". Select the cards you want to keep and tap \"Draw\" and as expected, you'll draw new cards for each hand.  Now, here's the twist. If you want, you can draw the cards again! That's right, draw a second time!  You'll have to pay the same amount as your original wager and you'll have to give up whatever winnings you won on the first draw. But, any winnings from the second draw you keep! So, if you have 4 cards to a Royal Flush, you can draw again to try to get it!
