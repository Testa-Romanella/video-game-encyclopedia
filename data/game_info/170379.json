(Paune, neonima, Anna)", "description": "<p><strong>KNOWN BUG: THE CENTRE OF THE BUTTONS IN THE ANSWER SECTION FOR BOTH THE SHRINK AND HIS PATIENTS\u00a0DO NOT WORK FOR AN UNKNOWN REASON, PLEASE CLICK ON THE SIDES OF THE BUTTONS AND ALL WILL BE WELL! THANK YOU</strong></p><p><strong>PLEASE DO DOWNLOAD THE SERVER AS EXPLAINED BELOW IN ORDER TO PLAY</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Game synopsis:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Invite a friend to play as you impersonate a shrink and his patient for a rather unorthodox exchange: while the shrink attempts to find out about his patient's\u00a0hidden secrets, the patient will do whatever they can to keep him from doing so using strategy... are you ready to outsmart the shrink?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Game instructions:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Once connected to another player, your character will be randomly assigned to you: you'll either be the shrink, or one of his patients. If you are a patient, you will be provided with a short bio of your character, and then you will have\u00a05 elements that will act as clues that you give to the shrink about yourself. You can choose the order in which you submit those clues, and the trick is to think strategically so as not to arouse suspicions: all these correspond to\u00a0hidden secrets that you don't want the shrink to find out about!\u00a0Once a clue has been sent to the shrink, he will be presented with 3 options: only one corresponds to his patient's secret!\u00a0After all 5 clues have been presented to him and he has made a guess for each, he will be shown 3 different patient bio: once again, only\u00a0one corresponds to his patient. He wins by picking the right one, otherwise the patient wins! You can play over and over\u00a0to get better and impersonate all the characters!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Game status:</strong></p>\n<p>This is a playable version of the game, although it will be continued and finished after the jam. At the moment the player can impersonate 3 characters: the shrink, patient n\u00b01 and patient n\u00b02, but more patients will be added in the future!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong>\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><em>Developer:</em>\u00a0Vincent Gschwend (vincent@crypta.li ; @necronima on Twitter)</p>\n<p><em>Artist:</em> Anna Brookman (cabochongames@gmail.com ;\u00a0cabochongames.wixsite.com/home/portfolio)<br/></p>\n<p><em>Composer:</em> Pauline Julien (paunesstrings@gmail.com ; paunesstrings on Instagram)</p>\n<p><em>Game Designer:</em> Vincent Gschwend,\u00a0Pauline Julien &amp; Anna Brookman</p>\n<p><em>Texts:</em> Pauline Julien, Vincent Gschwend &amp; Anna Brookman</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/341/34179801367f89064d908668d7fd30f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Anna", "Paune", "neonima"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
