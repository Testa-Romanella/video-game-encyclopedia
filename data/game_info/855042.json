You'll see a grey \"Fullscreen button\" on the bottom right. Click it to enter full screen. While on fullscreen, click on the button again to exit back to windowed mode.</em>\n<p>As you probably know,\u00a0window_set_fullscreen()\u00a0does not work on HTML5. So\u00a0\u00a0after searching online,\u00a0I\u00a0basically <strong>copy/pasted </strong>a small Javascript code for a GMS1 extension found\u00a0in this forum post (full credit to the original author),\u00a0 in order\u00a0to create a button that is added on top of the game canvas (I\u00a0chose the bottom right corner but you can change that on the provided script), that lets you\u00a0toggle full screen on or off.\u00a0 Check out the demo \"game\" above.</p>\n<p>By the way, the itch.io option to include a fullscreen button makes the browser full screen but does not actually scale the canvas.</p>\n<p>I also added a small utility function,\u00a0 to check whether the game is in full screen that works cross-platform, including HTML5.</p>\n<p>I included a button sprite, but obviously you can change that to whatever you want.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>\n<p>Tested on GameMaker 2022.8+ (uses a \u00a0call_later\u00a0 call) on current versions of Opera GX, Chrome and Edge. Firefox does not seem to work as expected. Provided as is -\u00a0expect little to no support, hopefully you won't need it :)</p>\n<p>I also included the demo GameMaker project if you want/need, on a separate file.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T11:17:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/178/178722686e9654e26492cd218b7d8c5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["manta ray"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
