Her easygoing accent is one of her traits.<br/><br/>Used to do everything at the Yuuki household; especially cooking in which she excelled at. She also used to wake up Makoto, Iori, and, whenever she stayed over, Matsuri.<br/><br/>To Iori, she was her guardian. To Makoto, his caretaker. <br/><br/>Wished to someday get back at Makoto for all his teasing.Iori Yuzuki<br/><br/>Iori is Makoto\u2019s childhood friend, who used to live together with him, and is also one year his senior. Putting it nicely, she is an older \u201clittle sister.\u201d Otherwise, an absolute good-for-nothing. She liked being pampered by Makoto and, much to his chagrin, acted like a big sister too. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t forget your carrots, okay? Here, I\u2019ll give you mine too.\u201d <br/><br/>Used to drink a glass of lemon juice, together with Makoto, every night before going to sleep. Always adding three spoonfuls of sugar.Matsuri Amachi<br/><br/>Matsuri is Makoto\u2019s childhood friend and has had a love/hate relationship with him since forever. Same age as Makoto and always barges into his room through the window.<br/><br/>Despite her wish to be treated differently, Matsuri would always whine whenever her friends left her alone. She is moody, cheerful, daring at times, and somewhat popular due to her shy nature around strangers. Despite her antagonistic relationship with Makoto, she would always go along with his pranks. \u201cThe point is, it\u2019ll be all right if we don\u2019t get caught. We\u2019re playing a prank on them, after all.\u201dArisa Yuki<br/><br/>Makoto\u2019s classmate. A \u201cchildhood friend\u201d that yearned to become a real childhood friend. A quiet, delicate girl with pale skin like that of snow, and a well proportioned face like that of a doll. Liked to read books by the window during breaks. Everyone thought of her as an unapproachable, yet beautiful, girl though she wasn\u2019t aware of it.<br/><br/>Due to a long-term hospitalization, she lost touch with people her age. However, even if she wanted to hold a conversation with them, she would get nervous, become unable to speak, and would flee in a panic. Her voice would be as low as a whisper, and one wouldn\u2019t be able to make it out unless they were but a breath away.<br/><br/>Before being hospitalized, she would rely on Makoto since they were friends. But by the time she was discharged, not only was he cold towards her, but he also completely forgot about her. Unable to depend on him any longer, she decided not to forgive him until he apologized. Though she was weak to Makoto\u2019s smile, needing only one to completely forgive him.<br/><br/>She wished to be a childhood friend in the same way Makoto, Iori, Matsuri, and Nono are.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:53:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c15/c15b87c27d81c50970afda277c4b3721.jpg", "website": "https://solpress.co/projects/yotsunoha", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 474, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hiqosoft"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Sol Press"], "esrb_rating": null}
