{"id": 451426, "slug": "temporal-worlds", "name": "Temporal Worlds", "name_original": "Temporal Worlds", "description": "<p>NOTE: Do not open the Instructions menu when the game is paused. There is a bug that needs resolving. To see the instructions, go to the Main Menu.</p>\n<p>Temporal Worlds is a third person adventure game. Unfortunately, you might encounter a few bugs &amp; the combat system is not polished yet. But even then, it is very fun &amp; challenging to play. Make sure to read the instructions before playing.\u00a0Good Luck!</p>\n<p>Summary:</p>\n<p>You are in a strange dimension consisting of 4 different worlds with a sun dial in between. A temporal Orb governs these worlds and it changes into a different mode every 10 seconds.<br/>Each world has it's own dangers &amp; secrets. Certain orb-modes might make a world very dangerous while others might bring out the tyranny.<br/>To win the game, you need to find and beat 3 Time Titans in 3 different worlds &amp; gather the temporal elements from each of them. Armed with the elements, return to the sun dial through the central portals and interact with the pedestal to finish the game.<br/>Keep in mind that once you start the game &amp; use a portal to enter a world, you won't be able to return back to the central sun dial until you have all the time elements &amp; you can only travel between the 4 worlds using portals.<br/></p>\n<p>Made By:<br/>Gustavo Sanchez<br/>Yash Agrawal<br/>Badr \"Ghostie\" Wael<br/>Bruno Szwajcowski</p>\n<p>Badr's Portfolio:<br/>https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1qNpt430eGDzmbJi0M9SZbqx-YJANNsPn</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T06:40:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7b/e7be91a85a9b0ba95fc03758f2fbfb5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EZ 4"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Fighting", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
