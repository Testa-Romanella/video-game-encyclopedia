While it is very simple, the project allowed me to work on some of my C# skills and create a fun little clicker in the vain of Cookie Clicker but with a spooky twist.</p>\n<p>You must keep clicking to keep gaining followers and sacrificing those followers to gain even more followers. See how many followers you can get for your Vampire cult!</p>\n<p>Check out my portfolio at www.broccolibay.co.uk</p>\n<p>Hope this little game can get you in the spooky season mood!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T07:50:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c2/3c26cbd75dcacd06970dc9c9c4507aea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DonkeyKiin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
