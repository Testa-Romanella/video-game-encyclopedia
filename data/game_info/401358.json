The theme of the jam was \"Death is Good.\" To go in accordance with the theme, the player does not loose when they die, but rather they are given faster firing and more enemies to kill. This allows the Player to collect \"souls\" from enemies quicker, filling the player's \"soul meter\" and increasing their overall score. The catch is that\u00a0whenever the player shoots, their \"soul meter\" depletes. When it reaches 0 it's game over.\u00a0This means the player can't die to many times, or else they won't be able to handle the power given to them as they would deplete their soul to quickly!<br/></p>\n<p>Other Team Members:\u00a0<br/>https://nerfherder.itch.io/ -- Co-Developer: We worked together to build the project<br/>https://dampos.itch.io/ -- Sound: Created music, assisted with sound effects<br/>Marth -- A homie that merely uttered the words:\u00a0\"Reference me in there some how.\"<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0Here's his discord server:\u00a0https://discord.gg/famdid<br/> </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-27T03:45:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae0/ae09caf05365b4ff6f12b511f2cc0f44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lukefrisbee"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
