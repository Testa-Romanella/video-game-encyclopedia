{"id": 624621, "slug": "danganronpa-revive", "name": "Danganronpa: REVIVE", "name_original": "Danganronpa: REVIVE", "description": "DANGANRONPA: REVIVE\r\n|| WEBSITE ||\r\n<p>A Danganronpa fangame, consisting of an original cast, plot, and world that is completely separated from any of the DR canon (you really don't need to know anything about DR to play this!). Only borrowing the most basic concept; wacky murder game involving ultimate students from the <em>Talent Program</em>.</p>\nSTORY\r\n<p>You're following the story of Lu, a 21 year old sweetheart who got accepted into the prestigious\u00a0Talent Program<em>\u00a0</em>as the Ultimate Relationship Councilor &lt;3\u00a0</p>\n<p>She finds herself\u00a0at the Monoco Resort and Casino, a fancy retreat that was booked by the INCREDIBLY generous Talent Program for a Super Special Program; all for a special group of 17 students! How lucky are they!</p>\n<p>The Super Special Program is meant to be the\u00a0most fun and most educational trip of the students' lives! One that happens to have an indefinite ending date, whoops! More time to learn, live and love alongside your brand new friends!</p>\n<p>Buuuut, if a student\u00a0<em>happens\u00a0</em>to want to graduate earlier and leave, they\u2019ll have to prove themself through a graduation project; kill one of your classmates and get away with it. We\u2019ll see if anyone can actually pull it off, or maybe they\u2019ll all live in harmony in a fancy resort for the rest of their lives. And that doesn\u2019t sound so bad!\u00a0<em>Does it?</em><br/></p>\n<p>*One of the many deviations from the DR canon is this is a college-esque program, so all students are adults.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nMore Info\r\n<p>This is very much a personal project of mine. I'm a team of one with a job, and will be working on this casually on and off. I will try to update with chapters as I create them, but I can't promise any timeline. This will probably take several years to create.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I have however already come up with the entire story!\u00a0It's just a matter of programming, writing dialogue, and creating SO MUCH art, lol.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you'd like updates, I post on my twitter accounts with news about the game (@_mememimi_) or I have a website for this game that I'll keep up to date with more info!
