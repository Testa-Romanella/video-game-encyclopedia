Naturally, I decided to make a game with only those two systems and nothing more. I suppose, though, that this makes it more of a procedural puzzle game than a roguelike. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Either way, it's here for you to enjoy some roguelike-style item identification with the pressure of a hunger clock.</p>\n\n<p>Feedback is always appreciated:</p>\n<p>Twitter: @highsodiumgames</p>\n<p>Email: highsodiumgames@gmail.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afc/afc358ae4320d22f1a3decc92480c36a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["High Sodium Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
