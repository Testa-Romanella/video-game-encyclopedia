You will never stop running in the game as you\r\nare always moving at a set speed, the game only has two controls one which\r\nallows you to jump and another that lets you change which direction you are\r\nrunning. Both controls let you dodge and avoid the oncoming obstacles, changing\r\ndirection back and forward in one spot does not count towards the distance run\r\nonly when you are moving right the score in which you run will increase. When\r\nyou progress to the right the map will fall behind you so you can\u2019t go back.\r\nDuring the game the gravity will change back and forward which allows for so\r\nunique experiences. To sum up Ninja runner is a game which you will have to\r\nkeep playing to learn the new obstacles and learn when to jump and change direction\r\nto get as far as you possibly can, if you do make it to the end a mini game\r\nawaits.  </p><p><strong>Key Features: \r\n</strong></p><p>8 different obstacles</p><p>Fast nonstop gameplay</p><p>Game Gravity changes</p><p>Mini game</p><p>Multiple control\r\nsettings</p><p><strong>Release date: </strong>24/06/2014</p><p><strong>Platform: </strong>PC</p><p><strong>Price:</strong>\r\nFree</p><p><strong>Contact information:</strong></p><p><strong>Email:</strong>ninjarunnergame@gmail.com</p><p><strong>Company: </strong>Silver\r\nSoul Gaming</p><p><strong>Website: </strong>www.silversoulgaming.com</p><p><strong>Twitter: </strong><strong>www.</strong>twitter.com/SilverSoulORG</p><p><strong>Personal Info: </strong></p><p><strong>Name:</strong>\r\nDavid Dale </p><p><strong>Country:</strong>\r\nNew Zealand</p><p><strong>Bio: </strong>I\r\nrecently started a bachelor course at Media Design School and within the first\r\ntwo weeks they gave me the chance to make my first game so I decided to make\r\nthe game Ninja Runner. Ninja Runner is a game that I created for the people\r\nthat like fast paced games because in Ninja Runner you can\u2019t stop moving, it\u2019s\r\na game that requires some patience and time to master as the more you play the\r\nfurther you will get in the game. When I made Ninja Runner I wanted it to be\r\nfun but also be a game that\u2019s not beatable within a minute or two, that\u2019s why I\r\nmade it a difficult to beat the game and get a far distance so when people do\r\nget far the can have bragging rights over other people as well as their\r\nfriends. </p><p>If enough people give positive feedback to the game I would most likely make a polished version of\r\nthe graphics as well as adding in multiple levels from easy to extreme and\r\npossible add a story to the game.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e2/6e2432b6e3270192ea2d34e2ae763642.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DAVO"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
