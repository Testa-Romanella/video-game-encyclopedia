BIG POTENTIAL.</strong><br/><br/>When the size of the digital world hits a breaking point, the Great User orders the evil Executors to commence its deletion. You are Paak, a digital mecha-elephant who uses his trunk to vacuum and compress junk. A well respected \"Compactor\", he has made enough space for his people to live in despite their inexplicably bad junk hoarding problem.<br/><br/>Now in the face of deletion, you must use those same skills to compress the world around you and take it to safety. Float, hover and flip around the world as you search for junk to compress. Use the space made by the compression to make yourself bigger, allowing you to compress larger objects! Then, swap between your huge powerful uncompressed size, and your small, nimble compressed size to get through the less-than-spacious world.<br/><br/>This game is suitable for all ages, is relatively short and easy, and has animated cutscenes for the start and end.<br/><br/>A project built with Unreal Engine 4, made for the <em>2021 Epic MegaJam</em>. The theme of the jam is \"Running Out of Space\". All aspects of the game (gameplay, levels, models, textures, music, cinematics, animations, sound effects) were made completely solo by me from scratch during the 7 day period, in a panicked rush.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T06:22:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ef/6ef6d5a9b5ed714b2d58d9bd7030178d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rowanmmc"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
