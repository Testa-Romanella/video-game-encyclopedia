To make it easy for me.</strong></li><li><strong>Re-do the game logo...</strong></li><li><strong><strong>Add all 14 girls to the plot. With their events, scenes, quests, and story. (The game will have more girls than 14.)</strong></strong></li><li><strong>Re-insert Elizabeth, Ari, and Leticia</strong></li><li><strong>Re-make Leticia.</strong></li><li><strong>A real inventory system.</strong></li><li><strong>A real market.</strong></li><li><strong>Re-design the quest window. (Title, descriptions, etc.)</strong></li><li><strong>Re-made from scratch the contracts.</strong></li><li><strong>Add weekend events and rainy days!</strong></li><li><strong>Make RPG-Like player jobs!</strong></li><li><strong>Interactive NPC's</strong></li><li><strong>Training girls system.</strong></li><li><strong>Change notifications to POP-UPS</strong></li><li><strong>First 6 girls to level 10. The others 9 to level 5.</strong></li><li><strong>Nerf the events. (In v0.0.1, the girl's events are \"from the future\". I want the player to see at least 5 or 6 story events BEFORE being able to unlock the lewd scenes/events.)</strong></li><li><strong>If patreon is doing good, hire an artist to change the GUI entirely.</strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong>This is all what I want to do for v0.1.0. If something is left at the moment of the update, it will be added eventually.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>To keep track of the next big update, join the DISCORD.\u00a0 There's a channel where you can see which of these ideas I'm working on. And in which I already finished.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T02:07:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33d/33dc826dd33fe9327a948748d64ce7e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.2, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 10, "toplay": 4, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 10, "suggestions_count": 232, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["komisari"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
