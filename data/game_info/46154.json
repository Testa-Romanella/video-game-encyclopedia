Explore a randomly generated miniature board world that unfolds before you as you roll dice and move around to explore. <br/><br/>Seek out shops where you'll find cards to buy, special services for hire and chests of loot to plunder. Remember, always shop before you steal! <br/><br/><br/>Raid Dungeons, where coins are a plenty, but deadly hazards are just as numerous. Here you will go up against your rivals who can defend the dungeon operating the traps while you attempt to loot its treasures. <br/><br/><br/>Don't get caught! Play your hand of cards strategically or buy favors from the local inhabitants to avoid the guards and other players as you work your way back to the thieves hideout.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T03:34:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/f83/f836e2e12978c67b80e7805c55550064.jpg", "website": "https://www.lightfingersgame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 348, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "PC"], "developers": ["Numizmatic", "Numizmatic Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Numizmatic", "Numizmatic Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
