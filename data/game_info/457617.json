{"id": 457617, "slug": "komrog", "name": "Komrog", "name_original": "Komrog", "description": "<p><em>Komrog is a project\u00a0done by 6 people within\u00a02 months, during my first year of study. Keep in mind it is a work-in-progress!</em><br/></p>\n<p>You play as a \"hero\" who must save his region from the threat of a dungeon that has appeared. The aim of the game will therefore be to climb into this dungeon and reach the final boss without dying.</p>\n<p>The enemies are only sensitive to one weapon, which is in your possession at the start of the game. This unique weapon will have to be improved over the stages.</p>\n<p>To do so, it is possible to fight enemies and the boss in a pre-dungeon but also in another dungeon where you can partly control the location of the rooms on each floor when entering it.</p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>An evolving weapon :</strong> throughout your adventure you can find items to improve the statistics of your weapon.</li><li><strong>Different waves of enemies :</strong> in\u00a0a room, you may find yourself fighting\u00a0a succession of up to 5 waves of different enemies.</li><li><strong>2 types of dungeon :</strong> you can find 2 types of dungeon : a premade one and a randomly generated one.\n<ul><li><strong>The former's shape is set and can't be changed.</strong></li><li><strong>The later is half randomly created, and half generated by you :</strong> you control how\u00a0the dungeon generates while keeping a random game. To do so, you must choose a path on a grid which determines the dungeon's shape. Depending on the colors of the boxes and the list, the different premade rooms will mix and transform to bring great diversity.\u00a0 It allows you to choose how you want to build your dungeon and also brings a strategic side to the game. Be careful though! The rooms number is random and likely to be limited.</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n<p>Oste : Game Art</p>\n<p>Lymann :\u00a0Game Art</p>\n<p>Sir_Lazz : Game Art</p>\n<p>Goost : Coding</p>\n<p>Milo :\u00a0Coding</p>\n<p>Narrako : Coding<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T05:01:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78a/78a3e313ca95b070042e0a3b6b56c140.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Narrako"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
