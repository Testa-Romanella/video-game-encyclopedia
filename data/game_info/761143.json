Gravity Well is a puzzle platformer where you maneuver around levels to a goal by manipulating and rotating segments of the environment around you. Made slowly over a month or two.\u00a0 Probably still has a few bugs including a super laggy level 7 and missing level 15 but other than that its a pretty finished concept I'm happy with for now!<br/></p>\n<p>May one day soon elaborate and create a more convoluted game out of this idea now that I'm more comfortable with C# and Unity!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-28T07:45:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/798/7987fe783fd379108f530234df971b4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SakuraCrowned"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
