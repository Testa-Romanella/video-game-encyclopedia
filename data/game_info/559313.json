Actually I lost motivation to continue fixing various bugs but I'm still proud of it given the fact that it took me a week to make. It's called Aquamarine but the color doesn't match up, it's stupid, but I didn't have any other ideas and this name sounds cool if you don't think about what it means. Anyways, it's a one minute experience but it does the job and fits with the jam's theme. It has no sounds whatsoever, sadly. I hope you enjoy it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T05:26:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8f/f8f746ac1ed1ee6fbe65efd0c1068b72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jfredd"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
