This is a submission for\u00a0Narrative Game Jam, where you have 11 days to build a narrative experience. Initially, I thought of a story about a penguin traversing between layers of dreams (via either sleeping, or playing a song on the gramophone which would wake him up from the current dream), but decided to go with this simple story due to time constraint.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy Sleepless, despite the lack of any interesting narrative. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>The background music used is called Waves made by FrenchyBoy. You should check them out.
