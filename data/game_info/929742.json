Once you have caught the human run to the hole without hitting any other zombies if you do you will drop the zombie and be stunned for a short amount of time and the zombie will run away. Once you get to the hole walk up to the edge and you will automatically drop the zombie into the hole gaining you 100 points. Repeat this until the time runs out. Try and get as many points as possible and try to beat your high score.\u00a0Good Luck.</p>\n<p>Credits<br/></p>\n<p>All made by Tiny_Tree.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T12:31:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d0/8d0cd903b7d252ec1a7fce113a6612c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tiny_Tree"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
