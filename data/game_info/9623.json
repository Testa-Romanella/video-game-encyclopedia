{"id": 9623, "slug": "heavy-metal-machines", "name": "Heavy Metal Machines", "name_original": "Heavy Metal Machines", "description": "<p>Heavy Metal Machines is a free-to-play multiplayer action racing game developed by Hoplon. The game is heavily influenced by the classic Rock n&#39; Roll Racing and more modern titles, such as Rocket League, Twisted Metal and the whole genre of MOBAs.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The players are free to choose from several characters to play the game. Each one of them has their own backstory and reasons behind their decision to participate in the event.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The players control the heavily modified vehicles with guns installed on them. The objective of the game is to steal a bomb, that is located in the center of the arena and get it to the enemies base to destroy it. </p>\n<p>Upon picking up the bomb, the player holding it has to ride around the whole perimeter of the arena and avoid destruction by the enemy forces. The player can be assisted in his efforts of bringing the bomb to the enemy base by their teammates that can cover the bomb carrier. </p>\n<p>Each character present in the game (there are more than ten characters in the game&#39;s roster) has not only their own backstory, but a specific vehicle that differs in handling, gameplay, and most importantly, its role. Like in most MOBAs, there are several player roles: a tank, who pushes through the enemies front lines; a support, who heals and buffs the team; a defender, who stays behind and defends their base by any means necessary.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:49:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/014/014ae85f986cd956574d8904da227907.jpg", "website": "http://www.heavymetalmachines.com", "rating": 2.12, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 54, "owned": 1324, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 45, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 40, "ratings_count": 85, "suggestions_count": 531, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 85, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["Hoplon"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Sports", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hoplon"], "esrb_rating": null}
