Think \u201cProp Hunt meets Red Light, Green Light\u201d.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Play with your friends, from 2 to 12 players ! One mouse and keyboard only !</strong> One player controls the human - the other players can spawn up to 11 mimics amongst the furniture, at any moment in game !</p>\n<p><strong>The human </strong>has three arrows to eliminate all the mimics : they only get refunded if a mimic is killed by the shot. He wins if all the spawned mimics are dead. But no more arrows, and he\u2019s done for !</p>\n<p><strong>The mimics</strong> have to get close enough to the human to lunge and devour him. As in Red Light, Green Light, the human player has to close his eyes (in real life!) during the mimics\u2019 turn : they can then move freely without being spotted. During the human\u2019s turn, they can still move and try to eat the player, but at the expense of being seen. You get to choose whether safe or cocky is the best strategy ! Baiting tactics are killer though. All mimics win if the human is eaten - but the player who devoured him gets to play human next !</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS :</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Human player :</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Left click</strong> to go somewhere</p>\n<p><strong>Right click </strong>to shoot somewhere</p>\n<p><strong>Mimic player :</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Arrows scheme </strong>to spawn a mimic and control it</p>\n<p><strong>Double-tap an arrow</strong>\u00a0 to lunge towards the player</p>\n\n<p><strong>/!\\ WARNING /!\\</strong></p>\n<p>Keyboard ghosting prevents inputs from being detected if there are too many at once.
