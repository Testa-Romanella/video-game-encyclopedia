Did Achilles always know he was meant to be a hero? Or Hector, or Susano, or so many who came before them or followed after? The truth is, we will never know. What we do know for sure is that Achilles didn\u2019t curb his instincts nor did he hide behind that infamous heel.<br/><br/>Enough of mythology - you know you are a hero but sometimes our daily heroics are just not fancy enough. Try this game out to just get a taste of heroics we all revere. A fireman risking his life to save people from fire and fumes, a rescue worker working tirelessly to get people out of harm\u2019s way, a police helicopter team putting their lives on line to rescue flood affectees. We\u2019ve all appreciated the way they help us and sometimes even dreamt about being one of those guys.<br/><br/>So what are you waiting for - we\u2019ve got work to do. Save all the people who need your help and give yourself a pat on the back.<br/><br/>We have our eyes and ears open for any feedback or comments that you guys have about the game and we\u2019d love to hear back from you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T11:17:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e5/0e59d75a6ea70765d9c6d62c77636bdf_IbAJlaR.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["elinx technologies"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["elinx technologies"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
