One night you were staring at the moon and decided to make your dream come true. You have heard of tales from the Elders and decided to embark on a journey to find the long lost spaceship that your ancestors has once used to travel to space.</p>\n<p>As you travel the world looking for the long lost spaceship, you notice how dissonance the world was becoming. It wasn't like it was before. But you didn't let it bother you as you got closer to your dream.</p>\n<p><strong>[INFO]</strong></p>\n<p>Following this prototype; We decided to use Love2D due to their excellent documentation and a lot of resources. We are still thinking of continuing this sometime next year due to us not able to implement all the features that we wanted (sound, monsters, collecting bones).</p>\n<p><strong>The game is unfinished!! Please play with caution. This is just a tech demo of an idea we are working on.\u00a0 If you make it to the end you'll see a nice animation cut scene.\u00a0Thanks!</strong></p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, thank you everyone for playing our ridiculous and terrible games! We have improved a lot since last year!</p>\n<p>Team: (same team from Homeward Bound)</p>\n<p>Nikki X - Main Programmer<br/>Matt S - Level Design/Coder<br/>Mei S - Art<br/></p>\n<p><strong>[ART CREDIT]</strong></p>\n<p>For this game we used many free assets and therefore would like to give credit to the artists.</p>\n<p>Frozen Forest and Wasteland Tilesets: Quintino Pixels<br/>Town and Jungle Tilesets and Yeti: Open Pixel Project<br/>Desert Boss(Eternal Gatekeeper): Dusan Pavkovic WARlord<br/>Town Boss(Super Strong Guy): Kalann<br/>Jungle Boss(Undead Executioner): Dark Pixel's</p>\n<p><strong>[SOURCE CODE]</strong></p>\n<p>https://github.com/DjKniteX/platformer</p>\n<p>[<strong>WEBSITE</strong>]</p>\n<p>https://teamskynite.net</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T08:15:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2f/a2f45d017605e39f1ae7ccba137163f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DjKniteX", "Msandfrey"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
