GDNative requires support for Shared Array Buffers, which requires the server to send certain headers which itch does not send. You can still download the standalone windows executable below.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-11T07:11:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd9/dd91ac53fea332fe924e73a9d462e3bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cha5m"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
