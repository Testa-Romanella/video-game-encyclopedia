We know you're itching for some fine and fun entertainment, and we think it's the perfect time for something new......like our Pimple Popper app (this is the ad free version)!  You'll be laughing and screaming at the same time! ;) Pimple Popper\u00ae is the MUST HAVE classic for your iPhone/iPad!  See why our game has hit #1 in over 100 countries!  Use your fingers to squeeze and pop whiteheads, blackheads, full blown pimples, and scratch off crusty scabs. YUMMY!  Don't forget to also try our sequel - MEGA Pimple Popper. <br/><br/>FEATURES:<br/>- 4 different pimple types: blackheads, whiteheads, full blown pimples and scabs.  <br/>- 18 different faces/levels to pop.  Tip: You can always replay the levels as the pimples will randomly reposition themselves.<br/>- The pimples on the faces change positions when you replay the app, so you can always replay the levels you have beaten! <br/><br/><br/>Are you still reading this? What are you waiting for? You could be playing the nastiest (but strangely fun) app ever invented!<br/><br/>BTW, It's even more fun watching your friends play our Pimple Popper app because their reactions are always priceless - you just don't know if they'll laugh or scream.
