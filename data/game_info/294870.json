Questionable music selections are entirely on Robin.</p><p>My professional games can be found in my\u00a0portfolio.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Each player is assigned a random key on the keyboard.</li><li>Press the key to raise the associated foot in the lineup.</li><li>Only raising the foot at the \"back\" of the lineup will cause the players to move forward / gain speed.</li><li>Raising the \"wrong\" foot at any time will cause the players to slow down significantly.</li><li>Raise all feet simultaneously to \"jump\" over obstacles such as fish and children.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Known Issues</strong></p>\n<ul><li>After landing a jump, the game momentarily sees the wrong foot being raised due to not all keep lowering in sync - needs some buffer on the timing.</li><li>Game doesn't reset properly after first play through. Global variables are not reset and feet positions are not reset.</li><li>It is possible for the same random letter to be assigned to multiple feet, creating errors.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-18T04:14:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f95/f95b3aa3ab79ea9c38bde7f7779aa245.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["David Michaud"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
