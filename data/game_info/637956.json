Honestly, I had a really hard time coming up with a concept to fit this theme and I never did figure out how to get it to disappear once you use it. Trust me, it's only once per level. I'm sure many teams came up with brilliant ideas. I wasn't one of them. I have been deving games for about 3 weeks nearly full-time. I decided to try out game jams and I've done one every weekend since. The project is very short because I didn't know this jam existed until it was halfway over. I had less than 4 days to dev it and honestly, there was so much more I wanted to do with it but by the time it was in a playable state, I was so fed-up with Godot that I decided I was just going to redo the entire game after the jam in Unity.\u00a0This is the last project I will ever dev in Godot. I truly spent half of my time fixing things this abysmally AWFUL dev environment created. I hardly was able to just create because I spent so much time on workarounds and Godot BS. It's completely obfuscated\u00a0for no good reason. I understand \"inheritance\" blah blah blah. Shove it. Give me Unity any day over this. <br/></p>\n<p>That said, I think I did pretty well on the project for only having used Godot for 2 weeks. I am going to completely remake it in Unity after this jam is over. I love the mechanics and I think they will be 10x better once I port it. I'm providing a link to source files if the judges want to see them but, honestly, loads of it is just workarounds and so messy because of what I had to do to get this project working.</p>\n<p>I created every asset I used while I was working on the project with the exception of the title menu song which accidentally got left out of the first jam I worked on.</p>\n<p>Models and Renders: Blender<br/></p>\n<p>Music and SFX: FL Studio 20</p>\n<p>Pixel Art: Krita<br/></p>\n<p>Here are the source files:<br/></p>\n<p>https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VVvYlAySOLcWvqm4DCZV8uPiuAVvmrDb?usp=sha...<br/></p>\n<p>Here is the music:</p>\n<p>https://soundcloud.com/ryanwilbur/eiplaytrack</p>\n<p>https://soundcloud.com/ryanwilbur/gamejamtitletrackoriginal</p>\n<p>The premise is pretty simple, collect the portal keys to advance to the next level</p><p>You control the maze only, not the player. You will rotate the maze to guide the player to get the portal keys. Use everything to your advantage. Backspin, flippers, bouncing, falling, spinning the maze, invincibility, drawing away the enemies etc.<br/></p>\n<p>A and D to move, E for a one-time invincibility per level, space or left mouse to kick the flippers.</p>\n<p>Left and Right arrows to move, KP 0 for invincibility and space or left mouse to kick the flippers.<br/></p>\n<p>ESC to exit the game</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game as much as I do. I plan on developing this entirely into a commercial release. I think it would port really well to the mobile platform.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T05:10:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3d/b3d178937d23fd69295becd4c2342b55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AllEyesOnMe(Ryan)"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
