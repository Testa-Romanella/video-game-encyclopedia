Story &amp; Features:\r\n<br/>\n</strong>\n<strong><br/>Story:</strong><br/>Story begins in \u00a0the world known as <strong>Eosopia,</strong> where tensions\u00a0 between two warring kingdoms,\u00a0Sholes Kingdom and \u00a0Chedainada Empire,  are reaching their\u00a0 highpoint. \r\nYoung man named <strong>Harold</strong> watches birds flying from above. It's supposed to be just another ordinary day, but things start to escalate \u00a0and \u00a0<strong>Harold</strong> finds\u00a0 himself in middle of all things. \u00a0\r\n<br/><br/><strong>Features:\r\n</strong><br/>+ Themed around \u00a0to be like 90's era\u00a0 top-down JRPG.\r\n<br/>+ Crafting system (Weapons, Armor, Tools, Items). <br/>+ Puzzle elements.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>2. Making of the game:<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>FOED</strong> (Fantasy of Everlasting Dream) is homage to the JRPG genre. This is my first bigger game project. Idea is is to see \u00a0what \u00a0I can make within <strong>2 years</strong> of timespan.<br/><br/>During my \u00a0early years, I \u00a0played tons of different JRPG titles, such as \u00a0Lunar 1: Silver Star Story, Lunar 2: Eternal Blue, Final Fantasy (1\u00a0 to 12) to name the few. I think you can see some inspirations from those said titles.<br/><br/>Currently\u00a0 FOED has basic crafting system for building weapons,\u00a0 armors and tools.\u00a0 There's few puzzle element in place and \u00a0more in works.\u00a0 You can choose from 3 different classes for main character <strong>(Warrior, Mage, Priest)</strong>. You can switch\u00a0 between them\u00a0 any time while visiting main hub called Acomb.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>TLDR: </strong>So here's <strong>Demo Version</strong> \u00a0of the project that I've \u00a0been working on. I hope that you enjoy the game.\u00a0 I'd appreciate if you left feedback.<br/></p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>3. \u00a0 Game information (Technical):</strong><br/><br/></p>\n<p>Made with <strong>Rpgmaker MV</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Plugins used:</strong></p>\n<p>+\u00a0 YEP (Author: Yanfly Engine Plugins)</p>\n<p>+ Community Basic (Rm CoreScript Team)</p>\n<p>+ WeaponSkill\u00a0 (Author: Sasuke KANNAZUKI)</p>\n<p>+ TerraXLighting (Author: Terrax)</p>\n<p>+ CraftingSystem (Author: Julian \"Szyu\" Heinen</p>\n<p>+ MadewithMv \u00a0(Author: Dan \"Liquidize\" Deptula) <br/></p>\n<p><strong>DLC used:</strong>\n<br/>+ RPG MAKER MV - Essentials Set\r\n<br/>+ RPG Maker \u00a0Mv \u00a0- \u00a0Time Fantasy Add-on: Animals\r\n<br/>\r\n+\u00a0 Rpg Maker \u00a0MV - Creatures: Woodland Animals\r\n<br/>+\u00a0 RPG Maker \u00a0MV - Animations Collection III - Thaumaturgy\r\n<br/>+ RPG Maker \u00a0MV - FSM: \u00a0Town of Beginning\r\n<br/>+ RPG Maker \u00a0MV - \u00a0Heroince Character Generator 8\r\n<br/>\r\n+ RPG Maker \u00a0MV - \u00a0MV Trinity Resource Pack\r\n<br/>+ RPG Maker \u00a0MV -\u00a0 Odyssey of Fantasy: Battlebackground\r\n<br/>+ RPG Maker \u00a0MV - \u00a0Mystic Voices Sound Pack\r\n<br/>+ RPG Maker \u00a0MV - Animations Collection\u00a0 I: Quintessence\r\n<br/>+ RPG Maker \u00a0MV - Cover Art \u00a0Characters Pack\r\n<br/>+\u00a0 RPG Maker \u00a0MV - Add-on Vol.4: KidGenerator Parts\r\n<br/>+ RPG Maker \u00a0MV - Cinematic Soundtrack\r\n<br/>+ RPG Maker \u00a0MV - The Agency\r\n<br/>\r\n+ RPG Maker \u00a0MV - FSM: Woods and Cave</p><p>If you made this \u00a0far in the list, all I have to say is;<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T04:01:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/447/4477e50f9c4b74ba71a99c7d574c09fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tohtori_Jamba"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
