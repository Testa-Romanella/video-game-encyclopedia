This\u00a0game was made in a couple days\u00a0for #PongJam. It ended up being more of a demo or proof-of-concept than anything else, since I could totally see this game\u00a0having a lot more crazy mechanics and gamemodes at some point, and maybe even a level-based campaign mode! Probably won't actually develop all that though; not unless this is received\u00a0really really well :P<br/></p>\n<p>Best played with 2 Players, but singleplayer mode works too. 10 points to victory.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><strong>Player 1:\u00a0</strong><strong>W</strong>\u00a0and <strong>S</strong></li><li><strong>Player 2:\u00a0Up Arrow </strong>and <strong><strong>Down Arrow</strong></strong></li><li><strong>Pause: </strong><strong>Esc </strong>or <strong>P</strong></li></ul>\r\nGamemodes\r\n<ul><li><strong>Paddle Portals:\u00a0</strong><br/>The paddles are direct portals to the center!
