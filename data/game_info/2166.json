The game consists of the first season with the second one being on hold. The events depicted in the game do not correlate with those of a TV-show, but rather complement them with the in-between details.<br />\nThere is a total of five playable characters, the game like the other TellTale titles is made as the point-and-click adventure with high attention paid to the choices. The gameplay is formed of QTEs, dialogues, cutscenes and the investigation parts. QTEs are forcing a player to mash the buttons repeatedly, in the dialogues section one can choose options to answer, and the investigation part involves pointing-and-clicking on the objects.<br />\nAfter every episode, the player is given the information about his or her choices. On the same screen, one may compare own decisions to the preferences of the other players in the world.</p>", "metacritic": 66, "released": "2014-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-20T08:27:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c81/c812e158129e00c9b0f096ae8a0bb7d6.jpg", "website": "http://www.telltalegames.com/gameofthrones/", "rating": 3.22, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 237, "owned": 3782, "beaten": 744, "toplay": 88, "dropped": 270, "playing": 19}, "playtime": 7, "achievements_count": 535, "ratings_count": 959, "suggestions_count": 675, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 962, "platforms": ["Xbox 360", "PlayStation 3", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "Android", "PC", "macOS", "iOS"], "developers": ["Telltale Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Telltale Games"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
