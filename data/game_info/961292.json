{"id": 961292, "slug": "super-astrovade", "name": "Super Astrovade", "name_original": "Super Astrovade", "description": "If you get a rush from playing classic arcade shooters, shmups, and bullet hell games where you\u2019re immediately thrown into the conflict, then here are six reasons you\u2019ll love Super Astrovade...<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>While you\u2019re in the middle of a swarm, dodging and weaving, you can melee attack enemies using your thruster.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>While dodging enemies, you need to collect Stardust. Stardust charges your shield so that if you get hit, it\u2019s not instant death - and gives you a few more seconds of survival. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>If you can absorb 10 Stardust, you\u2019ll trigger the Hyper System: a Supernova bomb that when dropped will destroy all the enemies around you.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The more you attack and kill, the higher your Score Multiplier. Plus, if you kill fast enough, you'll get a Kill Combo bonus added to your Score Multiplier. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>See how much better you are against your friends and other people. Or see if you can beat my score!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Easy controls means you jump right into the action and within one second you know how to play the game. But mastering the game will take time!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hey, my name is Matt. I spent my nights and weekends working on Super Astrovade, so I really appreciate you checking out my game. My biggest inspirations were Pac-Man Championship Edition DX, Super Hexagon, Ikaruga, and Devil Daggers.<br/><br/>So, if you\u2019re into classic arcade shooters where you\u2019re thrown right into the action\u2026 and you enjoy the struggle\u2026 and your payoff is seeing how long you can survive and chase a high score\u2026 then I made this game for you.<br/><br/>Super Astrovade comes out May 24, 2023.
