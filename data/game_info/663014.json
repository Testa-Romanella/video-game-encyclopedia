This game was originally released by Vulcan Software\u00a0in 1996.</p>\n<p>Burnout is an arena\u00a0combat game featuring futuristic cars. Best played with multiple players, 4 vehicles on a disc-like arena must smash each other off the edge, or damage their opponents in a series of rounds. Money can be used to upgrade vehicles. The game was my 19th and penultimate\u00a0Amiga game, and was distinguished by using high resolution\u00a0graphics throughout, rendered using Imagine 3D ray-tracing software.\u00a0After many years of trying to gain publisher interest, Burnout became my only game to be commercially published, by Vulcan Software, in the final years of the Amiga. The game sold around 200 copies. It has never been publicly released since, and as far as I am aware\u00a0Vulcan still hold the copyright, so please respect this and enjoy the\u00a0game for your private use. In 2021, I re-recorded the Burnout theme music for my album Nightfood.</p>\n<p>Supplied in 7xADF format discs for use with\u00a0Amiga emulators, and in RP9 format, where the game\u00a0is fully pre-installed on a virtual Amiga hard drive,\u00a0for use with Cloanto's Amiga Forever and other RetroPlatform\u00a0emulators.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T06:00:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98f/98f9637d6a27b539b996a2bf3342012f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 237, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mark Sheeky"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
