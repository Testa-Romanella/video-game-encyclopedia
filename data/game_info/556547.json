There is no real goal or point of the game but to mess around and find bugs. On the map, you can find parkour and giant chickens to push off the map. I hope you enjoy this random game. I will try my best to release updates that are actually good. Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T06:09:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0dd/0dd11f17e723927452b542706a5b0dc5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ImBananaCrazy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
