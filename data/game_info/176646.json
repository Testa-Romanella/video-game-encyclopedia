{"id": 176646, "slug": "jyrawingzero", "name": "JyraWingZero", "name_original": "JyraWingZero", "description": "<p>JyraWing is intended to recreate an older style of shmup reminiscent more of the likes of Gradius or R-Type than the more modern bullet-hell or \"danmaku\" style stg game. Those games offer something to a very specific type of dedicated player and can scare away people who are not ingrained the genre.</p><p>That was not always the case. The games the pioneered the genre in arcades and early consoles were meant to be approachable but challenging for everybody. This style of game has fallen to the wayside in favor of the hardcore bullet hell games in the independent scene where serving a niche is acceptable and common. The commmon belief is that non hardcore fans can't care about a shmup at all anymore.</p><p>I have played and enjoyed many bullet-hell style games. They are great at what they do and when made right can be something very special. But there is room for something else too. With JyraWing I hope to hearken back to those older style games. I believe that if made correctly and presented the right way a wider group of people can enjoy these games again. I have decided for a number of reasons that the game will be horizontal scrolling rather than vertical scrolling and that the atheistic of the game will have a \"retro\" feel. The game is still early in development so anything is subject to change.</p><p>I created this demo now for two reasons</p><p>1. Early feedback. Anything and everything you want to say about this I want to hear. It's not easy getting playtesters to look at your game whenever you need them to for free. I have polished this demo up to a point where I think on a technical level you shouldn't be having huge issues. If you do, or if you have concerns about anything else I would like to hear it.</p><p>2. Recruitment. I am a technical person. By day I am a programmer and that is it. I have done my best with pixel art and I pulled all music from open source resources. The art you see here is maybe a small half step above my typical \"programmer art\" I know. I would like to have people working with me from here on out to work on art and music. If you think you would want to work on this project as an artist or even something else, please contact me I would love to talk to you. Remember this is an after work/part-time thing for me, I have a full-time job outside of making games and I can't expect any more any more time dedication that what I give.</p><p>To contact me for the reasons listed above or any other email me at:</p><p>jyrawinggame@gmail.com</p><p>And thank you for taking the time to look at my game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b14/b145279f6caca8cec404a1e4d1511ef2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["RCoriWithTheStory"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
