We initially planned for this to be a wario-ware style game, with four minigames involving our bear friend Ferdinand. Unfortunately, we severely overestimated what we could accomplish in two hours. Hidden in the code, there is a second mini-game, but we couldn't get the minigame swapping mechanic done in time. Planned mini-games included a runner gamemode (seen in the final product), a rhythm game, a button masher, and a sort of four way tower defense thing. Planned assets would have included a scrolling background, humans for Ferdinand to eat, and an adorable little cape for when he has to chase down all the bad poachers! All assets are original, copyrighted, and locked away in a secure underground vault. No touchy. Hopefully we don't get last place?</p>\n\n<p>Joshua's final words:</p>\n<p>We ran out of time and couldn't implement the other mini-games, which kind of sucks. Not a fan of Unity's WebGL UI scaling, going to have to mess with that more in the future. Overall, I'm actually satisfied with the final product. It's goofy, which is what we were intending for. Wish we had been able to finish all of what we planned. The second minigame is fully finished and functional in the code, but unfortunately we ran out of time before I was able to implement a mini-game switcher.</p>\n<p>Bear thee well, and have a nice day!\r\n</p>\n<p>Ranked 11th/13</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T08:54:07", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hyo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
