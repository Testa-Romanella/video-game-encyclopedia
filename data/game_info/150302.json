By doing so, they collect resources that can be used to improve their frame and its weapon. There are multiple types of frames and weapons to unlock and the player gets active and passive abilities as well to unlock.</p>\n<p>The opposition comes from ten enemy models, part of four faction of enemies, each with their special abilities and attack methods that the players have to deal with. This game can be played in four players split-screen co-op and also supports controllers.</p>\n<p>Please note that it's also horribly unbalanced and might still contain bugs!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3bf/3bf635f56a2180746df41ce812112a79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["poik007"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
