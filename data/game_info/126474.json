{"id": 126474, "slug": "soccerturn", "name": "SoccerTurn", "name_original": "SoccerTurn", "description": "<p>This is my 3rd participation to Ludum Dare!</p>\n<p>Another great event has come to an end. With this I present you SoccerTurn. This is a turn based soccer game that is best played with a friend alongside on the same computer.</p>\n<p><strong>## Controls</strong><br/>- Use <strong>1\u00a0</strong>to move<br/>- Use <strong>2</strong> to kick the ball (If you have it)<br/>- Use <strong>3</strong> to tell your player to do nothing for this turn</p>\n<p>Upon Clicking on either 1 or 2, point and click with your mouse in the direction you want to do either actions!<br/>You may also hit <strong>Escape</strong>\u00a0if you changed your mind and would like to do another action instead.</p>\n<p>At any time, you may press<br/>- <strong>m</strong>\u00a0to mute the music<br/>- <strong>r</strong>\u00a0to restart the current match (since last goal basically)<br/>- <strong>h</strong>\u00a0to hard reset and go back to the title page<br/>- <strong>shift + escape</strong>\u00a0to close the game</p>\n<p><strong>## Mechanics</strong><br/>One player controls the blue team, the other player controls the red team.</p>\n<p>The game will switch back and forth between the blue and red teams.</p>\n<p>By order, a character will be selected by the game in order to be given an action.</p>\n<p>Actions are selected via your number keys (not number pad).</p>\n<p>Once an action is selected, point and click with your mouse where you want to use said action.</p>\n<p>The game will take care of the rest!</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this small multiplayer game, the idea is simple, but given more time, there are many places where I can expand and improve.</p>\n<p><strong>## Advanced Mechanics</strong><br/>- <strong>Your character can steal the enemy's ball\u00a0</strong>by walking into him or across him. It has a small percentage chance of occurring (like 15% I think). This is rare but completely disruptive in a game! :D</p>\n<p>- Also, <strong>your movement is heavily influenced whether you carry the ball or not</strong>. Furthermore, when you move with the ball in your possession, there is a very slim chance that you may move much further then being without a ball.</p>\n<p>- Finally, when not having the ball, there is a chance that your available distance for you to moved is halved!</p>\n<p>These 3 advanced mechanics adds a lot of randomness to the game which makes it more tactical and unpredictable!<br/><strong>(I'm also writing these down here so that you don't need to ask me if it's a bug or not :p )</strong></p>\n<p><strong>## About Local Multiplayer</strong><br/>This one thing bothers me, because I know for a fact that a lot of people might not have the time to bring a friend along and play it.<br/>I have spent a lot of time on the mechanics which made me discard the idea of having a basic AI.</p>\n<p>After completing the game, I can confirm there is a lot of networking and mild competitive potential in this game. Basically, this game has room for a lot more!</p>\n<p><strong>## Further disclaimer</strong><br/>This game was my first one being so mechanic intensive. So it may still contain a few bugs that I missed besides the minor ones. Minor ones are things such as messy character order selection at start of game for example.</p>\n<p>Do please tell me if you find and major bug so I can quickly patch it up!
