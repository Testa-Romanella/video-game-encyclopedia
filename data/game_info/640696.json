This script\u00a0also has spoilers in Antinomy of Common Flowers, so if you haven't played the game or you don't care, then have a\u00a0good time!</p>\n\n<p>//--------------Credits--------------//</p>\n<p>Dreaming False Memories</p>\n<p>A Touhou Project fan-made script</p>\n<p>By Syoudre</p>\n<p>Discord: Syoudre#8210</p>\n\n<p>Original Work by Team Shanghai Alice</p>\n\n<p>Story / Graphic Design - UI / Sound / Programming By Syoudre</p>\n<p>Most Sound Effects Ryannlib</p>\n<p>Dialogue code based from Sparen Naudiz</p>\n\n<p>Sprites: </p>\n<p>Mamizou Sprites Unknown Author (If someone knows then please inform Syoudre.)</p>\n<p>Mokou Sprites By NYAGAKIYA(KMAP)</p>\n<p>Kasen Sprites; Sumireko Sprites By Kirbio</p>\n<p>Portraits By dairi</p>\n<p>DNH default Shotsheet By danmaq</p>\n\n<p>Fonts:</p>\n<p>Cuprum By Jovanny Lemonad</p>\n<p>saxMono By s.a.x.
