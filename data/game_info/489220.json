Too bad your room is full of monsters.</p>\n<p>This game was created using GameMaker Studio 2 over a few weeks in August of 2020 for the Portland Indie Game Squad (PIGSquad) August Summer Slow Jam. The technical theme was \"horror\" and the creative theme was \"don't let it out\"</p>\n<p>This game is still a work-in-progress; its play style was heavily inspired by the\u00a0great (and creepy)\u00a0Rusty Lake series.</p>\n<p>Our design concept puts you, the player, in the role of a young child heading to bed. You would normally begin with the lights on and while you could freely\u00a0look around your bedroom, trying to interact with anything would be stopped by your\u00a0mother as a distant voice scolding you to turn off the lights and go to sleep.</p>\n<p>Once you do turn out the lights, suddenly monsters appear, and you must then solve\u00a0a series of puzzle chains in order to ward off the monsters.</p>\n<p>This build contains one monster and corresponding puzzle chain. We do intend on finishing this game as conceptualized,\u00a0as such there are a few loose elements from other puzzles you may also\u00a0stumble upon in this build.</p>\n<p>We appreciate you trying out our game,\u00a0and we hope you'll return to enjoy the full experience once completed!</p>\n<p><strong>Player Input:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Mouse for movement and interactions</li><li>F5 to restart</li><li>ESC to quit</li></ul>\n<p><em>*\u00a0</em><em>The arrow keys may also be used for movement but it is not recommended and can be buggy.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Concept &amp; Art - Sarah Landstrom</li><li>Audio Design - Kylie Briggs</li><li>Programming &amp; UI - Pete Vellucci Jr</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Technical Notes:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>This game was programmed at a default 1920x1080 resolution and coded around the 16:9 aspect ratio. Playing on a display with a different ratio may produce undesired visual issues.</li><li>As mentioned above, this is a work-in-progress build, so there very likely will be bugs; hopefully nothing that will severely detract from your enjoyment.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T07:15:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/672/67207bee66879072bad5b72ebf7dd109.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pete Vellucci Jr", "Sarah Landstrom", "Kylie Briggs"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
