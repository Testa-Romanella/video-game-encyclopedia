This exquisitely voiced comedy provides an hour of frivolous point &amp; click goodness like no other.<h3>Play in real time</h3>This game can be played in \"real time\". Meaning that if you play between the hours of 8pm - 8am some of the scenes, objects, actions and characters differ to those found during the rest of the day. Of course, if you don't want your game to last several months, you can enable \"Time skip\" mode in the game's settings.<h3>Game Features:</h3><ul><li>Control time \u2013 but beware it comes at a cost!<br/></li><li>From Louse-tamers to street urchins, you'll encounter a cast of colourful characters.<br/></li><li>Explore rich environments with an abundance of witty retorts to almost everything you can point your cursor at.<br/></li><li>Enjoy the distinctive and beautifully realised voice acting (English) <br/></li><li>Travel instantly between scenes with a double-click.<br/></li><li>Having trouble?
