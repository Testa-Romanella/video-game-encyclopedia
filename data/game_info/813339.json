You take control of a young mechanic, and as you work through the game&#39;s 75 episodes, you&#39;ll change oil, spray paint, replace engines and air filters, and much more.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<h2>Use the Touchscreen and Stylus to Repair and Upgrade Cars</h2>\n<p>You&#39;ll learn how to use different tools such as the welding tool. You begin as a novice at the local auto shop, where Captain Bob is your mentor and teaches you the basics of auto repair. As you look around the messy garage and all the scattered instruments and tools you need, you&#39;ll get a strong sense of the quintessential auto shop atmosphere.</p>\n<h2>Upgrade Your Own Car</h2>\n<p>As you learn more repairs and do more jobs, you can use the money you earn to buy your own car and customize it. You can choose from a classic car, race car, SUV, or a coupe, and then upgrade it with body kits, new paint, and more. Impress enough people with your ride, and you&#39;ll get a better job at a new garage.</p>\n<h2>Look At Cars from All Angles</h2>\n<p>Touch Mechanic features an intuitive interface that has portraits of characters on the top screen and the workshop at the bottom. The game has 3D models of the cars and parts, and you can rotate and look at the exterior and interiors of cars from every angle.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T16:43:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/366/3662a8535e3eefd5becbf86944d856b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 236, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": ["Kando Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": ["Aspyr"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
