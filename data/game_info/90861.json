Find them and get inside the building before your shift ends!</em><br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis is a video game!  It's set in the \r\n\tFlora universe.   You play as a goat and jump around.\r\n</p><p>Hm, well, there might be a <em>little</em> more to it than that.</p><p>Glip and I <em>somehow</em> made this in a week nine days for my GDQ game jam, GAMES MADE QUICK???.  It's a little explorey platformer with a bit of gentle puzzling.  Playing it straight through takes us a bit over half an hour.</p><p>Gamepads and non-qwerty keyboards are supported.  No configurable keybindings, though \u2014 not enough time, sorry!  Played with arrow keys, spacebar, and  <strong>E</strong>, <strong>D</strong>, <strong>S</strong> (or whatever's under your left hand on your keyboard).  Gamepads use <strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, <strong>X</strong>, and <strong>L</strong>.</p><p>The game itself is free and should be playable on anything resembling a computer, but if you chip in two bucks, you can also get the OST and some concept art.<br/></p><p>Source code and changelog are on GitHub.  The game runs on L\u00d6VE, so it's all Lua.  Other than that, a few utility libraries, and the excellent m5x7 font, it's all original work and freely-licensed \u2014 code as MIT/ISC, other assets as CC-SA 4.0.  Please feel free to have a poke around!  Preferably <em>after</em> playing the game, of course.</p><p>Current release is v1.2, Jan 31, 2017, 5pm Pacific.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d4/3d4a3bd0da8da5090882854ee0c7609f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["eevee", "Floraverse"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
