I couldn't do it with the ones that are set over huge holes. With them you recover the initial flying force so you can jump longer. But in the current version, they disappear forever when you get them, and if you fall in the holes, you will be unable to get it in the next time. I tried to make stairs or ramps, to don't become you stuck. But one of the stairs seems to be too high an may be impossible to escape from there, making the game unfinishable... but sometimes if you try hard jumping the stairs you reach the top... so keep trying?\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>I rushed a lot and this game clearly need a good polish.\r\n</p>\n<p>I want to solve all of these things in future updates, but this has been the build for the jam.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T11:14:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/149/149e0804765f616a20ebbde07b73555a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kuri_pl"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
