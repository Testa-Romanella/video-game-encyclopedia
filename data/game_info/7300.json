Play with headphones and the shotgun sound is so accurate - just like the real thing. RECOMMENDED\"<br/><br/>\"Excellent !!!! Le top !!!!!\"<br/><br/>\"Shoot clays at the weekend have been shooting about three months with some coaching. Some targets I can hit no problem, others I just cant hit. I was looking for a clay simulator to try and analyse my mistakes. I was sure my problem was reading the targets and my searching bought me to this game.<br/>First thing I noticed was the target presentations were all familiar to me and the ones I can shoot in the real world I can shoot in the game. Targets I cant hit for real I cant hit in the game either. So I played it for four says straight learning where to place the shot for various targets at various stages of flight. Off to the range today I shot my best round ever, and I mean massive difference. Missed some fast crossers then hit them by increasing the lead a little. It has helped me build up target pictures in my head so I take them more instinctively. <br/>Thanks for a truly useful app. I was going to spring for another lesson out of desperation, another \u00a375 but Im going to stick with this for a while\"<br/><br/>Features:<br/>\u2022 Real life physics for clay bird trajectories and leads<br/>\u2022 Unique multi-touch controls<br/>\u2022 Authentic graphics and sound effects<br/>\u2022 Tutorial mode, where you can practice your shotgun handling<br/>\u2022 Three classic clay pigeon shooting modes (similar to skeet shooting or trap shooting)<br/>\u2022 Arcade challenge with weapon upgrades, power-ups and endless challenge<br/>\u2022 Three shotguns: double barrel and two semi-automatics<br/>\u2022 Game Center Leaderboards and Achievements<br/>----------<br/><br/>See also the new Clay Hunt PRO - Advanced Shotgun Shooting Simulator<br/><br/>If you encounter any problems please send e-mail.
