There has been a lot of peculiar events going on near the Channel 417 headquarters which has been raising suspicion. It is up to Warren, Whitney and Blake (your team) to investigate.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Gameplay</em></strong>\n<br/>Level Up Land 2 operates on a pseudo-turn-based system, characters will attack automatically but spells can be used by spending mana which will need to be recharged before that character can continue attacking. Spells come with different enchantments giving your team a variety of buffs and it is up to you to mix and match spells to optimise each spell's use with the enchantments they provide.</p>\n<p>Enemies come in different formations where you will attack the nearest enemies before being able to reach the enemies further away.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Exploration is limited by chronometers which determines the amount of steps you can take before needing to warp back to the helipad. Warping also fully recovers your chronometers which you need to save your game. You can increase your chronometer capacity by collecting chronofacts that are scattered around.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Soundtrack</em>\n<br/></strong>Download the soundtrack, Level Up Land Lullabies 2 for free here: https://velocityeleven.bandcamp.com/album/level-up-land-lullabies-2</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-25T03:27:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f75/f755ccc9339aa52174e5d70c4b08a9ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Velocity Eleven"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
