I had originally built a melee combat system with a teleportation execution mechanic but had to scrap to refocus on the already-finished mechanics. The game itself was made in about a week with 5 others working on it. What I did contribute was applying animations to the player as well as the shooting mechanics I revamped and built to play better. Please enjoy our handy work.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T14:40:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f1/7f1d677b1a44434a8253474794a8925c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anomaly games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
