The objective of the game is for a player (giver) to have teammates guess the first word on the app's card without using the word itself or five additional words listed on the card. There is two minute timer that automatically starts as soon as card is swiped and resets after two minute with a sound.<br/><br/>While the giver is prompting the teammates they may make as many guesses as they want with no penalties for wrong guesses. Once the team correctly guesses the word exactly as written on the card, the giver moves on to the next word, trying to get as many words as possible in the allotted time. When time runs out, play passes to the other team. The playing team receives one point for every correct guess and one penalty point if any card word is spoken.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-17T02:57:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d4/8d45faf922996ed76cdd83541d20e158.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Samir Bathla"], "genres": ["Family"], "publishers": ["Samir Bathla"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
