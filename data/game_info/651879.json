Unfortunately for him the company  prioritizes efficiency above all else so if him is caught by one of the  manager robots, he will be seen as defective and taken to be  reprogrammed. \r\nTo resolve this issue a helpful technician has  mentioned several anachronistic items (Floppy Disks) laying around the  base (she calls Anachrons) that may be linked to your time displacement  issues. Can you gather all 6 before the Bots catch you? \r\n  </p>\n<p>----\r\nUltimately I wanted it to feel very dystopian and and focused  on both excessive labor, and planned obsolescence. The idea being your  character gets a glimpse of where we're headed and can head back to  change things for the better. \r\nNot sure how well that comes  across in game, but it is prototype and my first time trying a code jam.  Here's to many more in the future. \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T23:37:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e3/1e306c6e3434b5bfa5cc50d7cec272a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Malterac"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
