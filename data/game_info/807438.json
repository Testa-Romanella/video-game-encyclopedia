The game will take place in two distinct but interlaced worlds, the \u201cReal World\u201d and the \u201cDream World\u201d. This presents the player with two very different game mechanics, in the \u201cReal world\u201d Robin is but a ten-year-old child that is grounded, held back by restrictive earthly physics, the player will have to rely on logic to complete puzzles and move forward.\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the other hand, in the \u201cDream World'' anything is possible, a realm where feeling and emotions can be fully explored and experience how Robin\u2019s subconscious deals with hard hitting facts during dire times. Thankfully Robin will benefit from the help of Triip, a fairy that appears to have some connection with the old Basque gods,\u00a0<em>Mari</em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>Basajaun</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T10:19:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb3/fb3ee3371bdef709022712b1ad3d09fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 351, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KubicsDigitalCreation"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
