Save all the souls that got trapped there. Equip stronger and stronger masks. You can buy them\u00a0from a friendly shopkeeper that certainly didn't trap anyone at the end of the level (definitely not foreshadowing (100% not trying to make you play this game for longer with secret content)).</p>\n\r\nVery spoilery\r\n<p>Tips:</p>\n<p>- Better masks gives you more health AND more time you can spend in the World of living</p>\n<p>- Use environment to your advantage. Take cover when necessary</p>\n<p>- Sometimes its wiser to spend money on new sword instead of better mask</p>\n<p>- When you swing your sword and then quickly repeat \"A\", \"D\" you can chain more damage (\"It's not a bug, it's a feature!\")</p><p>- If you have problem with the window showing partially off screen, try pressing \"Windows + arrow keys\" to move it. Thanks DrManatee for spotting this problem.</p>\n\r\n???????\r\n\n<p>This game is submission for Wowie Game Jam 3.0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T14:17:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba1/ba1530d812951cfc18c2b89613cdf88e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["_superspaceturtle"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
