If the fate of a country is in your hands, you must be calm.<br/><br/>The 2020 UEFA European Football Championship, commonly referred to as UEFA Euro 2020 or simply Euro 2020, is scheduled to be the 16th UEFA European Championship. National teams of 24 countries will compete in this organization held every 4 years.The 2020 European Football Championship will be the 16th European Football Championship. The tournament finals would be held in the summer of 2020. However, the tournament was postponed to 2021 However, the name of the tournament did not change.<br/><br/>The game is a penalty shootout game for national teams. Elimination matches are played as penalty shoot-out. However, since there are no penalty shoot-out in group matches, we added the exciting manager mode there. In manager mode, you will manage your team from the side. To win in group stages you need to keep your team fit and motivated. But you gotta get through tough playoffs first to get into groups. At first, only playoff teams are available. If you want to play with group teams, you have to win matches and collect gems. Then you can activate the group teams and upgrade your teams with the gems you earn.<br/><br/>A penalty shoot-out is a method of determining which team is awarded victory in an association football match that cannot end in a draw. In a penalty shoot-out, each team takes turns shooting at goal from the penalty mark, with the goal only defended by the opposing team's goalkeeper. Each team has five shots which must be taken by different kickers; the team that makes more successful kicks is declared the victor. Shoot-outs finish as soon as one team has an insurmountable lead. If scores are level after five pairs of shots, the shootout progresses into additional \"sudden-death\" rounds.<br/><br/>Penalty shoot-out is very exciting and is one of the beauty of football. This is how the winner is determined from the teams that cannot beat each other for 120 minutes. These penalty kicks will not be forgotten for years. Because it determines the destiny of the whole country. <br/><br/>\u201cSome people believe football is a matter of life and death, I am very disappointed with that attitude. I can assure you it is much, much more important than that.\u201d<br/><br/>Bill Shankly<br/><br/><br/> Portugal are the defending champions, having won the 2016 competition . .<br/><br/>  GAME OF EURO 2020 GAMES FEATURES <br/><br/>  Real fixtures of Euro 2020!<br/>  Real teams and squads of Euro 2020!<br/>  Start from play-offs!<br/>  Play as manager in group stages!<br/>  Penalty shoot-outs in every elimination game!<br/>  Open national teams!<br/>  Upgrade your account!<br/><br/><br/>FREE! <br/><br/>Play Now ! <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This game is presented to you by Gamest<br/><br/>Gamest<br/>www.gamestgames.com", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T03:13:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fb/5fbd098c184461ea6b9604a4817e29e5_NsSaaT7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Muhammed Safa Tokel"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Muhammed Safa Tokel"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
