November 2020<br/></p>\n<p>Brief:\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Disney\u2019s brand is extremely important to them and this is at the forefront of their development strategy. Disney Mobile would like a match three style game that combines all of their properties. It must feature no violence and must have something that makes the game stand out from all the other match three games on the market.
