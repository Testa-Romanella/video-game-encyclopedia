IT\u2019S A RHYTHM ROGUELITE\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n              ==== HOW TO PLAY ====                ==== READ THIS ====                   === CONTROLS ===\r\n<ul><li>Hold down stick = you will move on the beat. You don\u2019t need to tap the stick, it ain\u2019t necrodancer.\r\n\r\n        Unlockable controls (in chests):\r\n</li><li>D-Pad Buttons - Dash on subsequent beat\r\n</li><li>D-Pad/Face buttons also resync the BPM and fix audio lag. So if you\u2019re struggling, tap out every beat in a row\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>! If you get an AWFUL or an ABYSMAL, just tap again and you will overwrite the previous action with a new one. ! i.e. Keep tapping when you get to a hole until you sync up a perfect then release.\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>X        = Dash. Comes out on the same beat! Hold the stick to aim it.\r\n</li><li>Triangle = Skate. Start skating next beat. Hold down on the stick to slide around, free movement.\r\n</li><li>Circle   = Blow. Blows enemies away from you next beat. If they\u2019re close enough, they die too.\r\n</li><li>Square   = Suck. Pulls everyone towards you with gravity next beat. After suck, blow comes out on the same frame.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>L1/L2/R1/R2 technically slow you down if you want but I added this for keyboard users, would advise not playing like this.\r\n</p>\n<p>TECHNICALLY you can play this game with a keyboard. It\u2019s just horribly inadvisable. For that: WASD and dvorak/azerty equivalents = movement. Hold left shift to make it slight. 1234 = XAYB on an xbox pad Up down left right = dash buttons Space = x as well.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n                === COMBOS (using PS4 names, X = A) ===  DASH . BEAT. X -&gt;  DASH + ATTACK on subsequent beat X-&gt;DASH . BEAT. X-&gt;DASH   quickly allows you to slash and dash every frame SKATE . BEAT. BEAT. BEAT. ATTACK  -&gt; you can get 3 beats if you get a GOOD or PERFECT beat. SUCK . BEAT. BLOW   -&gt;  The blow will come out on the first frame, time it right and you can suck in enemies then kill them SUCK . BEAT. X-&gt;DASH -&gt; Suck in enemies then quickly dispatch them\r\n<p>   There\u2019s loads more, find your own! Once you beat the boss, the TEMPO RISES.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n                        == Background ==\r\n<p>This  is the 15th Rude Bear game in the RB core series, the 16th Ludum Dare  extended universe Rude Bear game, and the 18th extended universe Rude  Bear game.
