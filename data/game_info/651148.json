Build a train route for example between a mine and a steel mill in order to transport iron ore. Create a train station at each end, and buy a cheap train. Set the route, and start earning money each time your train delivers iron ore. <br/>After you made some profit, create your next route. <br/>\u00a0<h3>Gameplay</h3><br/>The game is running in real-time, but can be accelerated and paused at any time.
