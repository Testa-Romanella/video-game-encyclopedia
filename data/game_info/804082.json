They can only wiggle as a way of moving. But they also have poisonous stingers on their backs, which pops other Noodlebonks into a cloud of bubbles! Try to tag your opponent with the stingers on your back without getting stung yourself! (1 or 2 players).</p>\n<p>I didn't have time to add audio sadly. But if this game is received well, then I'll add some sound effects/music\u00a0and likely make graphical improvements!</p>\n\n<p>Support me on Twitter:\u00a0@gg_auroras</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T20:25:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b4/1b4acfdd3bea8a883f2bc43604e22a2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["aurora's"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
