A demon from hell? Who knows what you are.</p>\n<p>All that matters is that YOU CRAVE BLOOD. You NEED BLOOD. Use your tentacle, latch onto the fools who try to stop you, drain them, and kill them. For as long as you can.</p>\n\n<p>In I CRAVE BLOOD, you play as a giant monster at the top of the screen who has control of their tentacle/tongue. You are constantly losing health, and need to drain the blood of enemies to replenish it. Use the end of your appendage to grab enemies, and use them to replenish your health, and flail them around to hit others.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Mouse Movement : Moves tentacle<br/></p>\n<p>Left Click: Grabs/Releases enemies or pickup.</p>\n\n<p>The end of the tentacle is what can latch onto enemies, NOT where your mouse is.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Credits</p>\n\n<p><em>Audio</em></p>\n<p>\"2 Impact Wet\" by original_sound from freesound.org \"https://freesound.org/people/original_sound/sounds/376818/\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Heavy Impact\" by SilverIllusionist from freesound.org \"https://freesound.org/people/SilverIllusionist/sounds/470587/\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Explosion\" by JustInvoke from freesound.org \"https://freesound.org/people/JustInvoke/sounds/446121/\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Train destruction\" by CGEffex from freesound.org \"https://freesound.org/people/CGEffex/sounds/94178/\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Explosion\" by florianreichelt from freesound.org \"https://freesound.org/people/florianreichelt/sounds/563010/\"</p>\n\n<p>\"glass24\" by Craxic from freesound.org \"https://freesound.org/people/Craxic/sounds/204697/\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Fireball Explosion\" by HighPixel from freesound.org \"https://freesound.org/people/HighPixel/sounds/431174/\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Fireplace\" by tripjazz from freesound.org \"https://freesound.org/people/tripjazz/sounds/394754/\"</p>\n\n<p>\"sizzling_frypan\" by beatmad from freesound.org \"https://freesound.org/people/beatmad/sounds/201936/\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Pound of Flesh 1\" by magnuswaker from freesound.org \"https://freesound.org/people/magnuswaker/sounds/522091/\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Single Gunshot 4\" by morganpurkis from freesound.org \"https://freesound.org/people/morganpurkis/sounds/371084/\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Whoosh\" by qubodup from freesound.org \"https://freesound.org/people/qubodup/sounds/60013/\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Emergency Siren\" by onderwish from freesound.org \"https://freesound.org/people/onderwish/sounds/470504/\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>In a Heartbeat Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</strong><br/><strong>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</strong><br/><strong>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</strong></p>\n\n<p>Main menu drone and Play Button noise from Soniss.com Free Game Audio 2017 Pack</p>\n\n<p>All other sounds are done by me.</p>\n\n<p><em>Art</em><br/></p>\n\n<p>All art is done by VFisherV</p>\n\n<p>Font is Hydrating Lip\u00a0\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/hydrating-lip.font?text=I+CRAVE+BLOOD</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T07:53:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/484/4843abc791e369c5ff116a9814cca6ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Baked Orange", "VFisherV"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
