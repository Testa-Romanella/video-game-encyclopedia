He's so strong that the enemies can't hurt him at all, unfortunately he's standing over a pit of lava. So dash into demons to stay airborne and rack up a combo by chaining dashes between enemies.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p><strong>THERE IS A BUG IN THIS GAME... and by that I mean there isn't a bug. The skulls that swarm together and seem hard to hit have the wrong sprites attached, they're supposed to be bug sprites, which is why the hit boxes are smaller.</strong></p>\n<p>The first idea when give the prompt \"Less is more\" was a game where it becomes more difficult the fewer enemies there are. This lead to the idea of a platformer where you have to constantly jump on enemies.</p>\n<p>But I thought of this when my hype for Cyber Shadow was at maximum, so I had ninjas on the brain, and I thought of a FPS game where you jump using a Genji-style dash. Thus I made this game.</p>\n<p>Then I decided I'd try to fit more \"Less is more\" features in, like how the more dashes you do, the less distance you travel, and then the combo system where you gain WAY more points for chaining dashes without a break.</p>\n<p>Honestly, this was the most fun I've ever had making a game jam game - even though I am\u00a0<em>severely\u00a0</em>sleep deprived. Mainly because this is just my type of game. But, I also learnt how to add tons of stuff to my games that I've never made before, like an options menu, intro animation, I MADE A FONT. I've been trying to figure that out for ages, and I finally did.</p><p>All of the assets and code were made from scratch over the course of the game jam by me. The programs I used are as follows:<br/></p><ul><li>I used blender and aseprite for the art</li><li>I used audacity and bosca ceoil for the music and sound</li><li>I used unity for coding and everything</li></ul>\n<p>So overall, I really want to thank BlackThornProd for hosting this game jam. It's the best experience I've had in a game jam yet.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T12:46:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4de/4de3edbbc405fc57fa5864da219849a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Slimburger"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
