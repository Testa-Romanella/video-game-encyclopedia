Welcome to REDS!</p><p>REDS is a component-management ... game, wherein you must decide which of your components to plug in to deliver emails and earn 1,000 coins as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>Each component has a purpose (ex. Eyes allow you to see, Head allows you to talk to people, Arms allow you to carry things) and you decide which ones are the most necessary at each moment. Emphasis is placed on rapid decision making that has consequences if not thought through carefully.</p><p>Please clap.</p>\n<p>Originally created for Ludum Dare 39, Running out of Power, in 72 hours.</p>\n<p>NOTE: Play the Post Jam re-release. The Ludum Dare release is there for posterity but the Post Jam adds a tutorial, music and generally makes the game less player-hostile and enjoyable.</p>\n<p>NOTE2: Please play the tutorial. Or read the manual if you're playing the LD version. It makes things much easier to understand and generally improves the player experience.<br/></p>\n<p>NOTE3(FINAL): Wait a few seconds after clicking your selection on the main menu.
