AD\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Objective:\r\n  </p>\n<p>Welcome to The Rebel captain, where you are playing a role of a (maybe) the last pocket of resistance against the empire. 2 of our 5 agent are confirmed traitor, so you must plan your action carefully in which agent you send on a mission.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Gameplay: \r\n  </p>\n<p>There will be a 5 mission in total. Each mission, you have to decide which agent that will go to go to the mission, each mission will require a certain number of agent to send. Thus, the number from mission 1 to 5 as follow: 2 3 2 3 3. The traitor will win if 3 out of 5 mission is fail and we win if we success in 3 out of 5 mission. If all the agent that you send are all loyal, the mission is guarantee 100% success, but if one of the agent are traitor, they can choose to sabotage the mission and make it fail, or let the mission success to cover their identity and lose the suspicion. Each mission, all you have to do is choose an agent by pressing the button below their portrait, after that, press the launch button and wait for the result. Each time, the traitor will be a different agent. Choose carefully captain, and remember, simple choices can lead to big consequences.
