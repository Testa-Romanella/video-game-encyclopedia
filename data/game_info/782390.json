You play as the lone surviving pick up item in an abandoned time trial game. <br/></p>\n<p>You are 10 Seconds. This would all be fine and dandy; however, the bugs are growing hungry and restless and you're just about the last thing left for them to eat. Better get moving! <br/></p>\n<p>Pick up broken battle items and take the fight to the bugs. Completing laps around the track resets the handful of remaining pick up spawns and as time progresses the bugs grow bigger and badder. So tell me, will you last, 10 Seconds?</p>\n<p>Made in RPG Maker MV<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T05:48:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d42/d4206d1b24eac0d915e740a8f0b5079b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Invalid.Username"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
