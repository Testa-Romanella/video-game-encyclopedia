All you do in this version is go around finding \"evidence\" (unity gameobjects that say evidence on them). You also have to avoid this one guy who wanders around the map.\u00a0<strong>But there's also a story:</strong><br/></p>\r\nWOAH!\r\n<p>Three people just went missing, who were last seen\u00a0at the local school after a UFO was supposedly sighted over the town. After that, there have been a few other disappearances from all over town!</p>\r\nBUT\u00a0WAIT!\r\n<p>You and a group of people (the group of people aren't in the game yet) are investigating the case and are trying to discover who, or what, is truly behind all this!</p>\r\nDISCLAIMER\r\n<p>THIS IS A PROTOTYPE.\u00a0I wanted to make a game where instead of a player model, I used a video as the animation. I might make this a full game later, or I might get bored and make something else.\u00a0We'll see.</p>\r\nTHAT'S IT!\r\n<p>You can download the game files below. Thanks for playing!
