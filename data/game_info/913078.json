He becomes obsessed with Coke's sugar, carbonation, and coca (early Coke contained coca). He repeatedly drinks large amounts of Coke to escape his less-than-ideal reality, eventually creating hallucinations. Players need to defeat the monster in the Coke hallucination maze by throwing bottles to find the exit.</p>\r\nContributors:\r\n<p>Programmer: Regina Xia (Me)</p>\n<p>Art: Ayaka &amp; Zhou</p>\n<p>Game Design:\u00a0Regina Xia (Me) &amp; Ayaka</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T18:15:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28c/28c5a5d089d1b4a183a3628f8e8177b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ReginaX"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
