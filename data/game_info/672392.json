Meanwhile, the Weins kidnapped the Princess of Bangaona kingdom while she was in the disputed region, the famous Boto Island, claimed by both of the kingdoms. This particular incident added fuel to the fire further worsening the relationship between the kingdoms. The Princess was the most important member of the Bangaona kingdom because she was the one looking after the military technology. Thanks to her leadership, Bangaona got a few modernized weapons and turrets. <br/><br/>Weins kingdom had already built the towers and the various types of buildings where various modernized turrets were manufactured.
