The audit is coming, and your world is falling apart. Can you survive the grating social world of your fellow anti-taxers? Can you fend off the I.R.S. Agents breaking into your home at night? Can you? Well, now you can! (Or, well,\u00a0at least in\u00a0the demo.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Made during NaNoRenO 2022)</p>\n<p>(There are, for sure, some spelling mistakes or bad punctation in here.
