The process of this story is much shorter and easier than \u2018CHANGE\u2019.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"Change: A Little Story\" describes the story of Le Yang, the protagonist of \"Change\", after becoming an idol producer.<br/>\r\nThe narrative structure still uses the double-lead narrative, but this story is about Leyang, and the other new character \"Xue Yuting\".<br/>\r\nXue Yuting is different from Le Yang. She is an ordinary college student who has never seen the big city before. The story is much more humorous than the original.<br/>\r\nHolding the idea of \u201cI want to see Yu Ting's active presence in the city of Shanghai\u201d, there will be more landmark buildings (or events) in Shanghai. If someone can recognize the place where Yuting has appeared, it would be better.<br/>\r\nOf course, those characters who are active in the game will also appear in the story. What will they look like in the future? Stay tuned!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:50:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/434/4346d824bb1c7b163bfe3f61a1f9c4b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 299, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ryu Productions Co"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Gamera Game"], "esrb_rating": null}
