Does not work on mobile.</strong></p>\n<p>Hello everyone!</p>\n<p>This is my my seventh upload in a series of a Game-A-Week projects I took under Bennett Foddy's Prototype Studio class at NYU. Many of them were about me trying to learn specifics of coding and experimenting designs that were too weird to continue development while trying to make something funny with it. These projects were actually made four years ago, and it was part of my plan to take this long to go back to them, make them presentable and release them to the public here.</p>\n<p>Number 7 is one of my favorites, just because it was so much fun to work on it. We were supposed to make a game based on a 80s obscure game cover, no context given. My cover had what looked like a monster slug running after \"regular\" slugs, so it came the idea to make the slowest endless runner ever.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Use the Up and Down\u00a0arrow keys\u00a0</strong>to control your slug.</p>\n<p>Your objective is to\u00a0<strong>survive the longest, while eating most regular slugs.\u00a0</strong>But\u00a0<strong>be careful with the shadows</strong>, since you will\u00a0<strong>become a regular slug if not in direct moonligh,\u00a0 </strong>and the other slugs will try to enact revenge upon you.<br/></p>\n<p>Disclaimer: I didn't do, nor I claim to own, any of the music or art in this game.</p>\n<p>The art is from Spriters-Resources and the music is from Muramasa which is\u00a0\u00a9 Vanilaware.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T05:18:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f82/f82c0cf0a39dde93cf03b6d0a8b45811.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mauriciojuliano"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
