Placed in a fantasy world with a vintage style. This game is a fusion of adventure and action.<br/>The entire game is made by one person.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Game story:<br/>One experiment goes wrong and the undetected virus spread across the area. Some peoples get infected, some back from the dead, and new creatures are born. When people have no idea how to turn this back, Doctor in his laboratory discovers a special weapon to fight with these different opponents... a laser! He connects himself with his best friend and also the most effective hunter in the village to start the adventure together.</p>\n\n<p>The main mechanic is both players are connected and need to cooperate closely playing on one keyboard. Nowadays those types of games are less popular than a few years ago, but I have a fondness for times when with family and friends we played together on one computer on one keyboard. It was awesome, fun and we can spend some time with each other. One of the main goals of this indie game is to remind you of these times.</p>\n<p>So invite your partner and play!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stay connected.</p>\n<p>I will be really glad to see your reactions and get the feedback. Play the game, take a screenshot, clip or photo of you playing with your partner. Feel free to send it directly to my email or post it on Instagram with #inseparablethegame Selected posts will be featured on the official Inseparablethegame profile.</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed playing Inseparable share it with your friends &amp; family and follow me on Instagram.</p>\n<p>For more content related to the game visit:</p>\n<p>Website</p>\n<p>Instagram<br/></p>\n\n<p>Game is free to play, but if you appreciate the amount of hard work and heart put into this game, support my adventure as a game developer.
