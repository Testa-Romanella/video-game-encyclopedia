You must jump in the lake and collect as much treasure as possible! However, your air tanks are limited and you can only go for a certain amount of time. Further, the more treasure you carry, the slower you will go!</p>\n<p>To the right of the lake is a store that will refill your oxygen tanks, as well as upgrade both your oxygen and your speed.</p>\n<p>The further down you go, the more the treasures are worth! Not only that, some creatures down there pose a threat to you!</p>\n<p>Made for the 8th Alakajam.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T02:55:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4af/4af90ed8b6eec29a3abac45dffc33fad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Laaph"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
