It is the third game in the Clock Tower series, and is considered a spin-off in its home country of Japan where it was not a numbered release. The story follows 17-year-old Alyssa Hale who suffers from multiple personality disorder with an alter ego named Mr. Bates. The player must guide Alyssa through various environments, altering between her normal and twisted personality, to uncover the secrets of her and her family&#39;s past.<br />\nClock Tower II was met with negative reviews. Journalists heavily criticized the gameplay which they found to be poor due to its slow and dated point-and-click interface, as well its reliance on trial-and-error mechanics. The story was criticized by some but found to be mature and creepy by others. Critics ultimately did not recommend the game except to those looking for an experience similar to Clock Tower (1996) and those looking for a game that, like a cult film, is flawed conventionally but redeemed by its willingness to stray from the mainstream.</p>", "metacritic": 49, "released": "1998-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T18:07:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/ffb/ffba10e7e2cf0e0b3c7082dc17dfdb67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.0, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 5, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 11, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 393, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": ["Human Entertainment"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Agetec"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
