Game can run multiple AI but no time for options or game setup window anymore :(.</p>\n<p>The idea was to create a ...IO game, but just with AI bots  (like most of'm actually are). So a battle royal feeling with paint-guns  having to paint these \"pixels\". I started off with this forest as a  placeholder and tried thinking of something more fitting of the theme, but since time was of essence, I never got to changing it. As of now, I  would love to improve the AI somewhat (doesn't attack the player and doesn't dodge bullets yet). Also some additional power ups or secondary  weapons/items would make this game a lot more finished. But I still have  to build the thing for GWT, fingers crossed to have some time left.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I added sound and music at the final moments to spice things up a bit :)</p>\n<p>Scope bit me in the arse halfway through the week, so had to hack in a lot of stuff to get some results.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T08:52:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96d/96d1941421c80c58dd9bd5584a59c017.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MadMenyo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
