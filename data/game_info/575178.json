The first two levels were entirely programmed by our group, but the design was assigned. The third level was also entirely made by our group, but we made modifications to the project from the original game. We added music, spaceships (like boats, but they disappear after stepping on them), a space theme, custom art, and functionality for a second player.</p>\n<p>Credit (All programming &amp; design):<br/></p>\n<p>Matthew Burkett</p>\n<p>Max Brombach</p>\n<p>Dylan Mccaroll (Also art)</p>\n<p>Chris Cardimen</p>\n<p>Tyler Eiseman</p>\n<p>Jason Israilov</p>\n<p>Additional credit to Professor Owen who gave us the base art and assets for the project.
