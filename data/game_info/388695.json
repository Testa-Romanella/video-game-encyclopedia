Standing a rigid as a stone statue they guarded its entrance until one day their nostrils were penetrated with a particularly unpleasant smell shocking them thoroughly awake. But \"a simple smelly wiff\"\u00a0was a goddamn understatement. Whatever was in the air, that shit STANK. From the other end of the\u00a0colosseum, a challenger approached, a hooded dinosaur titled \"The Wizard Lizard\". His objective? Swarm the two with zombie dinosaurs and pass through the Gate to\u00a0conquer the next realm with his magnificently pungent army. It was fortunate that the two had stacked guns that\u00a0</em><em>would engulf the stench with gunpowder.\u00a0</em><br/></p>\n<p>Jurassic Arena is a game developed by DinosWGuns (if we were a real company anyways).\u00a0 It is a 2 player vs 1 player game, the two players being the Amazonian warriors while the single player is a \"wizard lizard\", a dinosaur with magical powers to spawn dinosaur mobs. Two controllers and a keyboard and mouse will be required to play.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-04T03:45:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bd/6bdb46f7929b9b9121f1db3f4a28a2bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["pumibless"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
