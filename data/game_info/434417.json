I leave a bit disappointed because the coding phase went very smoothly but things really slowed down after I opened up blender and I hand barely used it before. But the purpose of this jam for me was to force myself into using\u00a0blender, 3d animations and figuring out how to playback\u00a0sounds so I needed to sacrifice all the \"gameplay\" elements from the \"game\" and had no time to implement\u00a0dialoque boxes to loosely fit the jam theme in... But in the end I (barely) did that what I wanted to do but the project absolutely isn't something that I hoped it would have become. I am really satisfied with the code tho :). Still a good first experience I guess +1</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T09:01:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23a/23afce2e91e7e026f293e63d83ae0bdc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Email77"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
