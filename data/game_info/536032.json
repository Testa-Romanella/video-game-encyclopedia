Christmas is at hand and the remaining students and faculty members are making preparations for the celebration.<br/><br/>You play as Alistair Morgan, the Resident Advisor to the other students and an heir to a sizeable fortune. He has a strained relationship with his father, who disapproves of his choice to study at a less prestigious school far away instead of following the family tradition. Alistair hopes to simply spend some time with his girlfriend, Natalia, as well as his friends instead of suffering another Christmas celebration with his demanding family. And as everyone joins in the celebrations, he does too. Unfortunaly, it won't be as simple as he hopes. And as everything goes wrong at once, it will be up to him to rescue his friends, while monsters stalk the hallways.<br/><br/>The game features monsters patrolling the different areas of the school, triggering a chase if they spot the player. Monsters have a different detection radius depending on whether the player character is currently running, walking or standing as well as depending on the direction the monster is facing. There<br/>are also the keelut, whose sighting brings only trouble. And of course, the<br/>great wolf Amarok starts its hunt soon enough...<br/><br/>There is also a cold weather system, which triggers a game over if Alistair spends too long outside in the freezing cold. The positions of the different characters you need to rescue are also random, adding some replayability. If you trigger a Game Over, you can press Enter to skip the long Game Over animation.</p>\n<p>Credits are additionally available as a separate download.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>\n<p>Move with Arrow Keys.<br/></p>\n<p>Hold shift to Dash (If Always Dash is on, holding shift will make you walk instead).</p>\n<p>Press Esc to access the Menu.</p>\n<p>Interact with NPCs and objects by pressing Enter.</p>\n<p>Holding W allows you to turn in place using the Arrow Keys, without moving.</p>\n<p>Press Q to jump (Has a cooldown of 16 seconds, useful to jump over a monster if it catches you in a narrow space with no way out).</p>\n<p>Monsters can detect the player character within two spaces if they are stationary,\u00a03 spaces if they are Moving and 5 spaces if they are\u00a0Dashing. Their\u00a0detection range is further increased by 1 space if they are facing towards the player.</p>\n<p>Use the Book of Survival Tips item in the Key Items category if you need more instructions.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T05:34:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82a/82a90e4b522e3b6203d9720e9c62d253.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Beregon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
