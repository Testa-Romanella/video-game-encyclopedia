In a simple and arcade-like manner they attempt to catch as many fish as possible to top a high score leaderboard in short bursts of between 3-9 minutes. Finishing combos, clearing the ocean floor of garbage, and avoiding bobbing jellyfish are all auxiliary goals which will net extra score.<br/><br/>Every few minutes a shark patrols the sea. Catching the shark allows the player to move on to another stretch of ocean, extending their timer for another 3 minutes of play.<br/></p>\r\nEducation &amp; Serious Games\r\n\n<p>The fundamental theme of the project given by Oyfo, was to be able to educate children in some manner on how humans utilise waveforms to be able to detect what is not usually in the scope of their perception. To this end, <em>Hooked </em>largely revolves around the use of a stylised sonar wave being used to reveal any item with which the player may have an interaction.<br/><br/><em>Hooked</em> also attempts to communicate almost entirely non-verbally with the player, and comes pre-packaged with a full tutorial as well as three individual sections of ocean to play in.</p>\n<p><strong>DEV TEAM:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Boat &amp; Prop Models:\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Joran Vergoessen</li><li>Fish Models &amp; Technical Art:\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Darragh Hayes</li><li>UI, Jellyfish, &amp; Design:\u00a0 \u00a0Blanca Celma Mir</li><li>Texturing:\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Admir Leka</li><li>Programming:\u00a0 \u00a0 Mari\u00e1n\u00a0Ba\u0148as</li><li>Programming, Game Design, Peripheral Features:\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Voidjumper</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T05:04:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d92/d923523fc96451156424379580e3e136.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Voidjumper"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
