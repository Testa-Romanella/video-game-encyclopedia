The stars on screen can actually be moved around using wind tools as if they were sand. I want to make a lot more brushes that utilize this feature, but for the most part the mechanic serves a purpose in brush dynamics more than anything.</p>\n<p>there are three brush sizes, each increasing in intensity of stars being made as well as how far they spread around. <br/>there's a push and pull brush that yanks stars into clusters or away. A constellation brush that's really fun! A shooting stars to give it a little animation kick. and finally a rocket star that wizzes around then explodes into stars. </p>\n<p>but, that's not all you can do in this. You can also inspect the stars you drew and visit it's solar system!</p>\n<p>I think this is going to be a project I come back to and keep expanding. I'd love to see this get big enough that it feels like an actual drawing program rather than a fun toy. but as it is, it's still amazing and fun to play with.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T06:18:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3e/e3e13749e3f598fe19c72462b7d878c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BTL games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
