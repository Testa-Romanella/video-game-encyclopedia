Get as much money as possible by pumping and dumping crypto-currencies!</p><p>Game by Maksu: https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@maksu<br/>\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>Get as much <strong>Money</strong> as possible! To do that, you need to do\u00a0<strong>Actions</strong> to pump up the <strong>Crypto Value</strong> of your <strong>Crypto</strong>, and\u00a0<strong>Cash out</strong> at the peak to get loads of money!</p>\n<p>The crypto market is unwieldy, sometimes the value crashes quickly and other times actions don't add much to the value at all. You'll need luck and patience to come on top!<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0But beware, some actions also build up <strong>Suspicion</strong> on your operation, and sometimes bad things happen when you have a lot of it...<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Actions:<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Promise unfulfillable things:</strong> Promise your fans  that you're going to make a metaverse or  MMORPG or a new coin to build a little bit of hype! Adds 1 Suspicion</p>\n<p><strong>Collab with a celebrity</strong>: Costs 3 Money and one Crypto (hohoho, sucker) to build most hype of all options! Adds 1 Suspicion</p>\n<p><strong>Hack a social media account</strong>:<strong> </strong>Hey, as long as it works. Gets you more than Promises, but adds 4 Suspicion.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Sell a Crypto</strong>: Exchange 1 Crypto and get 1 * Crypto Value in return! In case you need money for influencers.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Mine Crypto:</strong> Get 1 Crypto. You know, for selling it later.</p>\n<p><strong>Cash out:</strong> Sell all your valuable (not really) crypto and get that * crypto value in return, so you can begin your next crypto scheme!</p>\n\n<p>btw i freaking hate cryptocurrencies this game isn't a tribute to them or anything id rather eat a 3080 than mine crypto with it <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T05:35:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a72/a72f5c1670cd42017d9879e9e9a29b8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Maksu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
