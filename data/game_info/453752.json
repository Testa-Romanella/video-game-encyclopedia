Currently there are only 5 levels although this number will increase largely over time and these levels could be accessed and download through a D.L.C system that will be introduced in an upcoming update. Do note that all the D.L.C's will be free and require no charge. Also keep in mind that this game is just a test project that has no professional intent and currently is in very early stages which feature very limited gameplay elements and poor level design.</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>The game is fairly simple to install, if your finding trouble installing the game please follow the following instructions :</p>\n<ul><li>Unzip the file R.E.D.zip</li><li>Once you have unzipped the file you should get a folder with the name R.E.D</li><li>Open the folder and run R.E.D.exe</li></ul>\n<p>Troubleshooting :</p>\n<ul><li>Try installing 7zip if your having problems unzipping the file</li><li>If game can't close use the keys [ALT + F4] to close the game, do make sure you\u00a0<br/>are focused on the game and not on any other program or it may close other programs with unsaved changes.
