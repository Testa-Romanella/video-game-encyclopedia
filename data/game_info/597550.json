Luckily you do have a guide book, but didn't it look a little different the last time you checked it?</p>\n<p>This game was made for the Jamulator 2021 game jam. It was finished on a tight schedule, so expect various bugs and other interesting \"features\". Also, I never had time to implement sounds, so the onboard entertainment is going to be in your head this time.</p>\n<p>If the WebGL embed doesn't want to function, there is a download available for 64-bit systems.
