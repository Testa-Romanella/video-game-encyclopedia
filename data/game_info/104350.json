Play as a hacker named Saph whose goal is to help build new relationships with other cute hackers... by breaking through their defenses and destroying their hacks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>...How else are you gonna attract the attention of elusive hacker gays?</p>\n<p>The theme for the game jam was <em>Intentionally Broken</em>; which was applied on two levels within this game.<br/></p>\n<ol><li>The plot of the game follows the story of a trans-girl hacker intentionally destroying other people's hacks not only to help you build new items, but to help build new relationships with other hackers.</li><li>A couple of visual and gameplay bugs/mistakes were left within the game; to help set the atmosphere and build new game mechanics around these intentionally left in bugs. <br/>(For Example: <em>Invincible Enemy &gt; Stun Ability</em>)</li></ol>\n<p>We hope you enjoy the game we put together, a lot of time and effort went into making this as best as we possibly could! Sadly, due to time constraints and personal issues, a lot of content originally intended to make <em>Digital Lovin'</em> a full-game was cut from the final release.</p>\n<p>Perhaps in the future if there we see that people want it and see people supporting our projects, we could revisit Digital Lovin' and finally put together a full version of the game? Who knows!<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you for playing, and we hope you had fun.</p>\n<p>[ Produced by the team at LantixPro Studios ]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24e/24e07cb72ab413b955c775e731f70990.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Maddie Blue"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
