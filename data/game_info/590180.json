It'll be much longer later.</p>\n<p>There will be more characters introduced later, and possibly some music to go with it!</p>\n<p>SO: Here's some basic character bios for the ones currently introduced.</p>\n<p>Fizzy: A fourteen year old on the spectrum. Since they don't feel comfy talking to strangers, and even their own friends, they prefer to let everyone else talk. They care about their brother a whole lot, and feels bad for ignoring him for such a long time.</p>\n<p>Sxifty: An eleven year old with adhd. He doesn't talk a lot either, but he talks way more than Fizzy. He's very animated, and loves just doing whatever, when ever. He loves his older sibling but feels distant because of the age gap between them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T08:33:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25c/25c23286227d4f4db6f2933a659e71f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fizzywhizzy"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
