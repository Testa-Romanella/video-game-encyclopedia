It's a tower defence style game where waves of zombies approach your fortress.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game jam version features a continuous attack arcade mode, with a story mode planned for the future.</p>\n<p>The game was coded in three weeks using CC65, ABCmusic, GIMP and a couple of other support tools.\r\n</p>\n\r\nHow To Play\r\n<p>In Z.A.P. you have to\u00a0build offensive and defensive structures to keep zombies out of your fortress. You must balance your energy production and consumption and keep an eye on the integrity of your structures in order to survive.</p>\n<p>There is a background energy generation that will fill up your energy bar, but you may need to build additional power plants to support more structures. All structures require energy to be built and all structures\u00a0(except the power plant) have an idle energy usage. Structures like guns and laser consume additional energy when activated. If a gun/laser can't activate, it will power down until there is enough energy to activate it again.</p>\n<p>All structures have a structural integrity meter (yellow bar). Once this reaches zero, your structure will fall to rubble. Zombies can attack your structures, but there is also natural deterioration of structures over time.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>These are in the in-game controls.</p>\n<strong>Button</strong><strong>Description</strong>Opt 1Cycle through structures to buildAPlace structure on fieldBDestroy structure on selected field positionD-padChange field positionPausePauses the game\r\nItem and Enemy Stats\r\n<strong>Blaster</strong><br/>Damage (closest enemy)<br/>Build energy<br/>Energy Production<br/>Idle Energy Use<br/>Active Energy Use:<br/>Structural Integrity1HP<br/>20<br/>0<br/>1<br/>3<br/>2\r\n<strong>Mega Blaster</strong><br/><br/>Damage (closest enemy)<br/>Build energy<br/>Energy Production<br/>Idle Energy Use<br/>Active Energy Use:<br/>Structural\u00a0Integrity2HP<br/>40<br/>0<br/>2<br/>9<br/>5\r\n<strong>Laser</strong><br/><br/>Damage (entire row)<br/>Build energy<br/>Energy Production<br/>Idle Energy Use<br/>Active Energy Use:<br/>Structural\u00a0Integrity1HP<br/>40<br/>0<br/>2<br/>15<br/>4\r\n<strong>Shield Wall</strong><br/><br/>Damage<br/>Build energy<br/>Energy Production<br/>Idle Energy Use<br/>Active Energy Use\u00a0<br/>Structural\u00a0IntegrityN/A<br/>38<br/>0<br/>1<br/>N/A<br/>12\r\n<strong>Power Plant</strong><br/><br/>Damage<br/>Build energy<br/>Energy Production<br/>Idle Energy Use<br/>Active Energy Use\u00a0<br/>Structural\u00a0IntegrityN/A<br/>85<br/>3<br/>0<br/>N/A<br/>8\r\n<strong>Zombie</strong><br/><br/>Damage<br/>Health1HP<br/>4-12\r\nAtari Lynx Development\r\n<p>If you are interested in developing your own games for Atari Lynx, check out The Atari Lynx Dev Wiki.
