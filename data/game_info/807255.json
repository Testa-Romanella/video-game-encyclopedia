{"id": 807255, "slug": "blindwar", "name": "BlindWar", "name_original": "BlindWar", "description": "<p>This is a torpedo battle game.</p>\n<p>You are the captain of a submarine and sink\u00a0 enemy ships with torpedoes.</p>\n<p>Torpedoes are old type that were at World War II. There is no homing torpedo. It also has no ability to track enemy ships. At a speed slightly faster than the maximum battle speed of the enemy ship, it just advances in the direction specified at the time of launch.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the torpedo must be fired at the point where the enemy ship will be located at the time the torpedo will arrive. Even though there are enemy ships in the north-northeast, you need to launch torpedoes in the north-northwest direction.(The launching angle can be adjusted by yourself, but basically it is calculated on the game side.)</p>\n<p>I think one of the thrills of the torpedo battle game is that while the torpedo goes toward the target point, the enemy ship gradually approaches in that direction, and you are exciting\u00a0 whether it will hit the ship or not.</p>\n<p>I made this game thinking that I could express it with sounds.</p>\n<p>Of course, you can open the game view (nautical chart) and play while following the movements of enemy ships and torpedoes with your eyes. However, in that case, the score obtained will be low.</p>\n<p>The image shows the game view hidden.</p>\n<p>In this state, shoot a torpedo based on the enemy ship information transmitted by sound and sink the enemy ship.</p>\n<p>This game was created with the intention that visually impaired people can play at the same level as sighted people.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T09:00:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/945/94577aba67168c3194b20c13c9d2b500.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kazuhiro KITO"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
