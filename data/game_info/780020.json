Trying to return their bodies to their normal size, the protagonists meet all sorts of bizarre characters and, without noticing it, find themselves in the middle of a confrontation between the Solar System and the evil Kisechu Empire led by the mysterious Fish Hats.

It features cute graphics mixed with a strange, fantasy-ish atmosphere akin to Earthbound; although with occasional guro and dirty jokes, giving it a charming unevenness. Most of the main games involve aliens invading the world and attempting to harm humans, with the main party being tasked with saving the earth.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Important: this game wasn't made by us (Patchy Illusion Team)!
