The goal is to fight through waves of enemies to open up the dungeon\u2019s \u2018Chasm\u2019 using quick sword strikes, well-timed dodges and blocks, and well-placed arrows. This likely won\u2019t become a large commercial product, but I hope to continue to polish this demo up to a 1.0 release!\u00a0</p><p><strong>Changelog</strong></p><p>11/03/2020 (v0.51)</p><ul><li>Fixed crash on startup bug</li><li>Added quick M+KB support</li><li>Changed download file to simple installer</li></ul><p>11/02/2020 (v0.5)</p><ul><li>Initial upload</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T05:56:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c73/c73c6e43e987ff16fb355091a8162467.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 193, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NumeroHoowan"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
