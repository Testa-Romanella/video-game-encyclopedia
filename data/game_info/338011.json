It's been a while since I made this.<br/></p>\n<p>Every month, there's a game dev meet where I live, and every month, I make a game the night before so I can pretend that I, too, am a game dev.</p>\n<p>This is one of these abstract art pieces, crafted in Ren'Py.<br/></p>\n<p>This is a very short and very messy game so please don't feel bad about not donating. In fact, if you enjoyed this game enough to want to donate (for some reason) but can't, just make a donation to yourself and buy yourself an ice cream or something similarly good. I only really have the donate option there because it seems a waste not to.<br/></p>\n<p>Eventually I'll get around to fixing this up to look nicer. I figured I'd show off the original first since people at the game dev meet got a kick out of it. Well, the original had some bugs, so this is slightly improved from the original version.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-01T04:31:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e01/e01136fc63a828697f118870035442cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZippyWharrgarbl"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
