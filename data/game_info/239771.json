It was first published in the 19th century by \u00c9douard Lucas, who called it la pipopipette. It has gone by many other names, including the game of dots, boxes, dot to dot grid, and pigs in a pen.<br/><br/>Starting with an empty grid of dots, two players take turns adding a single horizontal or vertical line between two unjoined adjacent dots. The player who completes the fourth side of a 1x1 box earns one point and takes  another turn. The game ends when no more lines can be placed. The winner is the player with the most points.<br/><br/>Don't forget to check our Game section for other fun games..", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:15:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1d/d1d94545c87c7600ca2872d9f57fda48.jpg", "website": "http://www.gaspmobilegames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["GASP Mobile Games"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["GASP Mobile Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
