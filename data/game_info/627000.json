{"id": 627000, "slug": "moon-risen", "name": "Moon Risen", "name_original": "Moon Risen", "description": "<p>This game is my submission for the Amaze Me Game Jam!<br/></p>\n<p>Moon Risen takes place in the far distant future. Fantasy and science fiction collide in this strange world!\u00a0Our\u00a0protagonist is\u00a0a wicked Vampire Slayer /\u00a0Space Bounty Hunter\u00a0on the hunt for a Vampire Lord who has brought ruin to a secluded red planet. When our hero steps foot on the crimson dust of the planet he finds that all of the local lifeforms have been transformed and emit a mysterious green glow. The moon bathes the planet in that same eerie\u00a0green light.\u00a0Can this be the power of the Vampire Lord?</p>\n<p>The theme for the game jam was \"Neon\", so I made the game with very vibrant colors. A\u00a0lot of the enemies are glowing\u00a0green as they are controlled by the vampire lord who has glowing green eyes. The game also turns \"glow in the dark\" when you pause, try it out!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Early Development</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The game is a little rough around the edges, as I was rushing to completion during the final hour of submission. I apologize for the lack of in game instruction. There is a lack of sound effects. The only sound is one music track that begins when you enter the 2nd room. There is also a glitch when you die that doesn't properly respawn you sometimes, things may get weird. You will have to close out and\u00a0restart the game when this happens.\u00a0Sorry I did not have time to fix this. Expect to find glitches! When the game says \"Thank you for playing\" it's over, you can close out the game. You have to relaunch to play again.</p>\n<p>Update: Avoid trying to backtrack to previous rooms as it may cause the game to crash. I thought I blocked all the back entry doors for this game jam, but it seems I missed one somewhere. Also if you die it may even cause some minor lag, so I suggest relaunching the game. This will all be resolved in the next version. These are minor bugs and\u00a0easy to fix, but for the sake of the Game Jam I may wait until the voting is over in a few days before posting a fixed version. Hope you enjoy the game in the meantime!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>With Controller</p>\n<p>(Only tested with a PS4 Controller)\u00a0</p>\n<p>D-Pad\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0..........\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Move left and right\r\n</p>\n<p>X\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ..........\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jump (In the air press again\u00a0and hold\u00a0\u00a0to hover with\u00a0rocket boots)</p>\n<p>Square\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0..........\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Whip Attack!\r\n</p>\n<p>R1\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0..........\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Shooting Attack!\u00a0(and reload after ammo is out)\r\n</p>\n<p>Start\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 ..........\u00a0 \u00a0 Pause</p>\n\n<p>(I recommend using a controller, but keyboard works too!)<br/></p>\n<p>On Keyboard</p>\n<p>Arrows\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0..........\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Move left and right</p>\n<p>Spacebar\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ..........\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Jump (In the air press again and hold \u00a0to hover with rocket boots)</p>\n<p>A\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0..........\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Whip Attack!</p>\n<p>S\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0..........\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Shooting Attack!

Down +Jump to fall through platforms</p>\n<p>2. After you find the rocket boots, you can attack and shoot while hovering in the air</p>\n<p>3.\u00a0You can reload before ammo is out by holding up and pressing the shoot button</p>\n<p>4. Take advantage of the whip and rocket boots on the final boss fight, if you get there you will know what I mean</p>\n\n<p><strong>My Final Message</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game only has several rooms, so it does not take long to complete. I was generous with health and ammo to help you make it to the end! There are also 3 special hearts to find that increase your max health. You may need them for the final boss fight, so keep an eye out. The final boss is pretty challenging but VERY FUN!\u00a0If you beat the boss, be sure to let me know what you thought!</p>\n<p>You can find me on twitter. I'm the quiet type, but I\u00a0plan to be much more active on there with game development updates. I plan to either further develop this game or one that is similar, my decision will be based on the feedback I get. My specialty is retro style action platformers and \"metroidvania\" style games\u00a0(literally in this case), so follow me if you have a love for those kind of games like I do!</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/_j_balla_<br/></p>\n<p>Happy vampire slaying!\r\n</p>\n<p>Thank you!!! &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T09:43:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ea/6ea28df4beb8af1cabe22b8f5e806346.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["moonrisen"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
