Your goal is to equalize the count of grass (0), grain (1), lettuce (2), berry (3) and seed (4) tiles on the map. Tiny negative and positive signs indicate the surplus and shortage values. By clicking on a tile, its value gets added to its neighbours. For example clicking on a grain adds 1 to a neighbour berry which then transforms to a seed (3+1=4).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T18:19:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/728/728c68e5ef0057055f869a5b07177a83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Szieberth \u00c1d\u00e1m"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
