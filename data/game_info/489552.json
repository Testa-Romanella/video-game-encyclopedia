Left, right and up move you in those directions. When you die or at a splash screen press any button to restart.<br/></p>\n<p># Bugs</p>\n<p>Collision is a little wonky. If you find yourself stuck in a wall, jump and you should've fixed it.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T03:30:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f0/1f0321866b3f7ff5a8329cfafa973cf9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thief3"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
