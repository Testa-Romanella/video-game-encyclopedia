You are stuck at home in your bed, dreaming of exploring the outside world.<br />\nYou gradually develop the power to create and control stone creatures known as golems. You see through their eyes, direct their movements, and use them to explore beyond the confines of your room. At first, you can only build small doll-sized golems to send around your room, but eventually your powers will grow, until you can send enormous 15-foot tall giants to explore an ancient abandoned city.</p>", "metacritic": 59, "released": "2019-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-07T13:12:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d5/9d5a8c362401434fe2f1698eee4396d7.jpg", "website": "https://highwiregames.com/golem/", "rating": 3.33, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 15, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 30, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 232, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["Highwire Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
