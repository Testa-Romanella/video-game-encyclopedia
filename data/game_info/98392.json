The trick is to charge the jumps just right that you balance your speed and height.</p>\n<p>Future Plans (Maybe?):</p>\n<p>Besides fixing up the numerous control issues (I had problems with the whole system being a bit 'floaty'), \u00a0I would like to add a procedural system to the level generation as well as the above-mentioned orbs and other movement types. Was also thinking of adding enemies that drained energy, and using the orbs to either gain energy or as weapons against them.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Thanks to\u00a0namu :) \u00a0for the music (full song here:\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/namu_a_meme/grid-running )</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3db/3dbdfc629c4e10ed6457c063c6f733a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["beeseekay"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
