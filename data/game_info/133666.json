Or have you ever had the urge to throw an orange and a \r\nblueberry on top of a school bus? Now you can with Everyday Stacker!</p><p>In\r\n Everyday Stacker, you take 65 everyday objects that you might \r\nfind around the house, and stack them on top of each other to try and \r\nbuild the tallest tower possible. You only have three seconds to place \r\neach object where you want it, at which point the object will start \r\nfalling and hopefully land on the tower. You have to be very careful as \r\nbeing slightly off center can cause the entire stack to topple over!</p><p>If normal stacking isn't good enough for you, try stacking in the wind, on the moon, or with wacky physics! There's also a two player mode so you can challenge your friend to see who is the best object stacker in the world!</p><p>Alternatively, download the Android version on Google Play!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09d/09dd6f23fd6fd2fcaa2a74292a3717c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Tinzone Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
