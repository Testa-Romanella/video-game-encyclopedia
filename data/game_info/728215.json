The player has been clamped in each scene to prevent it from leaving the screen.</strong></p>\n<p>\n<strong>The input for all scenes in the gameplay is the \u201cArrow Keys\u201d and this is the same throughout all scenes to avoid confusion with input keys. \u00a0Each scene has a pop-up notification task reminder for the player and the scenery changes as progression is made or when a task is achieved which ensures an increase in the score while a \u201cTry Again\u201d button appears when the task is not achieved to encourage a replay if desired.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The scenes depict various seasons to create the illusion of a changing season and to camouflage the obstacles which are birds. The wings of the birds and the butterflies do flap to create a realistic effect of fluttering wings. Each scene has a sprite to depict each stage of the life cycle of the butterfly and the activity in each scene reflects it too.</strong>\u00a0\u00a0<strong>Collision with other game objects is constant throughout the gameplay to achieve a task or to restart the game and a delay timer has been implemented to enable the player to know what happened before the next scene loads.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The game is made to horizontal scrolling in the endless runner section due to the movement of the player and the structure of the background- where the camera follows the player, the seamless seasonal background repeats and the birds which are obstacles and the nectar or dewdrops which spawns in front of the player</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T07:18:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/105/105525b89c8141bded3226fc93c03fab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CraftersTV"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
