Theme - Leaps and bounds</p>\n<p>This is a Game Maker Studio 2 project of my entry for Game Off 2019.</p>\n<p>The theme was \"Leaps and bounds.\" In my case I approached it in a following way:</p>\n<ul><li>the character leaps into helping her freinds,</li><li>the character obtains powerful artefacts that allow her to confront the lich and save her friends,</li><li>the dungeon is disappearing (creates bonds),</li><li>the artefacts are cursed, limitng what character can do.</li></ul>\n<p>The game is a combination of a simple puzzle game (collecting the artefacts) and\r\nchoose your own adventure kind of game (once the dungeon disappears, the hero fights the lich).</p>\n<p>The game is by no means fully finished. It lacks full graphics, in some places you can find placeholders.\r\nAlso there seem to be some bugs with the final part.</p>\n<p>One of the planned features was the lich taunting can commenting on the player actions in the dungeon.</p>\n<p>Possibly I'm going to add that part later.</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\nDIRECTIONS: arrows / WSAD / gamepad's left analog stick, gamepad's d-pad\r\nSELECT: enter / space / A, B, X, or Y button on the gamepad.</p><p>GitHub site: https://github.com/swefnox/Dungeonbound<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-02T02:12:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c50/c50cbd17a319cf81f5997080d05d70e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["swefnox"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
