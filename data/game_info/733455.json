This is the premise and prototype of this demo of a deckbuilding game. Use your coins each turn to trigger abilities, and defeat Meowcifer. This game was made during the Global Game Jam 2022. It represents a barebones concept of a more fully envisioned deckbuilding game, where players gather coins and abilities to battle increasingly more powerful foes.</p>\n<p>See screenshot for a few clarifications.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Shannon Fenton:\u00a0<em>Programming</em><br/>Nico van Pelt:\u00a0<em>Programming</em><br/>Frederik Derks:\u00a0<em>Art &amp; Game Design</em><br/>Spencer Vonk:\u00a0<em>Art</em><br/>Eugene Shenderov:<em>\u00a0</em><em>User Interface &amp; Sound Design</em><br/>Toracha:\u00a0<em>Music</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T06:35:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/303/303dc1c4070c7e1625b12abfbde5c050.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NicoNicoVP"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
