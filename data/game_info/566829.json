For the test assignment, you have been challenged to ransack a castle, the surrounding area and even the Bank of Kerovnia itself of all valuables. Are you up to it? Frankly we doubt it.<br/><br/>Magnetic Scrolls was a British video game developer active between 1984 and 1990. A pioneer of audio-visually elaborate text adventure games. It was one of the two largest and most acclaimed interactive fiction developers of the 1980s.<br/><br/>The original game has been restored and improved by Stand Games (with permission) and adapted for modern devices, with a vastly improved UI.<br/><br/>Features include:<br/><br/>* Touch-Text Commands<br/>Tap \"links\" in the text to perform commands without typing.<br/><br/>* Game specific word suggestion<br/>Tap suggested words from the word bar during input to save time.<br/><br/>* Sidebar Inventory<br/>All your things are conveniently listed in a sidebar with icons. Drag and drop to use them or to apply them to things in the main text.<br/><br/>* Dynamic Map<br/>No need to draw out the map, we do it for you. As you explore the game, the map page will expand. Tap any previous room on the map to \"fast-goto\" that location.<br/><br/>* Compass Rose<br/>Quickly navigate with a handy compass gadget. It shows the available exits at all times, simply tap to move.<br/><br/>The new facilities make the original game fun and entertaining to play on modern mobiles. No more dead ends; the remaster has multi-level undo, save/load game and automatic undo from dying!<br/><br/>There's also the original artwork, the animated artwork and new music from the original artist John Malloy (thanks John!).<br/><br/>Help support the Remastering Project<br/>After fees &amp; sales tax, we get only about one UK pound from each sale. We're working to restore original game content, source code and documents and hopefully to develop and share new IF technologies.
