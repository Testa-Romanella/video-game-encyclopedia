Goals are generally upwards on the screen, so head that way if you're lost.<br/></p>\n<p>Eat yachts in one bite and get a cheeky speed boost for doing so, but don't touch the rocks or you will surely die. Hitting a wall will cause the shark to lose some confidence and speed, so please be mindful of his feelings.</p>\n<p>Win by chomping the libertine mermaids perched at the top of each level, or win by achieving the fastest shark, or cruising around and eating the most yachts.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T05:21:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14d/14df69c6f2a96c4104627a2f81910f65.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["justinmlu"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
