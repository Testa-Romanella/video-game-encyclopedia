You will be scored on your ability to narrowly escape oncoming fire from enemies. As such, points will be earned by placing yourself near enemies and their bullets without being hit.</em></p>\n<p><em>Please enter your ship when ready.</em></p>\n<p><em>End transmission.</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>How to Play:</em></strong></p>\n<p>In <em>Dancing Aegis\u00a0</em>your goal is to build up your bullet hell, shmup skills by incentivizing dangerous play!</p>\n<p>Your ship is surrounded by a blue circle, and when enemies or bullets pass through it you will \"tag\" them. this will give you\u00a0points and build up a combo.</p>\n<p>If you get hit or 5 seconds go by without passing by a threat, the combo will end, and your score will increase.</p>\n<p>Aim for a high score!</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Controls:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Left Stick / D-Pad /\u00a0Arrow keys / WASD to move</p>\n<p>Start / Options /\u00a0TAB/ Escape to pause</p>\n<p>Mouse to press menu options</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Tips:</em></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Your actual hitbox is smaller than your ship looks! It's represented by the cockpit (the smaller blue circle)</li><li>While you can't defeat enemies, they can't defeat you either! The only penalty to getting hit is losing your combo.</li><li>Enemies and bullets can be \"tagged\" more than once!</li><li>\"Tagging\" an enemy gives 300 points while a bullet gives 100!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T07:44:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b05/b0586583f566f0e812d0f99fee26f98c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kurt Plouf"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
