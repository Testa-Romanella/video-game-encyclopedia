{"id": 583359, "slug": "project-unknown", "name": "Project Unknown", "name_original": "Project Unknown", "description": "<p><strong>FREE PUBLIC ALPHA</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Project Unknown (PU)</strong> is DLZ Studio's exclusive project that began its journey back in late 2017. What started as an exploration of side-scroller AI, turned into DLZs biggest project in history. PU currently features extensive multi-layer pseudorandom 3D world generation which includes numerous biomes, underground caves, and procedural structures. Gameplay mechanics are tailored towards an experimental and tactical approach - damage is dealt by projectile type and all applicable senses (touch/feel, sight, and sound) are simulated to create a comprehensive combat arena. Players are equipped with ballistic grenades and an interactive grappling hook to enhance the Experience.</p>\n<p>This is a FREE PUBLIC ALPHA version that is subject to developmental updates to incorporate new content, fix bugs, and accommodate community feedback. Additional project information and discussions will be held on the <strong>Devlog.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD - Movement/Jumping/Climbing</li><li>W x 2 - Wall Jump</li><li>E - Interact/Open Door/Use Elevator</li><li>R - Reload Weapon</li><li>Q - Throw Grenade</li><li>L-Click - Use Weapon</li><li>R-Click - Use Grappling Hook (On/Off)</li><li>TAB - Generate New World</li><li>Esc - Quit Game</li></ul>\n<p><strong>TIPS</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Silenced weapons generate a limited amount of noise, but can still be heard from close proximity.</li><li>Non-silenced weapons generate a lot of\u00a0noise and reveal the player's position to enemy forces nearby.</li><li>Hostile forces are alerted by dead bodies.</li><li>You can jump on hostiles for a stealthy\u00a0insta-kill.</li><li>The aiming reticle turns red when you run out of ammo.</li><li>Run against crates to push them and provide additional cover from enemy fire.</li><li>Listen for hostile footsteps before planning a dangerous run across the map.</li><li>Throwing a grenade also makes noise.</li><li>Grenades always kill.</li><li>Stealth and agility are your best friends for survival.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>RECOMMENDED SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS (60FPS+)</strong></p>\n<ul><li>GTX-750 Ti / RX-460 GPU or Better</li><li>2.0 GHz Quad-Core CPU or Better</li><li>Windows 7/8/10</li></ul>\n\n<p><em>All C</em><em>ontent is Subject to Copyright - DLZ Studios 2017-2021 (Formerly Ramchuk Entertainment Games (REGT))</em></p>\n<p><strong>Proudly Developed Using\u00a0001 Game Creator</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T22:40:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d06/d0634b82edfba70a6765a260973d9c95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DLZStudios"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
