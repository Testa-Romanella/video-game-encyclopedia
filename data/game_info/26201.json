While \n      stationary, they have the ability to spin at a very high rate of speed. \n      As they spin, the Lumiloop emit unique sounds and a fascinating \n      ring-shaped glow. Lumiloop plankton seem to always grow in clusters of \n      five. They produce sounds at different pitches as they spin together, \n      creating a beautiful harmony. This is called a pentatonic scale. \n      Depending on where they live, Lumiloop plankton that produce several \n      different sounds have been identified.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d05/d05d503352cbae93143971a8d7b9a88f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
