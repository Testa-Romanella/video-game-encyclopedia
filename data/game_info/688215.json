Hamsters are cute!</li><li><strong>Grow </strong>sunflowers in a green meadow!\u00a0</li><li><strong>Help</strong> other animals!</li><li><strong>Watch</strong> the changing days and seasons!</li><li><strong>Listen</strong> to music! The music changes with the seasons too!</li></ol>\n<p>Almost everything in this game is affected by the seasons and time of day, but the stability of the atmosphere even as everything shifts just goes to show that the more things change, the more they stay the same.\u00a0This game was made entirely during Oct of 2021 for the Godot Fire Jam using the free and <strong>hamsterful</strong> Godot Engine.<br/></p>\n<p>You'll need a 64 bit Windows or Linux machine to play HamFarm.
