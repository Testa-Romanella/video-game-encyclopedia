These creatures, who have been dormant for millennia, suddenly start attacking the miners. Seeing their colleagues being mutilated, panic ensues, and the\u00a0remaining miners attempt to escape the mines.</em></p>\n<p><em>The few that managed to escape realize that the creatures that followed them are seemingly harmed by direct sunlight and dare not come out of the mines.</em></p>\n<p><em>However, that would not keep them safe for long as the dark side of the moon approaches\u2026</em></p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>Move using the WASD keys (W is jump), avoid obstacles and the creeping darkness as you try to reach the goal of each level.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p><strong>Project Lead/Programmer/Level Designer</strong><strong>:</strong>\u00a0Kreateer (Matija Milakovi\u0107)</p>\n<p><strong>Programmer(s):</strong> nagytech (Jonathan Nagy), whmct\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Level\u00a0Designer:</strong> Rubonnek (Wilson E.
