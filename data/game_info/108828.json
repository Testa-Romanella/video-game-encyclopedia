As you can probably guess, everyone in the town is a total dummy. If you could not guess from the information available then you should probably be living in that town... Burn! If you did not understand the burn then you definitely should move to that town... Double burn!</p><p>Anyhoo, this game is a classic RPG like Final Fantasy 2 or Chrono Trigger but without any fighting or magitech or summons or chocobos or time travel or pretty much any of the good stuff that is in those games.  This game does have comedy in it but it is pretty dark.</p><p>It has between approximately thirty five minutes and an hour of game play. Don't worry, that is plenty.</p><p>Any feedback or constructive criticism would be appreciated.</p><p>ENJOY!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84d/84de2f7f6ca72e921d06234ff8a2d825.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Dybno"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
