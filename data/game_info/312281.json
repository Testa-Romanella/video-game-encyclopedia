It is mostly just some world-building, and a proof-of-concept of gameplay. It will likely take under 10 minutes to play it. The theme of the jam was \"No\u00a0Death\u00a0State\"</p>\n<p><strong>Source Code</strong></p>\n<p>I have open-sourced the repository for Face The Wind. It was created in Game Maker Studio 2, and I hope the project can help other people learn something about how the game was built!
