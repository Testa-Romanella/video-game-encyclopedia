This pack is possibly the largest pack I've every made for the site and has taken more than two weeks to craft. If you've been following me on discord whilst I've been working on it you'll know it's been a long journey. There are over five hundred body parts in this kit which you can use to craft a huge variety of mages. If you can't be bothered with all that then I've already made up fourteen mage sprites in various styles including male and female, good and bad varying elementals and more. The included keyframes are 927 by 730 pixels. but you can export over 2000 pixels in size using the Spriter file and maintain resolution. You'll probably need to use a texture packing application to trim the alpha from the frames, the long staff adds a lot of padding to each frame.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-27T06:06:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/093/0936f40dc5e9cb6e73c14cafc4f3ccd2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Robert Brooks"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
