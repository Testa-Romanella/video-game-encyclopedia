You\u00a0<em>just </em>want to hang out. But curious humans won't stop barging into your dungeon.\u00a0Don't let them annihilate your buzz<em>!</em>\u00a0<strong>Your goal is to <em><strong>skeletize </strong></em>3 humans without letting one reach your room</strong>. (Bonus points for doing this in as few turns as possible)</li></ul>\r\nHow do I play your weird skeleton game?\r\n<ul><li>Each turn you can try\u00a0to cast\u00a0<strong><em>fireball\u00a0</em></strong>or <em><strong>skeletization</strong></em>, as well as which human you're targeting. Careful, as doing so lowers accuracy. You can also\u00a0choose to take a\u00a0<strong><em>necro nap</em></strong><em><strong>\u00a0</strong></em>and restore accuracy, but enemies will advance! If each room contains an enemy, you have the option to <strong><em>decimate\u00a0</em></strong>the entire map at the cost of lowering your base level accuracy.</li><li>As for the controls??!!??(?)
