Arcane Island is inspired by my favorites like Dungeon Crawl and ADOM, as well as games I haven't played at all like Master of Magic (not a roguelike!) and Mage\u00a0Knight\u00a0(a boardgame!).\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The game was initially envisioned as more of a rome the countryside taking out villages/keeps type thing with really big spell scale, HOWEVER, my plans changed during the challenge and we ended up with a single screen island and not that much spell scale.\r\n</p>\n<p>I worked on this\u00a0from Friday March 5 to Friday March 12 and used the Godot game engine.</p>\n<p>You control a\u00a0power hungry Wizard on a monster infested island covered in clouds.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong></p>\n<p>Use the cast button in the lower left to cast spells. Use those spells to explore the tiny island. <strong>You win by casting the Spell of Mastery or by defeating the big boss at the far east side.</strong></p>\n<p>Spells cost mana to cast and you earn mana each turn based on your power. Increase power through spells or by finding power up items.</p>\n<p>Some spells, like summons, also have an upkeep cost which you have to pay mana for every turn.</p>\n<p>Monsters wake up when they are attacked (at really high turn counts everything wakes up eventually)</p>\n<p>New spells have to be researched before they can be cast, research is just an initial up front mana cost.</p>\n<p><strong>Commands</strong></p>\n<p>Z - opens/closes the spell select window</p>\n<p>X - opens/closes the spell research window</p>\n<p>C - recasts your last spell (also the cast button next to the spell icon will do this)</p>\n<p>Space - Confirm for start and restart game, and initiates the selected UI item</p>\n<p>Arrow keys - select UI items</p>\n<p>Mouse/touch for everything else</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T08:57:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eaf/eaf11f595c5935513d1b8124a62e9002.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["sponrad"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
