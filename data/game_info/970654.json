The game was made by students at SMU Guildhall who are graduating in May, 2020 during the height of the Covid-19 outbreak. This is a difficult time for everyone.  We decided to make Goofballs and our other recent releases free for two reasons:  1) With a challenging job market, we wanted to show off the students' hard work to as wide an audience as possible.  2) Everyone stuck at home could use some fun, free entertainment.<br/><br/>If you are one of the gamers who supported our students and purchased the game, <strong>we thank you</strong>.  Proceeds go directly to the students to help offset some of the extra development costs of making and publishing the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T17:53:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64e/64eb6c3f30c5b059e60524eff93b2b05.jpg", "website": "http://goofballsgame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 27, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SMU Guildhall"], "genres": ["Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SMU Guildhall"], "esrb_rating": null}
