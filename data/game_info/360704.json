As such it is not in a super finished state. It was made in\u00a0Unity if you want to know.</p>\n<p>You play as a fox that has to solve puzzles by picking up items and flinging them at objects. The catch, though, is that you only have one inventory slot. You can't pick up as many items as you want.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy playing my game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T19:14:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18a/18a9dd84bf24563767d0722e60f8ffe2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Microraptor13"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
