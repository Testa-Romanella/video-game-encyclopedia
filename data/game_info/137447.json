It mixes the style and atmosphere of Hitchcock suspense thrillers with trippy cartoon phantasmagoria. Some say it's also an irreverent satire on human weakness.</p>\n<p>In the funky 70s Snakes of Avalon went highly recommended by the likes of PC Gamer, Rock Paper Shotgun and Gamezebo. Recently it was once again uncovered from the dust for the Gamejolt showcase at GDC 2016.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><em>\"Australia has a lot of snakes. Avalon apparently has more. The pitch-perfect humour and blatant popular media references alone make this a must-play, not to mention the spectacular atmosphere!\"</em></p>\n<p>Kotaku</p>\n\n<p><em>\"There's a certain feature in games that I don't believe has been fully explored to date which is main characters that go out of control, and it is fully enforced in Snakes Of Avalon. Jack is feeble and unpredictable.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>Slightly Deranged</em></p>\n\n<p><em><em>\"Most games get a recommendation based on the way they play, but Snakes of Avalon is worth experiencing simply for the world it presents.
