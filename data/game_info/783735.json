Published by Square Enix, it features a variety of popular characters from the Mario and Dragon Quest franchises, who must square off and win it all in a monopoly-like party game.</h2>\n<p>With over 23 selectable characters (one being a custom-made avatar), players continuously move around a board as they claim plots of land and collect money from others as they cross their territory. However, certain circumstances can take effect that can turn the tide, such as forcibly taking a space already owned by another player, or temporarily nullifying a space for the turn.</p>\n<p>Inspired by Dragon Quest&#39;s levelling-up system, players obtain bonuses the more &#39;Experience&#39; they collect throughout the game. This is done by passing four special spaces, which are marked with a suit: Spades, Clubs, Hearts and Diamonds, and then heading over to the &#39;Bank&#39; space. If a player successfully checks in with the bank, it activates a random &#39;Chance Card&#39;, which has an impact on themselves, other players, or even the gameplay. In the end, all of the players have a collective goal in mind: reach a certain total property value, or bankrupt all of the other players to seal the deal.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2007-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-11T03:23:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2f/d2f0449ba85517b144ace60e496350e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": ["Armor Project", "think garage"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games", "Card"], "publishers": ["Square Enix"], "esrb_rating": null}
