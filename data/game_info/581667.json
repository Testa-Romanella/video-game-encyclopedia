Me and my girlfriend both Computer Science majors in college decided it would be pretty fun to make something and take part in a game jam.</p>\n<p>And thus you have CrystalCavern, a rouguelike, top-down shooter. It features a procedurally generated map, and randomly spawning enemies to add a bit of spice. This was also my first time making any kind of music, so that was fun too. Hope you like the game.\u00a0:)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T15:21:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/185/185a706cb731ea555565e4e9c802244b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["imtiazkhaled"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
