{"id": 965295, "slug": "only-jump", "name": "Only Jump!", "name_original": "Only Jump!", "description": "Only Jump is a timed vertical climber, inspired by Only Up!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn Only Jump! you jump by pressing space or A on your controller. Use WASD or thumbsticks to aim your character. Race to get to the top in the fastest time. There will be various sections bookended by checkpoints. These include standard platforms, bounce barrels, and spikes to avoid. The checkpoints will save you restarting unless you choose to make a run without the checkpoints. Be careful there might even be a fake platform or two to trip you up.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOnce you hit the first checkpoint a timer will start and will complete when you reach the end. Completing the run will take you to a success scene where you can view pictures of the puppies involved in creation of the game and your score on the leaderboard. Then you can restart and try again.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMusic can be enjoyed by toggling the song on or pressing M or Y/Triangle on your controller.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlease enjoy!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-25T02:54:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d26/d26f010cb4926fe27d85dcab2029885b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BeepBleep"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BeepBleep"], "esrb_rating": null}
