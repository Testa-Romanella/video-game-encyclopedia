Do this <strong>when her eyes are fully open\u00a0 or blinking</strong>(usually after thinking in place for a bit) and you'll have a window of time where you can tell her where to go, if you click on any task in the screen.</p><p>*****************</p><p>You need to get working, quick! One project for class, one deadline for work, both before the end of the week. Can you do it without completely avoiding the problem\u00a0like the normal person you are? Or will you go crazy and lose control trying to do everything?</p>\n<p>This game was based on mixed personal experiences over several years.
