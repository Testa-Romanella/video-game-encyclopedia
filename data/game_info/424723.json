Atrocities of WWII are almost forgotten. Nonetheless, a special task force is set out to hunt Nazis down. As its leader, you will be gathering evidence of war crimes against them and forcibly bringing these criminals to justice.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>After WWII, numerous Nazis managed to slip through the cracks and escape overseas. This is why INCU (International Nazi Crime Unit) has been established with one and only specific goal in mind: to find them and get them back for a fair trial.<br/><br/>You will assume the role of officer who is looking for a distinct group of scoundrels. Every member of this group once used to be on staff at the most notorious concentration camp sadly known as \u00abAshland\u00bb. In the past all of them committed extremely heinous crimes and now it is time to answer for it.</p>\n<p><strong>This demo features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>One operation with optional goals</li><li>One evidence analysis</li><li>One 1942 memory in the concentration camp</li></ul>\n<p>It overall accounts for less than 5% of the total game, but still it's supposed to last around 45 minutes if every objective is achieved.</p>\n<p>The game quits when you'll have your final conversation with the witness. It's planned to end like this, so don't worry, it's not a crash.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note that this demo might have some minor bugs. It's my first alpha build, so you may experience some small bumps\u00a0along the way. But, hopefully, it should be fine.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I encourage you to\u00a0leave some feedback in case you liked the subject and/or the game itself.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Wishlist on Steam</strong>:\u00a0https://store.steampowered.com/app/1174680/Ashland_Dossier</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T05:00:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78d/78df76ef304792b473ec38c75b71ecd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 193, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PsyRob"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
