{"id": 715813, "slug": "snow-laughing-matter", "name": "Snow Laughing Matter!", "name_original": "Snow Laughing Matter!", "description": "<p>\u201cSnow Laughing Matter!\u201d is a collaborative platformer where two players must work together to reassemble Frosty the Snowman. By rolling the snowballs into position and collecting Frosty's pipe, nose, eyes, scarf, arms, and top hat, players can beat the level with Player 1 using ['w', 'a', 'd'] keys and Player 2 using ['up', 'left', 'right'] keys. Once assembled, Frosty will challenge you to a game of\u00a0Tic-Tac-Toe, whereupon completion ends the level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We designed this game based on the lyrics of Frosty the Snowman, \"Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul, With a corncob pipe and a button nose, And two eyes made out of coal.\" Players collect each of these elements (and more) while rebuilding frosty).</p>\n<p>The game includes\u00a0a standard main menu, volume settings, the main platformer section, and the Tic-Tac-Toe minigame. This game was created by Catie Balasubramanian (krystal#1000), Lucas DeMello (Troy Is Better Than Me At Life#1336), Matthew Keller (mkeller#5550), and Jenny Wu (orangejello#3730), first-time game developers and first-year biomedical engineering students at the University of Waterloo. The game was created in Unity using C# Scripts and built as a WebGL project.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T04:17:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ce/2ce8e276c83e15689feafaf0fc02f6f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mkeller3712"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
