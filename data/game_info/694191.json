Outside of his unceasing shallow desire to rub shoulders with Hollywood\u2019s biggest who\u2019s-whose, little is known about Phil. His upbringing, his family, even his pre-late night comedy background remain shrouded in mystery. To climb Hollywood\u2019s ranks, one must possess an inherent cynicism or at least an exploitable na\u00efvet\u00e9. Phil possesses both. Despite <em>Up Late </em>being his first (and only) love, Phil has a flair for the dramatic. The more off-the-rails an interview gets, the bigger those ratings get! Feathers may end up ruffled, sure, but the numbers speak for themselves. Phil isn\u2019t shy about his right-wing tendencies either. An outspoken advocate for military might and free-market economics, he justifies his outspoken political leanings as providing a change of pace from the generally liberal late-night landscape. But might that outspokenness be about something more than mere freedom of expression\u2026?<br/></p>\n<p><em>Up Late with Phil Crocker </em>spans over the course of forty years, from 1963 to 1993, and puts the player in the shoes of Phil\u2019s various guests. How the player chooses to approach their interviews can bring about dramatically different results for both their own personal success- and that of <em>Up Late </em>itself.\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Story by: Paxton Wright and Ian Ring</p>\n<p>Produced by: Paxton Wright, Lan Dev, Rohan Teredesai</p>\n<p>Creative Direction: Paxton Wright and Lan Dev</p>\n<p>Script: Paxton Wright and Rohan Teredesai</p>\n<p>Programming: Lan Dev</p>\n<p>Character Art: Paxton Wright</p>\n<p>Background Art: Halley Eveland</p>\n<p>Additional Art: Halley Eveland and Zane Craigmile</p>\n<p>Score: Dylan Baker</p>\n<p>Sound Design: Bryn Khouri</p>\n<p>Marketing: Zane Craigmile and Justin Roberts</p>\n<p>Special Thanks To: Michael Barach, Aline Crinon, the Families and Friends of our hard-working crew</p>\n<p>Extensions/Assets Used: Fungus by Fungus Games, Old Tv Filter by Vortex Games</p>\n\r\nPurple Car's\u00a0 Social\u00a0 Media:\r\nTwitter\r\nInstagram", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T11:28:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e9/1e9306994c5a96d8ef6575b8e8957800.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ianmring"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
