One needs to be careful while playing it or may have to lose the game of rummy. Ramee games are such a game that it can be played in groups. One deck of 52 cards is used for a group of 2 to 6 players, whereas 2 decks of 52 cards are used for 2 or 3 players, with 4 jokers, and 3 decks of 52 cards are used for 4 to 6 players with 6 jokers. Each player is dealt 13 cards, which they have to meld into valid sequence/set. 5,6,7 of the same suit is an example of a sequence, and 7,7,7 of a different suit is a set (These types of sequences or sets are called a pure sequence or set).<br/><br/>Rummy uses joker cards, and these cards can be used as substitutes for any card to form combinations(which is called a non-pure sequence or set).<br/><br/>Each card has specific points.<br/>- Number cards have points equal to their face value.<br/>- Face cards -&gt; jacks, queens, kings, and aces have 10 points.<br/>- Jockers has 0 points.<br/><br/>As players meld their cards, their point score decreases. The player who achieves 0 points, first of all, is the winner of the game. According to the game, there must be two sequences, and one of them must be a pure sequence. Rammy players can meld their remaining cards into either sequence or sets.<br/><br/>Each player picks a card from the closed/open deck and discards a card to the open deck. The gameplay goes on in a clockwise manner until the winner completes the required sets &amp; sequences. The basic 13-card strategy is to make valid sequences and sets before one's opponents.<br/><br/>The players need to arrange the cards and place them on the table to show their hands to other players. If the players hand meets the objective, he/she is declared the winner. If not, the opponent is declared the winner.<br/><br/>At the conclusion, if you haven't declared your game, then the points of the remaining cards after melding two sequences multiply by bet points.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/>- Played between 2 to 4 players.<br/>- Each player keeps a minimum amount on the table.<br/>- Minimum of two sequences are required.<br/>- One of these must be a pure sequence.<br/>- Apart from the printed jokers, there is one more card picked at the beginning of each game. All cards with this number from all four suits are considered as Yoker.<br/><br/>Features:<br/>- Player Avtar: There are 4 avatars to choose from for your player id.
