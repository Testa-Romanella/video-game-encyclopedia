There are two characters ('Red' and 'Blue') which are controlled by the same controls (arrow keys). However, only red collides with red tiles, and only blue collides with blue tiles. The aim is to get both characters to their respective endzones.</p><p>This is my second game (having started game development as a hobby earlier this year), and I welcome all feedback on the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/363/363d45f66ca5c5d79a0e1941c0a86a13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HAL_9001"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
