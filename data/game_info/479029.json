Each player has a side of the screen for himself with his own instructions. But you both have to share the same keyboard !<br/>You need to destroy objects in your way to move toward the treasure. To do so, a key will be displayed. If you press the correct key within the time limit, you will successfully break the object in front of you and move to the next one.<br/>But beware ! If you fail to press the key within the time limit, you will be stunned for some precious seconds !</p>\r\nCore mechanic:\r\n<p>The goal of this game is to be the first one to reach the treasure. But pressing a given key whilst your friend tries to do the same with another key is not an easy task. You'll have to fight over the keyboard to be able to destroy your object in front of you. Or you can also prevent your friend from doing so and make him stun which can benefit you.</p>\r\nReady ? Set...
