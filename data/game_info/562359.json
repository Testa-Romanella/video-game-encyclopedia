{"id": 562359, "slug": "words-turrets", "name": "Word's & Turret's", "name_original": "Word's & Turret's", "description": "<p>This game was created during the Brackeys Game Jam 2021.1<br/></p>\n<p>It's a tower defense game, where you have to combine words to create turrets and then place those turrets extra carefully because they will form groups to become stronger together. Formed groups then will have skills that they will activate by themselves. You may want to read the \"How to play\" page ingame first, because it's hard to notice a few features\u00a0at first.</p>\n<p>This was my first Game Jam and I think it shows - the result is not very good and I would have done almost everything differently if it wasn't for the 1 week time span. I planned too much for that little amount of time and couldn't finish half of it nor really balance everything out. I hope you'll have fun anyway and maybe even appreciate some aspects of it atleast, that would mean a lot already.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T10:20:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8cc/8cc3a939779e662d2f02c87e5759956a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["MidasButSilver"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
