{"id": 573070, "slug": "pigxell", "name": "Pigxell", "name_original": "Pigxell", "description": "<p>Pigxell is a combination of performance and a computer game, where the performer plays as an NPC in the game. This game is, as many other room-decorating games, all about personalization. However, here, gaining control of a virtual personal space means giving up certain controls of one\u2019s image.<br/><br/>A character in the game, a pig, trades furniture with the player only if they trade images of their body; eyes, nose, ears, mouth, hands, feet. Accordingly the furniture pieces players purchased from the pig have labels of the pig\u2019s eye, snout, mouth, ear, etc. The pig manages the shop in game while the performer manages the pig. The performer manually checks images sent from players, and then uses them as materials for making posters. The performer re-arranges their own apartment space, bringing the aesthetic and images from the game into their room, and shoots photos for making the posters.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Link to\u00a0play online\u00a0(might be experience slow loading, in that case please download the game here. )<br/>\u00a0Link to\u00a0see posters on the pig's phone<br/>\u00a0Featured in online show\u00a0<em>Share Screen</em><br/>\u00a0Featured in online show\u00a0<em>D02.0</em><br/></p>\n<p>\" \u00a0\u00a0Pigxell makes and trades furniture. Every staff at Pigxell dedicates to make your space a place. With a selection of furniture that incorporates our unique aesthetic, you can personalize your room with ease. The creation of space is central to us. It is shown in a story shared in Pigxell. Michael Townsend, who lives in Rhode Island, found a secret space behind two walls in the construction site of Providence Place Mall. The two walls almost touched but left a gap for entrance. Since then, Townsend started to decorate the space, making it his second home, but from outside people can only see the two solid facades. We hide behind the veneer facade of images and uniform aesthetics. We own and re- plenish the place in the gap between personal control and image flow. At Pigxell, everyone embraces the idea of play. We dedicate to host your play, while you may also find us as players and actors beyond your gaze.<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With that, we invite you to the game. \"<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T08:47:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/425/425e2176b2d3bdc395c6fba15d281ef5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 284, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nuobe"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
