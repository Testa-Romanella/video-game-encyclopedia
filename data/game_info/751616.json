The purpose of this game is to win the game by blocking the opponent.\u00a0Each new piece must touch at least one other piece of the same color, but only by the corner! The player with the most pieces on the board is the winner. When there are no more pieces to place, the game is over. To put it another way, the game finishes when one of the players blocks the other. The person who has the fewest pieces left at the end of the game wins!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T08:53:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea9/ea96a1c6b9c0a41b8914eab781da0173.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brington"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
