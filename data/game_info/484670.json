Kaname Komatsuzaki is a game that lets you enjoy life interacting and growing up with Kaname Komatsuzaki, a childhood friend of protagonist, Kouichi.<br/><br/>The game is strewn with short segments that explore their relationship with the choices made at each step which alter their lives as they spend their youth with each other. The story is 100% dialog and from the start in 1999 to the present day, everything from the subject matter to the backgrounds are linked to each period in the game.
