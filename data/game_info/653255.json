Parked on the edge of Earth at some point in the future when we're finally not shunned by other intelligent civilizations, Spaceship Repair VR puts you in the shoes of an interstellar engineer.\u00a0Fly around in zero gravity, find space debris, and use it for repairs on passing ships.</p>\n<p>Fix the ships that visit your station for repairs and earn credits.\u00a0The credits have no use in this version, but in the future they will be used\u00a0to upgrade your station - allowing you to build the new sections piece by piece. In the meantime, stay calm and weld.</p>\n<p>Use the thumbsticks to move at the beginning, the rest of the controls will be explained.</p>\n<p>Made in UE5\u00a0by one person in a handful of days. Most art is from the store, I\u00a0am no artist.\u00a0Wrist twist may be off due to openXR issues with packaging in UE5. Vive wands not supported, sorry (feel free to try). Tested mostly with Oculus devices, may or may not work well with\u00a0Index.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T06:25:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13e/13e0a8e802b8064fb6d678d660fd0075.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thoth_ta"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
