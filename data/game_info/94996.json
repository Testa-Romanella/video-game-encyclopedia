Help this noble sir to find it!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>\r\n\tFind your way into Heaven. Only \r\n\t<strong>you</strong> can do it.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>Descend Into Heaven</strong> is based on the good old times, the graphics and gameplay are based on the original Game Boy (not the color one!), and the level design is inspired by the classics SNES games. We did our best to bring back to life this old style on this little, but honest game.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWe really hope you enjoy it, we will listen with all our heart to any kind of feedback, as we want to make better and bigger games in the future.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAlso, if you make a gameplay, review, blog or anything about the game, don't hesitate in contacting us (links below) and we will share your content on our networks.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tEnjoy the game, and see you in Heaven!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t:)\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Only keyboard.</p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Left and Right Arrows -</strong> Movement.</li>\n<li><strong>S -</strong> Jump.</li>\n<li><strong>A - </strong>Attack.</li>\n<li><strong>Esc -</strong> Pause Menu.</li>\n<li><strong>Return -</strong> selections on menus.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\r\n\tYou can download the soundtrack by pressing the next link:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Descend Into Heaven Soundtrack.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\r\n\tMost of the development information of this game is in Spanish. We currently do all our content in english, but back when we made this game we were still using our main language everywhere:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>A Time-Lapse Post-Mortem of the first version of the game.</li>\n<li>A Gameplay of the demo where we, Spoonman Games, play and talk about the development of the game.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>\r\n\tAnd we also have this special content that you can enjoy <strong>regardless of your language</strong>:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Open-source project on Unity of the first version of the game.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>\r\n\tBe aware: the open source version is really outdated, it has even outdated graphics, some code is really ugly, and there are unresolved bugs not present in the actual full game. In fact, the open-source version was made in five days for the GameBoy Jam 4. While this full version was month of work later.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHope you enjoy all this, and if you want to contact us, use any of the links below.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBe good!</p>\n\n<p>\r\n\tGame made by \r\n\tSpoonman Games in Unity 5.4.0f3.
