It's an action 2D sidescroller, just like Mega Man, and features this...creature called Greg.</p>\n\r\nStory\r\n<p>Sharing a bad day with the likes of Wario, Greg had his house raided by a gang of bandits. He will now travel across the country, searching far and wide for the bandits, to take back all of his gold\u00a0and then some.</p>\n\r\nInformation\r\n<p>I have around 4 worlds planned with 2 to 3 stages each, and a boss (gang elite) at the end. This alpha features the first 2 levels from the first world, but has no bosses yet. I'm very excited to finish this small project.</p>\n<p>The game also runs on a hacked Nintendo 3DS or Nintendo Switch, as a homebrew app.\u00a0The 3DS version has stereoscopic 3D.</p>\n<p>Your feedback is important, so feel free to post any criticism or suggestions.
