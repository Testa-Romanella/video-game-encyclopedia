However, the stories, mechanics and environment are different. I wanted  to experiment and learn about Unity UI elements, because I did not  implement them in my first two prototypes. The question I want to  address is: Did implementing more UI features enhanced the player's  experience?\r\n </p>\r\n \r\nImplemented Features\r\n<ul><li>Press Spacebar to jump\r\n</li><li>WASD to move the character\r\n</li><li>Mouse to look around\r\n</li><li>A Score Counter\r\n</li><li>Rocks to collect\r\n</li><li>A minimap to relocate the player\r\n</li><li>A mute/unmute toggle button\r\n</li><li>Respawn mechanic\r\n</li></ul>\r\n \r\nFeatures to implement\r\n<ul><li>Add a prize or when the player collects all the rocks, let them know the game ends there.\r\n</li><li>Add Levels (more obstacle or harder to reach)\r\n</li><li>Option to increase the player's speed\r\n</li></ul>\r\n \r\nQuestions for play tester:\r\n<ul><li>What is your first impression of the game?\r\n</li><li>How difficult is the game?\r\n</li><li>How would your story go, if you could come up with your own narrative for this game?\r\n</li><li>What aspect of the game do you find the most interesting?\r\n</li><li>Was there any option you wanted to do that you could not?\r\n</li><li>What kind of task would you enjoy doing in this type of environment?\r\n</li><li>How did you feel when you were playing this game?\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Background music: www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u43yUcB8uY&amp;ab_channel=Prod.Riddiman\r\n </p>\n<p><em><strong>Notes from the Play tests</strong></em>\n</p>\n<p><em>Issues:</em> Some had difficulties finding all the rocks because  they did not know how to move from one iceberg to another without  falling into the water. There was an issue with the jumping mechanism  (spacebar) which propels the player at a high speed. I presume that  most of the time, it is due to the contact with the fences.\r\n </p>\n<p><em>Suggestions:</em> The game can begin with a story that explains  why all the icebergs are separated and the player can save their penguin  friends instead of picking up rocks. Then, to make it clear, I would  add signs next to the fences to remind the players that there is a  shortcut to the other icebergs. Someone suggested that I could transform  the stones into a magical element like a crystal to create a mysterious  adventure. The player could also collect objects that represent a piece  of themselves and it could motivate them to explore the area even more.  To add more variety in the task, it would be interesting to let the  player swim in the water, fly in the sky or even personalize the  penguin\u2019s habitat (with more trees and other objects).\r\n </p>\n<p><em><strong>Reflection on result of playtest</strong></em>\n</p>\n<p>Many play testers had a great first impression of the game. The  environment, the ambience and the music combined give a relaxing  feeling. It gave a play tester the impression of being on a \u201cpeaceful  island during [their] vacation\u201d. The instructions were straightforward,  although it would have been better if there was an obvious sign that the  fences are invisible paths to other icebergs. Half of the play testers  had difficulties moving from one iceberg to the other, but the controls  were easy to grasp. I realized that some of my play test questions were  repetitive, but all the feedback I received are helpful. All the play  testers came up with unique suggestions and I found potential stories to  tie this game with. It encourages me to pursue this prototype as my  final project.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T06:13:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/137/1371b621efff69fea3031cbfa1efc01c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["eloracchao_k"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
