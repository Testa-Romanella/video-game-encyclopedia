{"id": 896307, "slug": "angry-motes", "name": "Angry Motes", "name_original": "Angry Motes", "description": "<p>This game was made for the\u00a0LynXjam 2022 game jam, a 3 week\u00a0long game jam without final rankings for no other purpose but to have some fun and make some Xmas cheer!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game was coded in about a\u00a0week and a half using CC65, ABCmusic, GIMP and a couple of other support tools.</p>\n\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>In this game you control the player who is playing a game on the TV. You control what the person does in the room and that reflects what the game on the TV does in return. The goal of the game is to score 99 points against the computer without destroying your TV completely. Or just smash that TV to bits, it's your choice!</p>\n<p>Computer 'AI' is very dumb, it just moves the computer paddle left/right. You have to try and get the ball past the computer's paddle. Timing is important. You can launch the ball or by holding down the launch button, or you can build up extra force when you swing\u00a0to make the ball fly faster. The greater the force, the greater is the chance of having the mote fly out of your hands.</p>\n<p>If the mote hits the TV, it will damage it, but that's only visual, you can continue playing the game by feel.</p>\r\nControls -\u00a0Game Options Screen\r\n<p>Use the left, right and down buttons to select which mote, TV and person you want to play as/with. Once ready, press up to get started.</p>\r\nControls - Main\u00a0Game\r\n<p>Control the person by moving them left/right, up/down. The paddle on the TV will move left/right whenever you're holding the mote.</p>\n<p>If the mote drops, you can pick it up by walking up to it and pressing B.</p>\n<p>Press A to launch the ball to try for a goal.</p>\n\r\nAtari Lynx Development\r\n<p>If you are interested in developing your own games for Atari Lynx, check out the\u00a0Programming Resources\u00a0page.
