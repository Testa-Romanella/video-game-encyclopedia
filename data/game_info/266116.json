{"id": 266116, "slug": "next-gen", "name": "Next Gen", "name_original": "Next Gen", "description": "<p>\r\nNextGen is a proof of concept game for 3d rendering (and flaunting\r\nsome cool Linear Algebra) in an ASCII terminal. The core\r\nfunctionality of the rendering engine has been written from scratch\r\nover the course of 3 days in C++. It makes use of the sdl_mixer\r\nlibrary for playing audio, it is important to note that this\r\ncomponent of NextGen is only part of the demo game and not required\r\nas a core part of the 3d rendering software. The game must be\r\ncompiled with the g++ compiler using the makefile within the root\r\ndirectory. Any attempts to compile this software on anything other\r\nthan Linux will be met with all sorts of mean, nasty looks and\r\npossible silent treatment. Once running the game press \u201cp\u201d to\r\nstart the game or \u201ce\u201d to exit. The player can be controlled with\r\nthe \u201ca\u201d and \u201cd\u201d key. Avoid the seizure-inducing cubes to\r\nraise your score. </p>\n<p>The music in the\r\ngame is Adagio in D minor by John Murphy.</p>\n<p>up to date source\r\ncode can be found at https://www.github.com/rootieDev/3d-ascii-engine</p>\n<p>If you would like\r\ndetailed descriptions of the math used, email me at\r\nrootieDev@gmail.com I can offer you pictures of very lovely diagrams\r\nand equations on grid paper.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acc/accc1012c0aec8bd5e83adf83ba08957.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux"], "developers": ["rootieDev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
