The theme was \"Dreamy\" and the limitation was that each playthrough of the game has to be unique.</p>\n<p>In this game you wake up in your bedroom, but it looks a little different from what it used to be, in fact you're trapped in a nightmare, and you'll be able to do nothing but walk around the world searching for the 5 lost keys which will let you escape this nightmare.</p>\n<p>But there's more! There are 5 total stages, from the overworld to the dungeon, and each stage has one key, but each time you leave the stage, you'll end up in a random one! And if that wasn't enough, the key in each stage will have a 25% chance of appearing!</p>\n<p>Will you be able to wake up from this never ending nightmare?</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong>WASD or arrow keys to move<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Goal:</strong><br/>Collect all 5 lost keys to escape the nightmare</p>\n<p><strong>Credits and sources:<br/></strong>Game by me<br/>Sprites and art by\u00a0plutoniantoad (link to her\u00a0Instagram)<br/>Music from\u00a0CanariPack 8BIT TopDown (dungeon sprites were also inspired by this pack)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T05:41:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db7/db7385a6af89c63d35265595e072b1c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GalaxyVinci05"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
