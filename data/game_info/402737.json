{"id": 402737, "slug": "invader-tanks", "name": "Invader Tanks", "name_original": "Invader Tanks", "description": "<p>The aim of the game \"Invader Tanks\" is\r\nto defend the designated area against invaders trying to break\r\nthrough the gate. Fortunately, destroying the gate is not easy. The\r\ngate is built solidly and it takes a lot of time to destroy it for a\r\nsingle attacker. Additionally, an energy shield can be put on the\r\ngate and defensive cannons can be placed on nearby pillars of the\r\nwall. Properly used defence tools are able to resist a huge number of\r\nenemy units. In order to buy the defence elements you need to have\r\nenough metal. Metal is obtained from destroyed enemy units and\r\nthrough bonuses for group destruction of enemy tanks.</p>\n<p><strong>Tip : Making all purchases and using the\r\ndefence tools menus is possible during the pause which is activated\r\nby pressing the space bar.</strong></p>\r\nGate\r\n<p>When the cursor hits the gate, it will be\r\nhighlighted. When you click on the gate with the left mouse button,\r\nthe gate's menus are displayed. The price to be paid for each item is\r\nplaced next to it. Gateway menu containing the\r\nfollowing items:</p>\n<ul><li>\n<p>Buy Shield \u2013 When this\r\n\toption is selected, an energy shield will be applied to the gate.</p>\n</li><li>\n<p>Boost Shield \u2013 When this\r\n\toption is selected, the energy shield on the gate will regenerate\r\n\tmuch faster. The regeneration rate of the shield on the gateway is\r\n\tshown in the game status information (upper left part of the screen \t- \"Shield level:...\").</p>\n</li><li>\n<p>Fix the Gate \u2013 It rebuilds\r\n\tthe gate after it's completely destroyed.</p>\n</li><li>\n<p>Add 50% gate power \u2013\r\n\tRebuilds half of the gate's life points (when the gate is not\r\n\tdestroyed).</p>\n</li></ul>\n<p>If the door shield is destroyed, it\r\nis necessary to wait ten seconds to put a new shield on the door.</p>\r\nCanons \r\n<p>Cannons can be placed on the pillars of the wall.\r\nWhen you hover over a pillar, if it is possible to place a gun on it,\r\nit will be highlighted. There are two types of guns available.\r\nMounting the cannon costs 350 metal. You can change the type of the\r\ncannon by selecting it with the left mouse button and then clicking\r\non it with the right mouse button. Changing the type of the cannon\r\ncosts 400 metal. If the cannon has already selected its target for\r\nattack but it is necessary to change this target (for example, the\r\ncannon attacks a blue tank which cannot be damaged by it), then the\r\ncannon should be marked with the left mouse button and another tank\r\nshould be marked for attack also with the left mouse button. If the\r\ngiven tank is in range of the cannon, it will be designated as a new\r\ntarget. If the tank is out of range the cannon will find another\r\npossible target to fire.</p>\n<ul><li>\n<p>Heavy cannon \u2013 This cannon\r\n\tthrows very heavy bullets, so their reloading takes a very long\r\n\ttime, so there are two such cannons on each turret. The cannons\r\n\tshoot alternately, which significantly increases the frequency of\r\n\tshooting but still does not match the light cannons in this aspect.\r\n\tThese cannons do a lot of damage to tanks but do not attack drones.</p>\n</li><li>\n<p>Lightweight cannon \u2013 The\r\n\tprimary target of these cannons are drones, so they are the first to\r\n\tbe attacked. However, these cannons are not able to detect the\r\n\tpresence of drones, but only shoot at places from which the drones\r\n\tare firing. For this reason these cannons shoot only at drones which\r\n\thave already started to fire on the gate. If the drone is firing on\r\n\tthe gate but the cannon is currently busy shooting at the tank, it\r\n\tis possible to wait for the tank to be destroyed and then as the\r\n\tfirst new target the cannon will choose the drone or point the\r\n\tcannon at the new tank as a target that is out of range of the\r\n\tcannon and in this way the cannon as a new target will immediately\r\n\ttake the drone.</p></li></ul>\r\nRockets<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<p>If the cursor turns green after\r\nhovering over a tank and the tank is also highlighted green, it means\r\nthat a missile attack is possible on this tank, which is activated\r\nwith the right mouse button.  Rocket attack is possible if the metal\r\nstock is greater than 150 (rocket price) and the rocket reload has\r\nbeen completed, which is indicated by the rocket reload status bar\r\nplaced at the rocket launcher. Near the rocket launcher there is\r\nalways a transformer which is responsible for the rocket reloading\r\nspeed. On the transformer there is a missile loading speed level\r\nmeter. When you click on the transformer you will see the price you\r\nhave to pay for increasing the reloading speed to the next level. The\r\nhighest possible transformer level is 10. Only rockets are able to\r\ndestroy the blue tanks available from the second game map.</p>\r\nFinishing\n<p>The game ends if more than four\r\ntanks pass through the gate, otherwise it is possible to continue the\r\ngame until the player leaves the gate. During the game, the player\r\ngains further achievements, advances to the next levels, collects\r\nexperience points and adds further scraps to his statistics.</p>\n<p>Have a good time!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-06T02:30:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1fc/1fc44b0da8be871660d5154d1967ff2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Detrok"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
