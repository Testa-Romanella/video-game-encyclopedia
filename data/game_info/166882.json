In the deep oceans surviving can be pretty intense, life is dangerous down there. Luckily you are able to control a dangerous sea monster except this time you will have to fight your friend for it's meat. Avoid urchins and getting inside your enemy's mouth. Catching fish will keep your health up and jellyfish will keep up your energy!</p>\n<p>Experience the full swimming controls and senses of a sea monster with an xBox Controller (2 of them of course). The controls are hard in the beginning but that is the point of the game (it's like playing a realistic racing game for the first time :D).</p>\n\n<p>Feel free to leave a comment behind! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be1/be1022294cd2e875a952c52c1f7ce295.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LiefPiejn"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
