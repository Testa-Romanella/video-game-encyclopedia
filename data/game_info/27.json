{"id": 27, "slug": "pyre", "name": "Pyre", "name_original": "Pyre", "description": "<p>Pyre is an action-adventure game developed by Supergiant games. </p>\n<h3>Setting</h3>\n<p>The game is set in some purgatory. After getting banished by the society, the main character finds himself all alone. Three exiles soon approach him and invite the protagonist to party with them and nickname him the Reader. The group sets out to cleanse their souls.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gameplay of Pyre revolves around some sports game, which is connected with a ritual known as the Rites, which happens in a parallel world. The Protagonist controls his three newly found friends in battles against three opponents on a small arena. Each team has its own pyre. Both pyres oppose each other. The objective of the game is to defend your pyre while attacking the enemy one. The player can only destroy the pyre with the orb, that is spawned in the center of the arena and which has to be grabbed and thrown into the pyre.</p>\n<p>During a round, the Reader can switch between the character he wants to control and pass the orb from one to another. Each player has their own amount of endurance which is required for moving around the arena. If the players of a team come together, they create a zone that is dangerous for the player that carries the orb. If the player with the orb should get into that zone, they&#39;ll be temporarily removed from the game.</p>\n<p>While free from the Rites, the player can travel through the world of Pyre, train his teammates or try to learn more about the Rites.</p>", "metacritic": 84, "released": "2017-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-13T06:10:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/e63/e635b8c7fbe3ffd69ad6c1c586cd250e.jpg", "website": "https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/pyre/", "rating": 4.17, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 265, "owned": 1852, "beaten": 305, "toplay": 202, "dropped": 150, "playing": 36}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 165, "ratings_count": 469, "suggestions_count": 357, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 477, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Supergiant Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Sports", "Arcade", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Supergiant Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
