For it was believed a child cast into the abyss under the gaze of the blood full moon may one day return... but that child shall wield the wealth and power over The Undying. ~<strong>Gameplay</strong>Spirits Abyss is a procedural platforming death labyrinth (or Spelunky-like). Cast into the abysm you must venture into its depths battling phantasmic meanies through diverse spookful biomes, meeting curious compadres, and plundering its many useful items and treasures to hopefully find a way back home.<br/><br/><br/>There's also a variety of game modes and several unlockable playable characters each with their own weapons, upgrades and playstyles (and hats!)<br/><br/>~ But perhaps the stories are true? Do the fabled gates really exist? Where may they lead? And who may well dwell in such haunted realms beyond? ~<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:45:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fc/2fccbfe4400174fcab7c6d59a0e385e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 35, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 93, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 262, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anthony Case"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Caiysware"], "esrb_rating": null}
