I really love old Nintendo games, so I decided to make a game similar to The Legends of Zelda with the Halloween theme and named it Castle Hallowen. It's because you are in the castle where you need to get through the\u00a0monsters\u00a0to win this game.\u00a0As a programming language I choose Python and it's module Pygame. For the graphics I choose pixel art, because I want that retro vibe. Then I started to work on the game in my free time. And now, after the long journey we are here. So I hope you'll like it and leave some comment. And if you really like this you can support me. I'll be very thankful, because it'll encourage me to make some better projects.</p>\n\r\nStory\r\n\r\n<p>You wake up in the castle prison, and you don't remember anything. You found out that you and some other people were kidnapped by somebody. But nobody knows who. So you talk to others and find out that you are the only one who can get them out. Then you find a sword and now your goal is simple get through all enemies, find out what happens and get out out here.</p>\n<p><em>And just a little tip. You should talk to every NPC.</em></p>\n\r\nControls\r\n\r\nMovement\r\n<ul><li>Move up - <strong>W</strong></li><li>Move left - <strong>A</strong></li><li>Move down - <strong>S</strong></li><li>Move right - <strong>D</strong></li></ul>\r\nAction\r\n<ul><li>Talk and buy - <strong>E</strong></li><li>Pause - <strong>ESC</strong></li></ul>\r\nCombat\r\n<ul><li>Swing sword - <strong>SPACE</strong></li><li>Throw dagger - <strong>R</strong></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T10:56:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e9/2e9c13ecd8643be3f32847a02865ff3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["gastyCode"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
