She seems to know her fate, firmly telling the hero not to save her. However, the hero still entered the monster's lair without hesitation, held a weapon in his hand, and wiped out many monsters.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs a player, you will play the role of a hero, guard the girl, and at the same time defeat the monster guards to unlock the \"true ending\" and lead the girls to the correct reunion.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou need to use spatial imagination to control the shooting trajectory of the gun with the mouse. After the bullet is fired, it will be refracted between obstacles until it hits the monster guard. But the energy of the bullet is limited, and it will disappear after flying for a period of time, so you must defeat the monster guards in each level within the specified time. If the bullets are exhausted and all the monster guards have not been defeated, the level will end in failure. After completing the level, you can get reward stars, and use the stars to unlock more exciting CG illustrations.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMay you become the hero of this alien capital, protect the girls, repel the monster guards, and lead them to the correct happy ending!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-25T03:55:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d0/3d0468fa151552918f4c5f9df9353d2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wild shot Game"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual"], "publishers": ["wild shot Game"], "esrb_rating": null}
