In my game, your save is in a folder created at save time, but on itch, the location of this folder always changes, and leads to weird bugs. I will not be implementing a save for the web version because this is just a demo and it's going to be a downloadable game once it's out. Sorry for the inconvenience, that means for now the parts shop won't work properly.</p>\n<p>Updates:</p>\n<p>It came to my attention that firewall and the heat exhaust were not properly hitting enemies, now they are properly hurting/burning enemies.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>Spacebar - Dash in mouse direction</p>\n<p>Right click - shoot RGBar</p>\n<p>Left click hold and drag - Firewall</p>\n<p>F - Change music</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<p>Unlock abilities by buying items for Bytes, which you pick up from defeated enemies.</p>\n<p>Continuously dodge enemies set before you while destroying them.</p>\n<p>Defeat the bosses and progress forward to the core of the problem...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T07:10:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/847/8473ae10b95487eb8701d3fd47549eab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bernbark"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
