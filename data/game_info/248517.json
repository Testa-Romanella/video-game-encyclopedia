'Our story begins, down a drain we are flushed. Did we slip ? Did we fall? Or was it a push?'  <br/><br/>From the original creators of Conker's Bad Fur Day, comes a delicately told tale of a dog which thinks it's a toy, or is it a toy that thinks it's a dog?<br/>Lost and alone in a richly detailed 2D world, you must help lead our sad pooch back home again......Just in time for tea.<br/><br/>EXPLORE... 'Don\u2019t just sit there and skulk, or curl up for a sulk. Lift that tail I implore, for it\u2019s time we explore.'  <br/><br/>Not for the faint-hearted, explore this dark and dingy labyrinth. Avoid its pitfalls, exploit its treasure, relish its marvels and so save those souls from a fate worse than death.NURTURE... 'What a horrible thing, bubbling brains in a jar. I suspect without these, we won't get too far.' <br/><br/>Light the way, drop in shadow, lay a scent, break his fall, grab a friend, fill that belly, make a bridge, set the fuse, plant a bomb, trap the monster, be his eyes and his heart, feed him up, wind that clock.<br/><br/>BUILD... 'Oh! With darkness around, foul creatures abound. Over here, out of sight, perhaps there\u2019s a light?' <br/><br/>Afraid of the dark, afraid of the depths, afraid even of his own shadow, Rusty needs his master. Resources abound, find them fast and forge new paths.. <br/>Keep him on track but don't dawdle too much, lest time catches up.PROTECT... 'A Monster dazed, but not forever. You sailed unscathed, beneath its lever.' <br/><br/>The murk and dank are not the only foes, for in these depths lurk others who've made this place their home. Sometimes they help, but most just don't care.<br/>You're passing through so stay alert and lay a path, that gentle nudge, that double bluff to bring our pup a little closer...To home.<br/><br/>CHERISH... 'Lazy Pooch, wants to snooze. Scratch his ear? Let him kip? Up to you, time to choose.' <br/><br/>And yet, this little pup has a mind of his own, so keep one eye on your friend but stay mindful of the daunting tasks that lay hidden ahead of him. <br/>Push him or cojole, trap him or avoid, awake or in slumber, Rusty will usually do as he is done by.
