To get out of this terrible place, you need to collect a password that will help you open the door to freedom. At the beginning of the game, you are armed only with an old piece of metal pipe, but if you are careful, you can also find firearms. There are not many cartridges, but if they are used correctly, then enough to win. Be careful, zombies are always on your trail.</p>\n<p>F - flashlight</p>\n<p>WASD - Player control</p>\n<p>R - weapon reloading</p>\n<p>E - interaction</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T14:00:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0d/b0de1ccc9fba6bf2c3bd7d8f5ed575de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HORGAME"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
