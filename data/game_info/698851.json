You travel out into the dirt on a creaking, left-swerving bus devoid of other passengers. It seems an eternity before the bus finally stops and the doors open. You eagerly step out, and that is when you discover (to your dismay) that the Long Hole is right under the bus stop, just under your feet as you stepped off! The wind whistles past your head as you plummet down the hole.</p>\n<p>In the event that you survive the fall, you think, you will have a very large hospital bill. Better collect the silver DBloons on the way down, to pay for your expenses! Twist and turn yourself in the air to collect the DBloons and avoid the protruding blocks. How long can you survive falling down...
