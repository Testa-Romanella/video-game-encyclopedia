Each opponent has unique mechanics and behavior, so to win you need accuracy in throwing knives and attentiveness with good reflexes to find your approach to each boss and win! Playing or winning, we will collect coins to buy new knives that serve not only for throwing, but also unlock new opponents. Each boss can be encountered in two knife throwing competitions. <br/></p>\n<p>The first one is <strong>\u00abKnife Master\u00bb</strong>. All bosses are open at once, and they need to be defeated one by one, passing all levels while spending the minimum number of attempts and setting new records.\r\n  \r\nThe second is a <strong>\u00abKnife vs Knife\u00bb</strong>.
