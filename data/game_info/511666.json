Fight the boss when you think you are ready and go on to the next level.</p>\n<p><strong>Making:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>I wanted to make a space shooter but with more freedom of movement than you usually see. Also wanted a little bit of arcade feel, but have it look a little more modern. <br/></p>\n<p>This was made for the revival jam, the point was to use an existing idea/project and finish it. this is what my original project looked like:</p>\n\n<p>There wasn't really anything to do and the control were very different. So basically everything that is currently in the game was added during the jam. However I had the idea to create a game like this for quite a while, and already had ideas about how everything was going to look like.</p>\n<p>Because this was made using Godot the game is going to lag a little bit when an effect is used for the first time in the game, however once they are all loaded in it should run smooth (I hope). <br/></p>\n<p>Also fun fact: the only sprites used in this game are for the rockets and some basic shapes for  particles. Everything else is generated using shaders.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Mouse: Aim &amp; shoot</li><li>WASD: Steer/switch weapons in weapon view</li><li>Q: Open/close weapon view</li><li>E: Open/close map</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/></strong>Sounds:</p>\n<ul><li>Kenney.nl \u00a0Sci-fi sounds &amp; impact sounds</li></ul>\n<p>Music:</p>\n<ul><li><em>Humble Match</em> - Patrick De Arteaga</li><li><em>Heroic Intrusion</em> - Patrick De Arteaga</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T02:44:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d4/2d42d566c03e0d3ceb56090bfb2ecbce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Deep-Fold"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
