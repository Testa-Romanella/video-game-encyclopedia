I made this prototype-of-a-prototype while unemployed when I had time to learn\u00a0how to model and make simple art assets. I hope to eventually\u00a0flesh this out more in the future and expand on the story. I'd also love to add functionality to allow you to give to the environment rather than just exploit it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game should take 10-15 minutes to play. You can control Coriander with the arrow keys, press the space bar to jump\u00a0and use z to interact and chop down trees. Also note that you can not chop trees down immediately.\u00a0If you have any major issues with it (like a game breaking bug, the game won't load, etc) please let me know and I'll try to patch it with a fix. Otherwise this is the final version until I decide to build on it and likely expand into a different game entirely.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you end up playing this thank you! Feel free to leave a comment with thoughts on it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T07:38:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85e/85e47282eda81fdb51d77af172853e80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["blade_kissed"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
