I am learning unity so I thought to make one of my favourite games. Please download, install and play. :)</p>\n<p>Story :\u00a0 You are Roger,\u00a0the only Laser Defender\u00a0left which is assigned to eliminate all enemy space ships . You have been provided a modified\u00a0alien tech which creates unlimmited laser beams (so don't worry about running out of bullets). If 10 enemies complete their path (go offscreen) instead of dying then its game over and ofcource they shoot you too, so be carefull not to die in a burning spaceship. SUIT UP, Roger!!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T20:03:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3b/c3b7c14b3b8b44433baed67d8d413541.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ShubhamBrody2609"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
