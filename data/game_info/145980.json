Each level incorporates a part of \r\nthe Princes' journeys to win the hand of Princess Nouronnihar. The papery background suggests that you're playing in the pages of the book itself -- you drive the story forward as you play the game. This isn't exactly a fresh concept, but we feel that it works especially well with the aesthetics and theme of our entry.</p><p>\r\n\tYou may notice that our character is a Djinn and not a prince. While we didn't have enough time to implement the surrounding \r\nstory to our game,  it thematically made sense that a mythical \r\ncreature, the Grine, could act as the protagonist. The Grine is a type of \r\ndjinn that exists in an alternate world/dimension. It is intimately paired with a human in \r\nour world, and each of their actions have an affect on the other. While \r\nthe King is listening to Scheherazade's story and being drawn into the \r\ndream world, \r\n\t<em>you play as the Grine in the book's world</em> by acting out these stories.</p><p>\n<strong>CC0</strong></p><p>\r\n\tAll of our code and assets have been released to the public domain, free of charge.<br/></p><p>Source: Art assets + Code (scripts) + Unity scene file<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Story</strong></p><p>\r\n\tThe first prince finds a magic carpet that can \r\ntransport him anywhere; we've turned that into a short distance teleport that our Djinn has to use to cross large distances and move through \r\nmultiple objects.</p><p>\r\n\tThe second prince finds a magic tube that allows him\r\n to see anything; we've turned that into a controllable scryer that \r\nreveals hidden traps our Djinn would otherwise not be able to see.</p><p>\r\n\tThe third prince finds a magic apple that cures any \r\naliments; we've turned that into a projectile the Djnn uses to heal afflicted townspeople and block hostile projectles.</p><p>\r\n\tEach level you're given a skill that you must master in order to beat the level.</p><p>\n<strong>Instructions</strong></p><ul>\n<li><strong>Level 1: </strong>Master jumping, timing, acceleration, and wall jumping to prepare yourself for the challenges ahead.</li>\n<li><strong>Level 2: </strong>You're now able to teleport ahead a short distance using the <strong>'F' Key.</strong> Use this to move through enemy projectiles and reach distant platforms.</li>\n<li><strong>Level 3: </strong>You're now able to sense invisible traps.
