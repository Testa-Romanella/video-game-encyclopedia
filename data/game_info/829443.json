All assets, coding,\u00a0UI elements etc\u00a0were made by me during the jam. Music was downloaded and free of copyright.</em>\n<p><em>Dive Deeper is and endless puzzle game where you try to fix some modules to get oxygen and dive as far as you can.</em></p>\r\nHOW TO PLAY\r\n<p>Get close to the objects in each level.\u00a0When you get close to an object your sixth sense lets you know you reached it and you hear the puzzle sounds. Open the multi-tool to fix them with the right tools (play matching sounds). The flashlight lets you equip it for some seconds. The Oxygen Tank gives you oxygen and unlocks the next platform. Move to the left to fall to the next platform. You don't need to fix the flashlight to get to the next level. If your oxygen runs out you lose and return to the main menu.</p>\r\nSOUND PUZZLE\r\n<p>When you play the sounds with the multitool you have to keep track how many you played. The puzzle resets every time you play a full set of notes. eg. if you hear the notes A, C, F#. you have to play sets of 3. once you play 3 notes if they dont match the puzzle your note reset, so if you play G, A, C, F# even though the A C F# sounds correct, the game will have registered G A C, reset, F#...(waiting for the rest)</p>\r\nDEVELOPER NOTES\r\n<p>I am aware that it ended up pretty hard to get past even level 3-4.\u00a0 I didn't manage to playtest it enough and fix this in these 9 Hours.\u00a0 If you like it leave a comment and i will gladly update it and add more.</p>\r\nTRILETRIJAM BUILDS\r\n<ol><li>\u00a0Deepr1 = (First build, download, main game)\u00a0 aprox 8 hours</li><li>\u00a0DiveDeeper.rar =\u00a0(Second build, download, added menu and UI)\u00a0aprox 8.5 hours</li><li>\u00a0DiveDeeper.zip =\u00a0(Third build,\u00a0HTML, converted project to WebGL) 9 Hours</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T10:09:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf4/cf4056501887b3336f78a05c59d3584a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["AlanIII"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
