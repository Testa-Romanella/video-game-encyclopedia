Dr. Max used his Z-virus to infect the human colony and made them zombies. Dr. Max did make an antidote for the virus in case the things go out of hands (which did happen). Neo realized it soon that the antidote which can save the world is inside the evil laboratory of Dr. Max. Unfortunately, the lab is already filled with the deadly zombies protecting the antidote so that their colony could harvest and survive. Neo is the only human alive (Patient Zero) who is not infected and can save the world if he can get the antidote and help zombies turn back to humans. With the power potions inside the lab, Neo gets superpowers to fight the zombies but at the cost of his life points. Will he be able to manage his life points and power in a sustainable way to survive the battle against the zombies in order to steal and secure the cure?!
