I used the\u00a0Animals Wearing Jackets Asset Pack by snailscode for Asset Jam 2. The entire game is a large grid, with all units fitting neatly into the visual grid and all gameplay being grid-based. The score is an incremental game mechanic, increasing as you click to add new creatures, and as they reproduce in patterns.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T06:21:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/171/171da4d0ecf826d5d87a6533aaffff7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Gunnar Clovis"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
