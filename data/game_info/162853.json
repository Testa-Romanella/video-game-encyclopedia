These monsters will try to hide in the vortexes, but while they are out, you can blast them with magic bolts and your ultimate weapon, the Megaspell. Remember, though, that the magic bolts need to recharge and the Megaspell can only be used once. But above all else, DON'T LET THE MONSTERS CATCH YOU! You will regret it! Use WASD or the arrow keys to move, move the mouse to aim, the left click button to fire a magic bolt, and the right click button to fire the Megaspell.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce5/ce5f5eaed45268133eaf05e7cb565de2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kablamo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
