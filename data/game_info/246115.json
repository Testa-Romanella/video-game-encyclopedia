There are different traps and enemies to avoid. Collecting gems within the levels unlocks more characters to play as. Those characters have their own abilities and can make getting to some gems easier. The unique controls are tricky to get used to but the game offers a challenge and each character you unlock adds more to master.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/359/359abddee8d8e002be5f81d275a93725.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Legion Works Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
