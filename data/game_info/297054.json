Before playing, just know that I'm kind of new to the game development community and that this is my first game jam! To be honest, this is the first game that I have ever actually finished and released. So be prepared for some bugs! I'm also quite young (being in middle school) and just want to have some fun, so I'm not the kind of person who made this game to win. I just hope you enjoy it! Try speed-running it because I put in a bit of tech that those who like to play games fast may find interesting. Thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>Controls: W - Jump,\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A - Move Left,\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0D - Move Right</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T05:11:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6eb/6eb9a74cf73928224bbad5fcbe6ab6c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RussoGamer1"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
