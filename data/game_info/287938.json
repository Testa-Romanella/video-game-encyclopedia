It's what makes a dragon's lair a true home! But the citizens and soldiers of the slime kingdom took exception to your interior design choices, and are coming to take your precious things away! Keep the slimes at bay with your fearsome claws for as long as you can and show them the sort of devastation a dragon can do when they're protecting their home!<br/></p>\n<p>Controls - Use your hands to smack, smash, slap, punch, flick, and tap slimes, and to pick up any loot of yours they drop along the way.</p>\n<p>\u00c9quipe \u00c9toile Reborn (Team Reborn Star)</p>\n<ul><li><strong>L\u00e9andre Bolduc</strong>\u00a0- Game Designer, Level Designer</li><li><strong>Anthony Cousineau</strong>\u00a0- Game Designer, Sound Designer</li><li><strong>Alexis Morin</strong>\u00a0- Programmer, Animator</li><li><strong>Roxane Morin</strong>\u00a0- 3D Artist</li><li><strong>Justin Loranger-Ahluwalia</strong>\u00a0- Programmer</li><li><strong>Alexandre Gagn\u00e9</strong>\u00a0- 3D Artist</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-28T04:18:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76a/76a94d5bf7d42d4eaa8c1ba0889b69fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Trichotome"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
