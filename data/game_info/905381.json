Controls are simple, space bar or left mouse click to jump. Most features haven't been fully implemented, such as coins, character selection, achievements, etc. On the level selection map, there is an icon called \"Horizon\". Do not click it, as that hasn't been implemented either.</p>\n<p>The point of this test is to test the game's physics. Once you select the level and start the game, press Esc or the pause button and open the in-game settings menu. You can adjust the jump height, gravity, and speed of the player. Try tweaking these numbers and let me know which numbers feel the best for you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T11:41:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab3/ab3991233a3b36851bcfc1ff0bd85988.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Phantomforce"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
