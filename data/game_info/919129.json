Do you like super-short tabletop games with adaptable rules? Have you ever been accused of being perhaps a smidgen melodramatic?</p>\n<p><strong><em>If you answered \"yes\" to any of the above, Blackjoe is the game for you! <br/></em></strong></p>\n<p>This FREE one-page micro-RPG can be played with zero prep in a minute or less! The PDF is lovingly doodled-upon and filled with wacky prompts to keep the joe flowing. <br/></p>\n<p>If heavily formatted documents aren't your thing, there's also a more straightforward black-and-white PDF, so everyone can play!</p>\n\n<p>If you enjoy Blackjoe and want to see more TTRPGs from me, you can make my day by leaving a comment! If you're able, you can also donate either by downloading the game again or by visiting my Ko-fi. Regardless, thank you SO much for playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T15:38:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eed/eed1b3a1106c415b77408a01cd2f1d15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Games by Lithish!"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
