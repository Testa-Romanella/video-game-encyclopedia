Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.</li></ol>\n<p>Since its publication, it has attracted a lot of interest due to the great variability in pattern evolution. Life is considered to be a good example of emergency and self-organization. It is interesting for scientists, mathematicians, economists, and others to see how complex patterns can come from implementing very simple rules.</p>\n<p><strong>How To Play?</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Move camera with arrow keys and\u00a0mouse wheel</li><li>With left click you can add cells.</li><li>Right-click to start the simulation.</li><li>The top slider helps decrease or increase the speed of the simulation.</li><li>L to clean current cells.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-16T03:06:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e46/e461b39e2e51ebb4c4cd391a8c792494.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ivaCode"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
