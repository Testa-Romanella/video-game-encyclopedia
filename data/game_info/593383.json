Discard piles are formed by placing cards on them either in the order 1 to 12 or as sets with the same card values \u200b\u200b(e.g. 2,2,2,2). Newly started discard piles must be at least 3 cards in size.<br/><br/> 'J' cards act as wild cards. You can represent any number you want.<br/><br/>The game round begins with the player picking up a minimum number of auxiliary cards from the deck. If he has at least 3 cards in a sequence or set, he can start building a discard pile in the middle of the table.<br/>A player can discard as many cards as possible in a round.<br/><br/>If he cannot discard a card or if he does not want to, he ends his turn.
