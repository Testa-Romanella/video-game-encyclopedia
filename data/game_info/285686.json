The feeling of joy once you get it there is what makes this game so fun and addicting.</strong><br/><br/>Bouncing DVD : The Game is based on a bygone tech where you put silver circles into a plastic box and you could watch movies!<br/>This system was brilliant and even more so of the discovery of  a feature when the logo on the idle screen, would... one in a blue moon, hit the corner of the screen. Thousands of flip phone recordings show the moment when this very event happens. Blah blah blah, that time is over... UNTIL TODAY <br/>Now you can take control of the DVD logo and try to hit the corners. Your controls are limited so it takes real skill and maybe a bit of luck to even get 5 corner hits!<br/><br/>The world record, set by yours truely is 5000. Can you beat it?<br/><br/>This game is a free to play timewaster. Enjoy it, loathe it and uninstall it. That's what we did! REVIEWS <br/>We have one review-sounding comment from one of our playtesters which perfectly sums up the game, which we will leave you with now...<br/><br/>\"\"dangerously mediocre levels of fun\"", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:49:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/955/955efa120384f0ff0e4ce09070666bd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RoomsForRockets"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["RoomsforRockets"], "esrb_rating": null}
