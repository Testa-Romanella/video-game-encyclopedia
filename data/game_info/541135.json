Unfortunately one day much like every other , The \"Beholders\" showed up , they ruthlessly killed many of my people and to the few \"lucky\" ones who were spared, were thrown and incarcerated into small confined spaces. At first glance they look easy to escape but its very much the contrary... The beholders ensured our captivity by creating two dimensions inside the spaces. Unfortunately we can only see one dimension , or well at least the entirety of my species , but not me. I was the only baby born after the beholders arrived and a woman who I use to share spaces with raised me , took care of me and\u00a0named me Number 0.She said my name represented a new beginning\u00a0 for our kind a, reset if you will. Anyways, I don't know if that has any correlation with the fact that\u00a0I was born with the ability to\u00a0peek into the other dimension , but not for long ,I can only do it for a limited amount of time. With this ability on my side I will ensure that my kind yet against knows a world of peace and happiness.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T07:34:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e56/e56dff40ad72a1878e8c4ca8641918b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Liibby"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
