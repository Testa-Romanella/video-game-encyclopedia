Hence, it is highly encouraged to HOLD DOWN 8 or 9 in order to accelerate or decelerate (rather than just pressing 8 and 9 once). Basically, in this clone, accelerating and decelerating is more gradual. You can know if you are going fast if you hear an audio change or if you see the money meter (in the bottom left)\u00a0go up.\u00a0</p><p>Enjoy!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T05:53:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e5/0e505ef0ffcebe30574ee354edefa032.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["philippark0203"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
