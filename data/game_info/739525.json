But his power was not enough for him, and he revived an ancient demon who had been sealed in a statue. But instead of granting him his power, the demon consumed the king&#39;s soul and possessed his body. He then swore to destroy humanity once and for all.</p>\n<p>After several years, the fake Siegwald led his armies to conquer lands and expand his empire. At that time, a warrior named Jay arrived at the port city of Heles. Now he must find loyal allies and eventually stop the Emperor&#39;s evil plans.</p>\n<p>Miraculum: The Last Revelation plays like a traditional Japanese-style RPG, with a world map, towns and dungeons to visit, and enemies to defeat in random turn-based battles. The setting is mostly medieval fantasy, but there are sci-fi elements as well. The player&#39;s party can use a variety of moves in battles, and it is also possible to set the characters on AI mode, only assigning them general strategies. Graphically the game resembles typical 16-bit Japanese RPGs, but it has some anime-style movies, CD audio music, and voice-overs for important conversations.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-15T04:19:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62f/62f0dbba36cacc9ed46be30f08d0b4ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 188, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["NEC Home Electronics"], "esrb_rating": null}
