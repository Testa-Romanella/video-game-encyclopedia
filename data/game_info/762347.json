Beware of the clone Simunauts...<br/></p><p>A maze puzzler created for the 72-hour Mini Jam 103: Darkness game jam. The theme for the jam was 'darkness' with the limitation 'you are your own enemy'. This game requires you to activate 4 lotus plants to unlock the escape hatch. The limitation was executed by \u00a0spawning a clone of the player each time a lotus is activated. The clones mimic the movements of the player absolutely, and will destroy the player on contact.</p>\n<p>This game features an original soundtrack I created for the project, as well as the amazing sprite animations of @rumblecade here on itch.io<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T15:00:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca1/ca13b6f8985c75abe28a7486f0b06b63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Substance5271"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
