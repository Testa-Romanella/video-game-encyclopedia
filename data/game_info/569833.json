{"id": 569833, "slug": "moke", "name": "Moke", "name_original": "Moke", "description": "<p>Moke is a simple platforming game where you go on a journey in a world of chaos and harmony. The surroundings are evil and good and there is no balance. It's up to you to discover the balance and perhaps your purpose.</p>\n<p>This game was a course submission with the limitation of 3 levels. Due to the \"spaghetti code\" and the lack of motivation for the project, I decided not to continue the project and I put it in a side-folder for weeks, but then I decided to release it. It might be really short, but I think it is a short small cute game that people could enjoy and experience. Besides, this is one of my most complete games and why let a project rot when it's playable, beatable, and most importantly enjoyable?</p>\n<p>I hope you all enjoy this short experience and quick advice, if you have done a game that you genuinely think it's fun release it. Show the world what you are capable of.</p>\n<p>You can find the soundtrack here:\u00a0https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlWm27AYcCbw4NOIAc4jKz8cOtFOL6UDI</p>\n<p>As I said, I hope you all find this little adventure enjoyable :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T07:25:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ed/8edad06cd6e702f382041dbe9ceaebb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Demiero"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
