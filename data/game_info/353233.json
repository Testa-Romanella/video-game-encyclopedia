Keyboard controls are \"W\" for up, \"Left Arrow\" for left, and \"Right Arrow\" for right.</p>\n<p>There is also a jank map editor built-in triggered by typing \"&lt;3\" on the title screen. Maps are saved in the Data folder (differs by platform) within StreamingAssets &gt; CustomSongs &gt; SongName. The file format is pretty self-explanatory once viewed in a text editor if you look at the existing maps.</p>\n<p>This game was made over three days for Summer Slow Jams 2019, hosted by PIGSquad. The theme was \"3-Button, 3-Color\".\u00a0Hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-27T11:42:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65b/65b8b5aff7a422ba9088ba01abff2895.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Guatapuri"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
