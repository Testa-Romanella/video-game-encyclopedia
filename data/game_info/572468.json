But there's no code to enter that door, well, there's no other level to go!</p>\n<p>There was some code to have lights in the ceiling which could be shot at as well as using staircases to move between floors but didn't make it into this build.</p>\n<p>The guards\u00a0(too many) are completely unaware of their surroundings and don't bother if you start shooting at them.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>left/right</strong>: move</li><li><strong>down</strong>: kneel</li><li><strong>down/up:</strong> inside the elevator: move down/up one floor</li><li><strong>e</strong>: enter a document door</li><li><strong>z</strong>: shoot</li></ul>\n<p><em>This is an unfinished prototype, there are\u00a0a lot of bugs and a lot of functionality is missing.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T06:17:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1e/c1e4f9549336e88e5d4d22132704ae13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mulitasoft"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
