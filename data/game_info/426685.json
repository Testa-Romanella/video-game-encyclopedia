Run around, shoot enemies and try not to fall down in a quest of achieving glory (or merely trying to stay alive).\u00a0 Gain enough score points and arena will change shapes, drop floor beneath you or maybe even summon something very angry and dangerous... You'll find out :)</p><p><strong>You win</strong> by going through all stages.</p><p><strong>You lose</strong> if your hp runs out or you fall down.</p>\n<p>Game turned out to be pretty hard, so expect to start anew couple of times. If it feels a bit frustrating, I highly encourage you to leave a comment with suggestion, and I'll think of something. Thus, Im leaving this project in prototype state.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>WASD - movement</p>\n<p>Mouse - Aim</p>\n<p>Click to shoot</p>\n\n<p><strong>- Original music:</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T04:28:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e77/e776a0a5cbb7be3d27babb829972dcd2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IsWatcher"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
