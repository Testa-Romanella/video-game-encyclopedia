Each pair has a set of different ideas regarding where to place the furniture. Like, one couple wants the large sofa at the right wall. The other couple wants it in the middle of the room.</p>\n<p>But you don't have a lot of  time so be quick to implement your ideas before time runs out! The couple that gets the most of their plans completed 'wins'.<br/></p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Game requires two gamepads with four players. Each couple gets one controller where one player uses the left stick and the left trigger while the other uses the right stick and the right trigger. Because sharing is caring, as long as it within the same couple of course.</p>\n<p>Press R to restart.<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Made during Global Game Jam 2019 with the theme \"What home means to you\"<br/></p>\n<p>- Sebastian Strandberg\u00a0@Liq<br/>- Andreas Wilcox @svdvorak<br/>- David Torbj\u00f6rnsson</p>\n\r\nKnown issues\r\n<p>For some reason players won't move unless all players gets input at the same time. Meaning that all players have to do something at the same time (which fortunately, is most likely the case).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-16T07:29:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f64/f64c173e10c4516f6a5c046a180ce509.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anwilc"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
