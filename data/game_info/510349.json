It's your first and foremost weapon -- spit out bombs at other players to cause them to absorb them!\u00a0But if a bomb blows up in <strong>your</strong> mouth, it'll hurt <strong>a lot more</strong> than a cavity. Yeet bombs at your friends\u00a0to blow them out of this <strong>hot potato battle royale</strong>!<br/></p>\n<p>Created by <strong>Alston Chan, Jamie Ip, Trevina Tan, </strong>and <strong>Jonas Ong</strong> for Bear Jams\u00a0Fall 2020</p>\n<p><strong>How To Play with Friends:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>1. Get friends</p>\n<p>2. One person creates a room by entering their name and preferred room code (this will be the host)</p>\n<p>3. All other players join by entering their own names and the same room code</p>\n<p>4. Once the host clicks \"Begin the Game\", the game will start for everyone.</p>\n<p>5. Simply refresh the page to play again.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>WASD</strong> to move</p>\n<p>--\u00a0<strong>W</strong> to jump, press W twice\u00a0for a double-jump</p>\n<p><strong>Click</strong> and\u00a0<strong>hold</strong> to charge up your absorbed bomb and throw it in the direction of your cursor.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tips and Tricks:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- Bombs start glowing red when they're about to explode. Either run away or use the opportunity to bomb someone!</p>\n<p>- A player will only die if a bomb explodes inside them. You want to time things so that you throw the bombs close enough to be absorbed, with as little time on the bomb timer as possible.</p>\n<p>- Hold your mouse button to charge up the bomb; the longer it's charged, the further it'll fly.</p>\n<p>- Bombs can collide with each other too; if you see a bomb coming your way, divert its path by throwing another bomb at it.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Art:\u00a0https://pixelfrog-store.itch.io/pirate-bomb</p>\n<p>Music: \"Three Red Hearts, Prepare to Dev Edition\" by Abstraction</p>\n<p>UI Assets:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/modern-ui-pack-150824</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T03:37:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01a/01ab47f2036333be989292ae0e34c265.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["alstonchan64", "trevinatan", "jamieup"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
