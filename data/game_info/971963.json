Date a vampire, who thinks he\u2019s got magic powers. A monster girl, who\u2019s in love with Halloween despite not knowing when it is. Or explore your villainous side- and romance the Spider Queen herself. There\u2019s someone incredible looking for love around every corner. Of course, if you\u2019re feeling a little spicy- you can break some hearts instead and friendzone them all. With a whopping 400 funny scenarios and a staggering 120 different endings, every choice you make counts in crafting your own love-filled apocalypse!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Vando\u2019s magic powers have come at great cost. He suffers from an array of severe allergies- from the inability to eat most foods to a nasty sunlight allergy, he spends most of his time cooped in the local castle. Vando loves to host extravagant parties, take care of dangerous beasts, and set his enemies ablaze.<br/><br/><br/>Haley loves everything spooky, and Halloween most of all. She leaves the local dungeon every day to go trick-or-treating among the locals, and eat their precious candy. She doesn\u2019t know when Halloween is, so she goes out every day- and the locals never correct her because they like having her around so much.<br/><br/><br/>Cursed with a severe case of bad luck. Nothing seems to go Frank\u2019s way. Yet, despite it all, he remains cheerful, optimistic, and upbeat. He loves his community and will do anything to see you smile.<br/><br/><br/>Cleo\u2019s just now retired from the hero lifestyle, and is trying to enjoy her free time off. Problem is, she\u2019s fiercely competitive and obsessed with victory at any cost. Retirement may not have come easy to Cleo but plenty of other things have- such as her ability to crush boulders with her thighs.<br/><br/><br/>Al just wants to have a sweet time. He loves to try crazy stunts and can\u2019t help but party the day away. But don\u2019t let his rowdy exterior fool you- he\u2019s a marine biologist and fierce animal conservationist. Most of all, he\u2019s the most loyal friend anyone can ask for.<br/><br/><br/>Tessa\u2019s made plenty of money, and is definitely wealthy enough to retire. Her problem is- she loves crime. Can\u2019t get enough of it. Her mood ranges from manipulative to crazy- and she knows it. Do you hate the system? Would you like to overthrow it, while setting everything in your path on fire? Do you want to wake up the next morning naked in a different state, with your hands tied behind your back? Well I have just the girl for you.<h3>Dating with Absurd!</h3>At the core of the game lies an abundance of humorous scenarios, supporting both single-player and up to four-player online gameplay.
