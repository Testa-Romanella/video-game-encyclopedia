We loved morel mushroom hunting growing up. We still do it every year. One of the greatest things about mushroom hunting is just being out in nature. We take a lot of photos while we are hunting which is how the game came about. We wanted to create an immersive experience of being out in nature, mushroom hunting, and photographing the beautiful environment around you into a game, without having to hunt something with a weapon.<br/><br/><br/>Although one of the main goals of the game is to collect mushrooms, it Is Not a mushroom hunter simulator. Morels is an adventure game that focuses equally on mushroom hunting and photographing animals.<br/><br/>If you have any feedback, questions, or problems with the game please don't hesitate to contact us.<h3>Other Notable Features</h3><br/><ul><li>Explore and discover new collectables like a crystal skull and robot parts.</li></ul><ul><li>Several new animals, insects, and objects to discover and photograph.</li></ul><ul><li> Enjoy a new experience each season you play.
