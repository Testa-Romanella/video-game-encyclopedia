{"id": 678255, "slug": "scarcity-meets-opportunity", "name": "Scarcity Meets Opportunity", "name_original": "Scarcity Meets Opportunity", "description": "<p>Post Covid-19. You have now entered into a world where more than 40% percent of the population has been laid off due to business\u2019 inability to stay afloat in an uncertain economy. Many of the older generations have spent their lives acquiring hands-on skills such as\u00a0 factory work. Many of them do not have sufficient skills to work from home. Lemy (age 18), and Jesi (age 21), are scared for their parents. They\u2019ve both lost their jobs and are running out of money to keep the family of 7 afloat. Lemy and Jesi decide that they\u2019re both going to start an online business that answers a need that has arisen from the \u201cnew world.\u201d</p>\n<p>There's one big problem. They don\u2019t know the first thing about starting a business and to make matters worse, they have very little money. But they both have special skills that could help them put the puzzle pieces together. In fact, they both have awesome ideas and the vultures (business sharks) are lurking around hoping they can steal their businesses from them. If Lemi and Jesi can figure out the steps to start a business and avoid the pitfalls, they can save their family home and eventually create generational wealth for their family.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-11T07:36:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ce/8ce033f270a5870852655979f9c8e8b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["TiaTia"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
