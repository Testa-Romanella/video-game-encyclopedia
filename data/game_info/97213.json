Avoid alien monsters, ghosts, traps, and other super deadly stuff that are the only things between you and ungodly riches! Features a bangin' chiptune soundtrack!</p><p>A retro inspired platformer created for the \"Weirder Stuff\" Game Jam. We thought it'd be fun to self-impose a CGA color palette to see if we could make something decent with such a limited base of colors. We had to cheat a little and use one shade of grey, as well as the dark cyan and dark purple.<br/></p><p>Please leave any comments, we love to get feedback!</p><p>Thanks for playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2b/d2ba53b4072343dec829ddd56a7fea1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Midnight Mastodons"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
