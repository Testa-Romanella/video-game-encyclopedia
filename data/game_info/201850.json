{"id": 201850, "slug": "typen-run", "name": "Type'n Run", "name_original": "Type'n Run", "description": "<p>In \u201cType\u2019n Run\u201d you play as a medieval hero fighting through hordes of evil monsters!<br/></p>\n<p>Our idea was to mix both \u2018Typing\u2019 as well as \u2018Infinity Run\u2019 games, two genres with completely different reaction times! Every movement is made by typing in the action you want to make, it\u2019s easy right?</p>\n<p>So in order to make our hero jump, you need to type in \u201cjump\u201d.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The action is only executed when aproaching an obstacle. So when you type \u201cjump\u201d for instance, our hero will jump only when close enough to an enemy, hole or platform. You can kill enemies with \u201cattack\u201d, or avoid them with jump. Also you can defend incoming projectiles with the \u201cdefend\u201d action.</p>\n<p>Have fun!
