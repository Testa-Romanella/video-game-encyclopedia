Here, you're not the king. Incarnate a lost lion cub unable to protect himself and searching for his family.</p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p>In WILD\u00a0you play a Lion Cub separated from his family. Helpless and alone in the savannah, you need to be careful to survive in this hostile environment and get back to your family. You must avoid predators, hide in bush and use your lion cub instinct\u00a0to get back alive.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We are a group of 15 students, 12 of the Video Game axis of the Institute of Internet and Multimedia(IIM) and 3 of Audio workshop. We had several constraints for the project, that it has to be done in 2 months and that the game has an isometric view. We hope you enjoy our game!</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nGame Designer\r\n<p>William Filipe-Amir Alotounou-Pierre Louis Dulieu</p>\r\nGame Programer\r\n<p>Adrien Ribeiro-Florian Ribeiro-Loick Gombauld-Hugo Benrabia</p>\r\nGame Artist\r\n<p>Chris Ivan- 3D artist</p>\n<p>Sebastien Rioux- 2D artist</p>\r\nSound Designer\r\n<p>Fabien Boasso-Olivier Penchenier-Floriane Morel</p>\r\nGame Producing\r\n<p>Etienne Renard</p>\n<p>Alexander Murphy</p>\n<p>Damien Leclercq- Associate Producer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T07:50:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d0/8d00d19ed99dac758134804e91ab8634.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Damien Leclercq", "Amir1632", "William FILIPE", "S\u00e9bastien Rioux"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
