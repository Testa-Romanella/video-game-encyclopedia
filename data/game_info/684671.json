This version is currently under development with a projected release date of November 2nd, 2021.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In a world where color was stolen, only <em>you </em>can restore life back to the black and white prison. The goal of Color Quest is to travel through different biomes and meet NPCs to collect colors to fill your palette and restore color to the world. The 2D terrain must be traversed between different biomes while clearing obstacles that only color can help with. You can only wield the colors that you\u2019ve already collected which provides an element of challenge to successfully fill the world with color.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Color Quest is meant to be a relaxing and low-stakes game that players can pick up wherever they happen to be and for however long they happen to have. Unlike other coloring games, Color Quest implements the use of story in order to give players motivation and heroic feelings of accomplishment upon freeing the world from the antagonist, Dr. Mono Chrome. \r\n</p>\n\n<p><em>Controls</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>A</strong>: Move right</p>\n<p><strong>D</strong>: Move left\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Space bar</strong>: Jump</p>\n<p><strong>W</strong>: Cycle through palette</p>\n<p><strong>S</strong>: Cycle through palette</p>\n\n<p><em>Credits</em></p>\n<p><strong>Jamison Piper:</strong> Game Designer</p>\n<p><strong>Karan Singh:</strong>\u00a0Audio Designer and Programmer\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Nicole Stocks:</strong>\u00a0Artist\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Reid Harry:</strong> Lead Programmer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T09:47:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/010/010c22fd194c7676d93ea0b1651c83a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nicole Stocks"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
