This is our first game and I would like to say that it is in no way at all close to being done. I would love feedback but I am still working hard on this project and this is just a cool demo. Right now it is just a standard platformer but I will add more mechanics (like the achievements) at a later date.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>I just wanted to say two things: 1.) This music is not mine. It is CC0 Music. 2.) When I sourced the music, I kept a credits doc. This doc did not save. I have done my best to recreate the list but some names could be wrong or missing.
