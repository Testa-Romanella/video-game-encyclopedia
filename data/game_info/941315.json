Despite the knight's instructions,\u00a0 Lucy ran into the rickety building. The worried father ran after his daughter to help her, but she seemed to disappear into a portal in the center of the room. You enter the same portal, and end up in the PastryVerse, an alternative reality where everything, including humans, was turned into pastries.<br/><br/>Your objective is to fight your way through a whimsical set of environments, defeating a variety selection of bakery goods. Throughout your journey you meet bigger adversaries, such as Sir S. Shortcake, an opportunistic squire who took advantage of the chaos by taking rule of Strawberry Fields.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T15:56:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18f/18f3431e98bd8d685fb6a3e7fdd0e2d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 204, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["supermenace"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
