You are a runaway on the train to nowhere. <br/><em>Though not everything is what it seems....</em><br/>The other passengers are like you, running from something they deem worth escaping but trapped on this train that has only two ways out, solve your way to the front and hit the brakes, or death.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>We recommend the Script Change and the consent checklist by Gehenna Gaming, but you are free to use ones that work for you</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Purchase Includes:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>1 trifold brochure\u00a0</li><li>Character Creation</li><li>A Breakdown of how to play</li><li>At least 4 different ways to play</li></ul>\n<p>You will need:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>4 - 5 players\r\n</li><li>A full set of Game Dice\r\n</li><li>A Deck of Cards</li><li>Index Cards for Character creation</li><li>Playtime of 2 - 5 hours</li></ul>\n<p>Roleplay [x][x][x][x][x]\r\n</p>\n<p>Mechanics [x][x][x ][ ][ ]\r\n</p>\n<p>Combat [x][x][ ][ ][ ]</p>\n<p><strong>Made for the 2023 Firelights Jam<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Thank you to our playtesters!</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Jenna Marie (@forgottentroupe)\r\n</li><li>Jasper Adams (@JewelledCrown)\r\n</li><li>Technomancer Kyle (@YFTechno)\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T08:32:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ee/7ee783a34e150b5085c02d0314a002c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lost Guide Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
