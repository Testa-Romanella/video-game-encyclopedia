However, the players are afflicted with different types of colorblindness making communication with color difficult, do players must find alternative solutions.</p>\n<p><em>Roses Are Red</em>\u00a0simulates some of the challenges people have if they suffer from a color blindness.\u00a0When playing the game, we encourage players to put their screens back-to-back, so that each can only see their own side. This is to prevent players from learning that they are afflicted with deuteranopia and tritanopia, respectively. In truth, the solution to every puzzle in\u00a0<em>Roses Are Red</em>\u00a0is to match colors, but this is impossible because the players do not perceive color in the same way. Our hope is that, through the communication struggles players will face, they can come to a better understanding of the difficulties of being\u00a0color-blind.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong>\u00a0Before starting the game, please read SettingUp.pdf, included with the download.\u00a0This is needed to have our intended experience with the game.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Roses Are Red</em>\u00a0is an award-winning game!
