Fluid movement, mouse direction, moving parts and pixel art.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pixel Art, Gamedesign &amp; Programming:</strong> Narsiph</p>\n<p><strong>Music:</strong> Chains | Music Wolf</p>\n<p><strong>Sound Effects:</strong> Internet and tweaked</p>\n\n<p>Move with WASD around and use left click to do the majority of stuff. The game shouldn't last longer than 20 seconds to give you an impression but you could enjoy the music track all the while you're giving away coffee.</p>\n\n<p>I have no interest in making a game out of this but I am willing to give up code and pixel art if you wan't to do it. Just send me a message on Telegram or here in the comments.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T09:29:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27f/27fbc8896a02c956bc06d3641ed08c66.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Narsiph"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
