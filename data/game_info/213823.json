I doubt this could really work as\u00a0a full game.\u00a0This was made for My Little Game Dev's \"Marathon\" event in 2013. What I'm saying is that it's pretty sloppily made. I think the Info screen may be inaccurate. For one, I\u00a0don't think the keyboard is actually used for anything besides a few debug keys. \u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls/play:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Click and drag various blocks from the scrolling feed\u00a0onto the grid when it's your turn (when the grid is grey). <br/>Red blocks (Ls and +s)\u00a0attack. <br/>The white blocks (squares)\u00a0add shielding to reduce taken damage on the enemy's turn. <br/>The blue, cyan, orange blocks (the small ones)\u00a0are element-based attacks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When the timer runs out,\u00a0the enemy attacks or perform an action. <br/>Then it's your turn again.\u00a0<br/>Try to figure out which blocks you should mostly be\u00a0using by watching the messages on top of the screen. Yeah, it goes way too fast, sorry about that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can hold right mouse button to make your blocks feed scroll faster.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There's no point in\u00a0winning or losing! It's just an experiment.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf4/cf468cab777e54966396f485b2b2db5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fidgety"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
