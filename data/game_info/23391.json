Fly with dozens of friends in an open world full of cruel bosses and endless cascades of deadly bullets. We\u2019ve got a big main world, hundreds of unique enemies, a wide variety of secret missions, and many distinct plane types for you to unlock and master. But fair warning: Steambirds Alliance is a permadeath game - when your plane is shot down, it will be lost to you forever! (However, your pilot will eject and potentially level up if you've fought bravely enough!)<br/><br/>Steambirds Alliance is brought to you by Spry Fox. We co-developed Realm of the Mad God, the first-ever MMO shmup, back in 2010. At the time, we called RotMG \"the most co-op game ever\", but we fully intend to top that with Steambirds Alliance!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-31T06:45:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10f/10f4126180bf8ab7ac1364f24722f396.jpg", "website": "http://steambirds.com", "rating": 2.17, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 178, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 6}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 312, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Spry Fox"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Spry Fox"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
