The difficulty determines how big the target number is, the stats the player starts with, and what monsters are encountered. Starting a quest creates a randomly generated dungeon where the player has one chance to reach the goal \u2013 death means a new dungeon has to be created. Beating a difficulty level unlocks the next; this is also the one thing the game saves.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1991-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-11T15:15:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da4/da42d6a35be29fdbd9f6df487fa8a901.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 183, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Game Boy"], "developers": ["Konami Digital Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Konami"], "esrb_rating": null}
