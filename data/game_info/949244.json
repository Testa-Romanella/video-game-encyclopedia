I have enjoyed the process and have a few more games I have been alternating my time with. Don't Worry as a Disabled Veteran I have a lot of time, and I will not be pumping and dumping.\u00a0<br/><br/>As of Version 0.3.0.0 I still have planned assets and not optimized the File size. The next full update will have the size corrected to Hopefully half the current size!<br/><br/>As of Version 0.3.4.0 File Sizes are now more than half the Previous Build! Spent the day reducing File sizes of textures in ways that avoided loss in quality. Additionally the AI has been refined from random roam to stalking!<br/><br/>As of Version 0.3.4.3 Fixed an issue were the AI gets stuck on, Stalking mechanic is refined. If you bore him, he goes away till you move from safety. redownloaded UE5 and it fixed the issue where the command console is stuck on screen. The abandoned road looks more abandoned now too!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T15:11:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b12/b12a6f08e2e6c10dea8cd836e07eec7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sergeantmurica"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
