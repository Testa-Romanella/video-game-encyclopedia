The faster you make it to the bottom, the better your roll will be!</p>\n<p><em>Made for the GMTK Game Jam 2022</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>A / D to move left/right (these are physical maps, so your keyboard layout should be supported if you don't use WASD)</p>\n<p>(Left / Right arrow keys also work if you are a psychopath (or left handed).)<br/></p>\n<p>Space to jump</p>\n<p>Click to launch towards mouse cursor</p>\n<p><strong>Remarks<br/></strong></p>\n<p>This is my first Godot game and my first game jam entry.</p>\n<p>While I couldn't dedicate as much time this weekend to this project as I would have liked, holding back the quality of the game, I definitely met some major goals of mine: 1) to finally enter a game jam, 2) to finally start learning Godot, and 3) to return to game dev as a hobby after a long drought.</p>\n<p>The game is definitely in a glaringly unfinished state, but it is playable. Things like music, sound, particles, better UI, and overall juice are missing, but I'm uploading this at my bedtime just to be sure I have something submitted at all since I have obligations in the morning. Perhaps I will be able to squeeze in some of those things before the deadline, but I won't make any promises to myself or to anyone on that.</p>\n<p>Thank you for visiting my game page. Participating in this event means a lot to me and I appreciate you taking the time to share this moment with me, if even for a moment.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T14:29:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09a/09a4eafcea1d9ec83f7d91884f3f665f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DeepOcean"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
