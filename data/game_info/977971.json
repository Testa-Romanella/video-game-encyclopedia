Combine blocks to create combos and gain points, reach the highest score you can! There is over a million different ways to play if you fiddle with the settings.<h3>Gamemodes</h3>There are two different game modes <strong>arcade</strong> and <strong>frenzy</strong>. The difference between them is the frequency of certain blocks that fall. In <strong>frenzy</strong> the lower the number on the block the more of that block will be on the board, allowing you to combo more easily with it, but at the expense of points since lower blocks will fall more often. In <strong>arcade</strong> the blocks that fall are completely randomized.<h3>Settings</h3>You can alter the settings of the board within the settings menu. The music volume, amount of rows and columns, the amount of seconds it takes for a new row of coins to drop in a game, and the spawn rate of power blocks are all editable within this menu. <br/><br/><strong>Here are the possible applicable settings</strong><br/><ul><li> Music: 0%-100%<br/></li><li> Rows: 5-50<br/></li><li> Columns: 5-50<br/></li><li> Seconds till fall: 1-60<br/></li><li> Power Block Spawn Rate: 0%-10%</li></ul><h3>Scoreboard Info</h3>The game has a local scoreboard that keeps track of your top 5 scores.
