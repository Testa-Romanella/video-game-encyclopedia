You are sure that its eyes just glowed brighter with life.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>THE CREATURE\u00a0</strong>is a visual novel created in Ren'Py as a personal, experimental project.\u00a0There is an overall story with different endings\u00a0depending on the choices.</p>\n\n<p>It was a challenge making the animations, text and overall format work in Ren'Py, but it was a fun learning process. I removed\u00a0the textbox and had the dialogue appear around the scene. For each different location, I created different styles to change the formats of the choices and text. I also used videos for the backgrounds and most of the\u00a0character appearances.</p>\n<p>Time to play through all options is around 10-15 minutes depending on how fast you read or go through the options.</p>\n<p><strong>Game features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>4 endings</li><li>3 locations</li><li>Simple style in dialogue and style</li><li>Small animations of the backgrounds and character</li></ul>\n<p>Thanks for looking at my short\u00a0visual novel project!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T15:32:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acd/acd452951419a5fdfbf2627411ae6449.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["AnizyArt"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
