In Anodyne, you'll visit areas urban, natural, and bizarre, fighting your way through dungeons and areas in Young's subconscious.</p>\n<p>Originally released in 2013 by Joni Kittaka and Sean Han Tani. Check out our recent platformer adventure game, Even the Ocean!</p>\n<p>CURRENT VERSION: 1.514</p>\n<p>-Features Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Brazilian-Portugese and Spanish language options</p>\n<p><strong>Reception</strong></p>\n<p><em>\"Scenic water stretches and skyward spangles decorate idyllic countryside villages and moody, rain-drizzled night scenes. This is another one of those games I've flicked through the screenshots as if it were a global travel book outlining places you should visit before you die.\" - Chris Priestman, Indie Statik</em></p>\n<p><em>\"The game's sound design is the strongest facilitator of Anodyne's sense of dread and unease; the ambience and music give off an air of suspicion and danger, with ugly chords and disquieting, unnatural-sounding synthetic pings. It all adds up to a game where you're not sure who to trust, and you can't be sure of what's real.\" - Sam Prell, Penny Arcade Report</em></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Please Note</strong> </p>\n<ul><li>the pt-br and spanish languages have not been heavily tested.
