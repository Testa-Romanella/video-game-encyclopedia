This isn't a survival game. But, you do have 3 lives so maybe it is...</p>\n<p>Either way, your job is to collect all the elements on each level.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I ran out of time and you only get 4 levels to try out.</p>\n<p>Assets: I'm not an artist so I used the mannequin, pre-made materials, music from the asset store, sounds from Soundly. I made the Powerup meshes, the element mesh, the rocks, the platforms. I spent a few hours in the particle editor modifying the ones available from Infinity Warblade pack.</p>\n<p>My goal with this project was to script as much Blueprint stuff as I could. The\u00a0UI, the characters, powerups, etc.</p>\n<p>This is my first ever game jam, so let me know what you think. All feedback is appreciated!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a96/a96600a0cf2a96cc663e3cf4bd82a2fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jefftxp"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
