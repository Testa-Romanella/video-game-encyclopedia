We have always enjoyed playing games in our free time.\u00a0As if making a baby isn't enough, we decided to try to make our first game. After messing with Unity and ProCreate for a while, here is the result!\u00a0Let us know what you think. Ofcourse the game is free to play in the browser or as a download. In case you like to donate:\u00a0All donations will directly go to Raaf's savings account!</p>\n\n<p>The game is best played in FullHD and doesn't work on mobile!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T09:12:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c0/1c0a8d7a55b107cc7132879f55b7e845.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["eMinor"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
