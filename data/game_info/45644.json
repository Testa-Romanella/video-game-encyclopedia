We hope that after a bit of time with Subsurface Circular, you\u2019ll feel good about the price you paid.<br/><br/><strong>Do I need to have played other Bithell games to enjoy this one?</strong><br/><br/>No. Subsurface Circular tells its own self contained story.<br/><br/><strong>Why is the game only available in English?</strong><br/><br/>As you can imagine, a text adventure game contains a terrifying amount of text, but more importantly, throughout the game we use the particular quirks of word ordering and double meaning in English to support the combination and recombination of threads. Put simply, other languages are going to be more than a straight translation: They\u2019re going to need rewrites and changed design. Not impossible, but more than we could get done this time around.
