In an evacuated and soon-to-self-destruct Century Industries facility\u00a0lies a robot that has attained sentience. Seeing the precarious scenario he's in, he has decided to flee.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the facility\u00a0is overrun with seemingly out-of-control armed robots, attacking anything in sight and will explode within an hour. The confused, newborn robot's energy supply is leaking, and will take a week's worth of repairs to fix it. Worse, it seems something ominous is happening behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>Music by\u00a0Deltapotato.</p>\n<p>Font from\u00a0here.</p><p>---</p><p>UPDATE: Fixed Level 2 Crash bug, should be working fine from here on now.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c9/9c930f8c06ab232a673e0545c38c46a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["nousername010"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
