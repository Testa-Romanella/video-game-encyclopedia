There are plans for fast paced\u00a0multi-player and open world exploration.</p>\n\n<p>In the first build, there is the start of an interesting weapon system. There are six weapon presets in the demo to start out with. However, please interact with the weapon inventory to piece together a custom build out of the weapon parts provided.</p>\n<p>Each weapon is composed of six pieces:</p>\n<p><strong>Magazine</strong> - Determines the weapons element. Only piercing, toxic, heat, and wafian are featured so far.</p>\n<p><strong>Barrel</strong> - Determines a weapons output type. Only standard barrel is featured so far.</p>\n<p><strong>Body</strong> - Drastically impacts weapons base stats such as fire rate and damage. Plans to have the body also provide special effects. E.G. Burst - the first projectile fired from a full clip does 200% damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Grip\u00a0</strong>- Determines crosshair used, weapon spread type, and fire type (I.E. Auto, Semi-Auto).<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Stock\u00a0</strong>- Determines weapon accuracy and recoil type. Only constant and ramping upward recoil types are featured so far.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Scope\u00a0</strong>- Determines look-down-sights type. Only standard zoom is featured so far.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Please expect weekly updates as progression forwards towards an ambitious world.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T11:18:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/965/965c35c9e647ed10f0afcac11de3ae46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alex Archer"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
