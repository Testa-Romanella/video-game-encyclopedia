They're Baaa-ad, and they're coming to eat us!</p>\n<p>We are carrots and broccoli. Help us defend our garden in this tower defense game before we are overrun by monstrous mammals!</p><p>Fortunately, we have heat-seeking, splash-damage seed missiles.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>THIS GAME, THOUGH PLAYABLE, IS UNFINISHED! Since the team just made this project as a learning experience to see how we can work together, do version control, and scope, it was definitely worth it, but we likely won't be returning to improve this game. Comments are still welcome!</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Created in 48 hours as practice for Ludum Dare 41.
