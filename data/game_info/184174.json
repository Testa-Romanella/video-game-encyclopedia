Featuring randomly generated levels and enemies, a multitude of different towers, tower customisation, bosses, orbital space cannons and a massive fleet of weapons, Orion Defenders is a modern twist on classic tower defence action!<br/></p>\n<p>You begin in Orion, a galaxy ravaged by the Regement. You must go to each planet and defend against the Regement as they try to destroy your base\u00a0by using your massive arsenal of over 50 turrets and abilities. However, they will fight back: more enemy bases will continually spawn as you defend, creating a hectic, ever-evolving landscape.</p>\n<p>No game is ever the same in Orion as each level is completely randomly generated, ensuring that each time you play its a fresh new experience. On top of this, you have complete customisation over how your turrets behave, as with the modding system you can change almost everything about the turrets, ensuring that they work exactly how you want!\u00a0You can also get right into the action with control mode - a mode which lets you fully play as a turret and defend the galaxy for yourself!</p>\n<p>The galaxy of Orion needs you, will you save it from the Regement?</p><p>Twitter: @ODefenders</p><p>Email: oriondefenders@hotmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e57/e579b06b926c313f2414a02f1709a4e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 318, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nemozzz"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
