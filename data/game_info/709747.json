It comprises 25 single-screen levels and a larger 3-screen Point &amp; Click Adventure game level to keep you, your toddlers, and (pre)-schoolers off the streets for a bit.</p>\n<p><strong>How it came about</strong></p>\n<p>I created this simple game\u00a0during an Inktober-like challenge for myself. In October 2021, I turned a daily sketch on my Remarkable 2 into a small interactive level that my two-year-old girl and older sons can play alone or together on their tablet. Because I reserved only about 2 hours a day to work on both the sketch and coding of the level, the result is what it is. After October, I only removed a few bugs and added some of my own\u00a0sounds and music to complete the peachy experience.</p>\n<p>Enjoy -\u00a0<em>o musi pona!</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T07:04:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80c/80c8cd621d11dc02a31325c9e0dc1468.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nullelement"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
