{"id": 15294, "slug": "tension", "name": "The Void", "name_original": "The Void", "description": "<p>The Void is a game about supernatural adventures in a grotesque world. The game was also released under the names Turgor (the original Russian title) and Tension.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The main protagonist of the story is dead. His soul is trapped in the Void, a world beyond life and death that serves as a sort of Purgatory. Two factions inhabit the Void: the monstrous Brothers and the lovely Sisters. They live in the world almost devoid of color. The Color exists in this world as a liquefied substance that is very valuable. The protagonist wants to leave the Void and return to the world of the living. To achieve it, he has to infiltrate the faction of Brothers that consist of deformed, disabled men. Whether they will be hostile or friendly depends on the player&#39;s actions.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player navigates the main character from the first person view. The main goal is to gather Color, which in The Void stands in for all traditional types for video games resources. The protagonist needs Color to restore health, recharge weapons, and increase experience. To obtain Color, the player has to gather Lymph and then process it through the many hearts of the protagonist. As the Color fills the hearts, it influences gameplay in various ways, including the character&#39;s interactions with the NPCs.</p>\n<h3>Style</h3>\n<p>Like most of the Ice-Pick Lodge games, The Void features a grotesque and surreal visual style. It is set in a gloomy grey world full of fog, ruins, and deformed creatures. The Void is set to the dark ambient music.</p>", "metacritic": 77, "released": "2008-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-27T13:51:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/7a0/7a0b4801b4ec1a8ed03cf07cfedcaa77.jpg", "website": "http://ice-pick.com", "rating": 3.88, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 93, "owned": 988, "beaten": 37, "toplay": 47, "dropped": 59, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 106, "suggestions_count": 482, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 106, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ice-Pick Lodge", "Captionshiner"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ice-Pick Lodge", "Captionshiner"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
