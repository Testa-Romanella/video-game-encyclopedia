These keys are Z/X on a QWERTY layout (which is why the instructions say Z/X), but they might be W/X, Y/X, or something else depending on your keyboard.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Dino0040 for the leaderboard server!<br/></p>\n<p>Art assets used:</p>\n<p>Castlevania-esque Tilemap (Stone and Bricks) by Chayed Creates<br/></p>\n<p>Grass/Dirt [Connecting Tileset] [16x16] by KnoblePersona<br/></p>\n<p>Mage Rework by Wolfgang Wozniak (Ouren) &amp; Jordan Irwin (AntumDeluge)</p>\n<p>Mini Fantasy Sprites by GrafxKid<br/></p>\n<p>Music used:</p>\n<p>Leafless Quince Tree by Rolemusic<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T10:26:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1a/b1a7255725a63e620cfdfd48288ebf8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Birdwards"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
