But it all changed when a terrible sandstorm, raised my misterious powers, dried all vegetal life out turning every planet into a barren land. <br/><br/>All hope seemed lost. The maddening drought could last forever! Fortunately, there was still a chance... <br/><br/>Tsuyu! A peaceful creature who had the ability to summon rain and thus bring trees back to life. Knowing that he was the only one who could stop this terrible situation, Tsuyu embarked upon a quest to reforest the whole galaxy, one planet at a time! <br/><br/>- Follow Tsuyu in a first journey that will take him across the Yakeraan planetoid system. <br/>- Travel around 16 planetoids inhabited by Yaks, bull-like creatures that were once calm and nice. <br/>- Tsuyu won't harm any creature: his only goal consists of making it rain, and Yaks can't be blamed for the drought. Moreover, Tsuyu is good-natured, nonviolent and well... quite small.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:38:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52c/52c2479091b849224ebde0493b0f37c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Medusa"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Luis Anton Canalis"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
