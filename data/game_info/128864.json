Please be patient.)</p>\n<p>DialogFight is my first game for the One Game A Month challange.

I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>I'd be really happy to recieve feedback! On difficulty and what you thought happened in the story, especially.</p>\n<p>If you want to look behind the scenes, the whole Unity project is up on my GitHub!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ee/2ee46519aa100de03baccf636c3431f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Lena!"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
