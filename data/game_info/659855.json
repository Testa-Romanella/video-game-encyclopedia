I originally released this game in 1994. This game was distributed for free on CU Amiga as a popular coverdisc. It was technically shareware but I\u00a0didn't receive a single registration.</p>\n<p>Taskforce is a turn based strategy game. Take an elite team of soldiers, choose a mission such as blowing up a target or assassinating an enemy general, then give your team some guns and take it in turns to fight the enemy and complete your mission. Movement is divided into separate Move and Fire phases and you can choose any mission at any time. This game inspired and influenced\u00a0the later games Hilt and Hilt II on Amiga.\u00a0Years later, I made a fully 3D PC version of Taskforce, which was remastered and released on Steam of PC in 2020.</p>\n<p>The intro sequence was designed and created by the artist and animator Steve Packer.</p>\n<p>Supplied in ADF format for use with\u00a0Amiga emulators, and in RP9 format for use with Cloanto's Amiga Forever and other RetroPlatform\u00a0emulators.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T14:51:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/771/7717dcd0baa824dc7a3d0f655e39e90f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 368, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mark Sheeky"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
