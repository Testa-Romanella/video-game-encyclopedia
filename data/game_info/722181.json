Avoid any direct sunlight and only play when the sun is not visible. Cloudy days can work, but not all the time. \u00a0Best time to play is at either dawn or dusk. \u00a0The lighting conditions must be perfect in order for the game to track.\r\n</p>\n<p>If the lighting conditions are not correct your headset will not track unless you reset it and try in a different lighting environment. \u00a0If after multiple tries the headset does not track, it means that the lighting conditions are either too dark, or too bright. \u00a0You will need to bring it back inside and reset it there.\r\n</p>\n<p>Please make sure that your headset properly calibrates the floor and that your play space is as flat as a football field. any changes in slope will affect jump tracking. \u00a0you must be able to jump at least 1ft above the ground. Make sure you jump high so your head is above the jump threshold (Jump standing as tall as you can). thresholds are placed in-between the jumping gaps.\r\n</p>\n<p>For large playspace sizes disable your boundaries.\r\n</p>\n<p>Please message me directly if you are having issues with the games or have any ideas to improve your experience.\r\n</p>\n<p>VirtualGo LLC\r\n</p>\n<p>Safety:\r\n</p>\n<p>Extra Large Playspace VR Minigames is a game with VR movement elements not suited for all users and play spaces.
