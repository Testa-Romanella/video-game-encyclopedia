This is an early alpha demo I'm releasing for Halloween for everyone to enjoy. It's very unfinished, so yeah, you're gonna deal with a few bugs here and there. I have so much to add and so much to do, so this game is gonna take me a year or so to finish.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The demo currently features the tutorial and only one floor, so that's about 10-20 minutes of gameplay.\u00a0The demo is also\u00a0missing certain animations for the player and enemies, it's missing some original music (I'm currently using a song from 40 Winks (a PS1 game) for Floor 1) but at least the basement has an original song loop by me, the game needs more polish, needs better optimization, still haven't added a health bar yet, and probably needs a better tutorial. So yeah, I hope you enjoy this demo, and if you like it, follow my itch.io page to get notifications when I release news about Dracula's Castle. When I finish working on this game it'll probably be a 2-4 hour game and I'll release it probably in 2018 of October, hopefully not, maybe in the spring or summer of 2018, who knows. I may release it on Steam, who knows. If I don't, then I'll release it here on Itch.io with a price tag or if I'm feeling generous it'll be free with donations allowed.</p>\n<p>If you make a video about Dracula's Castle please let the viewers know that this is an early alpha demo and does not represent the final product. I don't want unfair\u00a0criticism y'know, and I'm not gonna report or ban or DMCA you or people that criticize the game, cause I'm not like those random asshole developers that make asset filp games on Steam that get so offended about their \"games\" being\u00a0criticized for being pure shit.<br/></p>\n<p>Anyway, I hope you have fun and have a friggin happy Halloween, cause when Halloween passes it's gonna be back to the same old, same old.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8cd/8cdb0aef4fd4ae29d1840ef35ab4ad3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dave Microwaves Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
