A carefully comprised plan with as little mess as possible turns horribly wrong, leaving you to fight your way out of an impossible situation. What are you willing to do to come out on top?<br/><br/>You begin the story as a low level enforcer for the mafia working under the enigmatic Salvatore Da Luca, a veteran from the recently ended Great War. Once he inspired acts of valour in the trenches, now he uses those same qualities for greed and corruption by liberating banks of their excess holdings. <br/><br/>Sal doesn\u2019t work alone, his trusted associate Giuseppe Gallo always teams up for the score. He\u2019s known as the loose cannon who can wind up being more trouble than he\u2019s worth. Shoot first; ask question later is how he operates. He has a grudge with the world, and he\u2019s not too fond of you either. You better make sure not to put a foot wrong.<br/><br/>The bank just opened and the score&amp;#39;s all set, are you in?<br/><br/>What the fans are saying:<br/><br/>***** by Leggam13<br/>Awesome action shooter - This is a lot of fun.<br/><br/>&amp;quot;The game&amp;#39;s whole feelings is nice.
