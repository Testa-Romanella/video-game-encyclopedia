Enjoy, and stay spicy.</p><p><strong>PROTIP:\u00a0</strong>Blocking is essential for success! Blocking an enemy's attack puts them in a stun state where they take way, way more damage. You have two blocking stances, high and low, and all enemies have a high and a low attack. The yellow warning symbol that appears right before an enemy attacks indicates what kind of attack it's going to be, and it's up to you to block accordingly.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d0/1d00a97388c175d0fec29b3a8f56c599.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ComradeWerewolf"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
