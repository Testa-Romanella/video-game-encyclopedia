Because I loved this game since childhood and I saw the community's desire for a remastered version, I thought I could try to sprinkle some hope. This is by no means a professional project, I'm just a student-level developer\u00a0after all.</p>\r\nMy vision\r\n<p>Let's dream for a bit. I would love it to have multiplayer support, co-op campaign, level editor, unit creator and of course: fully redone game.</p>\n<p>Because I'm just a lone programmer and far from a designer, I will introduce huge support for changing the game files. These include: Meshes, textures, sounds, UI images and level data. I'll leave creating and sharing modifications to the forum below.</p>\r\nCurrent features\r\n<p>Currently it has:</p>\n<ul><li>Bare-bones main menu.(Quit and new game works)</li><li>Intro and first level cinema videos.</li><li>War-room briefing.</li><li>Ability to switch through units.</li><li>Scarab recycling (But not everything is polished).</li><li>Pegasus pickup ability (with nice rope physics).</li></ul>\r\nClosing remarks\r\n<p>Currently I have put about 50 man-hours into this project, so it is LITTERED with <em>bugs</em>. But I wanted to upload this project before my university semester, to show my progress. Hope I will have time to bring updates.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T10:03:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4e/b4ecb6de2b85c2b087c96e6ad241d6c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Game dream st."], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
