Reynolds. You can find an in-depth explanation and a lot of corresponding scientific papers on his\u00a0\u00a0website</p>\n<p>An <strong>Oculus Rift</strong> or <strong>Rift S</strong> is required to play (It will also run on the Oculus Quest but only if you are using the Oculus Link Cable).</p>\n<p>At the moment the game has no real goal or end. Just create some swarms and enjoy their movements ... and maybe feed them from time to time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T05:49:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14f/14f98f88f72e6762d355aa3ff316c8ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["malacode"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
