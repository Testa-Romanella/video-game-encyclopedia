It is an RPG that features combat, professions (cooking, mining, and blacksmithing), an interactive dialogue system with matching voice lines, and a work-in-progress skill tree. The project was worked on over a duration of 12 weeks and has since then not received any major updates. Version 1.0.3 introduces the about section in the main menu.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We wanted to keep the project as close to what we handed in order to show reflection (for instance, we know that there wasn't enough player feedback). This is why we decided on not polishing this project</p>\n<strong>Controls</strong>\n<ul><li>Left Click: Attack\u00a0</li><li>Tab - Toggle Inventory</li><li>Escape - Toggle Pause\u00a0</li><li>E - Interact\u00a0</li><li>C - Character Equipment\u00a0</li><li>T - Skills Menu</li><li>ALT+F4 - Exit Game (Sorry....)</li></ul>\n<strong>Credits</strong>\n<ul><li>Ben Nilsson - Programmer</li><li>Joshua Mobley - Programmer</li><li>Cathan Bertram - AI Programmer, Audio Programmer, Level Design</li><li>Oliver Parrish - Level Designer, Programmer</li><li>Conner Pittaway - Skill Designer/Programmer</li><li>Christopher Glass - Lore/Quest Designer, Voice Acting</li><li>Daniel Marker - Dialogue Designer/Programmer</li></ul>\n<strong>Social</strong>\n<ul><li>Ben Nilsson</li><li>Joshua Mobley</li><li>Cathan Bertram</li><li>Oliver Parrish</li><li>Conner Pittaway</li><li>Christopher Glass</li><li>Daniel Marker</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T04:10:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a3/3a34818a0b2869e4c45df319bab44daa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kotie"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
