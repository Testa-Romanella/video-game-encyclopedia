You can download it on this link\u00a0Docking - The Game . Hope you like it! &lt;3</p>\r\nINFO\r\n<p>Little game based on the Interstellar Docking Scene submited for the Movie Game Jam. Hint: Press W to aproach the Endurance. The space ship has to be perfectly aligned with the space station to win the game xD it's kinda hard. You are warned xD Hint2: It works better at full screen or downloading the exe file (smoothness is important to align the spaceship with the space station) Hope you like it!!</p>\r\nCREDITS:\r\n<p><strong>Gamedev:</strong> Adri\u00e1n Alameda (Unity3d)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>PixelArt:</strong> Adri\u00e1n Alameda (Aseprite and PyxelEdit)</p>\n<p><strong>Music:</strong> Original\u00a0SoundTrack: Hans Zimmer.
