If you take the headset off, the game will restart after 15 seconds. Enter restarts the game. Esc quits.\u00a0 You should be the height of the characters in the game. Around 60cm /25 inches tall or so. If you are not you need to move your sensors around.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>If you don't have a VR headset connected, you can play it like a regular video game. W/A/S/D to move, space to jump, mouse to look around.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY:</strong></p>\n<p>The actor in the beginning gives you instructions. You are incorporeal and to get your body back you have to create a 7 syllable word. You find the syllables hidden throughout the level. You move wherever you look. As you find the syllables they appear in the sky.\u00a0 You don't need controllers.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The VR challenge of the game is to be able to move around and find the pieces of your word. Some characters in the level make it challenging to move around. You really need to look all over and when you get stuck you have to figure out how to get unstuck. I think this is ideal for standing.</em></strong></p>\n<p>It should take around 10-20 minutes in VR. Probably around 5 minutes without VR.</p>\n<p><strong>THINGS THAT MIGHT GO WRONG:</strong></p>\n<p>-The headset tracking might need to be adjusted. When you run into a wall you shouldn't go inside it. If that happens just back up or adjust the headset cameras. If that doesn't work let me know.</p>\n<p>-There are 7 cubes. You should be able to get all of them. When you go over them they make a noise and disappear. If you can't get all 7 you need to adjust your headset trackers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Not tested on a Vive at all. Let me know if you're able to complete on a Vive.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-26T23:49:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/431/4319b244b43cc80a921d2c96248a6caf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 293, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jeremycouillard"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
