Every time you complete the associated task, drag the slider over to mark it as complete. At the end of the day, you can double tap the reset button to put you on a clean slate to start again. There is a build for all major operating systems, excluding iOS.</p>\n<p>More features will be coming soon, but for now I need to get this in before the deadline.</p>\n<p>Github Repo:\u00a0https://github.com/4a454646/CongressionalApp</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T07:54:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/942/942307ba581c672ac1783f08f5a6ffd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["4a454646"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
