Each ship is controlled by a flocking AI, that determines where they will go and what they will do, preferring to stay in groups. There is no leader or director to the motion, however the player can influence the swarm by setting alert points, however every ship in the swarm can do the same. When you die, instead of re-spawning, you are randomly reassigned to another ship. The game is over when all ships are destroyed or you capture the enemies bases.</p>\n<p>This concept game was created in\u00a06 days for the Week 139 Game Jam hosted on itch.io with the theme \"followers\" This is the first game I have produced for any game jam.</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed this game and would like to see it turned into a full-fledged product, please tell your friends and support me by donating for the download.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-13T03:12:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76f/76f9974e389a85a043f900b6002acb85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["happy_killbot"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
