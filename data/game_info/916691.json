Avoid spikes, run from the fire, find the keys and escape to the next level!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Why the game is so short?</strong></p>\n<p>I created PICO's Challange from scratch in just a couple of days, to <em>Finally Finish Something</em>.  I do not think I will extend the game further \u2013 I plan to reimplement  this in Python and then make the game bigger. Still, thanks to PICO-8, it is very easy to add new levels, especially  if one would use only the existing mechanics. The game is released under  a very permissive 2-clause BSD license (\"FreeBSD Licence\") so if you  wish, then please feel free to add new levels and features to the PICO's  Challange.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T05:16:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d50/d50af393fce83c4cfc253c87cd229cb9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Vedor"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
