Earn cool collectibles and useful items for your adventure!</p>\n<p>This is an early version of a game I made to practice scope management.\u00a0The basic gameplay was done in a day but the rest of the mechanics, tuning and proof of concept content added another 5 weeks! I also spent minimal time on the presentation and borrowed heavily from free assets I found. As I continue developing this game I will be working on making the look more consistent and hopefully making some original assets. (Not my strong point)<br/></p>\n<p>You can play in the browser or download it to play locally on Windows. The game might not work for everyone in the browser. If it doesn't work for you, try the download if you can.</p>\n<p>Note: The game supports saving but since this is a very early version, I cannot guarantee that your saves will be compatible with future versions.</p>\n<p>After adding a bit more content,\u00a0I will be working on app store releases so I can get some experience with the process as well.<br/></p>\n<p>Please enjoy the game and leave me some feedback on what you think.</p>\n<p>Thanks to all the generous folks that have made their assets available for use! I hope I caught everyone in the credits but if I missed you, please let me know.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T05:36:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfd/dfd34a4a98a1751052b76f33b8f21424.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["initdotdev"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
