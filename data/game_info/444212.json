There are enemies spread out in the building that you have to avoid being detected by. If they see you, they will chase after you and try to kill you. You can lose them by turning small and hiding in narrow places. When you have gathered information you will find your boss to whom you will sell it.</p>\n<p><strong>-Current Version-</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game is still in development. As it is now it is more like a toy than a game. Some basic mechanics can be tested and that is mainly it.</p>\n<p><strong>-Made By-</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Team RatOn: Andreas Hansen, Yuhui Gan, Alexander Wik, Isak Forsberg</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T07:21:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16f/16f2c3743dd0248c71ff249e1a59151a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Mino53"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
