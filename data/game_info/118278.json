But once all the main mechanics are put in place, i will begin developing the story and map.<br/>Please give feed back on the mechanics and art style, but please be aware that nothing in this game is set in stone.<br/></p>\n<p>I am looking to have a community\u00a0<strong>heavily</strong> involved in the content creation of this game. Enemies, bosses, puzzle, weapons, etc.<br/>I feel that to allow people to create my game alongside me like this will allow people to do what I always wished developers would do. So please submit ideas. (Ideas may not be added. Claiming a Reward-Title guarantees I will use at least 1 idea from you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d8/0d8a07fd6815f366c0f557bc7adef605.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lamp"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
