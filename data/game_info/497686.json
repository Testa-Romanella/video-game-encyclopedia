{"id": 497686, "slug": "blackbeards-booty", "name": "Blackbeard's Booty", "name_original": "Blackbeard's Booty", "description": "<p>Blackbeard's Booty is a \"monitor\" game developed for the Colorado Lottery Game Jam. Players are able to make a bet by selecting how many slots they want, filling each slot with a gem of their choice. The player wins if they are able to match their bet with the correct combination which is generated from the chest. Each game/round, no matter how many slots you choose, is 25 cents.<br/></p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Rules &amp; Win Condition:</p>\n<p>You can choose 3 slots (3 gems) which have the best odds of winning but lower payout, 4 slots (4 gems) which have lower odds of winning but better payout, or 5 slots (5 gems) which have the hardest odds of winning but the best payout.</p>\n<p>You win by either matching your combination with those from the chest in any random order for a normal payout, or in-order for double the payout.</p>\n<p>For however many slots you choose, you can only make a match with the first 3, 4, or 5 slots from the chest combination.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<p>*Player Choice: red, red, green (3 slots)</p>\n<p>*Chest Combination: green, red, red, blue, white (You win because first 3 colors are in your combination)</p>\n<p>*Chest Combination: blue, green, red, red, green (You lose because first 3 colors are not your combination)</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>While not implemented yet, we plan to have the odds change over time in order to benefit the player. After losing a variable amount of games in a row, the probability the player wins the next chest opening is increased by a certain percentage. After winning, this increased percentage is reset. Here is an example of how we planned for the feature to work.</p>\n<p>***Payouts will be adjusted from current game to suit this system***</p>\n<p>3 slots chosen:</p>\n<p>Random Order Win: 1 in 35 (2.8%) | +5% for every loss after 3 losses in a row</p>\n<p>In-Order Win: 1 in 125 (0.8%) | +2.5% for every loss after 3 losses in a row</p>\n\n<p>4 slots:</p>\n<p>Random Order Win: 1 in 70 (1.4%) | +2.5% for every loss after 2 losses in a row</p>\n<p>In-Order Win: 1 in 625 (0.16%) | +1% for every loss after 2 losses in a row</p>\n\n<p>5 slots:</p>\n<p>Random Order Win: 1 in 126 (0.7%) | +1% for every loss after 1 loss</p>\n<p>In-Order Win: 1 in 3125 (0.032%) | +.5% for every loss after 1 loss</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Karim Najib: VFX, Animation, Modeling<br/></p>\n<p>Josef Bertolini:\u00a0Programming</p>\n<p>Ryan Green: Programming</p>\n<p>Lyndon\u00a0de la Torre:\u00a0Programming &amp; Audio</p>\n<p>Nichole Wong: UI/UX &amp; Art</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T06:43:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4eb/4ebfb8fe23be4e50d81ba86e2d7bc4ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nuclearMonkey", "Puffles", "KrispyKarim517", "JoeBertolini", "ryangreen"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
