But because of a natural disaster, they had to leave their world and they now roam space. Their technologies allows them to live in such comfort that they no longer need to work, only certain rudimentary tasks remain to be done.<br/><br/>The Aliens ended up getting so big that they couldn't get out of their gravitational chairs. They therefore go from world to world to capture slaves so that they do the dirty work for them: cooking, cleaning, activating machines, transporting objects.<br/><br/>  Samy is a human who -like many of his own, was captured when the Aliens came to Earth. <br/>He finds himself on one of the Alien capital ships and must work to survive. <br/><br/>However, the Aliens have lost the ability to speak due to their body fat, and they now only express themselves through the grumbles, sounds and colors.<br/><br/> Unfortunately for Samy, humans don't speak 'rumbles'. He will have to learn to understand the Aliens to be able to perform the cooking as efficiently as possible, and thus gradually gain the confidence of his jailers in order to find a way to escape.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T18:29:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/768/768173eb08fc655f41bbe0ed2e06f603.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Loulaty"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
