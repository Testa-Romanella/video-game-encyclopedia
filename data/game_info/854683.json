I still wanted to submit something so I crunched out an idea for a solitaire I had. The game design isn't super great and I didn't have enough time to do the art how I wanted, but I'm still really proud of how it turned out with the time that I had. I'm hoping to come back to this project after the jam sometime and polish it up a bit.\u00a0Thank you so much for playing!</p><p>Credit to my friends Julia for helping me with design and Monev for the beautiful forest picture he took.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T08:46:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b27/b274ccca82eb19afad969a6c1fb8ea43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["SerialBoxes"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
