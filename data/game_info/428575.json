We are building this game because our children want a video game where they can run around as a unicorn. Unable to find one, we decided to create it. If our kids want to run around as a unicorn, chances are other kids want to run around as a unicorn too. During the development of Unicorn Tails a strange thing happened: A story started to emerge. This isn\u2019t Insert-Word-Here Simulator. This is a world that is being crafted with thought and care.<br/><br/>Unicorn Tails changes based on game progress. We are continuing to develop quests and story events that will keep the game fresh. The more popular the game becomes, the more content we will create. This includes adding new game modes and ways to get off Unicorn Island to see new and distant lands. During the Early Access period we are especially interested in user feedback. What story elements do you want to see expanded? What gameplay elements resonated with you or your children that you would like to see further developed. As new developers ourselves, we are interested in taking the core game and shaping it into something that kids and adults alike can enjoy.<br/><br/>We surprised ourselves with how much fun we could have creating a unicorn game. We think you\u2019ll be surprised with how much fun you can have playing a unicorn game and discovering its secrets.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T03:10:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c8/0c88b05c2512ece6b62b254c9446d2db.jpg", "website": "http://unicorntailsthegame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 382, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RavenFist Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["RavenFist Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
