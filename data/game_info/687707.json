The midnight movie is a triple feature:\u00a0 The Voodoo Snake Massacre Trilogy.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>The Voodoo Snake Massacre</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A group of grad students traveling deep into the jungle to make contact with a lost tribe said to practice voodoo magic, little did they knew no they would soon become the human sacrifice offered to an ancient snake God.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Shot in the 1960's on black and white film, this low budget shlock fest was banned from being shown in counties all across the United States, it gained a small cult following being shown in midnight movies for years, but it wasn't until it was released on VHS in the 80s that people really started to take notice of the director's work.</em>\n</p>\n<p><strong>The Voodoo Snake Massacre 2: COLOR of fear</strong>\n</p>\n<p>20 years later, the son of the original professor who led the expedition in the first movie returns for revenge against the voodoo tribe, little did he know he would soon be thrust between two warring villages, and have to face the snake gods at the heart of the labyrinth.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><em>The home release of voodoo snake massacre on VHS sparked interest in the director's work and generated funding for a sequel.\u00a0 Created in the '80s in glorious color, with an increased budget the director could afford better sets, more stunt people, and expensive puppets for the snake gods.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Voodoo Snake Massacre 3: Voodoo in space.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The true intention of the human sacrifices of the voodoo clan is revealed! Not as a prayer to the dead gods but as a beacon to robotic snake aliens. Can our hero escape the alien prison ship? or will they be an exhibit in a zoo on some distant planet.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><em>In the 90\u2019s every horror movie had to go to space, Leprechaun and Jason were in space so Voodoo Snake Massacre took the leap as well.\u00a0 Despite some passionate fans it still lost a ton of money for the studio and the directors never worked in movies again, but it still plays at midnight, they all play at midnight.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Buy your ticket, grab some popcorn, find your seat, and enjoy the show\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T06:12:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/212/212115ad39ab83d138c71023b845ff43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 223, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bcawley"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
