You're in charge of some solar panel and need them to charge your small TV radio thing. It's pretty lonely so make sure you have enough battery if you want some news from your buddy.</p>\n<p>The project was made as part of my artist residency at PERTE-DE-SIGNAL in Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec. I had to work with 2 other artists to make something link to a simple repetitive movement.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The game is made to run on the Sega Dreamcast</strong>, so pull out your CD-R or your favorite DCemulator! You should be able to burn this very easily if you know how to use .CDI files. I personally use ImgBurn and you can find all the info about that online. Otherwise, the new\u00a0Redream\u00a0emulator\u00a0works wonder.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-22T02:28:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c9/4c99282c2fabee440925d3b4d920d00a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Magnes"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
