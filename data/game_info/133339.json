All the other keys have already fallen, and one\r\nof you is next...\r\n      \r\nUse your Shift! powers to swap positions with each other. Why? Because only one\r\nof you can survive.\r\n      \r\nDon't get hit by falling hazards, they will deduct your health and do bad stuff.\r\n      \r\nSome fallen keys may give you little benefits to help you survive the programmer's\r\nonslaught, while others may just hinder your survival out of spite and jealousy.\r\nTry to figure out what each fallen key does!\r\n      \r\nLastly, if you get hit by the programmer's finger, then everything will be OVER.\r\n      \r\nHave fun and good luck!\r\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>Player 1 (Lifty the Left Shift):</p>\n<ul><li>W to jump,</li><li>A and D\u00a0to move left and right</li><li>S to taunt/dance</li><li>Left shift to swap positions with your opponent</li></ul>\n<p>Player 2 (Rifty the Right Shift):</p>\n<ul><li>\u2191 to jump,</li><li>\u2190 and \u2192\u00a0to move left and right</li><li>\u2193 to taunt/dance</li><li>Right shift to swap positions with your opponent</li></ul>\n<p>Objective:</p>\n<ul><li>Avoid the obstacles</li><li>Avoid the finger of death</li><li>Get powerups</li><li>Make your opponent lose!</li></ul>\n<p>Alternative Download Link to Windows/Mac:<br/>https://github.com/ZY-Ang/Sticky-Keys/releases</p>\n<p>Source Code, Readme and Team:<br/>https://github.com/ZY-Ang/Sticky-Keys</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c33/c335463e60df876674b67f19b5dc2363.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["ZY-Ang", "fongwz", "vicisapotato"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
