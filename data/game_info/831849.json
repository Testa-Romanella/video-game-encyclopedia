All that viewers have to do is type !play and they'll be entered into the lobby!<h3>Gameplay loop</h3>Once the streamer decides that there are enough players in the lobby, they will start the game. <br/>Players are then placed into random positions in the maze, and will automatically start navigating. No further interaction is required from the viewers end!<br/><br/>This is not a game you will play for hours on end, but it is sure to deliver a lovely distraction for anyone who is watching your livestream. <br/>Live Maze can also function as a raffle system! Have the first person to reach the center of the maze win something, or host a grand-prix.<h3>Gameplay features</h3><ul><li> Find randomly placed weapons and fight off other players<br/></li><li> Find bombs and other power ups!<br/></li><li> Each player gets to pick an AI through twitch commands, if they choose to do so<br/></li><li> Each maze will be procedurally generated, with the size based on the amount of players in the lobby<br/></li><li> Lots of customisation options for the streamer to create a unique experience every round</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T04:59:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e60/e6006b706cdb299d240d466a1ec72a87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Base Software"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Base Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
