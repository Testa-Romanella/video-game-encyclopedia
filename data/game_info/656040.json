The aim of the game is to kill as many of the enemies as you can. There are three different modes:</p>\n<p>Controls:</p><p>A\u00a0 - Left</p><p>D - Right</p><p>Left Click - Damage Enemies</p><p>Easy - Stupidly Easy, the enemies are slow and come just from the left.</p>\n<p>Medium - The enemies are now coming from both sides.</p>\n<p>Chaos - The enemies are going to come from the top, left and right. When sleighing the top enemies, face them and when they are above you they can be killed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T20:37:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6cc/6cc75d6aeabf8f14e260a89e72d2b854.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ADH-PIXEL"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
