We have nothing to announce at the time of this prototype's release.</p>\n<p>We hope you can enjoy this demo in the meantime, Follow our endevours moving forward @BulletHeck on twitter</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/BulletHeck</p>\n<p>Original Idea</p>\n<p>Both Squaggies and Mezzo Roo came up with the idea of this game independently, and we decided to make the game together. I, Squaggies, and writing this readme so I can say where I initally got the idea of the game from, we coined the idea in late 2019 to eachother. Where I said \"What if you could play UNDERTALE, but as the enemies, like you fight eachother\" and if I remember correctly, Mezzo had the idea for a TouHou Game in the same sorta idea years prior and mentioned the idea when I brought up the game's idea, and then we started working together. The game's backend is a lot more clunky compared to \"Crossfire: Barrage\" I really hope one day that we can release the new version of the game as it's a lot better, but alas, subscription services are annoying and expensive when you're a hobbiest that only works on the game a few times a month at most.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading and supporting the game! Hope we can show something soon!</p>\n<p>-Crossfire: Barrage Team</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T02:49:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcf/fcf0d47e06a3a6a2b867b8040cdd0a07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Squaggs"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
