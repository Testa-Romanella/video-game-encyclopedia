However there is a catch: There are no ends to levels so you must fail. The further in you die on a level the more filled-up your jetpack will be on the next level. This means that you can die at the very start of a level but you will have less fuel on the next, resulting in a much harder or even impossible level.</p>\n<p>This game has 8 levels that is constantly getting more and more difficult. You can easily pass the first few but you will have to die further down on the latter ones. You can only complete the game if you die at the end of level 8.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<strong>Game</strong><strong>Keyboard</strong><strong>Controller</strong><strong>left</strong>A or LeftD-Pad / Joystick Left<strong>right</strong>D or RightD-Pad / Joystick Right<strong>jump / use jetpack</strong>W, Space, Up or CtrlD-Pad / Joystick Up or A, B<strong>Menu</strong><strong>Keyboard</strong><strong>Controller</strong><strong>up</strong>W or UpD-Pad / Joystick Up<strong>down</strong>S or DownD-Pad / Joystick Down<strong>accept</strong>EnterStart", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T06:25:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e12/e12bf185a5a14551cf4f3d95994d5dfb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["EsVagy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
