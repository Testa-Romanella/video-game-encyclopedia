It is targeted for casual gamers of any age group (kids, teens, silly adults) who want a cute and wholesome experience.</p>\n<p>The game\u2019s tagline \u201cPet the Pup!\u201d clearly indicates that the player's main goal is to pet dogs. However, the catch is that the player must do so without getting caught by the dog owners. The game levels will be held in miscellaneous parks and each level will hold its own set of winning conditions.</p>\n<p>To stay hidden, players are provided with various stealth mechanics like disguises or interactions with their environment. For instance, they will be able to hide within a bush if need be. If a player successfully completes a level, he/she will be rewarded with a set number of pugs equivalent to their score within the level. A maximum of three pugs can be received by the gamer per completed level.</p>\n\r\nDeveloped By\r\n<ul><li><strong>Antoine Paulin-Bessette</strong></li><li><strong>Nicole Parmentier<br/></strong></li><li><strong>Miled Chalal-Henri<br/></strong></li><li><strong>Briana Toia<br/></strong></li><li><strong>Gabriel Desroches</strong></li><li><strong>Greta Avetisian</strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong>This was a submission for \"COMP 376: Introduction to Game Development\" at Concordia University in Fall 2020.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T10:45:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/134/134e115e4510de2d3105daac6e98e5ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BenderBending"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
