If you are a lover of logic games, this is the right game for you! People have always been interested in challenging the mind with mind games and exercise the brain with brain training games. Our brain is a muscle and just like every other muscle. It needs exercise to develop and keep fit!<br/>\r\nTry in two playing modes to break the code:<br/>\r\n- easy mode with 4 pins<br/>\r\n- hard mode with 5 pins<br/>\r\nThe logic and Dominant Mind game rules are very similar to a mind game called Bulls and Cows that was played with a pencil on paper. Ready to get your brain training?<br/>\r\n\u00a0<br/>\r\n*** Game Rules ***<br/>\r\nDominant Mind is a mind game that is played on a decoding board with a shield covering four colored pins. The goal is to guess the code and recreate the hidden row. Below the shield, there are eight horizontal rows where the player, the code breaker, is able to guess the color and placing of the covered pins. On the right side of each horizontal row there are holes for pegs where the software will provide feedback for the code breaker after every attempt made to guess the code:<br/>\r\n\u00a0<br/>\r\n\u26ab  black peg indicates right color pin in right place<br/>\r\n\u26aa \u00a0white peg indicates right color pin in wrong place<br/>\r\n\ud83d\udd34\u00a0 no peg indicates wrong color and place<br/>\r\n\u2753 two playing modes - 4 pins easy mode and 5 pins hard mode\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe code breaker only gets one peg for every covered color that they guess right. If there are two pins of the same color hidden behind the shield, and the player guesses that there are three pins of that same color, the player can still only get two pegs indicating the right color.<br/>\r\nOnce the feedback has been provided the code breaker has a new attempt to guess the color/placing and break the code, with the help of the feedback and logical thinking.<br/>\r\nAs the numbers of rows indicate, you only have eight attempts to guess the code. You will be awarded points when you guess the color right and extra bonus points when you crack the code. Extra points are also awarded if you break the code in an early stage of this logic game.<br/>\r\n\u00a0Have fun, enjoy the game!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T03:04:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10f/10f6baff8be96221c33cba164eb1cd31.jpg", "website": "https://peaksel.com/casual-games/mastermind-brain-game/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Peaksel"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Peaksel"], "esrb_rating": null}
