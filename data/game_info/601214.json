Click on the buttons and levers to command the locomotive!\u00a0The bottom lever controls the direction and the upper left lever controls the speed. In the bottom left there is a button to fire a Harpoon, and also a lever to switch which side to fire from. In the bottom right there is a compass that points towards\u00a0J\u00f6rmundfenris but also health pickups that are scattered around the world. It is good to gather health because when you take damage some functionality will disappear, such as Compass and Harpoon. Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T04:26:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/332/3324a58c36e095629b211ccac6edc046.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bejno"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
