Made for the Mini micro 09 game jam.<br/></p>\n<p>The Small People, as its name implies, is a small community of people of really short height. They live in a small town next to the mountains. It's a peaceful place, not many exciting things happen and everyone live a happy life, except for... certain people...</p>\n<p>There's a group of people that are not happy with their height. Some of them are scientists. They've been studying and researching about how to grow up quickly. Since experimenting with animals is ilegal, they stay in the outskirts of town.</p>\n<p>They also have enough millitary power to protect themselves from any threat.\u00a0 With this power, they succesfully captured a group of giraffes alive. Their ancestors experimented with camels and it ended terribly wrong. They thought if they experimented with a different animal maybe the results would be different, but no. The exact same thing that happened to the camels are happening to the giraffes.<br/>Yes, they grow as big as a mountain, but they also get very aggressive and start shooting bullets from their mouths.</p>\n<p>Your duty is to protect the  town. If at least one giraffe escapes is game over for the small people.\u00a0 Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T07:36:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/988/988a79303dcca592cdd726268c2d5ab0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Intas"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
