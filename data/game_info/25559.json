As Bubbles, a brave bubble fish, \n      you\u2019ll set out to uncover all of the gold bars in each maze. But you\u2019ll \n      have to be careful: Sea Urchins will relentlessly pursue Bubbles, and \n      there are also dangerous black holes that must be avoided. Bubbles isn\u2019t \n      defenseless, though, as she has the ability to stun Sea Urchins with \n      sound waves and quickly change direction using posts scattered \n      throughout the stages. Not only that, but the locations of the gold bars \n      in each maze form the outline of another object\u2014so once you know the \n      object, you\u2019re well on your way to finding the gold! With 20 stages to \n      complete and increasingly complex conditions (like having to pass over \n      the gold bars twice to uncover them), you might just want to bring along \n      a friend for help.\n    </p><p>This game is only playable in 2D.</p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
