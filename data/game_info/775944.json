Use WASD or the arrow keys to move. Aim with the cursor and click to shoot! To kill an enemy you have to hit him 3 times, you have 5 lives yourself.</p>\n\n<p>IMPORTANT: The game is made for Full HD, so use full screen. If you don't do this, unless you have a very large screen, you probably won't see a portion of the top and bottom. If you continue to have problems with the size, try downloading the game for Windows and running that version instead of the WebGL version. Then the problem should be fixed.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T13:11:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44a/44a1656a7804bedb27cbe5fc1d523943.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Lorenz K"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
