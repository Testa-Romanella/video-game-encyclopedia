You need to go through a special zone in space where common logic is not applicable. Asteroids follow strange patterns, and you encounter other colonies of space insects also seeking to evolve. Feast on their parts to become the most majestic insect and insure your lineage.<h3>Quick gameplay overview</h3>In this minimalist bullet hell, you need to survive a determined number of waves to complete a run. Your space insect is automated, firing at regular intervals, but you control the movements during the waves.<br/><br/>You start with a set of unlocked parts to build your insect, then get new parts when defeating enemies. Those parts drop randomly from the defeated enemy\u2019s parts.<br/><br/>You manage your health through life cores. Your insect will always have at least one core, but you can earn more if you get lucky through a run. A core and all its attached parts will be destroyed if something hits it, and they are essential for your survival. <br/><br/>You\u2019ll face more complex enemies as the waves go, and the number of waves to go through to survive will increase after every completed run.<h3>If you read until here...</h3>The creation team is composed of 3 developers with more or less video game development experiences. We focus on delivering a simple yet interesting and fun gameplay. Hopefully, we will bring more simple and original quality games in this already diverse ecosystem.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T05:50:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/47f/47f06e0a39937c1d97f12f5d744815a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Patente Des Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Patente Des Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
