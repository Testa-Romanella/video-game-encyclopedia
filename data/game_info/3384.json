{"id": 3384, "slug": "woah-dave", "name": "Woah Dave!", "name_original": "Woah Dave!", "description": "From the folks behind the BIT.TRIP series comes the frantic insanity that is WOAH DAVE! Help our hero, Dave Lonuts, survive an insane alien invasion and line his pockets with shiny pennies.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHurl alien eggs, skull bombs, and explosive WOAH blocks to stay alive and sky rocket yourself to high score fame and fortune.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe brave players who manage to survive the alien onslaught and collect the most coins will be rewarded with top placement on the fierce online leaderboards. Do you have what it takes to be the world\u2019s best Dave? Or will you end up playing second fiddle to another, more powerful Dave? <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWoah Dave! also features a local two-player competitive mode, where two Daves can go head-to-head in a battle to collect the most coins. We aren\u2019t exaggerating when we say it could very well result in ruined friendships and unsalvageable marriages. Competitive games are good like that.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf that isn\u2019t enough Dave for you, there\u2019s also Bonkers Mode with more aliens, more lava, and more chances to get killed. Those who brave the storm will be rewarded with a splendor of precious coinage; those who fail will be revoked of their License to Dave.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGood luck, and may the best Dave win.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-05T17:52:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f0b/f0b62e6cda41ae5e98daa0e903e8fcd8.jpg", "website": "http://www.woahdave.com", "rating": 2.0, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 23, "owned": 457, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 28, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 54, "ratings_count": 66, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 66, "platforms": ["Wii U", "PlayStation 4", "PS Vita", "Nintendo 3DS", "iOS", "Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Choice Provisions", "MiniVisions"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Choice Provisions"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
