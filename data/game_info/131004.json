Sometimes it seems like they won't click but if you find the sweet spot on the button it'll eventually work.</p><p>Controls: WASD - Move Space - Interact with things Mouse click - buttons under conversations. Red = Mean, Blue = Nice, Yellow = Awkward/Funny</p><p>The front doors, people and some items in the classrooms are intractable (front desks, lunch room tables, some desks, etc).</p><p>The goal is to get a date for prom! Talk to students and say something nice, mean or awkward as responses. Everyone prefers and hates certain kinds of conversation. Students also are more prone to favor you if you've spent time training in the classrooms they like.</p><p>Teachers in the classrooms can also gain and lose favor towards you. If a teacher likes you enough you can add them to your party for stat boosts.</p><p>Try and figure out if you're gaining or losing favor based on the responses people give you!</p><p>On the last day, ask around and try to get a date to prom! Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e96/e9684cd5cf7454e0a1448f37fa09d664.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ObsessiveNerd"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
