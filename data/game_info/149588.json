Help them!<br/>You can shoot them out of mugs by pressing <strong>SPACE</strong>, the <strong>A, S, W, D</strong> keys or by clicking on the colored buttons. But you cannot control them directly.<br/>Turn the level walls by pressing the <strong>LEFT</strong> and <strong>RIGHT ARROW</strong> keys.</p><p>At least one little guy must reach a white mug, so that you can advance to the next level. Avoid black mugs though - they swallow the little guys.</p><p>All cookies give points. Eat as much as you can!<br/>If a cookie has a color on it then the little guy will only eat those of its own color.<br/>The jam filled heart cookies are 1UPs!</p><p>Find more great game experiments at http://metacozm.com</p>All code and art was made by Harry Trautmann, except the following:<p>Font \"Sztylet\" by \"Cannot Into Space Fonts\"<br/>https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/sztylet<br/>via Open Font License (OFL)</p><p>Sfx \"metal grind.wav\" by \"Daphne_in_Wonderland\"<br/>http://www.freesound.org/people/Daphne_in_Wonderla...<br/>via CC-0</p><p>Sfx \"Munching Food\" by \"Kodack\"<br/>http://www.freesound.org/people/Kodack/sounds/2563...<br/>via CC-0</p><p>Sfx \"shoveling stones\" by \"monotraum\"<br/>http://www.freesound.org/people/monotraum/sounds/2...<br/>via CC-0</p><p>Graphic image \"Cozy Kitchen\" by \"Mathilda Tan\"<br/>http://www.freeimages.com/photo/cozy-kitchen-15409...<br/>via FreeImages.com Content License</p><p>Graphic image \"Kitchen\" by \"Phillip Collier\"<br/>http://www.freeimages.com/photo/kitchen-1558906<br/>via FreeImages.com Content License</p><p>Graphic image \"Gingerbread Forms 2\" by \"Gyulav\u00e1ri Csaba\"<br/>http://www.freeimages.com/photo/gingerbread-forms-...<br/>via FreeImages.com Content License</p><p>Graphic image \"Chocolate Chip Cookies\" by \"Ioleia\" <br/>available at http://www.freeimages.com/photo/chocolate-chip-coo...<br/>via FreeImages.com Content License</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/003/003a601b81b0efad261f04eac6525d2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Jireugi"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
