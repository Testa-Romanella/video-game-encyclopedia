Being exhausted means you are much slower. Resting at night is more effective.</p>\n<p>- Earn money in the OFFICE.</p>\n<p>If a white circle appears inside the OFFICE you have to go there or you won't earn any money in the meantime.</p>\n<p>Working is boring and you will lose HAPPINESS. Low HAPPINESS will drain your HEALTH.</p>\n<p>While the OFFICE border is red your boss doesn't want you to leave. If you do so anyway you might get FIRED.</p>\n<p>If you have been FIRED you have to wait until you get a new job offer.</p>\n<p>With money you'll be able to:</p>\n<p>- Eat in the DINER.</p>\n<p>Eating makes you HAPPY. Even if your SATIATION bar is full you can continue eating to gain HAPPINESS. But you will also gain WEIGHT. The only way to lose WEIGHT is to starve yourself.</p>\n<p>- Heal yourself in the HOSPITAL.</p>\n<p>- Drink in the BAR. It'll make you very HAPPY but also DRUNK. Partying at night is even more fun.</p>\n<p>- Rest in the HOTEL. Resting here is more effective and a good alternative if your home is being repaired or it's too HOT at home because you don't have AIR CONDITIONING yet. Resting at night is even more effective.</p>\n<p>- Put money into your BANK account. You will gain interest every 5 days but the money won't be available anymore. It will be included in the final SCORE though.</p>\n<p>Additional Features:</p>\n<p>- Little QUESTION MARKS will appear at random locations all over the map. You may find something interesting there:</p>\n<p>\u00a0+ MONEY</p>\n<p>\u00a0+ OLD SANDWICHES are great when you are starving and can't afford food but they are disgusting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0+ BOOZE will make you very drunk but happy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0You have to LEFT CLICK if you want to eat/drink stuff you found on the ground.</p>\n<p>\u00a0+ BANDAGES are applied automatically if health isn't full, MONEY and ITEMS are automatically picked up.</p>\n<p>- From time to time merchants will have an ITEM for sale. If the dollar sign appears under a market stand you can go there and buy the ITEM with LEFT CLICK as long as you can afford it.</p>\n<p>- If it gets to HOT or COLD you will sweat/freeze while outside. This will make you unhappy/slow. There are items to counteract those effects.</p>\n<p>- During HOLIDAYS you will get paid twice as much for your work or you can stay at home and gain HAPPINESS.</p>\n<p>- When you knock over garbage cans or damage hydrants or the generator the city will send a worker to fix it. Workers hate to pick up trash, so you may want to put the garbage can back up and push the trash back in.</p>\n<p>- The final SCORE is calculated from the amount of DAYS you survived and all of your MONEY - including your bank account balance.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS/INPUT:</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0 Eat or drink stuff found on the ground / Buy item</p>\n<p>Right Mouse Button - Dismiss item</p>\n<p>Middle Mouse Button / I\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Inventory</p>\n<p>Escape\u00a0 -\u00a0 Pause Menu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T13:10:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4c/b4c643a98d4669dfa8844fdc76e7c41f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ugly-but-fun Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
