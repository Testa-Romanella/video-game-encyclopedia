Keep a good rhythm and pick up items to gain style points. Watch your hoop meter and try to keep it up. If your hoop goes down, it's game over! Also avoid bumping into pedestrians or stepping on crabs, as it is not very stylish and may knock your hoop down. See how many style points you can get!</p>\n<p>---------Controls---------<br/>WASD to move<br/>Tap the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to the rhythm to keep your hula hoop up.</p>\n<p>A graphic will appear in the top left corner of your screen when you're playing. A hula hoop will rotate left and right over a dotted line to show you which side your hoop is on. When one side of the hoop touches the dotted line, tap the arrow key on that side.<br/>Look at the graphic when you're not sure which arrow key to hit, but use your ears to keep the rhythm. Otherwise, you might step on an unsuspecting crab while you're not looking!</p>\n<p>Watch out for people, dogs, crabs and umbrellas!
