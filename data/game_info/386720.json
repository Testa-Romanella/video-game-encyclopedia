{"id": 386720, "slug": "graveyard-encounters-jamgame", "name": "Graveyard Encounters - JamGame", "name_original": "Graveyard Encounters - JamGame", "description": "<p>Entry into the LibGDX\u00a0 Halloween game jam for 2019</p>\n<p>This is a very basic top down shooter which takes place in a graveyard.<br/></p>\n<p>You deal with 5 waves of enemies. Each wave only spawns enemies for about 30 seconds. The next wave wont start until all enemies have been killed.</p>\n<p>Basic WASD movement, with mouse aiming and click to shoot.</p>\n<p>You can use the right mouse button to throw a glow stick to light up a small area of the map. You only get 3 to these to use.<br/></p>\n<p>*Authors Note</p>\n<p>I consider the game unfinished, since I ran out of time to do what I originally intended. But I'm glad I got it to a point where I could at least submit it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As my second Libgdx GameJam Entry this was a great learning opportunity.</p>\n<p>I'll be honest. Things started off great, but I bit off waaaay more\u00a0\u00a0than I could chew. I realized what I originally intended had to be cut short. But I didn't want to give up on making an entry so I did my best to rush this out.<br/></p>\n<p>Looking back this was a great excuse to work on some stuff I have never tried before. TiledMap, Mouse aiming, with weapon rotation and Lighting effects.</p>\n<p>Lessons Learned...</p>\n<p>*Personal note for next time... SIMPLIFY!*</p>\n\n<p>Most Assets where\u00a0NOT created by me. Though I did have to make some modifications to them.
