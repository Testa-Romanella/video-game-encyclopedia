After searching the area, you find a deep hole leading further into the caves. You must find a way to escape, and it looks like\u00a0the only way forward is down.</p>\n\n<p>+ Features +</p>\n<p>- Adventure through three different cave\u00a0environments!\u00a0<br/>- Find seven abilities that allow you to explore deeper into the caves!<br/>- Explore every nook and cranny to unlock a variant ending!<br/>- Play in browser or with the file\u00a0provided (tested with BGB)!<br/>- Experience authentic Game Boy graphics and sounds!<br/>- Enjoy the complete lack of chiptune music since I'm a slowpoke!<br/>- Probably experience some random bugs because I keep finding more somehow!</p>\n\n<p>+ Controls +</p>\n<p>Left / A\u00a0 (Game Boy: Left) - Move Left<br/>Right / D (Game Boy: Right) - Move Right<br/>Alt / Z / J (Game Boy: A) - Jump<br/>Ctrl / K / X (Game Boy: B) - Attack/Dash<br/>Shift (Game Boy: Select) - Shrink</p>\n\n<p>+ Notes +</p>\n<p>- Selecting \"New Game\" will *immediately* overwrite the save file with a fresh save. I only recently got saving to work and have not had the time to make it more user friendly<br/>- Selecting \"Continue\" on first play with cause the game to load at a default position, then crash, but resetting should fix it<br/>- I haven't had time to compose any music yet, due to time crunch, so sorry for the silence<br/>- I had plans to create boss battles, but due to a combination of lack of time and running into some system limitations, I had to table them in the interest of finishing the core game. Perhaps I'll expand the game in the future... Cavern DX maybe?<br/>- I learned a lot about working with Game Boy limitations during this, but I still have a lot to learn. Some parts are admittedly rough, with a few laggy spots, but everything is functional and playable at least.<br/>- Made with\u00a0ZGB! It's cool stuff!
