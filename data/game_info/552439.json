Not the first game per SE but the first one we actually finished.</p>\n<p>The game is obviously not great mainly because I first had to learn how to make games in unity. Vlajd did\u00a0the entire sound design and made most of the models, menus and\u00a0 textures.</p>\n<p>A lot of Ideas and features had to be scratched because there simply wasn't enough time. The game ended up becoming a fps style shooter that is pretty hard at first but when you master the controls it becomes a lot of fun(at least in my opinion).</p>\n<p>You can b-hop pretty easily and there are probably some glitches that we didn't find.</p>\n<p>I hope that with all it's flaws you can still enjoy the game.</p>\r\ncontrols\r\nW A S D\u00a0 move around.\r\nSPACE\u00a0 \u00a0 jump\r\n1 / 2\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 select weapons\u00a0\r\nLMB\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0shoot\r\nRMB\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 time slowdown\r\nJump on a wall to wallrun\r\nSPACE\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0on a wall to walljump\r\nCTRL\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0sneak\r\nR\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 reload\r\ntips\r\nWhen trying to wallrun\u00a0\r\n<p>don't jump to a wall when standing right next to it or you will perform a grounded walljump.</p><p>dont hold space you will immediately.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\nWhen learning the controlls\u00a0\r\n<p>use the time slowdown to avoid dying from shots all the time.</p>\r\nWhen trying to fight enemys\r\n<p>the shotgun deals more damage the closer you are to the enemy.</p>\n<p>the tracking is pretty basic so just stay on the run.</p>\r\nThe sword is lighter than the shotgun\r\n<p>you move faster and the time slowdown is longer</p>\n\r\nSocials:\r\n<p>slackers:\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0YouTube</p>\n<p>vlajd:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0YouTube</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T14:04:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba1/ba1647587d64f76b6c25b7a848a6bdc1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Slackers"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
