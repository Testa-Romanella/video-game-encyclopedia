{"id": 886827, "slug": "maze-zing", "name": "Maze Zing", "name_original": "Maze Zing", "description": "<p>Quick and dirty procedurally generated maze game. Took about a week to make, which is a turnaround I'm pretty happy with, personally.\u00a0The game is playable, and I tried to take some reasonable measures to make levels neither too hard nor too easy, but it is some very rudimentary procedural generation.</p>\n<p>Move with WASD or arrow keys. Your goal in each level is to find the exit, which is a small boxy circle.\u00a0Should be easy to recognize, it's the only thing you will see in the first few levels.</p>\n<p>However, not only does the maze get larger as you progress through the levels,\u00a0enemies will be added to the maze, too.\u00a0Mines are most common, they will beep at a distance, and beep three times when you get right next to them. They will then explode. Don't touch them, or be next to them when they explode.</p>\n<p>Next are Stompers. You will hear these jumping around when they show up, and they will try to chase you if they see you. They aren't too much of a threat if you pay attention, and even if they corner you, understand that they aren't just moving, they are jumping. Move underneath them while they are in the air.</p>\n<p>Last are the Phantoms. You can always see these, but they can also always see you.\u00a0They will constantly move towards you, but just remain still if they catch you, and they will reappear a distance away shortly.</p>\n<p>Also, remember you have one life.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now, just some quick Q/A:</p>\n<p>Q: Will you add [mode, enemy, mechanic, etc]?<br/>A: Depends on specifics, but the answer is probably no. I\u00a0just wanted to make a maze game. I\u00a0don't want to get too bogged down with adding a bunch of extra stuff to a game I don't intend to sell.</p>\n\n<p>Q: I found a bug!<br/>A: Please give me as many details as you can, and I\u00a0will try to fix it. Though I\u00a0might not bother with something that isn't game breaking, and not a simple fix.</p>\n<p>Q: How do I win?<br/>A: This is like an old arcade game.\u00a0You just keep playing until you lose.\u00a0Go for a high score, if you want.<br/></p>\n<p>Q: Then how about leaderboards?<br/>A: I don't think that's a great idea when there is so much randomness involved. I\u00a0tried to make every maze always winnable, but I haven't tested the upper bounds of complicated mazes and excessive numbers of monsters.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T07:36:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d75/d759f1c39fd1659cbd55472ad51bb133.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RhetHypo"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
