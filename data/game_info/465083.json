Each character has their own personality, and while you can ask them to do something, they may refuse, or get distracted and do something else entirely. Once you hit go, it\u2019s up to the characters to decide, it\u2019s out of your hands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Think about their personalities before asking them to do things, and perhaps their interests will align with yours.</p>\n\n<p>The Athlete</p>\n<p>Spent so long training his body, but not enough time training his mind. Very easily distracted, if he can see a button, he will press it.</p>\n<p>The Herb Enthusiast</p>\n<p>He\u2019ll tell you that his interests are strictly medicinal, but he\u2019s not particularly convincing. Has an antisocial habit of filling the air with smoke so thick you can\u2019t see anything.</p>\n<p>The Vegan</p>\n<p>Will eat pretty much any kind of plant, but refuses to hurt animals. Unfortunately, this does not stop the animals from hurting her.</p>\n<p>The Psychopath</p>\n<p>Sometimes what you need to solve your problems is a blunt object. And sometimes you need a gun and an empathy disorder. Polly won\u2019t be much use in doing what you ask, unless what you\u2019re asking is killing.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><strong>Move:</strong>\u00a0Click</li><li><strong>Interact: </strong>Click</li><li><strong>Back to Menu\u00a0:</strong> M</li></ul>\n<p>First you need to click a portrait to select a character, and then click on an object to request they interact with it.</p><p><em>If everything hangs and won't let you input again, <strong>press Q</strong> to break out of it.</em></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li><strong>Joe Shanahan</strong>\u00a0(Programming/Animation)</li><li><strong>James Kelly</strong>\u00a0(Programming)\u00a0</li><li><strong>Amy Elliott\u00a0</strong>(Art/Programming/Shaders)</li></ul>\r\nMusic\r\n<p>Bossa Antigua by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3454-bossa-antigua<br/>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T07:30:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c81/c81f83b6420a39477e1edfd16488b234.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Team Horsehead"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
