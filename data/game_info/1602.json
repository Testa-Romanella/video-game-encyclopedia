{"id": 1602, "slug": "rome-total-war", "name": "ROME: Total War", "name_original": "ROME: Total War", "description": "<p>Rome: Total War is a turn-based strategy. It is third of the numerous Total War titles: the main series counts as many as 13 titles, with 4 games being spin-offs. Rome: Total War is estimated to be one of the best PC strategies.<br />\nThe story follows a line of three Roman families: Julii, Brutii, or Scipii. The story takes place in the late Roman Empire. As the plot is driven entirely by the player&#39;s actions, it is possible to have numerous outcomes \u2014 one&#39;s story may end at the end of a battle, while another may start at the same time.<br />\nThere are dramatic gameplay differences in the title: the concept of a city is introduced: a fraction is considered defeated when it loses all the cities. The city can be lost in three ways: either conquered, bribed or contracted. There are a total of 21 fractions within a game with each economy being summed up by some factors: trade industry, taxes, agriculture, and mining.</p>", "metacritic": 88, "released": "2004-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-13T21:13:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d2a/d2a4b12c173f9ffba1c384a0607a3aea.jpg", "website": "http://www.feralinteractive.com/en/mac-games/rome-ios/?utm_source=mas&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=mas_rome-ios_minisite", "rating": 4.4, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 27, "owned": 533, "beaten": 193, "toplay": 27, "dropped": 89, "playing": 8}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 240, "suggestions_count": 496, "game_series_count": 20, "reviews_count": 242, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS", "macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Feral Interactive", "Creative Assembly"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["SEGA", "Feral Interactive", "Activision Blizzard"], "esrb_rating": null}
