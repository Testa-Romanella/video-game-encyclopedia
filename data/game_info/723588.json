While the game definitely wears its inspirations on its sleeve, I'm really proud of some of the later mechanics and level designs I came up with. I hope you enjoy it!</p>\r\nOther controls\r\n<p>XBOX and PS4 controller are both supported in addition to the above keyboard controls. If you plug in a controller and press a button, you should see the control prompts at the title screen change to match an XBOX controller.</p>\r\nOptions\r\n<ul><li>Hold R - Restart the current level\u00a0</li><li>Hold T - Return to title screen</li><li>Hold K - Skip cutscene</li></ul>\n<p>Also if you run into any issues with the web version, please leave a comment and if you can, try the downloadable version. I recommend using Chrome if you plan to play the web version, though Firefox should work fine as well. Thanks! </p>\n<p> If you enjoyed the soundtrack, feel free to check out my  soundcloud!</p>\n<p> My speedrun PB is 5:17.399, so if you want to speedrun this game, let me know if you beat my time!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T06:46:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/563/563f30dfaab913b6dd88ee12a922e00b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["abhimonk"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
