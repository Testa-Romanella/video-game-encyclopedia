Please note that for keyboard input to work, you may need to click in the empty space around the game window. We are actively working to find a fix for this, please let us know if you have issues.</p>\n\n<p>Welcome to Run and Chomp, a small, audio only endless runner made for Trijam. The goal of the game is to land on alligators who have their mouthes closed so you can make it over a pit of quicksand. Try to avoid falling in the quicksand, or being eaten by an alligator with its mouth open. The game is played entirely through sound. The most important sound sounds like a boing, and this is an alligator with its mouth closed. You can thus land on it when you are jumping above it, and then jump again to make it over the pit of quicksand. Other noteable sounds include a chomp/bite sound for alligators with their mouthes open, and bubbling for the pit itself.</p>\n\n<p>The game works on windows, mac OS, linux, and should work on the web too. Keyboard controls are provided and verified working, as well as game controller controls, though these may have trouble depending on your game controller used. This is planned to be remedied as soon as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for checking out this Trijam submission. We plan to develop it further as time allows after the jam, so stay tuned for updates and maybe even a full featured game some day! :-)</p>\n\n<p>-Michael from 2MB Games. https://2mb.games/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T13:23:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b88/b88630582c2406532131b0d0e1f804b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["2MB Solutions"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
