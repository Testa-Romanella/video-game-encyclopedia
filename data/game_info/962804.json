Some types can destroy droplets, others for example generate coins.<br/><br/>The lake can be attacked by <strong>2 types of droplets</strong> - water and oil. Each type can only be destroyed by a specific type of product(s).<br/><br/><strong>Droplets attack the lake in waves</strong>. For each droplet destroyed, the player receives a score and a certain number of coins with which he can buy ACO products and place them around the map. Each subsequent wave is slightly stronger - the drops are faster and have more lives. If any drop gets into the lake, the lake will lose a certain number of lives. <strong>Once the lake runs out of lives the game ends</strong>. The goal is to get as far as possible and collect the highest score. There is no limit to the number of waves.<br/><br/>As a bonus, the game contains the so-called <strong>ACOpedia</strong>, an encyclopedia containing around <strong>75 interesting facts about water</strong>. With each successfully completed wave, 1 fact is unlocked.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-30T02:43:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6e/d6e66fd3341ef248b197a8d8a4d32bbd.jpg", "website": "https://www.buildingdrainage.aco/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["red.aco"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual"], "publishers": ["ACO Industries, k.s."], "esrb_rating": null}
