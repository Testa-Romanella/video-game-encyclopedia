Neither do I!<br/></p>\n<p>Balloon Rider is a simple game that is meant for an easy, fun gameplay without having to read any instructions or learn any complicated rules. The controls are so simple anyone who can use a keyboard can play the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The concept is to fly a hot air balloon, go through some rings, rack up the score and then land properly to get the landing bonus. There are instructions in the game itself but even without them you can play it easily.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While the game is easy and fun to play, it's meant to be the kind of game where you would want to come back and see if you can increase your score this time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A side benefit of the game is to use it to relax. Simply take the balloon up in the clouds and cruise along while enjoying the scenery without worrying about the score.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is my first game on Itch.io. I am hoping that people will like it and I will be motivated to make more games.\u00a0</p><p>The version available here is for PC execution.\u00a0 You can also play the game for free on my website\u00a0https://www.secondrealitygames.com/games/balloonrider.html</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T06:08:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f73/f738d9ecd963da5951cb7802ef3d1221.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sunnygoswami"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
