Ok! Cheap sounds good. I give you 10 dollars. Now leave my office!\"\r\nChuck: \"No Jack. I said 'Chip' design\". I have some wonderful ideas. And it will cost you some dollars, I'm afraid.\"\r\nJack : \"Whoooot? Can't you just make something up from scrap? I need the budget for the next Commodore commercial. It goes like \"Are you keeping up with...\"\r\nChuck: \"Sorry, Jack. We have already used all scrap material to pimp the CEO restroom so you can play Jupiter Lander while...\"\r\nJack : \"All right, all right. Let's see. One of my sons made a game that needs to be tested. It is a Tenliner. To keep costs low, you know.\"\r\nChuck: \"And...?\"\r\nJack : \"Well it has platforms where you need to collect coins. I'm a bit of a gambler, so let's say, one collected coin stands for $50'000. Equal to one revision.\"\r\nChuck: \"I need to play a game to get funded my next CPU revisions? What's the catch?\"\r\nJack : \"You only have one go. That's it. Let's see how well you love your team. After that no more money. Everrrrrr!\"\r\nChuck: \"Ok. Looks like this is my last chance to get some money. I can do that. Let's focus...\"\r\nNow do your best to assure many many more years of Research &amp; Development for your 65xx CPU architecture and help MOS and Commodore to stay ahead of the growing competition.\r\nTask and Goal\r\n=============\r\nTry to collect as many coins as possible. You can only use the black platforms to stay in the game.\r\nWhile one platform disappears with your own gravitation momentum another one will appear from the top.\r\nTry to estimate the best route to get to the coin but also to land again on a platform in reach.\r\nYou can also leave the screen to the left or right to enter the screen again from the other side.\r\nGood luck (and focus)!\r\nControl:\r\n========\r\nUse Joystick in Port 2 for moving left and right.\r\nFire button to restart the game.\r\nGame Requirements:\r\n==================\r\n- C64/C128* with BASIC 2.0 runtime environment (or compatible)\r\n- 1 Player\r\n*Also playable on Windows/MacOS/iOS/Android (C64 Emulator required)\r\nStarting in VICE: C64 emulator (http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/):\r\n==================================================================\r\nStart the emulator and then drag and drop the \"chuckschallenge.prg\" into the VICE window.\r\n-or-\r\nLoad the program with the command: load \"chuckschallenge.prg\",8\r\nThen start the program with:       run\r\nChuck's Challenge BASIC program
