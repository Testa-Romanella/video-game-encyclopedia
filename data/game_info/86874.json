There are wizards, forest nymphs, magic effects, epic enemies and even a final battle.  We've included short movie cut scenes to help see how the story unfolds.<br/><br/>The story begins with your young tiger.  You must help her find her way in the world.  Find some family members, mark some territory, and avoid the wild enemies.  Your big cat will build her skill by completing various quests. Along the way, you will develop your hunting skills. You will need to drink water and stay hydrated. Be sure to hunt and eat when your hunger level gets low.<br/><br/>This a long form game. That means it will take you some effort to complete.
