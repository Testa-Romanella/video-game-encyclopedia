If you are unable to win at first just retry... (hint: R) <br/>The level's walls will regenerate thus every time you play the level is unique.<br/><br/>The inspiration is the difficulty of the Pogostic toy, wich to us seems almost impossible to ballance... add force and things starts to get crazy!<br/><br/>You might even lose your head or win by accident!<br/><br/>This game won the Voyager Award at Create Jam Fall Edition 2016<br/><br/>Our team name Cheval, is the french word for horse... which seemed strangely fitting.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a0/4a0383f94e4bc93d907df6f4b82c413f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MrExillion"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
