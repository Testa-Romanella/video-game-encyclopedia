You are a robotic tank left over from a war that destroyed the world. You try to {~use the arrow keys~} to run and jump through floating, defused TNT, dodge floating red landmines {~solid red blocks~}, and illusions {~upside-down TNT~} to the portals, on a hopeless quest for life and happiness without falling into lava or exploding. In the end, you realize that when you die {~and you will~}, nothing will remain. You look deeper. Even when you are alive, nothing important remains. Your only purpose was to win a war that was the end of everything. The point of your life was to kill everything, to destroy it all.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!
