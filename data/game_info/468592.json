This project is my first ever videogame submission (and first ever videogame I have made ever in general!) for RMIT university's Games Design course, which I am apart of.</p>\n<p>The premise was creating a game based around the prompt: a game based on \"catching\", which although could be interpreted in whatever way the students see fit, it involves \"any form of action that results in reaching the objective by catching it\"  as the main drive of the game.</p>\n<p>For my first game ever, I had to learn how to use Game Maker Studio 2 from absolute scratch, as I am fairly new to programming in general. It took a long time, many youtube tutorials, and it still is CLEARLY not a perfect product, but a good first attempt at making a game!<br/></p>\n<p>The theme is obviously in reference to the recent Corona Virus (COVID-19) pandemic outbursts, and in all honesty, I chose it because of pure comical value, and to see how RMIT lecturers would react to my idea. I'm glad to say they were supportive!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T20:33:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f9/3f90dfe9eb10140b08f2f424e7b97500.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ionatan B Maghidman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
