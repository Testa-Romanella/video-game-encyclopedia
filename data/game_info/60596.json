Experience the couple of seconds adventure, stretched to infinite time.</strong><strong> The mystery of life after death. In game you are talking with yourself, with your subconsciousness.</strong>It will happen eventually to all of us, but Mr. Samson is the guy who has no luck today \u2013 he\u2019s dying. He is falling into his own mind and each next second is taking longer and longer. At the beginning, the first second felt like three seconds. The normal time was slower for him than for others. The next second one was like five minutes. He had very much time to rethink his life. For everyone else this is the matter of seconds, but for him this was taking forever. Finally the last second of his life on earth was stretched to the infinite time\u2026 and this is when we are starting our adventure. The adventure where you are moving through 4-dimensional system. The space and the time are connected here and you are free to move not only in three directions (width, height and depth) but also in the fourth one \u2013 time.<br/><strong>Clinically Dead is a game about flow of the time while dying.</strong>The action take place in mind of person while he is dying. The time is flowing not as we are<br/>used to in real. Not only it can flow into the future. But it can also stop or flow backwards.<br/>The time is binded into the space. So as we move through the the level we also move<br/>through the time. The change of the time changes various things in the game.<br/><strong>Time and space are bound together. Moving through the level changes the time and player\u2019s life.</strong>The time field is represented as colors which are casted on the level. The blue color is a low value of time. Red is high value of time. The rest of the colors represent corresponding time in between minimal and maximal time.Think of it like weather forecast where the temperature is visualised with colors on the map<br/>As you move through the map the temperature changes. Same thing is in the game. As you move through the level the time changes.<br/><br/>The time field itself can be also modified by moving or throwing the various items in game.<br/>The time also corresponds to player\u2019s life which means there is negative time (dark gray<br/>color) which makes the player respawn. Overall it\u2019s what can be called the \u201dtriple entanglement\u201d. Time to the space and time to the player\u2019s health.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<strong>Goal</strong>You are dying and you are trapped in your mind with your subconscious . All that left you<br/>before the moment of death is couple of seconds. Your goal is to collect the seconds to be<br/>able to die. Be careful for creatures in your mind. It's not a horror game, but has some creepy moments as we like.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-25T19:04:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7f/d7fcddba4a9eea3c60fbfb315bdc5d8c.jpg", "website": "http://www.mogilagames.com/clinically-dead", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 62}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 6, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 469, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mogila Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PlayWay", "Ultimate Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
