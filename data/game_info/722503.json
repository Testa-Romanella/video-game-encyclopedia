I tried to make this game as juicy as I could and added the secondary theme for the jam \"Don't Stop\".\u00a0</em>\n<em>You are an imp that wants to murder these little box devils that plague this game. Each level, 4 boxes spawn randomly and you have 4 seconds to murder them. Murdering these devils is easy as all you have to do is touch them and then they die. Your Impy aura murders them when you touch them leaving a big explosion.\u00a0<br/></em>\n<em>So don't stop and continue murdering them. Each second counts. If the countdown falls to zero, you are back at the main menu.</em>\r\nMade in 8 days for the jam. All of the art is original and made during the duration of the jam.\u00a0 Used the\u00a0Trirampo Colour Pallete for the art. Thanks to\u00a0Juice Baby's feedback this game is 10 times better than what it was.\r\n<p>Hope you like what I put together</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T10:17:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55d/55d720507beb24d4669d483362a2dbfe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["CybearTron"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
