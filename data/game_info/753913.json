There are enemies which descend from the top of the screen. And they can hurt you (as you might expect). They also come in different colors. Here is a list of all the enemies with some info to go along with it.</p>\r\nAll Enemies\r\nBlerkul\r\n<p>Blerkuls are the most simple enemy. They descend from the top of the screen and... well, that's it.</p>\r\n\u00a0Pointling\r\n<p>Pointlings are like Blerkuls, but faster and don't appear as often.</p>\r\n\u00a0Amphibash\r\n<p>Amphibashes are frog-like aliens. After reaching a certain position on the screen, They will change directions and go real fast.
