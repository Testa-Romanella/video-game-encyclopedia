Piece together the requirements and spot common patterns amongst the various eggs to get eacg egg to incubate...why, it's almost like \"crafting\" life. Each egg in your inventory will \"expire\" after 20 days, so use your wits and dastardly cunning to incubate all the eggs before the Company\u2122 moves on to the next planet.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong>Mouse-based Game</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements<br/></strong>It's a little in-efficiently programmed due to time constraints and I haven't been able to test it on any systems but mine, so I'm not entirely sure, let me know how it runs on your computer.</p>\n<p><strong>Known Bugs<br/></strong>The resolution system is pretty buggy. It may work for you, but the recommended resolution to play the game on is 1920x1080. All other resolutions are used at the users peril.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T13:22:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a6/4a63fadeba11777bc5885393fe87ee87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RefresherTowel"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
