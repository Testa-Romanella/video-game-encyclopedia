Punch Out!!, okay, I get it, but WindJammers? What does it have in common with boxing?\"</p>\n<p>Well, the question is more about what it DOESN'T have in common. Knock Me Out is to boxing what WindJammers is to Ultimate and Frisbee games in general :</p>\n<p>Not exactly faithfull to its source material.</p>\n<p>So, it's still two people punching each other in shorts and gloves, but take out the rounds, the timer, the points, add special attacks and tornados, and you should get what this game is about...</p>\n<p>... strategy?</p>\n<p>There is no IA, 2 players only:<br/></p><p>-Down boxer is controller based, but shambled in the transition to HTML<br/></p><p>-Up boxer is arrow based and numpad0 is attack.</p><p>The PoC lacks music and the second fight is broken for some reason, but I'm kind of tired and want to go on? So here it is. If I come back to this concept, I'll certainly redo it from scratch.</p><p>Any feedback is still welcome.</p><p>Have Fun!!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T05:21:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab7/ab7458a1ee7f24c514025c68a37af6b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Maurice Willinger"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
