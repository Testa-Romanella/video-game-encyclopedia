Deduction and a pinch of luck are the heart of almOSt.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play</strong></p>\n<p>At your left, the available cards. A used card is replaced by another one. Each one is related to a wish : entertainment, social, practical and comfort.</p>\n<p>At your right, the unrevealed wishes of your owner. Use your cards to meet these wishes and earn data. Nothing happens ? Proceed by deduction and use other cards.</p>\n<p>Be careful! Using a wrong card will make you lose data. If your data score is close to 0, use keydata by clicking on a wish : each card used has a chance to fetch these precious data.</p>\n<p>The more you're right, the more your owner will connect his house. Unlock the livingroom, bathroom, kitchen and even the garage to earn new cards and take the entire control!</p>\n<p><strong><em>Exclusively in French - for the moment.<br/></em></strong></p><p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Programming - Lo\u00efc Escales <br/>Art - Lo\u00efc Le Mou\u00ebl <br/>Game design - Hugo Jacquet</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-01T03:51:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e7/1e7cdbd1b008422083b64cf8fb912f11.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["La La Band"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
