Or what might happened if the crow gave up on getting water from the pitcher or the lamb had had the sense to run away from the wolf?\u00a0That's exactly what this VN explores\u00a0in those and two other fables. The original/\"true\" endings are present, but each fable also has at least one alternate ending.\u00a0</p><p>Art note: Only \"The Crow and the Pitcher\" and \"The wolf in the Lamb\" have all their sprite finished. The other fables currently just have one static image for the whole tale.
