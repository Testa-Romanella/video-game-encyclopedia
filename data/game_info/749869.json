As U-Boat commander your mission is to sink as much Allied shipping as possible within a fast 20-turn time frame without yourself getting sunk. You have a limited supply of torpedoes and battery life, and an operational area of four depth level within which to maneuver and evade aerial attack and depth charges. Each patrol lasts no more than 10 minutes in this fun-filled yet intensive drama that unfolds above and below the dark seas of the North Atlantic.</p>\n<p>This video game is based on the board game created by Designer Etienne Michot, and was created with the permission of the game designer.
