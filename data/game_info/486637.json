Play as a khajiit that has the ability to rewind time and cast night vision spells as she explores a mysterious ruin that changes its rooms with each entry. Replaying the game could give you a different experience than the first time!\r\n<p>Are you a fan of Prequel?\u00a0 Do you wish Katia could rewind time and kick butt with a sword? Do you love chill grooves and tasty beats?<br/></p>\n<p><strong>GAME FEATURES:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>-REWIND TIME ABILITY</strong></p>\n<p><strong>-RANDOM LEVELS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0-ROUGH AND TUMBLE SWORD ACTION</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>-CUTE TALKING ANIMAL</strong></p>\n<p><strong>-NIGHT VISION SPELL</strong></p>\n<p>I was experimenting with a rewinding mechanic and random level generators and decided to turn it into a Katia Managan video game!</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>KNOWN BUGS:</strong></p>\n<p>- In the pause menu, when selecting \"Resume\", Katia will go into 'climbing' animation. This is fixed by moving, jumping, or attacking. Trigger any other animation and it will fix itself. Not an issue.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T07:52:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5bc/5bc36b23e30bf0fa8e02ba033b4aa33a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nilesmac"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
