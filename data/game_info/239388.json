Now go to the kitchen and start preparing. <br/><br/><br/>When I was in college, I went through a phase where I ate vegan chocolate ice cream every day an entire pint of it. I know\u2026 not super healthy. But I was on a quest to gain weight. College was a time when I was supposed to feel like an adult, and instead I felt incredibly insecure in my child-like body. Plus, it\u2019s not like the vegan chocolate ice cream diet wasn\u2019t a lot of fun. It definitely was!!!<br/>You melt some condensed milk and a tiny amount of white chocolate chips in the microwave, and let it cool. Then you whip up some heavy cream in your mixer. Back to the melted chocolate chips: stir in some sour cream and some vanilla. Then you fold the whole thing together, freeze it for at least 6 hours, and then add some of your favorite chocolate sauce to the top of it.even non-vegans, who love regular ice cream and have Ben&amp;Jerry\u2019s and Haagen Dazs in their freezers, routinely ask for seconds of this creamy homemade chocolate ice cream!<br/><br/>Since the recipe doesn\u2019t call for eggs, you get to skip the step of heating things up on the stove, making this ice cream ridiculously easy to prepare. It can be eaten plain OR used as a blank canvas for all sorts of delicious new ice cream flavors. Add shredded coconut and pecans for German Chocolate Ice Cream, or stir in mini marshmallows and make Rocky Road Ice Cream, or add caramel, or peanut butter, or peppermint, or cookie dough.If this were my dream flavor, I\u2019d stir in my favorite Chocolate Peanut Butter Brownies, hot from the oven, for the ultimate vegan chocolate ice cream brownie sundae. Then I\u2019d cover everything with chocolate syrup.<br/><br/>Whisk all ingredients (except optional chocolate chips) in a dish. *Ice Cream Maker Version: transfer to your ice cream maker and watch the magic! (It took about 12-14 minutes in my Cuisinart. Make sure your ice cream maker\u2019s base is completely frozen before use, or it will NOT work!) Stir in chips. You can eat it straight from the machine, or freeze a few hours for firmer texture. Homemade ice cream is best the day it\u2019s made, but you can technically thaw it out and it will keep for a few weeks. *Food Processor/Vitamix Version: Pour your whisked mixture into ice cube trays and freeze. The next day, thaw just enough so your machine can blend the frozen mixture. Then process, scraping down or tampering as needed. *No Machine Version: If you don\u2019t you don\u2019t have any machine, you can still make a less-creamy (but still delicious) ice milk. Transfer the whisked mixture to a shallow container and freeze. Stir every half hour until you achieve a frozen ice milk texture.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:15:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bee/beee6e3f605da99829efb976fd0a4a32.jpg", "website": "http://graux-emilie.website/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["graux emilie"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Family"], "publishers": ["graux emilie"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
