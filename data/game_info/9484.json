Also we have some strange problems in our electrical system at nights, but we're sure you'll manage to fix them.<br/>\r\nDon't forget, if there's something broken by 6:00 am you will be fired!<br/>\r\nSo don't miss a chance to get a huge payment for your job.<br/>\r\nYes... And about our dear guests. Just try not to get in their way.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBear Haven is a great indie horror game where you have to survive scary nights.<br/>\r\nPlease note that it is not yet another \"five nights at freddy's\" clone. <br/>\r\nYou don't have just to watch at cameras as a night security guard, but you can freely walk around and interact with the environment.<br/>\r\nParticipate in atmospheric and intriguing nightmare adventure.<br/>\r\nFix broken electricity and hide from angry bears so they couldn't catch you.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRun if something goes wrong. Then close the door and turn of the light. The phone shouldn't ring and TV shouldn't work while you are hiding. Then you can survive the first scary night!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:14:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8a/a8a02a63378ea57ae6988a76bcc8114c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 51}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 7, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["SunRay Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SunRay Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
