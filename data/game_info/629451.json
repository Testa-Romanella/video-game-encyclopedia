Each time you are petrified, you respawn and attempt to kill Medusa again. You can use your petrified statues to your advantage, but the aim is to kill Medusa in the fewest deaths and turns.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Tutorial<br/></strong>Use the mouse to find a place to move (green box) and left click when you are happy. The size of the green box shows how many moves you have left in that turn. When you have finished moving, click next turn and Medusa will make her turn. To kill Medusa you will need both the sword and the shield. Once you have both, you can attack with space bar. <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>3rd party assets</strong><br/>Music: https://www.bensound.com<br/>Font: https://www.kenney.nl/assets/kenney-fonts</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T12:40:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c4/1c4e4c69c198717cc4f34e707d478ea7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Pangeo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
