As part of trying to understand this we've created this toy car designer which you can play with!</p>\n<br/>\r\nDesign the triangular 2D car of your dreams!\r\n<p>Your job is to design a simple car to solve one of several terrifying challenges. Do you dare test your design against the\u00a0road bumps or face the\u00a0dreaded ski jump!!</p>\n<br/>\r\nWork with the computer and each other\r\n<p>You're not on your own, at the same time as you're designing your car so is the computer. Will the computer help or hinder your progress?\u00a0 If you play on the downloadable version of the game you'll also be able to share your designs with friends and the community!</p>\n\r\nHelp with real scientific research\r\n<p>If you opt in to sharing your data then just playing this game will provide us with a better understanding of how humans work with computers. Using this we can design better tools for engineers and designers.</p>\r\nGet Involved!\r\n<p>We want to know everything you think about this tool so use the forum below to tell us what you think, work with each other to really dig in to what's going on. All your feedback and discussion\u00a0is helpful for our research!</p>\r\nWho are we?\r\n<p>We are a team of scientists from Swansea University and Lancaster University Leipzig interested in how humans and computers can work together on creative tasks. You can read our last paper here where we investigated how these sorts of tools can help level designers. If you have any questions about the research either ask in the forum below or email me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T10:09:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ee/3eeb7bb18f3e47ffe2688f1f16e66e0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Pill Bug Interactive"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
