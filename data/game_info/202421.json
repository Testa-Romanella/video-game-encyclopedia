After you are prepared, press play to start the enemies waves.</p>\n\n<p>I made this game a few years ago when I was an exchange student at\u00a0WPIwith a collegue,\u00a0Tim Calvert, for a Game Design class hosted by\u00a0Brian Moriarty. It uses an javascript engine called Perlenspiel that is basically a grid that you can change colors and handle clicks/mouse/keyboard events.</p>\n<p>Just download and then execute the cover.html (or game.html) to play the game!\r\n</p>\n<p>Commands: Mouse to interact with the shop and palce towers</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/378/378eafb9b4adc1e6a626e888f60f936c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fahrenheit"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
