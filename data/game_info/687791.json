They can also use the right button or hold down the right button in order to erase objects they\u2019ve drawn (Feature 2). They can use the RGB sliders to change the colors of the objects and preview the color they selected in the color preview box at the left bottom side of the canvas (Feature 1). To make it easier to select basic colors, there is also a color dropdown menu included with specific colors the user can select to paint with (Feature 3). There is an automatic destroy toggle that allows the user to have their creations erase themselves after 3 seconds or they can turn off the toggle to keep the objects (Feature 4). Lastly, there is a clear all button that lets the user erase everything on the canvas and start anew (Feature 5).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T06:31:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ac/8acebd6e433a3b5f931d5865832293d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nes22"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
