{"id": 967193, "slug": "velocity-valley", "name": "Velocity Valley", "name_original": "Velocity Valley", "description": "Velocity Valley allows up to 8 players to compete against each other. The objective is to achieve the fastest lap time within a 7-minute race while managing tire wear by changing between soft, medium, and hard tires at the pit lane. Soft tires provide better grip but wear out faster, medium tires offer a balance between grip and wear, while hard tires last longer but provide less grip. Completing 8 laps in a race earns players a coin bonus which can be used to unlock new tracks. However, staying off the grass and avoiding crashes is important, as any violations such as going on the grass, crashing, or two cars in the pitlane may result in a 3-second penalty.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe controls for Velocity Valley are as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nW: Acceleration<br/>\r\nA and D: Turn left and right<br/>\r\nS: Reverse/Brake<br/>\r\nSpace: Handbrake<br/>\r\nEscape: Pause Menu<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGame Credits:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDeveloper, Designer, Visuals - AJ<br/>\r\nTrack Designer - J\u00e9r\u00e9mie, AJ<br/>\r\nSound/Audio - KrossKancel<br/>\r\nAnimator - Taylor/Tayloer", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-02T04:49:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48f/48f51926ee679dff265ab7917d8fec43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AJ"], "genres": ["Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["AJ"], "esrb_rating": null}
