After each wave, you may unlock new skills with EXP and buy items with Gold.</p>\n<p>This is a project I made over the course of December through a friend's \"Game Devember\" challenge. I had to create a game starting December 1st, implement\u00a01 feature every day, and release the game on January 1st.</p>\n<p>It was a very fun project to take part in!\u00a0It of course had its series of bumps, so while the game isn't perfect, I\u00a0am proud of the outcome!</p>\n<p>SFX and Enemy models/animations are from the Unreal Asset Store. All other models and music are made by me.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy!!</p>\n<p><em>(Any feedback on the game is greatly appreciated!)</em><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>I will soon post a postmortem of my process here for those to read if interested.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T05:27:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69f/69fec69bdd1b885140b431026380d25a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BrandoStamo"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
