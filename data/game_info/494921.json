{"id": 494921, "slug": "pocket-rocks", "name": "Pocket Rocks", "name_original": "Pocket Rocks", "description": "<p>Pocket rocks is a Pokemon based sandbox game. There is no end goal but you can go around the world collecting and levelling up your Rocks. You can find shiny rocks too!!! They have a 0.2% chance of appearing instead of the original version of a rock when a encounter happens. You can change your rock you are using at any time via either the in battle rocks menu or the bag in the overworld. You have items in your bag for combat. The lower down the list they are the better they are. Your Pocket Rocks will evolve at different levels depending upon what rock they are (There are 20 rocks in the game so far)</p>\n\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>WASD to move around in the overworld</p>\n<p>Return/Enter to interact with menus</p>\n<p>Arrow keys to move in menus</p>\n<p>Pressing L does nothing...
