There is no win condition and it is not an attempt to idle. Made with unity. Windows executable. I didnt make anything for linux or mac but if you insist i may try. If you quit on the first screen before entering a name it will create a corrupted file (it will attempt to write an object to file before creating it) so i advice avoiding doing that. If you did that simply delete that file and start over.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T10:54:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e2/3e2d33381060654919d95d08fcdc01e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xhite"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
