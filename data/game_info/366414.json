Taking mechanical inspiration from contemporary RPG games, Mennui was Orokana's attempt at a platformer arcade game that could appeal to RPG fans. The source code, thought to be lost after the studio folded in 2004, was only discovered recently by former lead programmer\u00a0Goto Takuya in an old thumb drive, which was then sent to us for restoration.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-19T04:28:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d6/1d6ea6c8ccf1b1de5c96c098415d82c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["crass_sandwich"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
