Evil ninjas have taken over the country. They have banned all kinds of leisure and\u00a0have forced the Japanese to work 24 hours a day. All Japanese artist are in danger. Video Games companys are replaced by pachinko factories...\u00a0Sounds like a joke, right? ^ ^\u00b4\u00b4\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gaijin Heroes is a beat\u00b4m up project made by a otaku to otakus. I want to tell you the story of Alex (Spain), Michael (Usa) and Khristeen (Russia) (Gaijin =\u00a0forengeiner).\u00a0The plot of many beat 'em up is suggested or left to the imagination of the player. However, in this game I would like to tell a funny story through dialogues and geeky situations, as if the game were a Jrpg. Our heroes do not know each other, they are not the strongest or the most \"normal\" in the eyes of some people, but this is their game; A tribute to those otakus who dreamed of traveling to Japan or meet their favorite mangaka.<br/></p>\n<p>Read\u00a0here the full story of the game</p>\n<p>This solo-dev game project and failed on kickstarted, so... Well, i put the idea here to obtain some love for the game, if\u00a0 people like the idea here, i will try to make a indiegogo campaing or something similar to make the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you very much for your support!
