My name is Bas Tempelman and I\u2019m excited to introduce you to my hobby project, The Bugger! For the past two years, I\u2019ve been developing this game in my spare time while working full time in a different profession. The idea for The Bugger! came to me during the Covid pandemic and, although I wasn\u2019t sure where it would lead or how long it would take to complete, I\u2019m thrilled to finally share it with you. I hope you have as much fun playing it as I had creating it!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-04T03:15:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6b/c6bcb785b243e674e87fe6734e7ff8c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 242, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["SpectraCoder"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Casual"], "publishers": ["SpectraCoder"], "esrb_rating": null}
