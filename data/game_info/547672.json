The demo includes 3 areas to explore, 5 player upgrades, a nice variety of enemies, and a monstrous boss battle.<br/></p>\n<p>This is my first solo game so if you have any comments or suggestions please leave a comment and I'll do my best to reply.</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n<p>Demo Version 1.0.1 Update</p>\n<p>- Modified the Energy Blade. It now should have better hit radius as well as require 1 Energy to use.</p>\n<p>- Now if you run out of Energy while using an upgraded beam you will auto\u00a0 switch back to the basic blaster.</p>\n<p>- Made a minor change to an enemy sprite.</p>\n<p>- Fixed an issue with an enemy \"spazzing out\".</p>\n<p>- Fixed a section of the bosses map that was causing unintended situations.</p>\n<p>- Fixed the map display. It no longer shows rooms that haven't been discovered.<br/></p>\n<p>- Some other minor things I can't remember.</p>\n\n\n<p>This is an older video of gameplay but it should give a decent idea of what to expect in Pentacore.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T09:31:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f5/1f5eb223f9acf839b87382a614cbb107.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 276, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mythril Age"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
