Every so often, there will be a boss. If this game gets support in the first few days of the alpha release, I'll keep improving it more and more. If it gets past the alpha stage I'll add a story mode and more.</p>\n<p>For now there are only 3 levels available, level 1, 2 and 3, which is a boss. ALL THE MUSIC IN THE GAME DOES NOT BELONG TO ME, I say again, if the game reaches a good quality, I will contact Locknar (the creator of the music).</p>\n\n<p>unknown</p><p>Some \"Bugs\":</p><ul><li>When you click on \"retry\" the Button doesnt retry, this is not a bug, just isn't implemented</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T10:58:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/001/001cd6391f4db104f413dff3e25ae2b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Adryh"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
