So, that is what I tried to replicate (in my own style). The map is mostly unviewable except for the exit at the end of each level. With trial and error, you'll have to find the right path out.</p>\n<p>Music: Pixabay</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T08:30:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40a/40a6322c145071ac88a73eaefe146e71.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pasta"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
