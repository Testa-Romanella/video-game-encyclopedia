Two missions, five years apart, turn out to be connected by one man. In this frenetic and bloody third-person shooter that unleashed the iconic red-headed femme fatale on the world, the dhampir Rayne faces horrific creatures, hordes of soldiers with an array of tools and firepower, and every Nazi officer that stands between her and the one she must stop.<br/>\n<br/>\nBloodRayne 2: Terminal Cut:<br/>\nBloodRayne is a dhampir, born from the unnatural union of vampire and human. Blessed with the powers of a vampire but cursed with the unquenchable thirst for blood and a weakness to sunlight, Rayne is challenged with her most personal battle yet as she hunts down her siblings. With new acrobatic movements and rail sliding, fast-paced blade and gun combat, fatal finishing moves, more dhampir powers like time control, and an extensive combo system, BloodRayne 2 is a brutally satisfying continuation of the iconic series.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T02:06:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1c/b1ca67f510e5b06ccd56b369a8142a22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 310, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Terminal Reality"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Ziggurat Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
