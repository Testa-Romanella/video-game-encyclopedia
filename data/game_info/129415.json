Can you keep up?</p><p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p><p>Best played on a multi-touch touchscreen, but if you want to play with a mouse that works too. You can even multi-task with the keyboard: Space to gaze and left and right arrow keys or A and D to switch lanes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d0/9d06afc066f01b2aa966a3d96a92b94d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stephen Borden"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
