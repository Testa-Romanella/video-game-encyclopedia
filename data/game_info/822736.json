Join Cerosse in the Border Mansion where it's kill or be killed! When one of the competitors is murdered in a manner most brutal, will he be able to find out who killed them? Or will the crime be pinned on him instead?</p>\n<p>Like before, here's some general warning and instructions for the visual novel:\r\n</p>\n<p>-NEW: Scene selection! I intend to add this feature to my previous rounds as well, but you can now enter scene selection from the title screen. Useful if you missed a panel and want to start over or are trying to skip to a specific point in the round.</p>\n<p>-The game might take a while to load on it's first run. If nothing is happening once you start the game and start clicking, just give it a minute or so to finish loading.\u00a0Press the left mouse button to progress the story and speed up text. Note that there is, due to the limitations of the program used to create this, NO back button, so be careful!\u00a0 You can save and load the file, however.\u00a0 Furthermore, you can press the space bar to hide the text box and see the art behind it properly. Press space again to bring it back. If the game is bigger than your screen dimensions, either zoom out your screen, or there is a \"full screen\" button to the bottom right.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>-This round has a plenty of swearing, violence, discussion of suicidal thoughts,\u00a0and upsetting scenarios. Not for kids!\r\n</p>\n<p>-All characters that aren't mine are used with permission.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>-Normally I credit everyone but there are a LOT of characters in this round. My opponent, James Kennedy belongs to Tapper ( @Tapperdraw on twitter.) Please check out his work and round! In addition, check out the main Excalibur Experiment twitter @ExcaliburOCT to learn more about the other characters featured in this round and their creators. They all deserve the attention, believe me!</p>\n<p>-Total Number of Images: 388</p>\n<p>-Bonus Challenges included: Hide The Bup Cube, Socialize With The Culprit, Socialize With a Competitor Unrelated To The Murder</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T18:14:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f12/f122744018c8b304745c5ad98c6a78cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fallingfeather"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
