Your goal is stop them by building tower that shoot them, or have other effects that lead directly or indirectly to their deaths.</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>To place a tower you can either:</p>\n<ul><li>Drag it from the menu to a position you want it.</li><li>Click on it in the menu, then click the build button, then click where you want it.</li><li>Double click its icon to place multiple tower without having to go back to the menu.</li><li>Hold its hot-key (visible when you click on its icon) and then click where you want it.</li></ul>\n<p>To upgrade a tower click on it, then in the menu to the right select any light green hexagon to see a description and cost, buy it via the button or with double click.</p>\n<p>Use the buttons in the bottom right corner to start the game, increase the speed, or automatically start waves.</p>\n\r\nOther info:\r\n<p>You earn xp by beating enemies, this goes to both your player level, as well as tower levels.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When towers level-up you can unlock more upgrades for purchase.</p>\n<p>All xp earned by towers is divided over all current towers, for example: You have 2 Archers and 1 Kobold, when you kill a hero worth 30xp, the Archer tower earns 20, and the Kobold 10.</p>\n<p>A tower can have at most 8 upgrades purchased. Try to find the best combination!</p>\n<p>Unlocked tower abilities can be used by double clicking the tower.</p>\n<p>All tower, map, and difficulty unlocks are permanent.</p>\n\n<p>The downloadable version of the game works, but I can not 100% guarantee its save data at the moment. I'm working on it.</p>\n<p>Save data for the web should be fine as long as you don't clear cookies etc. I'm working on an alternative there as well.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T17:40:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25c/25cc4791c51a840935967e1d993eb6e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Catagami"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
