You have no hands, but you are sweet and juicy, and you never give up. You have traveled far to reach this hidden temple. Find the Golden Watermelon in this surreal 3D platformer.</em><br/></p>\n<p>Made in 72 hours for the GDQ One Mechanic Game Jam 4. Game jam themes: Food, Gravity, &amp; Loot. I'm not sure if this is just one mechanic, but you're mainly pushing things (in addition to standard walking/jumping of 3D platformers).</p><p>I interpreted the \"Food\" theme as a world made entirely of watermelons. \"Gravity\" is your main enemy as you can easily fall, and must figure out how to overcome gravity.  \"Loot\" is the goal of the game as you're trying to get to the treasure - the Golden Watermelon.</p><p><strong>Playtime:</strong> 3 to 6 minutes depending on how you are with 3D platformers and physics puzzles.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Instructions: </strong>Wander through the temple, solving the challenges, to find the Golden Watermelon.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong></p>\n<strong>Action</strong><strong>Controls</strong>WalkArrow Keys or WASD Keys<br/>JumpSpacebar.
