It is about a character named Pammie who gets sent to a dimension of food to rescue her friends.</p>\n<p>The game is very early, so there are only 3 levels and the game also plays like an old arcade game.</p>\n<p>Use left and right to move, space to jump, Z to shoot, and use the up and down keys to direct the fireball you shoot.</p>\n<p>the way to finish the game is to collect all the pastries in each level while avoiding dying. Enemies drop extra pastries to collect, so you can improve your score.</p>\n<p>Also,\u00a0 use T to restart the game, Y to close the game, and L to skip a level. These are debug features I'm leaving in for now.</p>\n<p>Try to get the highest score, although it is kind of luck dependent since some pastries will randomly have higher points to give.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T14:14:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/530/5302b19ddddaf76cd209be51a73f5d03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aston Quintanilla"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
