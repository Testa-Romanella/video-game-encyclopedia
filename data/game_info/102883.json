It follows the development of an elemental firewall. A creature of magical fire bound by C++ code.</p><p>In this game you can:</p><ul><li>Search for malicious spirits</li><li>Protect your network</li><li>Make friends</li><li>Burn everything</li><li>Learn</li><li>Dream</li><li>Become sapient</li></ul><p>There are 90,000 words of text, five animated sequences, eighteen achievements to pursue, and eight possible endings.</p>Statement<p>I created Open Sorcery because I fell in love with the Twine engine and see it as an amazing tool for creating stories. Words sitting static on a page can move people to tears. When I can weave color and pictures and sound into my words, well it's almost cheating.</p><p>Open Sorcery particularly is an exercise in how rapidly a player can develop emotional relationships to characters. I made the main character a firewall to accelerate attachment to the other characters--from the start your purpose in the game is to protect them.</p><p>The firewall's constant monitoring also gives the player a view into the characters' private lives and a litany of personal moments and snippets of dialog help to flesh out the cast.</p><p>The game is concluded with a massive threat to the population that will starkly illuminate any feelings of investment. It is meant to be an emotional experience.</p>Team<p>Game by Abigail Corfman</p><p>Photography by Becky Strauss</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff1/ff103904362340e32f64b51481395aa3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OpenSorceryGames"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
