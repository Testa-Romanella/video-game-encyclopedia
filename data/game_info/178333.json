Whenever you move or shoot, time slows down so that execute your moves flawlessly.</p>\n<p>Currently this project is in a \"proof of concept\" stage.\u00a0 There's only one playable level which I made to test out the controls. The game has been built from the ground up as a android game but there's also a windows version with mouse controls. The windows version isn't perfect but it'll have to do until I implement gamepad support.</p>\n<p>I'd love it if you try it out. There aren't many good Twin stick shooter games on android so I really want this to succeed. You can help me out by playing the game and giving me your feedback through this link:</p>\n<p>https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScySzFiJFqu4xPZZyy3Xe6yasbcWvrjugXSC9Z_...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/241/2412d1ef3cb0a7c3175f55c0da725047.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Czerkas"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
