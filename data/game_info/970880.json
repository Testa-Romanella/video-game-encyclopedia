Please expect \"Cyber Driver VR\" to be a small, cyber-style arcade flight game. It's fast, easy, tight, and repeatable. Your only goal in the game is to constantly break the scores you have created before in the unique cyber atmosphere. I am very grateful for the feedback and bug report.<br/><br/>Thank you for taking a moment to read this, I really hope you enjoy this game.<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li>The taxi will always drive forward automatically, and the player controls the taxi to shuttle through the full 3D cyber city to pick up and drop off passengers.<br/></li><li>Collect as much as possible of soda water, holographic billboards and other reward items, while preventing cars from colliding with buildings.</li></ul><br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Immersive 3D sound.<br/></li><li>An VR arcade-style casual game full of cyberpunk atmosphere.<br/></li><li>Easy to learn and smooth game control experience.<br/></li><li>The rhythm of the game is fast, and the constant challenge of past scores in the cyber world is addictive.<br/></li><li>Endless play mode, only you can stop yourself from playing.<br/></li><li>Steam achievements, leaderboard support!<br/></li><li>Steam cloud support.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T22:53:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9fe/9fedbc1a75b56296b16494cf7768ee34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Meng Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Sports", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Meng Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
