You play as \"Passenger 2\", who is trying to find the way out.\u00a0<br/><br/>The game is 10 minutes long, depending on how fast you react to the environment and find the tapes. This is linear experience and mostly focuses on atmosphere and story. The current idea for the game is loosely based on a short horror film \"Unidentified\", which you can check out on YouTube.\u00a0<br/>Link to the film:\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Thanks a lot for showing support and downloading my game. I am looking forward to see your feedback and criticisms, if any, please leave comments down below and don't forget to enjoy the flight.
