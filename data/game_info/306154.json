His feet never leave the floor, and he\u2019s happiest collecting any old junk he can lay his hands on, in the hopes of combining it all together to solve a satisfying puzzle. His cohort and sidekick DAN has decided there\u2019s no money to be made in Adventure Games any more, so he\u2019s going to be an indie darling platformer instead.<br/><br/>LAIR OF THE CLOCKWORK GOD sees you switching between both characters and using their unique abilities together in a race-against-time effort to stop all the Apocalypses happening simultaneously by teaching an old computer about feelings.<br/><br/>LAIR OF THE CLOCKWORK GOD is a new, standalone adventure starring Dan and Ben, heroes of hit point-and-click games \u201cBen There, Dan That!\u201d and \u201cTime Gentlemen, Please!\u201d, which are somehow already definitely in your Steam library, even if you can\u2019t quite remember how?
