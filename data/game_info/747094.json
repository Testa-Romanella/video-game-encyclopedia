You always thought you saw something out of the corner of your eye, but told yourself it wasn\u2019t real. Your illusion may be shattered, but that doesn\u2019t mean that your guests should learn about these sociable specters!\r\n\r\n\r\nAs more and more guests check-in be sure to keep these ghosts in check by night! You may find that some of your guests are nosier than others and if they come across a ghoul while roaming the hall it could be all over for the Totally Normal Inn! Collect ectoplasm to earn-power ups and protect the haunted furniture before the secret gets out. And remember, if anyone asks about the spirits at the Inn, it\u2019s not real!<br/><br/><br/>---------------------<br/><br/>Jason Rand - Programmer, Designer, UX\r\nDanzMacabre - Music, Sound Design, SFX, \"The Husband\"\r\nCatherine Rand - Art\u00a0\r\nTony Corbitt Jr.- Art\r\nJillian Wagner - SFX, Vocals, \"Vixen\", \"Grandma\"\u00a0\r\nWillis Reifsnyder - SFX, Vocals, \"The Writer\"\u00a0\r\nFaith Reifsnyder - Vocals, \"The Wife\"", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T10:02:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/521/5219f92a91d0b7be893df6c8d73d4a5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jasontherand", "jynki", "dwiweam", "DanzMacabre", "Tonytherookie"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
