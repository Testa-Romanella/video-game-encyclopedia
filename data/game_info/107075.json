We are planning for four episodes with a new exciting gameplay feature added to each one, such as the ability to organize police tailing or raids, new exciting detective characters, and an exploration system. We have plenty of ideas we want to try out and show you! But we won't forget to work on the basics of a visual novel between each episode. As our team becomes more experienced, we are looking forward to adding more animations and sound or graphical effects to upgrade the player experience.
