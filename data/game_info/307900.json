You're at home with some friends, and as always, did not buy enough beer to last the night.</p>\n<p>You rush to the shop to restock, and arrive one minute before 10pm. Hurry up and load up on the booze your friends ask for before the clock strikes ten, forcing you into a packed pub for the rest of the night.<br/></p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>Credit for the concept goes to Jennifer Abe and Clara Kumagai.
