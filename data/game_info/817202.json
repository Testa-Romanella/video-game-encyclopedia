It does not matter if you die, the little ghost is quite sturdy!</p>\n\r\nHow to play\r\nControls\r\n<p>You can move by using the WASD keys.</p>\n<p>You can resume enemies by one step\u00a0with the left Shift key or by pressing the next-button (they also move if you move). <br/></p>\n<p>You can restart the level if you are stuck with the R key or by pressing the restart button on the screen.</p>\r\nMechanics\r\n<p>You\u00a0 will always respawn at the red flag. The position of the red flag can be changed through using an in-game big red button.\u00a0 Later you will also be able to pickup and place a checkpoint yourself!</p>\n<p>Furthermore you can collect keys that can unlock locks, and enemies will push you around.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Music from\u00a0Komiku - Level 4: First infiltration in Unresponsible Tech</p>\n<p>SFX from\u00a0pixabay</p>\n<p>Font: Bulky Pixels</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to my friend JustSis for playtesting!</p>\n<p>Thanks to the Mini Jam team for hosting the game jam!\u00a0Made all the pixelart myself and although it isn't perfect, its pretty good for a first project.
