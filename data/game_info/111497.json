Hence free.<br/><br/>You can also contact me per email using that one from my homepage:<br/><strong>http://www.spacefractal.com</strong><br/><br/>The game is for Windows only (but later will do a Mac version as well).<br/></p>\r\nV1<strong>Please Note:</strong><br/>V1.1 is the <strong>LowRes Jam</strong> version, which is why im keep it and allways will do.<p>V1.2 is a <strong>updated version</strong>. Here  you have 5 lives instead of 3, and you can start from any screen from 1-25. You would do still need to complete the 25 screens, before you can try the night version of the screens (which is harder).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f0/8f0925f400d3d2b58c723693303d2d4f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Space Fractal"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
