Time to fight back with GHOST MAGIC!<br/></p><p>The game plays like an arcade-style twin-stick shooter.</p><p>You have a health score at the top of the screen - shoot the drones to steal your music back, and try to survive for as long as you can!</p><p>You have 3 bombs - bombs unleash a bunch of missiles at the robots, although they behave erratically. You can get more bombs by scoring tons of points!</p><p>This game is playable both with a keyboard and with any XInput-compatible controller. No Mac or Linux builds, I made this in a very short time!</p><p><em>CREDITS</em></p><p><em>-------</em></p><p><em>Uses the Otter2D C# Framework by Kyle Pulver.</em></p><p><em>Music:</em></p><p><em>Goodbye Summer, Hello Winter by FantomenK</em></p><p><em>Font: </em></p><p><em>KenPixel Blocks</em></p><p><em>All other assets are my own.</em></p><p><em>This game is being released for free, with no commercial profit to be made.
