Myself and four other students designed and built this game from the ground up. We were given the constraint that it had to be made in to fit into a pre-existing franchise that we weren't allowed to choose:\u00a0<em>The Dresden Files</em>.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nFor this project, I\u00a0developed an\u00a0extensive and easy to use dialogue system\u00a0alongside various smaller quality of life and graphical features in C#. I also designed\u00a0characters, UI, and other miscellaneous art assets in Clip Studio Paint and Aseprite.</p>\n<p><em>Made by: Alessandro Fiorella, Liliana Klein, Carson Lampila.
