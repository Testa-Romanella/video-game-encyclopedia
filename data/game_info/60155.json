Imagine that there are many zombies around you, but this time, you do not have a usual shotgun, a katana or at least a chainsaw. However, you have different grenades: frag, contact, bouncing (our favorite), radio, UV grenades, and others. <br/><br/>The fewer grenades you use for completing the level, the more points you score. <br/><br/>A rational choice of grenades and a precise throw are the key to solving tactical tasks on fifteen levels of the most beautiful post-apocalyptic fray you\u2019ve ever seen.Key Features<ul><li>Single-player adventure mode</li></ul><ul><li>High-quality graphics</li></ul><ul><li>A high level of immersion</li></ul><ul><li>Stats and achievements are available</li></ul><ul><li>Game is easy to play but hard to master</li></ul><ul><li>Requires different tactics to complete each level</li></ul><ul><li>Great variety of locations, each location has own features and goals</li></ul><ul><li>Wide choice of grenade types with different mechanics</li></ul><ul><li>A realistic handling of weapons: with the help of motion controllers in virtual reality, use different types of grenades, performing realistic movements</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b16/b16120069f0376c759f337e98c6fa1cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 567, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ARVI"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["AGA Ad Media LLP"], "esrb_rating": null}
