Self-driving cars!</p><p>Gameplay (skip to 1:16)</p><p>Created in 12 hours for #TrafikJam, the winning entry \r\n\tError-Prone is cute little game of chaos and carnage made for 26 people to play around one keyboard. The end result illustrates perfectly how self driving cars are vastly superior to their human counterparts in terms of traffic grid lock, efficiency and avoiding road accidents.<br/></p><p>\r\n\tThe game itself is very simple, 26 cars autonomous cars driving around in a neat little circle. When you press a letter on the keyboard you assume control and almost immediately you will see the effects your erratic human driving causing grid lock or even accidents. The more people play (up to 26, if you can fit and have a good enough keyboard) the more chaos ensues.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe only way to win is to not play at all.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tTrafikJam is collaboration between \r\n\tStugan (an indie games accelerator set in the Swedish country side) and Trafikverket (the Swedish Transport Administration) to imagine the future of transport.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tCredits:\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tCode - Peter Cardwell-Gardner \r\n\t@TheFuntastic<br/>\r\n\tArt &amp; Sound - Mark Backler \r\n\t@MarkBackler\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIf you like this please consider checking out Cadence (The musical playground, out on Steam Early Access this September) or The Last Word<br/><br/>\n</p><p>Sound sample attribution:<br/>Big Crash - Northern_Monkey<br/>1004_crash - FatLane<br/>Car Crash - squareal<br/>Cuckoo &amp; Nightingale Duet - Vonora<br/>Car Horn - bsumusictech<br/>Car Horn - BeatsbyCasper<br/>Car Horn - keweldog</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82d/82dfb9fc5fa2d933ad7fbebc2058d0f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["MadeWithMonsterLove"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
