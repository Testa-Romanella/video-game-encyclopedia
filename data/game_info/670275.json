Although it was not your fault, you have always felt indebted to Ana, his fianc\u00e9e. Today you received a letter requesting you to go to the hospital where they will explain to you the truth about what happened. The letter is signed by your dead brother.<br/>_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br/></p>\n<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>This is my first game made with www.Tell4Play.com, a new technology to create interactive stories. I invite you to take a look at it because I was surprised. It is quite different from the usual.<br/><br/>\"Dark Hospital\" is inspired by the atmosphere of \"Silent hill\" (the story, the characters, the music, the rooms...). It is a game that lasts about 4-5 hours, and you can reach two different endings. If you want to save your progress, that it's highly recommended, just log in with your Google account in the next screen.<br/><br/>You can read it in English, Spanish and Catalan. Up to you.<br/><br/>By the way, the game starts to get fascinating when you get to the second floor. You can see the clues and prizes in the settings option. :)<br/><br/>I would like to say that I really enjoyed doing this game, and I have in mind a sequel, but first, I need to know if people like \"Dark Hospital\" or not.<br/><br/>Hope you so.<br/>Thank you all<br/><br/>AK Sun<br/><br/>(Feel free to write a comment, I will really appreciate it because I need some feedback, but please, don't be too cruel to me, it is made with a lot of illusion, but I know I am not a good writer, specially in English).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T06:30:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/710/710e721ef641d2ffc62966408405e89d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 256, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AK Sun"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
