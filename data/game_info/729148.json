This is my make-up horror game since I didn't do one for October. :D</p>\n<p>I used this project as a test/learning for different kinds of tools that I\u00a0hadn't really used too much before in Unity.</p><p>A few things I would have liked to improve/fix; the UI like usual, not my best skill. Some animations were kinda unfinished and I want\u00a0to add a few more. Would liked to have added some cool interactable stuff in the map, it's kinda empty as is.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T11:06:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5a/d5a6f16ae915a7fb1439afbd8699a634.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hambonair"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
