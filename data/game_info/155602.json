Many times, when grieving, we tend to try and muscle our way through the day. The problem is, it can feel like we're in a never-ending climb to reach some sort of end point that doesn't actually exist. This game illustrates how we can keep trying forever, but in the end, we'll just end up exhausted. the only thing we can do is let our grief wash over us and deal with it.</p>\n<p><em>This game will soon be updated with endless climbing. My original vision for the game was to have levels, but the message is stronger when the player can climb endlessly.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2c/d2cff26f1b294fe72fbc2eb63bcaa2a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["calebmassey1"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
