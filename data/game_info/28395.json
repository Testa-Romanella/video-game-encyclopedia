The developers took the bad ending of the first part as a continuation when Artyom destroyed the entire Moscow population of the Dark Ones. However, during the bombing, one of the representatives of the suddenly extinct species hid somewhere under a bush and safely survived the misfortune. The order learned about &quot;The lucky one&quot;, and Artyom receives a task to find and destroy the sole survivor.</p>\n<p>You will get access to entirely new locations in the Moscow&#39;s metro, on the surface of the destroyed Moscow and walk through the newly added stations and familiarise themselves with the lives of people who are trying to live after the Apocalypse. At your disposal will also be the latest Arsenal of weapons, because you will have to shoot a lot to save your life. During the game, your actions can lead to one of the two endings, one of which, as in the case of Metro 2033, is false.</p>", "metacritic": 81, "released": "2013-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T14:25:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/b1f/b1f1eeee149ef49c008a2258ee6c0d78.jpg", "website": "http://www.enterthemetro.com/", "rating": 4.13, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 195, "owned": 2684, "beaten": 1091, "toplay": 92, "dropped": 127, "playing": 18}, "playtime": 8, "achievements_count": 200, "ratings_count": 1018, "suggestions_count": 665, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 1023, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["4A Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Deep Silver"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
