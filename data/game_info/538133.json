All of the games have been released separately by each individual dev, but are also collected here for posterity. In this way, there\u2019s nothing being \u201cleveraged\u201d toward some worthless idea of a \u201cvextro brand,\u201d yet everyone is going along with (leeroy's) gimmicky long con idea to try to make our work a footnote in games history.</p>\n<p>As Vextro has something of a light steady following, we decided it would be fun to pivot the games we\u2019ve all made as also being part of the critical project of Vextro, because they\u2019re rad and radical, and put stuff we say into practice, and they\u2019re made better because of each other. Game making and writing about games is an entwined process.</p>\n<p>Every year bet on creative work from Vextro! We believe in creative game making!</p>\n\n<p>All of these games have been released separately, however, there are extra materials (okay just pieces of writing) that can only be found in this mega download.
