The pay is good- and so are the acommadations- you'd be a fool to give up an offer like this. It almost seems too good to be true!</p>\n<p>Maybe it was.</p>\n<p>Cold Cuts is an interactive, story-based horror/mystery game made with Twine! You play as a chef who has recently been hired to work in a huge, ancient mansion, owned by a rich family that never seems free from rumours. Upon your arrival however, you quickly realize that maybe the rumours were true, as you discover the corpse of one of their workers in the walk-in freezer. You can make choices on who to talk to, when to preform certain actions, while trying to unravel the mystery behind the family and the corpse in their freezer. The story will swap between trying to do your job the best you can through a series of memory games, and trying to not raise suspision while searching for a way out of your contract. You can also choose to ignore everything that goes on, of you like!</p>\n<p>Quick note- not all backgrounds are intirely finished, notibly the kitchen being a paintover of a minecraft creation. This will be changed in the future</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T20:41:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/caf/caf43a9f8b92498e1409cce85487d4b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BeetrootBot"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
