Fista was originally a metal band we formed with Matt (guitar), Steve (drums), &amp; Dave (bass). We wanted a cool name for the band &amp; went off of the word Pfiesteria (some kind of sweet disease in the ocean). Except we wanted to shorten it. We thought maybe Phista in which we all agreed that it looked too much like the band Phish.. so then we shortened it to FistA &amp; the rest is history. Little did we know at that time in our young lives that the word Fista would closely resemble the sexual act of Fisting which made it all that more awesome &amp; we ran with it HARD. Even our logo is a fist going through a circle. Keith, Tony, Matt, and Steve have been making short films ever since... and Steve has been making video games since 1998. LUV U ALL.</em></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T08:17:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/415/4154dde68a918755a676c993fdabdef3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 311, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fista Productions"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
