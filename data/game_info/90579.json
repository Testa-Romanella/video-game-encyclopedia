The game is a beat 'em up with slope physics\u00a0built on Clickteam Fusion 2.5 and\u00a0the Sonic Worlds engine. It mainly takes inspiration from GBA beat 'em ups such as Dragon Ball Advance Adventure and Astro Boy Omega Factor.</p>\n<p>Currently the general mechanics and the first stage are in development.\u00a0Still need to add Super moves, some animations and the alternate second area for the first stage.
