You have to play as a town mayor and defeat hordes of zombies in a top down shooter style.\u00a0\u00a0It was great fun, we learned a lot and we enjoyed the experience. Unfortunately we didn't even remotely get close to finishing the game, we are maybe continueing development in the near future to make our ideas reality. Anyways have fun testing our unfinished game and don't forget to play all the other awesome games of this gamejam.</p>\n\n<p>Special thanks to:<br/></p>\n<p>PANTA for composing the music for our game.
