She will dodge, slash, and throw stars through over 20 levels of painstaking platforming.</p><p>*Challenging game play at its best. Brutal concoctions of environmental hazards, platforming, and lethal enemies force the player to stay attentive, quick, and adapt. </p><p>*Carefully thought out level design. The player's experience is crafted by strategically placed dangers, risks, and rewards. </p><p>*Beautiful retro pixel art paying homage to the early 90's such as Sonic, Mario, and Kirby.</p><p>*A very expressive soundtrack which also pays tribute to the early 90's. Infectious melodic hooks and driving beats wrapped up in a 16-bit package. </p><p>*20+ levels to blaze through. Seasoned players who are skilled can speed through levels at record time. </p><p>*Quick sessions and instantaneous respawn leaves no time for the player's skill to depreciate. There is enough punishment for the player to endure, why sit through a drawn out dying sequence.</p><p>*Automatic Saving so none of your progress will be lost. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d78/d7833da674a6c2d39d9a52fa99693ee4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["7osix"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
