Within a simulated patient encounter, you will experience the short-term and long-term impact of your clinical choices.<br/><br/>This case is centered around a retired auto mechanic, Andrew Turner, who is requesting medical marijuana. In this clinical simulation, you will make choices as Mr. Turner's\u00a0primary care provider and experience outcomes based on the choices you make. You will be challenged to:</p>\n<p>~Consider the most appropriate pain treatment for a patient when medical marijuana is a potential treatment<br/>~Make a referral for medical marijuana to treat pain<br/>~ Provide patient education and facilitate patient decision-making regarding its uses and effectiveness of medical marijuana for pain<br/>~Describe a treatment plan for use of medical marijuana in treating patient's chronic pain<br/><br/>You will complete typical steps of a patient encounter and receive feedback after each step:\u00a0<br/><br/>~ Review medical record<br/>~ Complete an evaluation and treatment plan<br/>~ Make a plan of care for your patient<br/><br/>Feedback is color-coded to let you know whether you made the best selection, a less than ideal selection, or an incorrect selection. With the ability to retry a section or continue down paths to see impacts of different decisions, you will learn by doing without causing real-world negative outcomes.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Who We Are:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>The\u00a0<em>CE: PainTx</em>\u00a0suite of cases were developed by Clinical Tools, Inc. through a NIDA grant (\u00a0#1R44DA035042\u00a0).
