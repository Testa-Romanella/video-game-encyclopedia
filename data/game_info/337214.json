As you can tell, it's in kind of rough shape. This is a visual novel I was working on in RPG Maker MV, and I'm just now getting back to working on it. In this alpha version, you can play through part of Day 1 and get a general idea what the characters and settings are like. Eventually, there will be multiple paths across multiple days, with over ten different endings. <br/><br/>This MAY be ported to another program eventually(Ren'Py, maybe?), as the programming is rather rough and RPG Maker isn't really made for Visual Novels. If I do so, I will re-upload the project as a new game since it'll be easier to patch that way.</p>\n<p>At the moment, this game is completely SFW, but it will eventually contain erotic art and themes. Also, one of the planned possible relationships is M/M - as is implied in one of the screenshots -  and I will add the LGBT tag to the game once that is included.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>All Character Art, Character Design, Backgrounds, and Dialog was created by the creator of the game. <br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Credits for UI Design, Cursor Design, Character 3D Model Resources, etc will be added as the game state progresses and will be finalized before the game is sold.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Characters and Backgrounds were made in Daz Studio 3D.</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>Current Storyline Status:</p>\n<p>Kamea + Talis: <strong>Day 1</strong>: 50% Complete</p>\n<p>Liani + Rissa: <strong>Day 1</strong>: 75% Complete<br/></p>\n<p>Erith + Kol: <strong>Day 1</strong>: 25% Complete</p>\n<p>Secret Character 1: ???</p>\n<p>Secret Character 2: ???<br/></p>\n\n<p><em>This is an alpha version and does not represent the final quality of the game.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-28T03:56:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/653/653331390f1ef947a73d106b6b889dd4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Keita Creations"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
