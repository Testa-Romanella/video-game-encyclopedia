The core game mechanics are from Hurricane VR, and the scene is built from a combination of free and paid assets (see below for attributions).<br/></p>\n<p>The PC Rift version is just the Quest build with shadows on and new light baking done.</p>\n<p><strong>HalloweenHunt was built for my 4 year old Finn</strong> for his birthday, originally I\u00a0was going to have guns but my younger age focus meant removing them.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0only had 2 weeks to do this project as I\u00a0have so much going on, each year I'd like to release another level, the planned ones are Skull Cavern Swarm, like drop dead horde mode. Candy Maze, scale a giant lollypop to see the maze from above, in this scene you can climb the tree to get a view of the surroundings.</p>\n\n<p>I'd like to have a Candy Bowl in this main lobby area, where you can collect candy from enemies of different levels, and have the enemy display as a trophy.</p>\n<p><strong>Future Action Points:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>UI menu options need more work</li><li>Still more work needed on the lighting, especially\u00a0some of the non-static objects like weapons.\u00a0</li><li>Materials/skins for the weapons need more work</li><li>More sound effects</li><li>Hand grab points on some custom objects need alignment</li><li>Earmuffs to replace the UI for muting the pumpkin bouncing sound</li><li>Placement of some trees in background could be improved</li><li>Pumpkins are not supposed to collide with candy but are doing so even though the physics layers are set not to interact</li><li>Max number of pumpkins spawns at one time needs to be fixed.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Attribution</strong></p>\n<p>I'm not required to attribute Hurricane VR as I purchased it, but it's really saved me a great deal of time and enabled a far more polished game.</p>\n<p>Banner created in Canva with the bae picture:\u00a0pexels-art\u016bras-kokorevas-5749961</p>\n<p><strong>Audio</strong></p>\n<p>I\u00a0created a bunch of sounds in BFXR, other than\u00a0 that Freesound.org was where I\u00a0got the clips from.</p>\n\n<ul><li>Monsters are from a Unity Asset Store mega bundle package:\u00a0Micro_Monsters_N_Heroes_Pack</li><li>SFX are from a free unity asset pack Cartoon FX</li><li>The scene was a prebuilt scene form a free Unity Store Asset:\u00a0Halloween Cemetery Set by 3Dfancy.</li></ul>\n<p>I\u00a0don't have a working global high score system, so feel free to post your high score in the comments section of my game page!!</p>\n<p>I\u00a0really hope everyone enjoys the first iteration of HalloweenHunt VR!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T05:24:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c8/7c882e3871031d3b3b6ca5267221ebcb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kr4yZ33"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
