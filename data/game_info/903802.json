The gameplay mixes rogue-like elements with traditional platform mechanics from well-known titles like Super Mario World.</p>\n<p>Known issues:</p>\n<ul><li>The screen may flip upside-down for a split second a few seconds after launch. This is only temporary and shouldn't happen more than once.</li><li>Font rendering issues on outlined text (browser version only).</li><li>General browser lag.</li></ul>\n<p>You may experience some lag in this prototype as it is a browser version. If it lags in full-screen mode, please try it in the regular embedded mode.</p>\n<p>My goal is to eventually release this for mobile, and it will be implemented with touch controls, like swiping to move, etc.</p>\n<p>All graphics, coding, design were done by me. Some sound effects have been\u00a0sourced from\u00a0Juhani\u00a0Junkala's Essential Retro Video Game Sound Effects Collection.</p>\n<p>Thanks for checking out my game!</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br/>Vincent</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T13:54:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/223/22328d2a053e615708c7af40d726ad0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["xalezar"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
