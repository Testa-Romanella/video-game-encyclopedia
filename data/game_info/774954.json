Once you've destroyed the core, don't lose any time cause you need to outrun the explosion and get back to the start !</p>\n<p>To destroy the core, you'll need to hit it with a special missile. You've only got one of these, so if you miss your shot or don't execute the commands in time, it's over!</p>\n<p>Thankfully for you it's only a prototype so you can play any level however you like.</p>\n<p>You can also activate your holo-chain to grab asteroids and sling them into barriers or turrets if that's your thing.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>/!\\ Experimental physics the chain WILL BREAK /!\\</em></p>\n<p>Game supports keyboard/mouse and controllers.
