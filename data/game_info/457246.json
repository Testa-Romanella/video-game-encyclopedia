You don't need to press buttons on beats but the world itself moves on beats so you have to react accordingly. One wrong move means death but the checkpoints are often and death is very short. The game is currently in beta so please after playing it, join the discord server and tell me what you think and stay tuned for more updates!<br/></p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/yR4xkkZ<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T03:34:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ba/6ba06a4594b8823d2612a6fc35926631.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CryingPsycho"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
