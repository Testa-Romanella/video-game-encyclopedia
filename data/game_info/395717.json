Find out in this funny game where you must keep all your cat's alive and try to have as many as possible!</p>\n\n<p>The start is easy, but it gets hard really quickly!</p>\n\n<p>Note: This is a pototype I made as part of the #OneMonthOneGame challenge. I am aware of some bugs still being in the game. If the game is loved, I\u00a0will turn this little prototype in a real game with a lot more features and different levels!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Let me know in the comments if you'd like this to turn into a real game!</p>\n<p>Also post your highscores in the comments with a screenshot. The top 3 users will have their name in the game and can appear on a cat!
