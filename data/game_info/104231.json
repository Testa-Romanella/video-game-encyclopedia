Your citizen credit balance has hit 0, and all you have left is your GMCC 867K Cybernet-enabled Terminal and your skills in hacking. The accounts of those good citizens -\u00a0never speaking up and never complaining -\u00a0sit open and ready for the taking. You plan to climb your way back up the social ladder, through any means necessary.</em></p>\n<p>Citizenship++ is an incremental hacking/puzzle\u00a0game in which you hack the citizen credit accounts of anonymous people in a tightly-controlled surveillence state. Initially only armed with a blank terminal you will unlock increasingly advanced features, all the way up to a scripting engine that will allow you to automate the hacking of accounts.</p>\n<p>Citizenship++ was developed in 72 hours for the Ludum Dare 41, with the theme \"Combine 2 incompatible genres\". We decided to combine a hacking game (like Hacknet or similar) with an incremental game. Are they really incompatible? Yes. Don't question it citizen. Minus 10 credits.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/164/1645987429219c1aa257edf4812fab05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["While False Studios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
