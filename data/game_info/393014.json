Literally, just run around shooting red squares and stuff. Pretty epic. It's also very bullet hell like, so be prepared to move quickly.</p>\n<p>The current version of the game was rushed out in about a week, and as a matter of fact this is the first game I have ever created. I hope that you guys enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T07:15:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/364/364e964820133a9a96723f4e7fcad354.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aliert"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
