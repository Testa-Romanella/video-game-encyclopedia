The ship now responds relative to the players feedback and fingers no longer cover the players ship!</p>\n<p>Guide your colony across the galaxy to reach Eden, the new home for mankind.</p>\n<p>Plan ahead in the hangar, customize loadouts with upgradable equipment and ships, spend riches on new gear and research. Then plot your course through the Galactic Map towards Eden, defending the ARK and the future of humanity along with it. Gather resources and experience to use on future attempts. The campaign offers more than 120 levels to increase the diversity of each attempt. Find events for higher rewards and outposts for shopping and repairing along your way.\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>FAST-PACED ACTION:\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>Mobile first controls make high-paced arcade action simple to play, but hard to master.\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>GALACTIC MAP:\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>The Galactic Map system randomly generates new campaigns. Pulling from a collection of over 120 levels, each attempt is always unique.\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>PREPARE:\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>Build your custom loadout slots using the gear you want and set-off across the galaxy. Each attempt grants experience and coins to use on unlocking or leveling up powerups. 9 ships, 7 unique powerups, turrets, shield upgrades and 4 supers are available through the galaxy.\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>WAYS TO PLAY:\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>Play the campaign, a weekly challenge level, or alternative game modes like Countdown and Endless.\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>Arkfront demands short-term skill, medium-term preparation, and long-term planning in order to survive.\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>SUPPORT:\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>Twitter: @arkfront_game\r\n</p>\n<p>Email: shamus@arkfront.net\r\n</p>\n<p>Discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/yERyNhPK</p>\n<p>Patreon: Shamus Locke is creating Arkfront | Patreon</p>\n<p>Arkfront is in active development and some features (including full-screen support) are still missing.
