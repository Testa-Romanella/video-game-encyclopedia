The story, divided into four chapters, follows the dragonrider D'kor who, with the help of his dragon Zenth, searches for girls to be candidates for Impressing a new young gold dragon. Various side-plots are developed throughout the game including a bit of intrigue involving an epidemic sickness that is somewhat reminiscent of the storyline in McCaffrey's novel Moreta: Dragonlady of Pern. The game contains over 120 locations on three continents. The player interacts and speaks with over 170 characters.</p>\n<p>The game did not sell well, and was derided both by the gaming community and fans of the series for inconsistencies, poor storyline, and poor gameplay.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2001-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:01:27", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Dreamcast"], "developers": ["Ubisoft", "Ubi Studios UK"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Ubisoft Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
