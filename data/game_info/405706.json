This is just a small simulation I made in which some organisms (which I call cells although they're way more advanced than a cell) try to survive and evolve, simulating <strong>natural selection</strong>.\u00a0\u00a0The project is heavily inspired from a video by Sebastian Lague on ecosystems and genetic algorithms and a video about a cell simulation, the Bibites.</p>\r\nInstructions for the simulation\r\n<p>Set the desired parameters and then click generate. These are the suggested parameters to start the simulation:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>MinStartingCells</strong>:\u00a0<strong>10</strong>. The minimum amount of cells to be generated at the beginning of the generation.</li><li><strong>MaxStartingCells</strong>:\u00a0<strong>20-25</strong>. The maximum amount of cells to be generated at the beginning of the generation.</li><li><strong>MaxFood</strong>:\u00a0<strong>1000</strong>. The maximum amount of food to be generated.</li><li><strong>FoodMultiplier</strong>:\u00a0<strong>500</strong>. The higher, the more food will be generated per second.</li></ul>\r\nCell behaviour\r\n<p>When born, the first cells of the simulation get random traits/genes which allow them to act different than other cells. These are the possible genes:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Speed</strong>: The maximum velocity the cell can reach. A small cell will move faster than a big cell.</li><li><strong>RotationSpeed</strong>: How fast can the cell rotate.</li><li><strong>Size</strong>: The scale of the cell. A big cell will consume less food per second (energy wasting) than a small one.</li><li><strong>FoodType</strong>: What food will the cell eat, either vegetal or meat.</li><li><strong>LookRadius</strong>: The vision range of the cell, with which it will detect food and other cells.</li><li><strong>Color</strong>: It doesn't have a purpouse other than showing all the members of a \"family\".</li><li><strong>MinSurvivingTime</strong> <strong>/ </strong><strong>MaxSurvivingTime</strong>: A random number between these two traits determines how long will the cell live.</li><li><strong>VirusResistance</strong>: The higher, the lesser the effect of a virus when infected.</li><li><strong>Cell action genes</strong>:\u00a0 When born, the cell might acquire some of these genes:<ul><li><strong>CanMove</strong>: Ability to move around the scene. It's essential to survive, so it's easier to get it when being born.</li><li><strong>CanStop</strong>: Ability to stop. Really useful to better control the cell's movement.</li><li><strong>CanTurn</strong>: Ability to rotate.</li><li><strong>CanAttack</strong>: Ability to attack. Not really useful at the moment, since it's not fully implemented.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>The cells can also get infected by a virus when eating poisoned food (purple food). A virus can give the host cell the following effects:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Damage</strong>: Inflicts damage to the cell, making it more vulnerable.</li><li><strong>Mutation</strong>: Makes the cell mutate a random gene without having to create a new child.</li><li><strong>Hunger</strong>: Consumes food.</li><li><strong>Slowness</strong>: Reduces the cell speed.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p><em>A cell with a virus.</em></p>\n<p>To survive, cells must eat food (that includes other cells!). There are 3 types of food:</p>\n<ul><li>Vegetal: Only appears in the scene, but more abundantly than meat.</li><li>Meat: Appears in the scene and is released by dead cells.</li><li>Poisoned: Contains a virus.</li></ul>\n<p><em>All three kinds of food.</em><br/></p>\r\nUI\r\n<p>Clicking a cell will display this menu. This panel shows all the variables of the cell, from health to color. At the bottom, five dots are shown, which represent the genes:</p>\n<ol><li>CanMove</li><li>CanStop</li><li>CanTurn</li><li>CanAttack</li></ol>\n<p>If a dot is <strong>red</strong>, the cell doesn't have that gene. If the color is green, the cell has that ability.</p>\n<p><em>The cell panel</em></p>\n\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>ics_de</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-20T03:50:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83b/83bcba79b7168213d4096a10c36a81e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ics_de"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
