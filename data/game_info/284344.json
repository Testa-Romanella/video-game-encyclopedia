Don't get both of them killed by the over-eager protagonists though!</p>\n<p>Control Cirno with the arrow keys, Clownpiece with wasd, and respawn instantly using \"s\" or \"down\". When Cirno's dead, she and nearby things freeze, while Clownpiece's death sets wood ablaze.</p>\n<p>(Because it's a game jam, there's no quality of life features like pause menus or level selects.
