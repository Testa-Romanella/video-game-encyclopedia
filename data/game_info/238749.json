At the beginning, the player chooses freely a vehicle and drives it around town, enjoys the ultra-realistic feeling of driving and the original sounds and may even forget that the vehicle is virtual. Once gripped by the excitement of simulation driving, the standards increase: stick to tight schedules, carry special passengers, master the difficult traffic. But that\u2019s not all. The ambition grows with the experience: Now the multiplayer is played under real conditions \u2013 the colleagues in the control centre coordinate by radio, the game leader set challenges in the middle of the road, unpredictable weather, real duty rosters and long shifts. And after all, how about recreating the way of the school bus and to master the student\u2019s traffic this time on your own? Didn\u2019t the mate from the historic vehicle society have an ancient tram car with crank control standing around? You could breathe life again into it in the simulator \u2013 as a museum run or maybe even at the time it originates\u2026<br/><br/>With LOTUS, dreams and ideas come true \u2013 and the best of it: every good realization will find followers and supporters that are hoping for extensions or are looking for exhausting the adventure of simulation driving.

Afterwards the landscape is shaped and decorated with buildings, trees, lights, stops, benches, fences and much more.<br/></li><li>Content tool: Whether a single scenery object or a whole vehicle \u2013 with the content tool the objects are configured. From material settings to complex animation, from the design of the physics, the sound settings and the import and debugging of scripts, the content tool accompanies and supports the developer.<br/></li><li>Plugin interface: A discarded crank, the board information system with display, a driver\u2019s desk or a whole cockpit can be operated with the simulator and get information back from it by the use of the plugin interface.</li></ul>*Schedules, passengers, traffic, multiplayer and weather will be enabled during Early Access and are not available from start!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:53:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43b/43ba0335e5854002a63e695fe210b662.jpg", "website": "https://www.lotus-simulator.de", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 387, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Oriolus Software"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Oriolus Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
