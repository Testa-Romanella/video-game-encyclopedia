Kill someone to get half their money as reward, then use that money to upgrade your ship. Here's the catch, the more you upgrade, the more your worth, the more pilots will be gunning for you!<br/><br/>This game is the amalgamation of 2 years of development(part time). There's still a lot else planned, but I'd like to see what the world thinks about the game so far.<br/><br/><strong>Sneak peek of what else is planned:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Save/Load game worlds</li><li>AI pilots</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Follow the project:<br/></strong>Subscribe to my YouTube channel and join the Discord for discussions and bug-reports. We'll also plan group-test sessions where we get to all meet in-game for some deathmatch action.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiplayer:<br/></strong>Port forward UDP port 7777 on your router\u00a0and get your public IPv4 from\u00a0https://whatismyipaddress.com<br/>Send this IP to your friends so that they can direct-connect to your hosted game.</p>\n<p><strong>Happy flying skipper!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T07:13:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99b/99b8e6173563ecddcb76c114b38b1515.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["irjayjay"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
