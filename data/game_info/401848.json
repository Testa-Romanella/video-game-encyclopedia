After completing a level the next will unlock as the challenge increases with new mechanics. Master each level by hitting the required time to earn 5 stars.</p>\n\n<p>This is the first game I began working on in 2015. I set out with the challenge of creating a game in my spare time and completing it. Development took about a year and was released on the google play store in early 2016.</p>\n<p>The game was created for android and only recently updated to allow keyboard/mouse input and exported in\u00a0the WEBGL format.\u00a0 The controls are not perfect to say the least, there were many complications trying to create full 3D movement on a phone screen. I did not want to do the typical false thumbstick/buttons approach so did a lot of testing to refine a single/double touch system.</p>\n<p>I wanted to upload the game for anyone who could have some fun with it. It was\u00a0 a real learning experience for me and the process of seeing the project to completion was a real milestone to hit. Now I am focusing my time on Hounds of Valor but this little runner game was a much needed first step into solo game development.</p>\n<p>In this webGL version I have provided an unlock all levels and clear all progress buttons. If the levels wont load after playing before, clear progress then refresh and unlock.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T01:35:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41a/41a889f581832744c9ebca236eb7cbb2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Web"], "developers": ["DogatWorkGames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Racing", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
