This lead to the idea of fitting as many boxes onto a flatbed truck as possible, as the truck can only transport a limited amount of cargo.</p>\n<p>Gameplay-wise, this entry shares some similarities to Tetris, in which different types of boxes (small and large) spawn at the back of the truck and slowly move forwards. A box will stop when it touches another box and a new box will spawn for the player to control. The objective is to simply keep the game running as long as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>WASD or Arrow Keys - Move a box vertically or laterally</li><li>Space Key - Accelerate a box's movement</li><li>Left Click - Menu navigation</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T10:25:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e49/e49c0d7a79d201f7cb89f33f28f234f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["henryNorthway"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
