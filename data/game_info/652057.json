There is also an annoying bug - the player often jumps right into the water at game start.<br/></p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>\n<p>Adam<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T00:26:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0f/d0ff5bc6df36742222dd554dd4fa28be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["adamleczkowski"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
