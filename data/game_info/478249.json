You can rewind yourself.<br/>2. You can rewind other players in a certain radius around you. While you are using this ability you can\u00b4t move.<br/></p>\n<p>But you have to be careful! Every time you use one of your abilities you have to recharge. An indicator on your head shows if you are charged: glowing means that you are charged and not glowing means that you are not charged.</p>\n<p>When you are close enough to a player you can try to catch him. In return you will receive a small speed boost. However, if you fail to catch someone you fall down and cannot move for a short amount time.<br/>After one or less player remains the round ends and another round starts automatically.<br/></p>\n<p>After 16 rounds the game ends.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>Keyboard:<br/>[W], [A], [S], [D] - Walk<br/>[Space] - Catch<br/>[Q]\u00a0 - Rewind yourself (hold)<br/>[E] - Create a time wave<br/>[F] - Recharge (hold)</p>\n<p>Controller:<br/>Left Stick - Walk<br/>(A) - Catch<br/>(Y)\u00a0 - Rewind yourself (hold)<br/>(X) - Create a time wave<br/>(B) - Recharge (hold)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T06:17:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce1/ce19472dd44fcbb61538510ce22bc64e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["unityplayer01"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
