(Twitter: @XPaele)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Content</strong><br/>This short fanfiction is set before the start of the mage origin in the video game Dragon Age: Origins in the Circle of Magi in Ferelden. <br/>It contains young Cullen Rutherford's crush on a female mage (Amell/Surana), from Cullen's perspective (2nd person POV).\u00a0 <br/>There is no sexually explicit content but very mild descriptions of violence/horror. <br/></p>\n<p>I do not own any content that is related to Dragon Age - the world and the characters are owned by Bioware/EA. <br/>I only made this for fun and because I love this franchise - I do not intend to make money off of it. <br/>If there is any reason for me to delete this, please let me know.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Quality</strong><br/>English is not my first language - please keep that in mind while reading. <br/>I am also not an experienced writer or game designer whatsoever. <br/>This is my first game and I made it mostly for myself. <br/>I'm glad if you try it out and maybe have some fun, too - but please don't expect too much. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T04:28:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e53/e53334092a1029d592f33cd0727ae706.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Paele"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
