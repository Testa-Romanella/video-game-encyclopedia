A husband and expected father wakes up one day as the only person left on Earth. How would you survive, eat, drink, and shelter yourself in a world no longer bound by societal boundaries? Would you get the fastest race-car and settle in the biggest mansion or live mobile? Raid a supermarket for a lifetime supply of perishable items or prepare a more sustainable food source? Discover your own answers to these questions as well as the reason for your solidarity, even discover what the acronym TDED stands for! <br/><br/>Oh and one more thing. Without humanity's presence, Nature is ready to reclaim her world. If she doesn't get you, your own sanity just might.<br/><br/>This an extremely early version of the game. I\u00a0have put more focus on coding the majority of the mechanics of the game rather than the art assets so most of the sprites look mediocre if not absolutely basic. Some of the items don't do anything yet either but feel free to click on anything interactable.\u00a0Any and all feedback is wanted but I am in desperate need of constructive criticism. Don't hesitate to roast me.<br/><br/>If you run into any questions feel free to reach out or email me at arctyx@arctyxcreative.com. If you run into any bugs or crashes please let me know immediately and try your best to explain or recreate what caused it.<br/></p><p>Please note that all art work has been drawn myself, which is why it looks so bad, with one exception. The player's character model is from work by Stephen Challener (AKA Redshrike) and Zi Ye, dual licensed under GPL3 and CC-BY-SA3. You can\u00a0 find more of their work on OpenGameArt.org. This will not be the final iteration of the player model and will be hand drawn by me at some point. These are merely placeholder animations in the meantime so I\u00a0can put my focus elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Basic Controls\u00a0 :\u00a0<br/>WASD - Movement<br/>Escape - Outside Inventory :\u00a0Pause<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Inside Inventory/Menu :\u00a0Exit Inventory<br/>Tab - Cycle through rows of Inventory (if more than 10 slots)<br/>Shift - (Held)\u00a0Double movement speed<br/>1 - 0 (Non-Numpad Digits) - Change current slot<br/>Mouse Wheel Up/Down - Scroll through slots<br/>I - Inventory toggle<br/>P - Phone GUI (Menu) toggle<br/>E - Interact with current slot (as in USE or EAT)<br/>Mouse Button Left - Interact with item under mouse<br/>F1 - Enter debug mode with additional options displayed (For example :\u00a0press F1 to enter Debug Mode then press F5 to exit game).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T04:02:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f91/f911b0eccde0cc4276ba9edb9d25da1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arctyx Creative Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
