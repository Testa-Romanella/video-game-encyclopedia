Here are some of them:</p>\n<ul><li>Dummy: This tank doesn't do anything. Pretty easy to kill!</li><li>Turret: These tanks are stationary,\u00a0but they fire deadly and accurate bullets.</li><li>Mover: The Mover tank periodically jumps forward and shoots, meaning you will need to use your mobility to the fullest.</li><li>Bullets: Not just any bullets, YOUR bullets! Shoot wisely, as your own projectiles can bounce and kill you.</li></ul>\n<p>Good luck, and don't die (or kill yourself!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T09:46:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec4/ec43b42afdd2b6e5a4cb69817d6c4987.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["r3sgame"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
