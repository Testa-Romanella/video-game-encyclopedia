{"id": 842329, "slug": "starcat-godstar-slayer", "name": "STARCAT :: GodStar Slayer", "name_original": "STARCAT :: GodStar Slayer", "description": "STARCAT :: Godstar Slayer\r\n(This game will struggle on WEBGL if you have a low end PC.. Please run the Windows/Linux Builds)\r\n<p>This is my submission for the Minijam 113 : Final Boss.<br/>This game was HIGHLY ambitious and a solo project that cost me 36 hours of dev time. I crunches more than I usually do and hope you enjoy the little game I created. this is unfinished but still very playable, due to it being a gamejam game, please expect bugs.</p>\n<p><strong>Reported Bugs:</strong><br/>- Dying for the second time causes a hardlock<br/>- Sprite on WebGL rarely get stuck in a coloured state<br/>- Audio is very low, turn your volume up as necessary.<br/>- Fuel goes into negative values &amp; does not end in failure.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>All mouse, baby!</p>\r\nHelp:\r\n<p>Unique battle system will lead you to be strategic with your move placement. I had more planned but had to divert quickly away from a full inventory + combine system that caused affinity reactions. For now this is the combos:<br/><br/>Attack vs Attack = both take damage<br/>Attack vs Defence = damage is nullified<br/>Attack vs Healing = you stop the healing<br/>Defence vs Defence = nothing happens.<br/>Healing vs Healing = you both heal.<br/><br/>Tip. Enemies have a limited healing pool.. so attritition is sometimes best bet.<br/><br/></p>\r\nFun Fact:\r\n<p>The song used in this was also features in another game I collaborated in with a lovely talented gamedev\u00a0Emma. You can check out her page here:\u00a0https://elyon.itch.io/\u00a0where you can see her amazing games and some of the inspiration for this game here. Starcat is Emma's dream game that I drew inspiration from and hope they like my game.<br/><br/>----</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>All artwork and coding by Me;<br/>SFX sounds by various across freesounds<br/><br/>Audio by:<br/><strong>\"Phantom from Space\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</strong><br/><strong>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License</strong><br/><strong>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/<br/></strong><br/><strong>\"Jellyfish in Space\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</strong><br/><strong>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License</strong><br/><strong>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</strong><br/><br/><strong>\"Space Fighter Loop\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</strong><br/><strong>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License</strong><br/><strong>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T16:38:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6da/6dafbccdc6d38710d23e824380281003.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Fmlad"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
