This game is only controlled with\u00a0the left and right mouse buttons. Left click will raise and lower your plane, and right click will allow you to perform a barrel roll. Barrel rolls will allow you to pass through obstacles unharmed, and you'll receive bonus points for doing so. The more obstacles you avoid in a single barrel roll, the bigger the reward. See how high of a score you can attain!</p>\n<p>Developer's note:\u00a0<em>I originally designed this game while going through the Unity Learn Junior Programmer pathway a few weeks ago. Part of the coursework has you developing a personal project, but I was disappointed when I discovered that they didn't actually expect you to ever finish it. I was fairly happy with the game I had been working on, so I decided to finish it up, polish it a little, and release it on my itch.io page. It took about 2 weeks of on-and-off work to get this to a state where I was happy enough with the game to release it. It's still a little odd in some spots, but I hope you enjoy!</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-28T03:23:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b88/b8808822e2936e8dbae6954109ae4a58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["trickytriangles"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
