{"id": 934525, "slug": "end-of-world-survivors", "name": "End of world: Survivors", "name_original": "End of world: Survivors", "description": "This game is inspired by my love for survival, end of the world scenarios, and, of course, Zombies!<br/><br/>I have always enjoyed the driving and collection parts of these games, so I thought I would cut out the middle man and only do the driving. Games like dead island, dying light, and the amazing LTOU have influenced what this game is about. Their graphics were lacking however, so I thought I would improve on that with some hand drawn comic style art!<br/><br/>There is a simple story that will not get in the way of the main point of the game. That is, to go from A to B in your car and have some fun along the way. Exploring, collecting and running over zombies will be the main aim here. The Zombies will only be a mild annoyance, rather than a never ending dying nightmare. <br/><br/>Full disclosure: This is a fairly short adventure. I estimate a few hours taking your time. Given the levels have been loveingly hand made and linear, replayability will be limited.<br/><br/>Here is some more info:<h3>Features:</h3><br/><ul><li> A simple, fun driving system for the car.<br/></li><li> A somewhat leisurely difficulty, you die but you won't lose much progress if you do.<br/></li><li> Hand crafted linear levels.<br/></li><li> Grassy, desert and snow biomes.<br/></li><li> Cute stylised graphics, no horror or scary elements.<br/></li><li> Zombies are lurking around to get in your way, run them over or avoid them.<br/></li><li> Trade your collected items for scrap.<br/></li><li> Use scrap to fix your car, upgrade it and pay for stuff.<br/></li><li> Simple controls with a keyboard or controller - all buttons can be re-mapped</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T04:41:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c5/7c5076744aa2fa608f3c736c109e592d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 226, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["End of world games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["End of world games"], "esrb_rating": null}
