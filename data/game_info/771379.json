Armed with the royal Pop-o-Matic, can you burst their bubble and send them plummeting before they take all the sweet delicacies for themselves?</p>\n<p>Pop Rock 'N' Roll is a vibrant action game that has you pop balloons with your mouse to prevent enemies from reaching the top. But don't be too trigger-happy: not every balloon should be popped, as they may carry helpful Power-Ups or even friendly Mokos, who will cost you precious candy if you burst their ride!</p>\n<p>You're going to need quick fingers and a cool head as you stop hordes of enemies and overinflated bosses.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>25 Levels across 5 worlds</strong>, each with a boss at the end</li><li>More than a dozen <strong>different balloons, enemies and power-ups</strong></li><li><strong>Arcade survival mode</strong> with linear or random progression</li><li><strong>5 difficulty settings</strong> to tone down or turn up the levels' challenges</li><li>Support for new levelpacks, and a <strong>level editor</strong> to make your own!</li></ul>\n<p>There is a free Demo that contains 5 specially made levels, a limited Arcade mode, and fully functional editor (limited to demo objects). The demo levels reach medium difficulty and showcase elements from all the worlds, so they should give you a good idea of what to expect from the full game.</p>\n<p>Now, go out and pop some balloons!</p>\n<p>(Note on colour blindness: Balloon colours don't mean anything. Everything that acts differently has its own shape or pattern, so the game should be accessible.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T04:37:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2af/2af3951dd6321cdd828397a9ed6f0fb6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vellidragon"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
