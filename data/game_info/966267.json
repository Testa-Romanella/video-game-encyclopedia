He wishes she were beautiful, like the squirrels of the wood.  And so he sets out to hunt the squirrels of the wood, so that he might staple them to her and make her beautiful again.<br/><br/>But that is easier said than done.  A sinister presence lurks in the deep forest, and it has only one rule: \"Thou shalt not staple squirrels!\"<h3>IN SQUIRREL STAPLER YOU CAN...</h3><ul><li> Hunt squirrels!
