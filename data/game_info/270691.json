It features constant nuclear combat and radiation everywhere. Technically.  If you love chemistry or physics, you'll probably enjoy this. If you hate chemistry or physics... you'll also probably enjoy this.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlay as an electron and cause havoc on your road to freedom, or play as nucleus and struggle to control a full atom's worth of particles.<br/>\r\nIn terms of content, this game comes with a short campaign, single-player challenge modes, and split-screen multiplayer that allows for 2-4 players. <br/>\r\nThere's also online multiplayer in the form of the Quantum Nightmare modes. Quite possibly the hardest online multiplayer you'll ever encounter. It's not recommended to take it too seriously.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:50:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64b/64bbb633292315e6d618551aab708969.jpg", "website": "https://iceforgedgames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cole Allen"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Cole Allen"], "esrb_rating": null}
