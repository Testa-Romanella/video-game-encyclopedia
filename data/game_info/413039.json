Help him collect every coin.</p>\n\n<p>This is a fixed camera platforming game. I had 6 weeks to complete this project. I unfortunately had some things in life come up about half way so the middle 3 weeks were not very usefull.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope that you can get at least 15 minutes of enjoyment from this little game. I will be creating a new game over this next month. I'll be posting a devlog for this game and also a devlog for the next project when it comes out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Insta - leafmealonegamedev<br/></p>\n<p>Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRPq0I6U3VqCsLs_OuWL9Gg<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-17T04:27:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f57/f5725f13146307d59c7b9103e4366441.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LeafMeAloneGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
