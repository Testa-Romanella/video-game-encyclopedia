You remember nothing, but someone appears to tell you where to find all the answers. What will you choose to do?</em></p>\n<p>This is my first game project published in itch.io. I like this theme because it is a good starting point to think, and review, over myself. This game is story-driven and I've spent much time on building the dialogue system framework, so there aren't many real stuffs to play. Anyway, I enjoy this mouth pretty much and I hope you will enjoy reading the story as well.\r\n</p>\n<p>GitHub:\u00a0https://github.com/FFATL/NoManIsAnIsland</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T10:54:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e90/e901b644bfcaab7408c8a9820996bbe3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FFAT"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
