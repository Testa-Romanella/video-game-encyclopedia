The only way out is finding the door to your room, but room repeats and things get scary. This game has 3 levels to play in, some cutscenes, and many more! However, it is\u00a0incomplete in terms of player dying properly, not all mobs being added in such as Humanoid Bunny or Doll, and the\u00a0audio not being all done. BUT still playable and possible to beat!\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Not too shabby for a first game jam I'll say lol</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T12:43:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20b/20b93c1ef0460dbded1190c1a3df5d60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SoulWolfx"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
