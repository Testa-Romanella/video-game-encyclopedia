These creatures come from the \u2018dense\u2019 woods around your small farm. Be on the lookout whilst growing your crops. You might be suprised how quick they arrive once you start watering your plants.</p>\r\nWhat to do?\r\n<p>A quick introduction to the gameplay. Basically you first go ahead and pick up some of the seeds found at the tables near the barn. You bring those to the field and plant them. Atleast one seed has to be planted to start a wave. Upon wave start enemies spawn in the surrounding areas and come targeting the crops you planted. They will attack them and you have to try and defeat them. Which in this build is easy because for some reason every weapon one hits the enemies. Plants grow after they survived a wave. Are they then attacked and \u2018killed\u2019 in a following wave, then they will revert to the previous stage and so on until fully destroyed. If a plant grows fully (stage 4), then you can harvest it which spawns new seeds for you to plant on more spots (as of writing this there is a mistake where only a single seed is harvested making them overall seed count not go up). If all seeds are destroyed you lose the game. If you however manage to plant all seeds and fully grow them you win the game.</p>\n<p>Well I still hope you guys enjoy the game a bit. There is not too much to do sadly.</p>\r\nHow to play\r\nActionKey(s)MoveWASDLookMouseAttackLeft MousePickupEUseFDropG\r\n<p>To harvest crops you take the harvester (shovel) and press F on fully grown crops.</p>\n<p>To start a wave you water your plants by pressing the button at the fountain.</p>\r\nKnown Issues\r\n<ul><li>Sometimes colliding with objects bounces you back</li><li>Killing an enemy very early in a wave ends the wave but still spawns all remaining enemies</li><li>Pitchfork does one hits on enemies</li><li>Mouse does not lock in WebGL version on itch</li><li>Able to hit with seeds</li><li>Enemies sometimes kill plants almost directly (1-2 hits)</li><li>Enemies animator does not work correctly</li></ul>\r\nFeatures I wanted to add\r\n<ul><li>Showing which button to press over objects</li><li>Health bars</li><li>Cooldown of the weapon delays</li><li>Much nicer looking surrounding</li><li>Correctly animating the enemies</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c8/4c8906e0d549710f1934dc4c2c5ebc54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["OnePlusOneNS"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
