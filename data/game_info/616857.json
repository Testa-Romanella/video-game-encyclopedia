Will you reach the finish first? Can you keep track of the deceiving changes your opponent makes to your path?\u00a0Sticky notes and marker-lines aren't permanent after all...</p>\n<p>Stick-It is a 2-player\u00a0versus platformer where players strive to beat each other to the finish in a best of 5 format. Players start by taking turns building a path after which they are let loose into an ever-changing level. Can you predict your opponents choices and will you remember the correct path?\u00a0\u00a0Or will you be deceived and find yourself at a dead end?</p>\n<p>On your marks... get set... go! Try to beat your opponent to the finish but don't forget to take in the different paths you encounter, as this might be the only time you get to see the entire path.</p>\n<p>Didn't manage to beat your opponent to the finish? Don't fret, there's more time to get back in the game. After each round you will get the chance to change the layout of the level, creating new paths, changing up the traps or maybe creating a dead end to trick your opponent.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T04:16:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e2/7e295433c3419a90a71f461e50ff1885.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LegalSpeedDevelopment", "ge-daan3", "InDeWalvis", "Riaxmz"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
