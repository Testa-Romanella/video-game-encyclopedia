And then i also had the idea of using the trippy shader i made a while ago in something i actually release and the long held intention of including the dad kite\u00a0 golfing bit from psychonautwiki in one of my games and then lintilion mentioned the black dresses samplepack and therest just kinda grew naturally.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T14:42:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/878/87894807a656ed2e27c7dfb80408aa1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ash K"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
