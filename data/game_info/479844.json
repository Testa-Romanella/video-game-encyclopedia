It\u00a0will also teach you\u00a0a lot of theoretical and help you learn a lot of\u00a0practical\u00a0stuff\u00a0about basketball, I mean you're probably gonna learn some game rules as well as get adapted not only to this game, but also to the\u00a0<em>Real Life\u00a0Basketball</em>!</p>\n<p>Note that this game may receive updates at any time (like the eventual local multiplayer we're thinking of), so if you find anything that should or should not be in this game, just let us know!</p>\n<p><strong>When is the local multiplayer gonna come?</strong> Well, we're not entirely sure! Probably by the end of 2020! I dunno! We haven't even decided\u00a0whether to start working on it yet! Your comments might be supportive for our decision! For now, you can at least\u00a0learn playing this game and also have fun on your own with the AI!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T03:05:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cba/cba8b612dbf41951119ffbfb93d13b2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VASCii ENTERTAINMENT"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
