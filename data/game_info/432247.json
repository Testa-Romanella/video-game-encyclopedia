You are tasked in finding out why the outbreak of spiders have taken place whilst also finding what happened to her sister. Is she still alive? there's only one way to find out.</p>\n<p>What i have learnt from making this 3D game most of all is the character interaction. Having a question mark above their heads and pressing E to change to the next dialog was an impressive feat that i achieved.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T12:25:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a2/8a281c4d83397854a8872ed4638946da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ShaneFitzpatrick"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
