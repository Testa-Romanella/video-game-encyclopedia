Nitori Kawashiro has brought video games to the fantasy world of Gensokyo, and she intends to capitalize on it with as many diverse games as possible, so you'd better think fast!<br/><br/>This version of the game has updated content not yet featured in the Steam version. It is temporarily only available in itch.io's Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality. We're taking this stand because racism has never belonged in our collab, or the Touhou fanbase, and anyone who enjoys our game should recognize that. The update will become free after the bundle is up.<br/></p>\n<p>This game can also be purchased directly on this page as a donation. Regardless of how you purchase, the proceeds will be split between:</p>\n<ul><li>NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund</li><li>Community Bail Fund</li></ul>\n<p><strong>However, we recommend donating through the bundle to access this collection, as it bypasses itch's cut and donates all the money you put in!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-08T05:44:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/446/446685bd8ddfabd5f53f6577c1363b1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gman8r"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
