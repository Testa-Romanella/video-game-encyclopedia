These cards will represent your options of placing chips on the board. The starting player selects the card they wish to play, and then selects one of the locations on the board that match the selected card. A new card is automatically drawn from the deck, and it is now player 2\u2019s turn. The players now take turn placing chips and creating rows.<br/>When a row of five chips has been created, the row is locked for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>There are a few ways to make it easier for you to get a row, or to stop your opponent from getting one. As you may have noticed Jacks are not depicted on the board.<br/>The blue Jacks are wild cards. Selecting a blue jack gives you the ability to place a chip on any of the free spots on the board. These are often used to either block your opponent from getting a row, or to finish a row of your own.  <br/>The red Jacks are a bit different. Selecting a red jack give you the ability to remove one of your opponent\u2019s chips (unless it is part of a locked row). This is often used if you opponent has previously blocked your row, or if your opponent is close to getting a row.<br/><br/>A faster way of getting a row of five chips, is to use one of the corner chips. These chips count as one of your own, meaning you would only need to place four chips out from a corner to get a row. Another option, is to utilize one of the locked chips from a previous row, to create a new one. <br/><br/><br/>Find a bug, or experience an issue?<br/>Please feel free to contact me and I will see to solve the problem as fast as possible. <br/>Email: nsdapp1105@gmail.com<br/>Enjoying the game, please leave a rating.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T01:57:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb8/fb83cefd5fc4090de19f100065a59c8f_FHg0Itn.jpg", "website": "http://appsite.skygear.io/in_sequence", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Nikolai Dirks"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Card"], "publishers": ["Nikolai Dirks"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
