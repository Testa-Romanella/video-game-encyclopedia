It is your job to keep yourself and the civilization alive. Use your power to provide food, resources, change the temperature or release deadly diseases. Keep tracking of everything you and the civilization needs and hope the civilization reaches it\u2019s modern age by the year 100.</p>\n<p><strong>As a nature spirit you can\u2026</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Plant trees and generate rocks that the civilization will use as resources to expand and develop technology. Beware that resources too far are hard to reach. They last longers but produce less.</li><li>Spawn animals the civlization will use for foood. This is the only resource you can\u2019t live with, specially early on, keep a good track of it.</li><li>Change the temperature. It affects many things. Highger temperatures makes people consume less food. Lower temperatures increase food consumption but reduce population multiplication, and also diseases effectivity.</li><li>Unsleash diseases. These will help you to control the population when overpopulation occurs. The more cells used by the civilization, the more the population can increase without falling into overpopulation.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>*The civilization will rise and expand</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Expansions occur when some criterias are met and allows the civilization to have more population.</li><li>Age advance occur when some criterias are met and completely changes how your civilization behaves in terms on consumption and productionm, while also changing how diseases affect them.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>To win and lose</strong></p>\n<ul><li>To win you\u2019ll need to reach the modern stage of civilization by the year 100. </li><li>You\u2019ll lose if pollution consumes you or if you fail to keep the civilization alive.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Requirements to expand </strong></p>\n<p>For the civilization to expand on any stage you will require 1 empty tile on the side of any of the already existing cities.
