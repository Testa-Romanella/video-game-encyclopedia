New characters, new mechanics, a new story, and more. Taking place in the large gap between FNaF 1 and FNaF 3, FE:S seeks to merge somewhat seamlessly with the existing FNaF story, while also filling in a few gaps.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T12:33:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/735/7351053c82a25740ecf3b8f8e64bc1c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["GATUS"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
