Our goal is to produce a game that can be played by a wide, varied audience, and show off the talent of the next generation of game designers coming into the industry in New Zealand. Within the scope of Acolyte, we want to explore a narrative that discusses life, death, and what comes after, whilst presenting choices and characters that genuinely engage our players within the world we created.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Whilst we want much of the narrative to be discovered through the game play, we intend for the players to have genuine excitement to make their way through the world we have created for Acolyte, and meet the people within it, all of whom present the player with a unique perspective on the events that brought them there.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\r\nWho Are We?\r\n<p>The team involved in making Acolyte are a varied and passionate group of students who have come together with their individual talents to create a project. We are all second and third year students within Massey University, headed by a team of three producers who help drive the group to create the best results possible.</p>\n\n<p><em>Made Under The Banner of Parietal Eye</em><br/></p>\r\n\r\nInstall instructions:\r\n<p>After unzipping the installation folder, run Acolyte.exe to play the game.
