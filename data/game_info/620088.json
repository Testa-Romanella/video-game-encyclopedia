What if they were really bad at it? \r\n<p>Here is a game with someone trying to stop you from 'disrupting a learning environment' despite the fact it cannot distinguish between work and play at a glance.</p>\n<p>You play as a blue dot dodging red dots while you, the player, must hide that you are playing a game from a wandering robot. Being spotted without your screen hidden (hide with SPACE) or taking a hit by a red projectile raises the suspicion against you. However, while taking damage you are immune to projectiles, but too much damage will cause a game over, but blocking damage with SPACE will stop your movement and negate the projectile immunity. Balance carefully.</p>\n\n<p>WASD: Move</p>\n<p>SPACEBAR: Toggle hide screen (essentially Alt Tab)</p>\n\n<p>Mobile is not supported. Firefox/Chrome recommended.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T17:22:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe9/fe901809b13ff7e5988c646aaa169a92.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["m;dy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
