He asked the jam organizers if he could use the turn based tactic part of that code so that he could work on that game while working on this game. The jam organizers permitted him to do so as long as we provided this note (and here it is!). Aside from refactoring the code, the new feature programmed into this game is the land vs water terrain mechanic. This became the core mechanic.\u00a0Moreover, the enemy AI is also newly programmed.   All sound and music related programing was done by our composer, Ivan Berlin (Midnight Shadow).</p>\n\n<p>Controls: WASD to move. Z to confirm a tile to select.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2022 Marvin Chong - Programmer<br/></p>\n<p>\u2022 Ivan Berlin (Midnight Shadow) - Musician\u00a0and Audio Programmer</p>\n<p>\u2022 Austin Szema - 3D Artists and Texture Designer</p>\n\n<p>Goal of the game: Gain the most territory by\u00a0converting water to land. If you have control of at least half of the terrain by the end of the third round, you win! Otherwise, you lose.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T07:13:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff7/ff760d8e94c868bf432e79b997429f93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["melodicht", "MidnightandShadow", "elipter"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
