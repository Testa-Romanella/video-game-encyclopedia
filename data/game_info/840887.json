CHAIRS!<br/><br/><h3>*BEEP* *BEEP*</h3>As a middle-class man, you have got to take your pills to function normally and scream no to your toxic environment!<h3>Time to meet your maker employer</h3><br/><br/>Elevators will get you floor by floor towards salvation, maybe your issue with the uncomfortable office chair will finally be heard...<br/><br/>Because you are almost always under influence you often forget floor layouts so be prepared to get lost a lot.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But when you will get to the final floor, just beware of any shiver, because the boss there won't be waiting for you to shake it off. He just sits there and watches TV. Perhaps he may watch you right now through a CCTV camera, so put a smile on your face :)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T05:29:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f83/f8307fe1472d9bb30fec3c4cf58e1398.jpg", "website": "https://decorporation.cubepotato.eu", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 15, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["TheMatiaz0", "Cubepotato Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Cubepotato Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
