{"id": 150294, "slug": "glue-time", "name": "Glue Time", "name_original": "Glue Time", "description": "<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWASD to move, QE to rotate\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMouse shoots your main cannon. Shootings costs glue, unless you fire less than once per second.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSpace switches you in or from Glue Time, which slows time and lets you assimilate enemy balls when you touch them.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTo be able to go into Glue Time you need Glue at or above capacity.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tP is pause.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWhite ball (cueball) is you, you shoot your main cannon from it, and it's game over if it is destroyed.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t1-ball has no special functions, except being cheap (in glue capacity value).\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t2-ball shoots straight\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t3-ball has high speed. Your ship's speed and rotation speed depends on ratio of mass/speed of all it's balls, so 3-ball can make you faster\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t4-ball is your armor. It has high hp, and extra damage resistance.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t5-ball has homing missile launcher. It's damage is weaker than one of 2-ball, but it can get you from any angle.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t6-ball is a magnet for dropped glue. Any of your balls can absorb glue, btw, but in enemy ship only 6-balls can do it. Which makes them nearly as annoying s 5-es.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t7-ball buffs all nearby allies in short distance. Bonus is around 50% to damage resistance and firing speed for nearest balls, and drops with the square of distance. It sacks up to 300% total.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t8-ball is a boss. Nearly indestructible, and gives big 7-like buff. Only way to defeat it is to destroy all it's other parts and glue it.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca0/ca0d98243c0ab15549ceb5bd5c369461.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Baturinsky"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
