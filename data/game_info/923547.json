Rife with humor, and maybe even a little romance, work alongside anthropomorphic Pokemon to bring both their dreams and your own to life!</p>\n<p>The premise of this tale will revolve around you helping run a DynaMax Raid Den! Giving Pokemon a safe place to grow to silly sizes and blow off steam engaging in harmless rampages of their personalized choosing!<br/><br/>For now think of this demo as a taste of the kind of humor you can expect from the eventual finished product along with a sneak peek at some of the characters! No growth or Dynamaxing just yet alas. Perhaps in the next update.<br/></p>\n<p>STATUS: Version 1.01</p>\n<p>DISCLAIMER: This is my very first attempt at writing much less coding something like this and I'm certain it shows. I'm still cutting my teeth on this and it takes a lot of time to not just write and draft this out but, with any luck, coordinate with artists to breathe some life into this undertaking.\u00a0Updates, should they come, will be slow.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, do be aware that the themes explored in future updates will be, gasp, decidedly risque!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finally this work will, and forever shall, remain free for you to consume. For fairly obvious reasons I cannot and adamantly will not profit off of this work. This is a passion project and will remain as such.</p><p>Cover Image by @saintsucrose (Twitter)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T08:12:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/562/5621a761ac49ef200939bf8db958db7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RaddaReep"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
