It was made by 5 artists and 2 programmers, students of ESAT in Valencia, Spain. Students of Berklee also collaborated creating the soundtrack.<br/></p>\n<p>In 2063 you will take the role of Katsu, who awakes after 10 years cryogenized and discovers that he has mutant powers. You will travel through the island of Odaiba in the city of Tokyo in a post-apocalyptic setting that still has electricity running thanks to clean energy.</p>\n<p>The full process of development was 9 months long. Please understand this was our first project, it still has bugs that we are not going to solve because we already passed the deadline. We don't plan on develop further this project, but feel free to give us any feedback we can take for future projects.</p>\n<p><strong>SPECS</strong></p>\n<p>You will need a decent computer to move 2063. Keep in mind this is just a student project and our main focus wasn't to optimize the game for toasters.</p>\n<p>Should run fine in a setup similar and lower to this one:</p>\n<p>Windows 7 (should run at least in Vista)</p>\n<p>GTX 770</p>\n<p>8GB RAM</p>\n<p>i5-4690 3.50ghZ</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d69/d69fc59acb40735c9a9a5c2eae401393.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 258, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wabbaboy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
