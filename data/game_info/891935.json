We finished most of the technical challenges before getting burnt out when it came time to actually implement the story. We took a break and both ended up moving on to different projects. I would love to continue this and I know they would too, so more updates in the future aren't out of the question.</p>\n<p>As for the idea, the initial inspiration was to create a game, like cities skylines but with a twist. That twist isn't implemented or playable in the game just yet so I won't reveal it yet.</p>\n<p>For now it's basically a glorified demo for the unity AI waypoint system and the assets game-racers made for the project that actually made it into the game!</p>\n<p>https://game-racers.itch.io/<br/></p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>I - Next Line of Dialogue</p>\n<p>E - Lock Camera in Place</p>\n<p>WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>Left Click - Place / Sell</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T07:58:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45a/45af5d44030069ffca67780f7c96d43e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SometimesGames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
