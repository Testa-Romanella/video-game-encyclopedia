I have always wanted to make video games ever since I was a kid, but during that time you had to either work at; a AAA studio or be a very smart, and skilled person in order to make games. As technology advanced and still does to this day everyone around the world has made things to help with the lack of knowledge on how to either: Programming, 3D Modeling, Sound Effects, and etc! This doesn't mean me as a game developer is using this as a clutch to make games, but rather a jump start on my adventure to become better at this, and be more skilled in the near future.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T04:21:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0a/a0af7b84a0a4444eac474b48a0d33f7d.jpg", "website": "https://twitter.com/HBunnyBoi", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 249, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HBunny"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["HBunny"], "esrb_rating": null}
