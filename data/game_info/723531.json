Stay tuned for the updates. This definitely won't be my last game made with Unity, and there will be more games to come. Hope you enjoy this game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T06:34:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db2/db286c63a306cd187cf8820b68e807c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HabebusGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
