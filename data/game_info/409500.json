These are the rules:<br/>1. Inmates will alternate consciousness as a reward for good behavior.<br/>2. Lights out in ten minutes<br/>3. Once curfew is in effect, ANY Erudites found wandering the halls, have their lights ON, or with open doors WILL be SHOT on sight</p>\n<p>Enjoy your stay!</p>\n<p>In Erudite Ambry, the player plays as two individual Brains with limited means; encased in glass spheres. These are Erudites, confined to the Ambry. The players objective is to leave their cell (at risk of breaking curfew) and see if they can find a way for both of them to adhere to the rules... posted on their cell wall.... because who knows what happens in this dark and gloomy place if you don't comply... The Ambry doesn't allow all the inmates to enjoy the freedom of consciousness at all times, so each Erudite is given a turn to use a limited amount of the shared conscious time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-03T06:17:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07c/07c4b1240f8ee407cc5f28074ec05ca9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KleinM"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
