Explore 8 initial world locations in any order as you build your character from a weak kid into a plausible video game hero.  Chris's floating mechanic allows for unique platforming challenges, and he can learn increasingly powerful spells and special moves as he travels the globe - as well as purchase upgrades from the merchants of the Kingdom of Lost Balloons.  Explore a world like something out of a Saturday morning cartoon, fight ninja cats and cyborg penguins, uncover a sinister story, and prove your capabilities to a skeptical population - with laughs along the way!<br/> <br/><br/>THE STORYOne day in 1995, seven children around the world mysteriously vanish, including a nerdy, overweight 7th-grader named Chris.  Finding himself in a remote part of Transylvania, he soon becomes lost in a Saturday morning cartoon universe of magic and villains.  When one of those villains transforms him into a helium balloon as an insult, Chris (ever the optimist) reinterprets his transformation as the superpower of flight, and floats off to save the other kidnapped children.<br/> <br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T07:05:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0b/b0b7f45c5a8e3dd1fba8ccb6e6697073.jpg", "website": "https://adventuresofchris.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 11, "owned": 91, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 56, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 228, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Render Cube", "Guin Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Graffiti Games", "Guin Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
