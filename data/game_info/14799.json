This base enables players to extract minerals and build factories, which will be used to produce ammunition and spare parts for their space ships. This base is the player\u2019s primary stronghold: other Lords can raid it, but they won\u2018t be able to capture it. Players can also capture up to five additional asteroids, which will be used to extract minerals. But beware: the player will have to remain on the alert to keep other Lords from recapturing the asteroids. <br/><br/>Player bases are located on asteroids, which travel within the Oort Cloud. Once they\u2019ve acquired the appropriate skills, players can control their asteroid\u2019s movements.<br/><br/>Mass-combat enthusiasts will love the Arena: here, players can battle it out against alien races (AI) or other Astro Lord players. Those battles take place in real-time, which allows players to actively take part in the game instead of just having to wait for the completion of their building projects.<br/><br/>You will experience complete freedom of action and social interaction.<br/><br/><strong>Become a worthy Astro Lord!</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T04:20:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4bb/4bb3fbdfc1c69138c595c9372ecbd022.jpg", "website": "http://astrolords.ru/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 251, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 46, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 453, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Aratog"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tartezal Holdings"], "esrb_rating": null}
