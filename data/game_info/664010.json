Think Alien: Isolation mixed with System Shock 2.\r\n</p>\r\nDesign Pillars\r\n<p><strong>Terror. </strong>The monster should wander around the spaceship, looking for its prey. The player will not have constant knowledge of where the monster is. For all they know, it could be right around the corner.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Horror.</strong> Upon finding the player, the monster should chase the player to capture him/her.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Strategy.</strong> The player must outsmart the hunter or become hunted. Several abilities the player has can help them leave the spaceship.\r\n</p>\r\nGenre/Story/Mechanics Summary\r\n<p>If I have enough time, I\u2019d like to make a few different starts where each character has a unique initial inventory. If I run out of time, the plan is just to use one player start, where the player is a scavenger who boards a derelict ship looking for goods when they discover they aren\u2019t alone on the ship. The player must make a break for the escape pods.\r\n</p>\n<p>The monster will use all its simulated senses, from touch, to smell, to hearing, to visuals, in order to find its prey. It will utilize a decision tree to determine when to investigate a room and when to run towards the player.\r\n</p>\n<p>A separate \u201cdirector\u201d AI will give the monster hints as to where the player is, so that the monster does not get completely lost; however, a \u201ctension\u201d variable will measure the perceived terror the player is experiencing, and if it gets too high, the director will get the monster to back off. The tension variable will consider the health of the player, the proximity of the monster to the player, if the player can see the monster, and if the player was previously spotted.\r\n</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<p>Sneaking will be crucial to the survival of the player. Hiding in the shadows will help prevent the monster from seeing the player. There are various hazards on board the ship that can hurt the player. Falling damage, toxins, burns, and more stand in the player\u2019s way.\r\n</p>\n<p>Distractions will aid the player in getting the monster to move elsewhere, allowing them to sneak by. Throwing items is a good example.\r\n</p>\n<p>Some areas will be locked off by keycards, or loss of power. Having the correct tool for the job will allow access. The spaceship will be a cheese hole design to allow freeform movement within it. In general, if there is a room in the ship, there will always be two exits (With exceptions. Sometimes it just won\u2019t be possible).\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T03:41:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf9/cf95e3143e0031c8d7ed2b5c9bb2c224.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Singulo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
