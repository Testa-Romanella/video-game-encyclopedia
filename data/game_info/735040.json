The theme was \"1 minute\", and you have exactly 1 minute left of fuel upon starting the game. The fuel bar is in the top left.\u00a0Use the arrow keys or WASD to move, and space or z to shoot, and avoid other speeders, police speeders shooting at you, and cactus. Destroying a police speeder or other speeder will give you fuel, but shooting takes away fuel so be careful with your shots. Hitting an obstacle takes away a lot of fuel. (Inspired by the Tatooine speeder bikes in Star Wars) :)\u00a0</p><p>(Keep in mind this was made in 3 hours so there might be some bugs)</p>\n<p>I made this entire game in the 3 hours, except for the hit flash effect and screenshake effect, which I took from another one of my projects. (Premade assets are allowed). It wasn't too hard to make considering every object behaves similarly, so there were lots of corners cut. I was going to make a high score system and some sounds, but I ran out of time so you'll just have to remember your scores and there are no sounds. I hope you like it! :)</p>\n<p>Engine: Godot</p>\n<p>Art: Piskel</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T04:34:16", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["djmick254"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
