Part of the reason I made it was to learn about Twine, and the other main part was to take a stab at writing a story that made the player feel like their choices mattered, even if the scope of their effect was relatively small or short-reaching.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-21T03:33:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/022/022e0ed0d45eec0089a75cf43c596dd1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["epiblitikos"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
