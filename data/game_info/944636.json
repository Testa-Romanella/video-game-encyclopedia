While taking shelter, you are chased by a ghost, and try to banish it by performing a ritual with 5 candles.</p>\n<p><strong>Known issues:</strong><br/>After a few seconds of playing, the screen flashes black, not sure why this happens, but it's a very minor issue. The player also tends to get stuck on walls, so please blame the collisions for any deaths near solid objects.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>Move - Click, Click and hold<br/>Select - Click</p><p>(Everything is by me, apart from the audio, which is all free on the site freesound.org)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T11:55:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/799/79948e9ad2bd355d60d8855f9ddb3ec4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Okau"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
