Having received overwhelmingly positive reviews, I'm putting it on here. More download platforms can be found on the Entry Page :)</strong><br/></p><p>Having travelled across London, 1v1-ed in the rain and engaged in intense afternoon of coffee-fuelled coding, I HAVEN'T collapsed in exhaustion but instead present you with this: <br/><br/>'Lovers on a Park Bench' is essentially a typing game following the story of a square, his ex-girlfriend and a series of intense and very-confusing-at-times metaphors and allusions (they're pretty obvious). All of this is topped with narration by award-winning robot voice, Stephen Hawking (or whatever Audacity can do to emulate it). <br/><br/>All instructions are in-game but here they are if you miss them: <br/><br/><strong>Type the red text as it appears. <br/>Attack (becomes enabled half-way through the game): Space / Click <br/>Change Attack: 1,2 <br/>Enable and Disable Narration: F2 <br/></strong><br/>There are 3 possible endings. <br/><br/>And finally, a disclaimer. <br/><br/>DISCLAIMER: I'm only 14 and therefore haven't actually been in a romantic relationship before (life is short); I hope this will be an insight into how opera and television have contorted my view of life in general. Thank you and enjoy :P <br/><br/>Software Used: Unity, Photoshop, Visual Studio, Audacity, SFXR, Kawai CA 95 Keyboard, 2nd Speech Centre, Good Old Notepad ;) <br/><br/>Soundtrack and the 'mysterious' third ending can be found here: https://soundcloud.com/peterthehe/sets/lovers-on-a... <br/><br/>Post-Mortem coming soon but now it's time for some SLEEP &lt;3 </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/510/51062b5caa748eb7c798c5ff03ea4c82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["PetertheHe"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
