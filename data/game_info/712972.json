In defence, I am self taught!</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>dicky</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T07:23:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cdd/cdd770726606bb3003546420ea2b8c87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dickydodds"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
