Along the way, each incarnation also offered BOTH aspects of the sport - wrestling in the ring or \"booking\" behind the scenes in an entirely separate strategy sim. GM modes have become standard in wrestling games since then, but at the time it was bold and risky to \"expose\" the business to this extent. Similarly, the gameplay itself was wild enough to ensure wrestling fans were having more fun than they could find anywhere else - with dozens of characters in the ring at once, along with destructible furniture and weapons! To this day, the game is a permanent fixture on\u00a0<em>YouTube</em>\u00a0where fans continue to share their own highlights.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-25T05:28:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3d/b3d2d0b1fb6c48cb52236739a1b72105.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MDickie"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
