As such, you control this character's left and right movements, bringing chairs to potential supporters as they descend from the doorways near the top of the scene. To progress, you generate \"rapport\" by shaking hands with seated supporters... if you have time to! As you advance in the game, the story of your glorious political career unfolds, taking you from the humble title of Mayor of Philadelphia to international leadership!</p>\n<p>The 2017 version of this game, which includes Achievements and is meant to be played on a touchscreen phone or tablet, is available (for free) in the Google Play store.</p><p>***</p>\n<p>Alright, now that we've got that out of the way, time for me to drop the act and admit that this game is of course a safe-for-work parody of a rather strange \"adult\" game called <em>Beat 'em and Eat 'em</em>, which was published by a company called Mystique in 1982 for the Atari 2600, and featured a premise so bizarre that the only way to do it justice is to watch a\u00a0demo or a review of it. While <em>Greet 'em and Seat 'em</em>'s basic gameplay mechanic is much the same as its x-rated counterpart's, it also has the added \"rapport\" challenge to make things more interesting in lieu of pixelated nudity.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Having it\u00a0begin in Philadelphia with a newspaper called The Daily Flash is a nod to<em> Philly Flasher</em>, a clone of <em>Beat 'em </em>that had different sprites, but was still x-rated. You'd think that if you're going to re-skin a NSFW game you'd make a SFW version to reach other parts of the market... but no, Mistique had apparently found their niche and had no interest in also making a clean version for the kids. So that's where I\u00a0come in, with this tribute to that strange, strange time in the history of video games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-20T03:20:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a8/9a8a87d1cb2f058df1e49b4404c4d11f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AK"], "genres": ["Action", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
