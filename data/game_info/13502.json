THERE IS NO SINGLE PLAYER MODE. YOU WILL NEED CONTROLLERS AND YOU WILL NEED FRIENDS.</strong><br/><br/>MageQuit is a wizard-brawling arena game where up to 10 players use spells and physics to do battle. As a wizard, you are granted a staff with a glowing D20, empowering you with unique elemental spells to battle your opponents. With every kill, your neckbeard and fame grow. Will you end up as Merlin, or be forever cursed with peach fuzz?<br/><br/><br/><br/>MageQuit is a series of skill-based attempts to outsmart your opponent. The spells are dodgeable, so predicting your opponent's aim and movement is crucial, making button-mashing ineffective. One of the best feelings in the game is watching your friend (enemy) walk directly into your well-placed Rockshot and explode into pieces because you guessed right and he or she guessed wrong. And even though your spell aimer is visible to other players, you can secretly apply a curve with your triggers to add an extra element of surprise.<br/><br/>Choose a new spell from 28 available before each round, until you have a full arsenal to destroy your opponents. Harvest the D20s of those you defeat in battle to grow your neckbeard. The wizard with the longest beard after 9 rounds wins!<br/><br/>MageQuit can be played as 2 teams, 3 teams, or free-for-all. Team games present unique challenges, such as pushing an arcane barrier to send the other team off a cliff or scoring a game-winning goal with a giant, flaming puck.7 Stages<br/><strong>The Coffin</strong> - a coffin-shaped island with 2 open sides for falling to your death<br/><strong>The Volcano</strong> - a small island surrounded by rising lava with an active volcano in the middle<br/><strong>The Ruins</strong> - a basic large island surrounded by rising lava<br/><strong>The Sports</strong> - score a goal with the fiery puck and the other team will explode<br/><strong>The Islands</strong> - each player or team gets their own island that will randomly sink<br/><strong>The Tower</strong> - a ring of land surrounds a tower that can be climbed to on vanishing bridges<br/><strong>The Classic</strong> - a basic round island surrounded by rising lavaGame Options<br/><strong>Spell Selection Mode</strong> - Draft (choose after each round) or Random<br/><strong>Health</strong> - High, Medium, or Low<br/><strong>Number of Rounds</strong> - 9, 11, 13, 15, or 17<br/><strong>Stage Selection</strong> - Random or a specific stage<br/><br/>Full Release (Q3/Q4 2017)<br/><br/><strong>Full release will definitely have:</strong><br/><ul><li>Online multiplayer (the community has spoken)<br/></li><li>10 elements: 4 primary + 6 hybrid (steam, spark, sand, grass, lava, ice)<br/></li><li>46+ spells<br/></li><li>10+ stages<br/></li><li>Steam achievements<br/></li><li>Power-ups<br/></li><li>More game options<br/></li><li>OSX and Linux support</li></ul><br/><strong>We are excited to get feedback from the Steam community to prioritize these features:</strong><ul><li>AI<br/></li><li>Co-op campaign<br/></li><li>Unlockable wizards/skins/staffs<br/></li><li>Build Mode (create reusable spell profiles before you play)<br/></li><li>Original Soundtrack</li></ul><br/><br/><br/>MageQuit's gameplay was inspired by a Warcraft 3 mod named Warlock. I always loved playing it with my brothers but felt it could benefit from being a single-screen game with controllers and even more spells. The elemental theme and coffin stage were inspired by the Pro Bending Tournaments from Legend of Korra. The Sports stage was inspired by Rocket League.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T02:40:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b46/b46c990ece1f166757126d195f25e072.jpg", "website": "http://bowlcutstudios.com/sheet.php?p=MageQuit", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 60, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 454, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["Bowlcut Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bowlcut Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
