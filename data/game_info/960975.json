{"id": 960975, "slug": "castle-of-alchemists", "name": "Castle Of Alchemists", "name_original": "Castle Of Alchemists", "description": "Step into the shoes of the alchemically enhanced super soldier, Bellator, in this pulse-pounding tower defense and top-down action hybrid game. As the first of its kind, you are humanity's last hope against invaders trapped within the castle. Strategically set traps, build defensive towers, equip powerful weapons and gear, and reclaim the castle piece by piece in an epic battle for survival. Unlock new abilities, traps and weapons to aid you in your mission to save survivors and gather lost knowledge.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>For centuries, the masters of the Castle of Alchemists have sought the ultimate goal: the Philosopher's Stone. But decades of failure led to impatience and a tragic mistake. In their desperation, they turned to forbidden arts of sorcery to speed up the Magnum Opus, but instead of finding the Philosopher's Stone, they opened portals to unknown elemental realms, unleashing malicious creatures into our world.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Trapped inside the castle's defense systems, both the creatures and the castle's residents must now rely on a brave few - the apprentices and the alchemically enhanced defender, Bellator - to save them from the marauding hordes of the elemental realms. Time is running out as the creatures break free from their entrapment and it's up to you to defend the castle and restore order before it's too late.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>As the alchemically enhanced super soldier, Bellator, you will face a variety of challenges as you level up and arm yourself with an impressive arsenal of weapons and powerful armors. As you progress through the game, you will have the opportunity to discover and unlock new schematics for crafting even more powerful equipment with randomized abilities that will add depth to your gameplay experience.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As the defender of the castle, you will face a diverse array of enemies from different elemental realms. Engage in fiery battles with invaders from the fire realm in the forges, battle against the golems of the Earth realm in the mines, and fight through the halls overrun by ice-realm creatures. Each enemy has its own unique abilities, resistances, and weaknesses, forcing you to adapt your tactics as you progress through the castle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The castle offers a variety of environments and objectives, from preventing invaders from escaping to protecting valuable assets, and saving trapped masters and apprentices. This not only adds depth to the gameplay but also keeps the scenery fresh as you progress through the castle, uncovering new challenges and dangers at every turn.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Build defensive towers to house semi-automatic ballistas, revolving cannons, and steam-powered mounted gatling guns. Set deadly traps such as spikes, flame pillars, acid showers, and rotating-dart throwers to slow down and eliminate your enemies. As you progress through the game, you will unlock upgrades and new versions of your defenses. For example, you can enhance your cannons to add a spin to cannonballs, making them ricochet from the ground with an extended range. Or coat your spikes with poison that also slows down the invaders.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The key to success is to use the synergy of traps and your abilities. Expand the range of your electric turret by planting it in the midst of other metal traps, and if they are coming in large numbers and fast, wet them with showers of water and freeze them with ammonium-nitrate vials. Discover and unlock many more combos using traps and abilities together to maximize your defenses and keep the castle safe.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-19T04:43:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d05/d050ccea1bc7005246f27903683bd2eb.jpg", "website": "https://twitter.com/TeamMachiavelli", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 388, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team Machiavelli"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["IndieArk", "Catoptric Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
