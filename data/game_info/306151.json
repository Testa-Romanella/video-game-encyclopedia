The object of this bite-sized educational project is to allow amazing facts to be delivered in an immersive VR experience, with a focus on our Titanosaur \u2013 Argentinosaurus.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe love to innovate. In developing interactive installations for visitor centres, museums and galleries we always aim to bring original concepts to life in new ways. This project blends the simple concept of dinosaur interaction with a friendly, highly detailed 3D mesh model, animating realistically and adjusting it\u2019s poses based on the player\u2019s actions \u2013 all delivered using an HTC Vive at room scale.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs a result the team has delivered a memorable VR experience blending incredible facts with moments of surprise and delight.  In addition, running on an HTC Vive allows participants to move around the prehistoric landscape and inspect this Titanosaur up close using \u2018dash\u2019 teleport.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSir David Attenborough launched this experience last year at York Museum as part of their Yorkshire\u2019s Jurassic World exhibition and now for the first time it has been released for VR arcade and educational use.  It is the ideal introduction to VR for first time VR arcade users.  The experience is around five minutes in length.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u201cTremendous\u2026    I imagine every child for miles around will want to see it!\u201d<br/>\r\nSir David Attenborough.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe have tried to price the experience at a level which makes great sense to arcade businesses and to encourage as wide an uptake as possible.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f60/f60c8c5ebc85b6cb04303135d025b0fd.jpg", "website": "https://immotion.co.uk/experiences", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 249, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Immotion Studios"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Immotion Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
