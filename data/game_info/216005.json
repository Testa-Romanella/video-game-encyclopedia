Instead, you use the left and right arrow keys to rotate the camera by 90\u00b0.</p><p>Default Controls (configurable before launching the game) :</p><p>ZQSD : Move</p><p>Left and Right Arrow : Move Camera</p><p>Space : Shoot<br/></p>\n<p>This game is unfinished, because I didn't have ideas that would fit the camera constraints and I know too little about Unity to make significant progress. Moreover, the \"game\" is ugly. I'm sorry I'm not much of an artist so I can't produce assets fast enough.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e09/e09e6468070c8bf6de278c78d47326c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KuroAno"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
