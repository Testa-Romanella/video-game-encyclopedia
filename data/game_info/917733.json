Enjoy the calm surroundings of the Humble Lake, catch a variety of fish types using different baits and sell your fish to Curtis at the bait shop!\r\n<br/><br/>\n<ul>\n<li>Arcade style fishing</li>\n<li>Easy to learn</li>\n<li>Supports online play</li>\n<li>4 fish types to catch</li>\n<li>Clothing to purchase and unlock</li>\n<li>Relaxing atmosphere</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\r\nCold Fish is SmolBrainGames' first project and bugs are anticipated. If you find any bugs that inhibit gameplay or cause annoyance, please share a bug report on itch.io or you can email support[at]smolbraingames.com!\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nCold Fish is currently in an alpha stage and contains some bare bones content for you to enjoy. Some features may be placeholder or unfinished.\r\n<br/><br/>\n<strong>Gameplay</strong><br/><br/>\r\nIn Cold Fish, your objective is to catch fish and sell them to the bait shop. In doing so, you'll earn money which you can use to purchase clothes, bait and new equipment*. Different baits and depths will attract\r\ndifferent fish. Different fishing rods are capable of catching heavier fish. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nWhen a fish is attracted to your bait, it will bite. This will trigger an arcade style fishing mini game. To successfully catch the fish, a menu will appear. Use the box in the left sidebar to track and keep the \r\nfish indicator inside of it. In doing so, the progress bar will fill up and you will catch the fish! Heavier fish will be more difficult to track, smaller lighter fish will be easier to catch. If the bar fully depletes,\r\nyou have a small window to recover. If you fail to recover, you will fail the minigame and the fish will have escaped.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nIf you use a bait that fishes are not attracted to, possibly because of your depth or time of day, fishes may inspect your bait but will not take it. In this case, you can re-use the bait and continue fishing.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nAs soon as you begin fishing, one type of bait is activated and used. You can select what bait to use by pressing your \"I\" key to open your inventory. You can also change this whilst fishing, however it will destroy whatever\r\nbait was on your line. You can choose \"stop fishing\" to prevent anymore bait from being used after you have hooked or lost a fish.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n* There isn't a huge amount of content yet!\r\n<br/><br/>\n<strong>Online Gameplay</strong><br/><br/>\r\nCold Fish supports basic online play at this time. You can create and allow other players to join your game. Online play currently supports the synchronization of your fishing state, trophies you catch, clothing, equipment\r\nand emotes. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nOnline play is only available if the SBG relay service is online. No promises can be made as to the availability of this service, though every effort will be made to support the online feature for the foreseeable future. LAN and dedicated\r\nservers are unsupported.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nIf there are multiple versions of Cold Fish available, make sure that you and your friends are using the same version. The game will try to prevent you from joining incorrect versions.\r\n<br/><br/>\n<strong>Key Bindings</strong><br/><br/>\r\nUnfortunately it is not possible to modify keybinds, this is on the to-do list now that the first release is completed.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nPause Menu: ESC (escape)<br/>\r\nInventory: I<br/>\r\nDrill Hole: F<br/>\r\nMain Action Key: F<br/>\r\nMovement: WASD or Arrow Keys<br/>\r\nCamera Free Rotation: Right Mouse or Left/Right ALT Key<br/>\r\nFree Mouse Movement: Left or Right CTRL (control)<br/>\r\nFirst Person Walking: C\r\n<br/><br/>\n<strong>Fish Reeling Controls</strong><br/><br/>\r\nNote that you only have control over RAISING the hook box.
