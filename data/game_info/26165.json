Their bodies are made up of eight \n      sections, each featuring a distinctive diamond-shaped tail. The sound of \n      a Beatnes can vary wildly depending on which segment of the body is \n      tapped. However, all of the sounds closely resemble the short-wave and \n      triangular-wave sound effects from a Nintendo Entertainment System sound \n      chip. When Beatnes are tapped in time with a rhythm, they continue to \n      repeat the sounds in perfect time for a short period.\n    </p><p>\n      More Electroplankton Games!\n    </p><ul>\n<li>\n        Electroplankton \n        Trapy\n      </li>\n<li>\n        Electroplankton \n        Hanenbow\n      </li>\n<li>\n        Electroplankton \n        Rec-Rec\n      </li>\n<li>\n        Electroplankton \n        Nanocarp\n      </li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4e/e4ee38fd889356cfaffae82f6e7238f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
