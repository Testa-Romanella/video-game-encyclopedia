{"id": 112043, "slug": "end-of-days-itch", "name": "End of Days (itch)", "name_original": "End of Days (itch)", "description": "<p>End of Days is an open world VR zombie survival game. End of Days is heavily inspired by the hit Nazi Zombies and other zombie titles such as Left 4 Dead, Dead Rising, and The Walking Dead.</p>\n<p>End of Days aims to be an online multiplayer experience set up similarly to Nazi zombies, but with as much freedom and shenanigans as Dead Rising. Another trait the game aims for is to be able to interact with almost everything the way you would in the real world. For example, all weapons in the game are manually operated. You must load magazines, pull back slides, add attachments, craft weapons/items, and pilot rc drones with your own hands all while making sure you don't get torn to shreds by the hordes of zombies on your trail.</p>\r\nPlanned features (not sorted in priority)\r\n<ul><li>More weapons</li><li>Drones</li><li>Perks and power ups</li><li>Traps</li><li>Craftables</li><li>More Zombies!
