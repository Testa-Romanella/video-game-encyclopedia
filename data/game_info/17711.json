You can even render out your animation as an image sequence (and an MP4 file soon)!<br/><br/>If you're not too great at animation, you can still pose objects, characters, add particles and lights, and more, and render out cool stills or backgrounds!<br/><br/>With Steam Workshop support, you can even add your own content, whether that be weapons, props, characters, or even entire scenes!<br/><br/>With the addition of Live Recording, Pose Blending, and Collada DAE export, you can even use it as a quick-pose tool for your favorite 3D software!<br/><br/>Video tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7GBs1QsuR23D0Lm6mxP_SZJaZ-LyOwZt<br/>Content Creation tutorial: http://www.virtuanimator.com/create-content/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cee/cee84f282fe9313019ded9f6bf6c147c.jpg", "website": "http://www.virtuanimator.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 102}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pheonise"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Pheonise"], "esrb_rating": null}
