It is a small puzzle game featuring a golf ball and the goal is to get it to the flag in every level. The twist is that you can only move by 1,2,3,4, or 5 spaces, and you can only use each number once per level. Avoid obstacles, pick up power-ups, and golf your way to a win!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T08:22:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/353/35339b74066bfb37cf26519b660d7f91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Percy"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
