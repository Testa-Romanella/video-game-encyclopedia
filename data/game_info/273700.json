The original version\u00a0is available in the download section below.</p>\n<p>Your boss wants you to fire people by giving out pink slips to employees in the company. Their sacrifices must be made for the sake of the company but most importantly, for the sake of your boss.</p>\n<p>There are only 8 levels in the game and it should take at least 10 minutes to complete.</p>\n<p>The UI and the text box is a bit buggy and weird but hopefully everything is alright. =)</p>\n<p>I recommend playing this game in a 16:9 aspect ratio and lowering the volume a little bit when the sound eventually comes on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll need the mouse to click on profiles and switch through pink slips. You\u2019ll need a keyboard to type in the numbers.</p>\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/shulolololololo</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c8/4c89561926ca0b21729c8f5f429ec52b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["shulololo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
