So in with the new and out with the old ya know? Time for Blinky's Adventure 2: The sequel to the neveragame! Comes with a fresh coat of paint to the game's mid graphics to make them ten times as better (and a little bit more retro), but also comes with actual music and sfx for a blinky game! Holy cow! This is merely a demo though, there may be more to come in the future..</p>\n<p>Controls -</p>\n<p>Arrow keys - move</p>\n<p>Z - Jump</p>\n<p>Shift - Run</p><p>Trailer -\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T18:21:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43f/43f4fc0abb82f9f4239058033d017785.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ScruffTuna"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
