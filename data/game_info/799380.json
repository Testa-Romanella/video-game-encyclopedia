Upgrade his armour and weapons as you battle through the streets, encountering new scenarios and enemies. Some of these will only appear when playing with the Powdermaster, whereas others are added as global content, for any future playthroughs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Powdermaster must be chosen as a solo starter character, who must survive the entire duration of a campaign, but you can still recruit additional party members along the way!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis character has a unique hero ability; mixing powder cards. When you have powder cards in your hand (Red, Pink, Yellow or Black), you can discard them to gain stacks of 'Boom' - a new status effect specific to the Powdermaster! Pro tip: you'll gain more Boom for discarding powders of more than one colour.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Powdermaster's Grenade deals stacks of Boom as damage - racking up some crazy numbers - and many of his Talents use this status in various interesting ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's in this DLC?<br/>\n\u00a0\n<ul>\n<li>A new unique Hero Character!</li>\n<li>New cards including 10 Powdermaster Talents.</li>\n<li>3 new Enemies!</li>\n<li>7 new Scenarios!</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-10T18:27:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a4/7a4b612b522946212088d29d47a7dee8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 248, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MonteBearo"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Maple Whispering", "Goblinz Publishing"], "esrb_rating": null}
