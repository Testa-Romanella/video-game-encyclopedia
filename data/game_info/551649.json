It's intended to provide TF2 at it's best, in full modern VR with motion controls while preserving TF2's carefully designed gameplay as much as possible.</p>\n<p>Currently, we haven't been able to get multiplayer to work yet but we have Full VR, motion controls and all the official TF2 maps ready for you to explore on your own! You can even explore beloved community maps like dm_mariokart by just dropping them into the maps folder!</p>\n<p>More info on completed and planned features can be found here:\u00a0https://github.com/PinkMilkProductions/VirtualFortress2/projects/1</p>\n<p>The game runs on Windows and is made with SteamVR so every VR headset should be supported. The motion controller bindings have only been configured for Oculus touch so far but other motion controllers should be able to move and look around. Because this is SteamVR, you should be able to edit the bindings yourself if they don't yet work for your controllers.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone is welcome to discuss the mod and it's development on the mod's discord server:\u00a0discord.gg/umdcscvqnu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T10:43:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb6/eb6828b1e761c2c04982473439e3f468.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 235, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PinkMilkProductions"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
