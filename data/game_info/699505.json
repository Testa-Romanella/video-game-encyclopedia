Bloodthirsty monsters, divine creatures and epic boss battles. The game\u2019s story is shaped by \u00a0choices that will define your journey.</p>\n<p>We have created an open, immersive world - a beautifully designed environment, <strong>hand-drawn frame-by-frame animation</strong>.</p>\n<p>The musical accompaniment of the game varies from classic instrumental music to progressive metal.</p>\n<p>He called to me and I answered the call. I could not do otherwise. The fused will of a dying world - the mighty force \"Essence\" overcoming the barrier of life and death carried me into the maelstrom of time and space.<br/></p>\n<p>- The Chronicles of Ericona.</p>\n<p>No one remembers how it all began, no one can tell how it will end - a dying world at the dawn of change. He proclaimed himself God, creator of heaven and earth, of ight and darkness. \u00a0He proclaimed judgment in the name of light, making it his will. The reason for this was his desire to live forever. Where there is light there must be shadow, but who would remind him of that?</p>\n<p>It is ironic and at the same time strange to realise that this is the end. Or maybe he was wrong and his sick mind will release fear, with the advent of the Dark Ages, no one could have guessed it. But the outcome was a foregone conclusion... Fear had taken over the world, becoming monstrous creatures in the flesh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Optional:\u00a0</strong>\u00a0send bug report on\u00a0 this e-mail\u00a0 or Discord channel *bug-report</p>\n<p><strong>70strike.games@gmail.com\u00a0</strong>, let`s make a Skelethrone better !!!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Share this post in your social pages, you really will help\u00a0 us to tell about our game!!
