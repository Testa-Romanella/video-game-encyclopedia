Made by Kaitlyn Schmidt and Isabelle \"Mint\" Gould.</p><p>Run your town's food-based reactors for a day! The theme for this jam was \"out of control\", which quickly led to two things; reactors and not controlling something about reactors.</p><p>After some iteration, we opted to go with not controlling the inflow of resources. You need to make the call when to open up reactors, and how to distribute your resources. Don't let your hand fill up, don't let any reactors bottom out, and don't let 'em overload either!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T07:58:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71d/71de4b192c343a0569f5cd0211bb486b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["WispyMouse"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
