He'll bring the ball back most of the time but sometimes he's a jerk and he'll just wait for you to come get it. </p><p>Left and right to walk. Hold down spacebar to charge a throw, then release and cross your fingers that Harry actually brings the ball back. Escape to quit once you're fed up with him.</p><p>I haven't tested the Windows build so let me know if you find anything broken.</p><p>Music kindly contributed by Dylan Burns, who jammed it up really quickly for me. Sound effects are my own fault, however.</p><p><em>(In 2017 I am challenging myself to make 50 little videogames to get more familiar with the tools. I make no guarantee then any of the games are good, but that's not really the point. This is game #2 or 50.)</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f88/f881f32cf27272fe47c5d9b51dab4f20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Brendan Keogh"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
