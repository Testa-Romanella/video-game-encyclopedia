{"id": 118147, "slug": "minimal-input", "name": "Minimal Input", "name_original": "Minimal Input", "description": "<p>In Minimal Input, you play Baby, a child that can only answer \"Yap\" or \"Neh\".\u00a0  In the first scene, your limited input allows you to drive the dialogue without choosing how things unfold (64 different outcomes). In the second, you have an interactive dialogue where you have less control on the direction of the conversation, but more visibility. In the third, your input has (almost) no bearing on the dialogue, and you see clearly where things are going.\u00a0 (Play time: 15 minutes tops?)<br/></p>\n<p>This little game was made over a period of 7 days for the 3rd Minimalistic Jam, using 3 colors, and reducing the input dialogues to the bare minimum. It's mostly an exploration of that constraint. All aspects of the game (art, script, filthy code) are my own.\u00a0 The code was written using WebStory Engine. <br/></p>\n<p>\u2699\ufe0f The final version of this game may include different sets of parents (two moms, two dads). Maybe hands for the psychologist, faces for the dad, blinking eyes and moving mouths, or light music and sound effects. The original script has been cut in half, but I don't think I'll ever make the other half. We'll see.<br/></p>\n<p>\u26a0\ufe0f The dialogue may mention possible child and animal abuse. Much like the rest of the game, it is a way to show how adults can (and do) ignore children's words, talk over them and for them. <br/><br/>\u26a0\ufe0f I unknowingly mix british and american english, and I almost certainly left a lot of typos and monstrous grammatical errors in the script. Please, be ruthless and tell me about it all!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3d/a3d68e096de2e8993e9d8935534d789e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dja_Redona"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
