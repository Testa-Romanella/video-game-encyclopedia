Get Out. <br/></p>\n<p>Try not to die. <br/></p>\n<p>Tesseract quest is a rogue-like adventure with ASCII graphics, designed to be completable in a single play session. <br/></p>\n<p>This is a low complexity rogue-like with few keys to remember. If you find the genre intimidating, it may be a good place to start. <br/></p>\n<p>You will need to explore a procedurally generated dungeon, fighting your way through hordes of monsters and searching for treasure and better equipment on the way. Learn which monsters are more dangerous and develop your own tactics to manage risk. <br/></p>\n<p>There is little to no story in this game, it is a dungeon crawler in the traditions of Rogue and Moria. <br/></p>\n<p>With credit to the rot.js toolkit by Ond\u0159ej \u017d\u00e1ra</p>\n<p>Press '?' after starting the game for a help screen.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T07:20:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a0/5a0690fbe5a88e9ae3269d055041e6ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["coelocanth"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
