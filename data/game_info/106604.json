It never quite reached version 1.0 and I stopped development in 2009. As it's playable, I'm putting it out there, just be aware of the rough graphics and interface.</p>\n<p>Ataxia II is inspired by Julian Gollop's <em>Chaos</em>. Up to 8 human or AI-controlled players take it in turns to cast spells (some of which summon monsters) to try and kill the other wizards. As you cast spells, the game board board becomes saturated with Law or Chaos, which effects the casting chance of aligned spells.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4c/c4c4c096bad48ea2ba85e14556b2c31e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Marasmusine"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
