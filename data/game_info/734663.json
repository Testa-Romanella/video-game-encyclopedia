{"id": 734663, "slug": "demon-king-chronicle", "name": "Demon King Chronicle", "name_original": "Demon King Chronicle", "description": "<p>Demon King Chronicle is a freeware RPG first released in Japanese on August 19, 2007. An English version was translated and released on April 19, 2013, six years later, on Playism. </p>\n<p>Despite being an RPG, Demon King Chronicle shares a number of aspects with Ai To Yuuki To Kashi Wa Mochi, (Love, Courage, and Leaf-Wrapped Rice Cake; it has an iPhone version in English), Ai To Yuuki To Kashi Wa Mochi Kai (Love, Courage, and Leaf-Wrapped Rice Cake: Unexpected Meeting; no English translation that I&#39;m aware of) and Irisu Syndrome (has an English fan translation patch), puzzle games that share some of the same staff. In all four cases, the plot is revealed only incrementally, not all aspects of the world are ever fully answered, and things sometimes get deeply, deeply surreal.</p>\n<p>(Just don&#39;t look up anything else about it first. It&#39;s best played when it&#39;s still a bit of a surprise. And keep an eye on the game directory, txt files pop up every so often and they&#39;re important! ...okay, enough advertising for an entirely different game. I&#39;m advertising this one right now.)</p>\n<p>Source: https://lparchive.org/Demon-King-Chronicle/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2007-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-05T21:26:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6c/b6c06f39cb8bf74d1655dc5b8e768f37.jpg", "website": "https://archive.org/details/demon-king-chronicle", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
