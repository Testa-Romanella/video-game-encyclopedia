The project scope was kept small and manageable by focussing on one aspect \u2013 the art style \u2013 coming up with something that is unique or less common in video games and using this aspect to also relate to the source material, the book released in 1926.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\tGameplay and Art Style \u2013 Main influences include games released in the 90s that used pre-rendered or painted backgrounds, assets and environments. Game design such as Final Fantasy 7\u2019s Level Maps\u00a0and Digimon world\u2019s with Pick up items, are directly relatable to the design of this game. Movement was based on Resident Evil 3\u2019s third person navigation, allowing the player to get a sense of depth when essentially playing on a flat background. Resident evil added depth by creating foreground and mid ground environment assets, also adding to the immersion, similar to elements in in the level design of this game.\u00a0The world map is like a playable menu, rather than automatically travelling between levels, the player can navigate to each location with freedom with no other objective.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\tFor testing and feedback purposes, the narrative is set by a simple quest structure to tell a story \u2013 this replaces the lack of voice acting and cutscenes whilst keeping it simple.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Future plans include; integration of other main characters, creating remaining locations with unique quests, adding original story segments from the book and developing fun and enjoyable mechanics.\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T14:14:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/014/0147084ff4503a78baa3eba42c3a0c46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["omziGizmo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
