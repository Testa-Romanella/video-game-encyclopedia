{"id": 138657, "slug": "the-amazing-super-star-vigilante-squad", "name": "The Amazing Super Star Vigilante Squad", "name_original": "The Amazing Super Star Vigilante Squad", "description": "<p> In the dawn of an economic depression, three broke, jobless friends form a vigilante group designed to do what the police can't do... kick butt! Armed with out-of-date weaponry and a sense of humor, the 'Squad' makes it their job to save the day! This is a short game that spans around 30 minutes (or less) and takes the player on three different, non-linear 'cases'. This game is infused with humor, action, and story telling in an attempt to make a game for everyone. As I stated before, this game is nonlinear so there will be different choices, some that slightly influence the ending while others offer you different ways of completing a certain case. </p><p> The action is that of a standard RPG enhanced by a few plugins and each case is a unique crime almost always with a twist and entails many choices throughout making each gameplay experience at least slightly different from the last.<br/> This is my second game so I would definitely appreciate constructive feedback as I know this game isn't perfect. If there are any issues with the game, like bugs, glitches, spelling, or gameplay errors, feel free to tell me! </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af3/af395a22c4bd6c0d3888f28aeafa5dc1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dosaaaa"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
