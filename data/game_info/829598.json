My personal favorites are:</p>\n<ul><li>If all of your units die, you need to Alt+F4 to retry.</li><li>There is no official means of winning. Your goal is to reach the <strong>Data Center</strong> building on the far side of the map and energize it.</li><li>I didn't have time for navigation code. So I invested in command queueing for giving players control over unit pathing then made the floor \"lava\".</li><li>No audio :/</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Mouse Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Mouse on edges of screen to pan camera<br/>\n</li><li>LMB to select single</li><li>LMB + drag to select area</li><li>Double Click to select all units of type in viewport</li><li>LEFT SHIFT + click to toggle unit select</li><li>LEFT SHIFT + click to queue commands (move / build / etc.)</li><li>RMB / Escape to command selected units (move / build / etc.)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Keyboard Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD / Arrows to pan camera</li><li>X to stop unit motion</li><li>1 / 2 / 3 are the allowed actions which vary by current unit selection</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Mechanics to know</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Everything costs ENERGY. Most notably: building units +\u00a0attacking.</li><li>Drones can manually move energy around.</li><li>Krags are your only combat unit.</li><li>Flux Relays will automatically transfer energy.</li><li>Energy Sources take time to recharge; spend wisely.</li><li>You can't heal your units :( But you can give them energy.</li><li>The green \"lava\" will hurt your units because navigation didn't make the game's budget.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Known Bugs</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Can build on top of existing objects</li><li>Disposing of a hologram will dispose of all holograms and not just the selected one (only in the web build)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T11:12:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a1/2a18f5b179eb44ec02b373b3a444655d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AriNeonShark"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
