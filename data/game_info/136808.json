The goal is too dislodge the poor souls sacrificed too the fire god in the mountain, but beware, the army, cops, ninjas that can float and superheroes will try too protect these people. The god has given you his balls that has the power too dissolve rock, but should any of these balls touch the lava or any hostile obstacle, you loose a bit of your soul. Also, the balls procreate and sometimes release themselves so time is of the essence. Now, I'm flying blind when it comes too Apple apps and Linux but I exported and Zipped them up for all three. My machine is a PC so please let me know if the game works for the other two machines.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abe/abe47e168c0d34e6331cf089b77698c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["murderedcarrotproductions"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
