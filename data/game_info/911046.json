You have only 10 days to assemble and deliver a Compliance Machine that is better than those assembled by the other people participating in the process.</p>\n<p>Each day you will receive resources that will allow you to move through the structure of the company, seeking help from the compliance teams to implement the different components of the machine. Resources that are not used for the assembly of compliance machines can be diverted and lost to fraud, which will end up disrupting the assembly process, as they will take time and resources from the compliance teams that help you, as these teams will be busy dealing with with problems in the routine of the company. Good luck!\r\n  </p>\n<p>COMPLIANCE INC. is a component collection game that simulates the implementation of a compliance program in a fictitious company.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T15:06:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebf/ebfb3b7a16f31e8e5dd25b14d39ea22c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ComplianceBoardGame"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
