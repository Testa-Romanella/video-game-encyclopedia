The most lovely place to watch oozes oozing and doing what oozes do best. Throw coins out to help your oozes grow. Be patient. Oozes live life at a different pace than you and I.</p>\n<p>Occasionally an ooze may bring you a gift that it finds during its travels.</p>\n<p>The way to think of Ooze Meadow is a atmospheric nature cam that you can have on while you gather with friends, drink hot cocoa by torchlight and play an RPG campaign while the oozes clean the cave floor in the background. <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>** a note on the controls **</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>Escape and spacebar quit the game. Once in the meadow, there is a single button on the bottom left of the screen that can be used to drop gold coins.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a7/0a75fe7a860f1e1300804a7e540d3faf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Tartle Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
