That's where you come in: someone's gotta clean it all up. Use your ship's magnetic field to attract junk and haul it to the disposal unit. For dangerous junk \u2014 you'll know it's dangerous because it's glowing red \u2014 use your repulsor field and/or magnetic field to ease it down to a safe velocity, then bring it in. The clock's ticking, but you'll get extra time for hauling in the big stuff. Which is good because there's no weight in space, but there is still mass, and big stuff means more of it. Just watch out \u2014 one wrong move and someone else will have to clean up what's left of you!<br/><br/>ATTRACT junk to attach it to your ship.<br/><br/><br/>SLOW bad (red) junk until it's safe to capture.<br/><br/><br/>DELIVER junk to the disposal unit for points and time.<br/><br/><br/>BIG junk means BIG risk, but also BIG rewards!<br/><br/><br/>Graphics, music, sound, and programming originally for the 2021 GMTK Game Jam, then updated to version 1.1 for Steam release!<br/><br/>A controller is recommended for best gameplay experience!
