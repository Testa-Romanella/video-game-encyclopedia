The game is about a girl who dyes her hair for picture day and her old-fashioned immigrant mother disapproves this decision. Thus, the girl runs away from her mother who chases her in their neighborhood. <em>No Time To Dye</em> is a unique\u00a0endless runner game featuring\u00a02D character sprites and a 3D interactable environment. Watch out for the fire hydrants and look before you cross!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T21:40:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33b/33b75679df6e735ac30a8684bfe1dc9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fablefox5", "QuarterCircle", "FrankSilantro", "apostoljane"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
