Only one pacemaker remains in this world and it's yours!<br/></p>\n<p>Without battery, your pacemaker won't last long, hurry and go find some cells! <br/></p>\n<p>Beware of all the mutants wanting to steal your pacemaker. Protect it by all means! (but with your old age, it would be wise not to attack)</p>\n\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>X or Mouse Click : Attack</p>\n<p>A or Space Bar : Dodge</p>\n<p>Joystick or Arrows keys : Move<br/></p>\n<p>You have a stamina gauge on the top left of the screen. This gauge decreases with time, when you dodge and when the enemies hit you. If this gauge falls to 0, you lose. (but you can try again! :D)</p>\n<p>To refill your stamina, you have to pick the small and big cells spawning sometimes on the ground. <br/></p><p>The enemies also have a stamina gauge decreasing over time and when they attack you. Use this to your advantage.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Made in a 48 hours period for the ENJAM (theme \"Do not Attack!\")</p>\n\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<p>Programmers : <br/>Rapha\u00ebl Bailly<br/> Antonin Demeilliez (@tabasscore)\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Artists: <br/>Julie Heugue : http://julieheugue.com<br/> Danton Slip : http://dantonslip.com<br/></p>\n<p>Sound Design:<br/>Anize Amestoy : https://soundcloud.com/anize-amestoy<br/></p>\n<p>Game Designer: <br/>Tha\u00efs Arias</p>\n<p>Producers: <br/>Victor Cottineau<br/> William D\u00e9sert</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa7/aa7659073aaa44b779d1930c62d760f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["TheFuel", "DantonSlip", "Wolfangar", "Anize", "THAIS ARIAS", "Victor Cottineau", "tabass", "Jutruc"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
