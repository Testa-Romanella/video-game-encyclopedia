(Very specific and nobody will understand but IDK what to say)</p>\n<p>Tower Defence games are amazing when it comes to strategy. The level of knowledge of different\u00a0towers and their strengths and weaknesses is great and all but why can't we have full control over our towers. For starters, in real life they don't have infinite ammo. And they also don't have solid, set in stone upgrades either. So meet KMA, a a\u00a0Tower Defense game where YOU make the towers!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-14T04:22:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c26/c262b2117800b4800e19040aaf308891.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["IceGod9001"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
