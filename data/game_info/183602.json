Use the space bar to eat a second helping and try to avoid your parents eyesight or else you will be caught and have to start over! Beat the first five levels to win the game and satiate Bill's hunger!<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you for playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b4/6b43f66550865eb132d355a9186ed500.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Genyie"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
