By going to a central flower the bee collects pollen that they can use to either heal their other flowers or shoot at ants to kill them. The player needs to travel back and forth to collect pollen and check on their flowers to protect them from the ants. The ant invasion doesn\u2019t stop until all the flowers are destroyed. <br/></p>\n<p>~ The Development Team ~<br/></p>\n<p>Cameron Nodrick - General Artist / 3D Environment Artist <br/></p>\n<p>Cole Fuller - VFX / 3D Character Artist<br/></p>\n<p>Felipe\u00a0 Holanda - Gameplay Programming / Design</p>\n<p>Frank Xu - Design / UI Programming<br/></p>\n<p>Juan Carrillo - Tech Art / Design <br/></p>\n<p>Sean Lynch - Project Manager / UI Programming</p>\n<p>Zayle Radomi - 3D Artist / Gameplay Programming </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T18:24:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07a/07aae43560fb4f3f76fcec77b8a38223.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sean Lynch", "Philisoft Studio", "Zayle", "Frank Zihao Xu"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
