There are 100 different clouds to look for and the game is playable in two game modes, \u00a0singleplayer and multiplayer (2 players).</p>\r\nGame Modes\r\n<p><strong>Singleplayer -\u00a0</strong>In this mode, play against your own highscore and try to find as many clouds as you can without striking out. The name of a random object will appear at the top of the screen. You need to find the cloud in the shape of that object and drag it to the left or right side of the screen to earn a point. If you drag the wrong cloud to either side of the screen, you will get a strike. If the requested cloud floats off the screen before you find it, you will get a strike. Get three strikes and it's game over. Keep playing to better your highscore.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiplayer (2 Players) -\u00a0</strong>In this mode, you will play against your friend to see who can find the requested cloud first. Like the singleplayer mode, the name of a random object will appear at the top of the screen. You will need to find the cloud in the shape of that object before your friend does. Player 1 will need to drag it to the left side of the screen to earn a point and Player 2 will need to drag it to the right side to do the same. The first player to 5, 10, or 15 points, depending on what you chose before the game, wins the game.<br/></p>\r\nImportant Info\r\n<p>It's recommended to download from the Google Play Store for a smaller file size.</p>\n<p>Android version requires Android OS 4.1 or Higher.</p>\n<p>Multiplayer works only on phones with Multi-touch support (2 touches).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T19:47:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f07/f07c7a4316c4454baf83d4fffad698b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Claudio Vertemara"], "genres": ["Action", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
