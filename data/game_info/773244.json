Tirk Baron and the crew at Polyanna Video invite you down a rabbit hole of sprawling colorful landscapes and twisted nightmare realms that bend the boundaries between 8-bit and 64-bit sensibilities. The priestess  Flower Momogami must run, jump, and utilize an array of holy weaponry to overcome the demons that lurk every corner during the\u00a0 invasion of Tenryu, in the first chapter of this tale of Japanese-style horror.</p>\n<p>Only challenge the road ahead if you dare!</p>\n<p>WARNING:<br/>Game might be pretty buggy at the moment but its still perfectly playable from beginning to end on my end.</p>\n<p>There is currently no way to close the game outside of the taskbar or toolbar</p>\n<p>There is no way to save the game, but there is a stage select to make up for it.</p>\n<p>Menus can only be navigated with mouse for now.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls (360 pad):</p>\n<p>A: Jump</p>\n<p>X: Melee attack (Press up or down for other attacks on the ground or the air)<br/></p>\n<p>B: Hana Card (Press up or down to utilize other weapons you may find in the game)<br/></p>\n<p>Y: Item Crash</p>\n\n<p>Game by Tirk Baron aka tirkaroKujo</p>\n<p>Music by:\r\n</p>\n<p>Oth_Radar\r\n</p>\n<p>Pandora's Bread\r\n</p>\n<p>Additional enemy graphics by:\r\n</p>\n<p>juneflowa <br/></p>\n<p>DryChris</p>\n\n<p>Keep up with development on more titles at:<br/></p>\n<p>Twitter: https://twitter.com/frogkaro<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T12:46:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e42/e4254f89f814593b7e2ee24a8f389810.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 210, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tirkaroKujo"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
