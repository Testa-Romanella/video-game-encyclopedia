Compete with up to four players locally at once . Play as your favorite Holiday character and help their team prove once and for all which is the best holiday and take the Holiday Throne. <br/><br/><strong>THE TITULAR HOOK</strong><br/>The hook is the main tool in your arsenal, you can use it to quickly move around the map, grab items from afar and even grabbing your enemies. Each character has their own signature hook making sure they stand out in any brawl.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>WEIGHTS</strong><br/>Weight is a very important part of mastering your hook technique, when hooking lighter objects, or characters, they get pulled towards you. Hooking heavier objects, such as walls or cars, will cause you to move towards them instead <strong>BUT</strong> beware hooking heavier players doesn't seem to work very well and often it just makes them angrier.<br/>Weight can be gained by either hooking/eating food or smaller players.<br/><br/><strong>ITEMS</strong><br/>Items can be very helpful in your fight, they spawn around the map and come in two forms. Food can be eaten to gain weight and can't be hooked from a distance, while throwables can be used against other players to cause them to puke and lose weight.<br/><br/><strong>Abilities</strong><br/>Each character brings a unique magical ability to the table, use it to complement your hooking skills and get the upper hand in any encounter. So learn and try to remember each character's ability so you're not surprised when you see Frosty zipping around the map, or fall tempted by The Leprechaun's pile of gold.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-03T18:12:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ac/2ac9e1c55eb4526931d259c97cb18889.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spawn Point Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Spawn Point Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
