Maximum of three colours used on each sprite, No shaders, particle effects or anything like that.</p>\n<p>I didn't get to use the whole time we had because of work, booo!</p>\n<p><strong>\"Features\"</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Randomly generated seeds for layouts, bomb count powerup and bomb chain powerup, bombs blow up when hit by explosions</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Player 1:\u00a0Arrow keys and control to drop a bomb</p>\n<p>Player 2:\u00a0WASD and space to drop a bomb</p>\n<p><strong>Known bugs and problems</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Due to the entirely random nature of the game, it should be possible to have a seed without any powerups, but the odds are heavily stacked against it, there's roughly a 20% chance for each block to spawn either one of two power ups or nothing.</p>\n<p><strong>Updates</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I will continue working on this, it was fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/414/414c77b290e5282197c6149165197e60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DilapidatedMeow"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
