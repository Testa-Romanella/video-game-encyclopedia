Hitting them with any\u00a0</p>\n<p>other part of the ship will produce splatter sound and will yield zero points.</p>\n<p>Remember to shoot the FLASHING buildings in order to get crowds to come out!</p>\n<p>The key is in keeping the height at the neck level, it may take some practice. The sound clip player on contact will hint at which body part is cut.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n<p>PS: H.A.R.V.E.S.T. is a cutting-edge technology but is not meant to be driven by idiots,</p>\n<p>if you run your nose into a building you will die!</p>\n<p>### CREDITS</p>\n<p>Krafter - programming, 3d models, game design</p>\n<p>Orb - concept art, textures, game design</p>\n<p>Sounds:</p>\n<p>Listed below are freesound.org website users who authored the sounds used:</p>\n<p>Erdie</p>\n<p>Belthazarus</p>\n<p>JohnsonBrandEditing</p>\n<p>klangkobold</p>\n<p>deleteduser7146007</p>\n<p>waveplaysfx</p>\n<p>duncanlewismackinnon</p>\n<p>Minian89</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T14:09:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd6/dd6833770bbb3febc7a6ee76b02d9141.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Krafter"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
