Unlike us, their puny descendants, they were even able to travel freely between the worlds! Sadly, their advanced knowledge and technology have been lost and we are only left with some artifacts that we have no idea how to use.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tA recent discovery by Prof. Braumber, who found a way to activate several ancient portals, was met with a surge of enthusiasm. The enthusiasm, however, has quickly waned as it became clear that the world accessible through the portals, which was named Arvie Flar by its re-discoverer, is an undeveloped, wild, and dangerous place. To make things worse, savage soldiers of an unknown army appear to live  in this world, fiercely attacking explorers and settlers.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThese unfortunate circumstances have greatly affected the interest in Arvie Flar among world governments and major corporations. And this is exactly where a middle-tier corporation <em>Limbader &amp; Co</em> saw an opportunity. It managed to acquire the concession rights for Arvie Flar and believes that it can extract profit from this world. Mr. Limbader's plan is quite simple: acting quickly, the corporate workers get as many resources as possible while the corporate armed forces protect them from the mysterious army. Nice and easy, what could possibly go wrong? \t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tYou have a good chance to get the leading position on this planned expedition. It would be a tremendous move for your career, and of course it would allow you to demonstrate your extraordinary leadership as well as analytical and problem-solving skills. As the negotiations with <em>Limbader &amp; Co</em> are almost over, you arrive to the city of N\u00f6rsten for a final interview with your potential employer. Good luck!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\n\n<p>Yeah, right: Laser Squad, X-Com, JA-2, Fallout-1/2, spiritual succession etc. Everybody seems to have a different idea of which parts of those games should be preserved intact and which parts should be removed, altered, or completely redesigned in order to make that spiritual successor thing. <br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>This project is my idea of what a good game could look like.</p>\n\n\n<p>What does it contain?<br/></p>\n<p>Story: Plot twists. Revelations. Discoveries.</p>\n<p>Tactics: Turn-based tactical combat. <br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Guns: Pistols, revolvers, rifles, carbines, light and heavy machine guns. Grenades too. A lot of them.</p>\n<p>History: Procedurally generated world of alternative history 1920th.</p>\n\n<p>This game uses images, sounds, and other assets from different sources:<br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\r\nGun item 3D model rendered: By 3DMaesen at sketchfab.com\r\n</li>\n<li>\r\nBackground photo: Background photo created by jannoon028 -
