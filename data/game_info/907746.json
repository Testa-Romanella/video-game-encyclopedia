Energy is needed to do activities that could raise your sanity or for mandatory tasks so should be saved and spent when there's leftover (unfortunately not functional in launch). However if the sanity bar reaches zero and the player goes to sleep, the game is over.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The story plays similar to a rogue-like in which each day the player can speak to different characters and complete their routine to progress the story and when the day is over start a new day with the advancements of their actions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>How to Play:</p><ol><li>AD to move</li><li>Space to jump</li><li>Backspace to interact</li><li>J for quest log</li><li>ESC to pause\u00a0</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T07:07:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/167/1678b4f18da9bd2bf9b425b305a9710d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Karam \"Karma\" Hamadeh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
