Join your Robot and ready your program cards to compete in the Grand Arena for the ultimate cyber-trophy and become the Robogram Champion!</p>\n<strong>Robogram a card game to teach you programming</strong>\n<p>Robogram is a unique\u00a0 card game designed to teach about programming (it's also proper fun!)</p>\n<p>It's a game of epic battles where programmers attempt to bring down their opponent's firewall and crash each other's servers.</p>\n<p>As cards and damage are dealt, players will also develop an understanding of how computer systems work. They will write programs and evaluate them together.</p>\n<p>The tricks, terms and programs they learn to use in the game, will give them real-life advantages when it comes to understanding programming.</p>\n<p>The game is asymmetric as the play style of the available Decks is unique.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Game is based on the Robogram - programming card game.</p>\r\nWhy Early Access?\r\n<p>We have a tiny team with\u00a0 a big dream, so feedback is vital for the development of the game.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\r\nHow long Robogram\u00a0will be in early access?\u00a0\r\n<p>We hope to work on this game for years to come and make something truly special. We have a good idea what would qualify as a 1.0 version of Robogram, but the game will be in Early Access for at least 1 year, could be longer.</p>\r\nWhat is the current state of the early access version?\r\n<p>We\u2019ve reached the point in development where we feel ready to open the game up to the public. There are still a bunch of performance, design and visual issues and the game is far from perfect. Having said that the game is in a state where you can have a fun and\u00a0 try out the basic game mechanics.\u00a0 You are able to play a local game with two players.</p>\r\nWhat we are launching with:\r\n<p>\u2022 2 Players local game \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2022 C++ Deck\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2022 1 Robot Card (without specials)\u00a0 \u2022 All C++ Firewall Cards\u00a0 \u2022 All C++ Command, Function, Object, Iteration Cards\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\r\nHow is the full version planed to differ\u00a0from the early access version?\r\n<p>We are planning to at least add the following:\u00a0\r\n\u2022\u00a0 Rest of\u00a0C++ Deck (Events, Upgrades, Conditions,\u00a0 Robot Specials)\u00a0\u2022 Ruby Deck\u00a0\u2022 Tutorial\u00a0 \u2022 Single Player Story mode \u2022 Online Matches: 1v1\u00a0,\u00a0 2v2\u00a0Team , 3 player Death Match, Co-op and Ranked\u00a0\u00a0Matches\u00a0 \u2022 More optimisation\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Visual Improvements Upgrade\u00a0\u2022 Full VR Support\u00a0\u2022 In game rule book\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T05:01:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/934/934198db53bb6e0471a366dc8b0aa8ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["kory75"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
