Here's a taste of the <strong>Kalinago history</strong>:<br/><br/>Hundreds of years ago, many Kalinago were lost at sea while fleeing from the Spanish. They shipwrecked in The Archipelago where they began to prosper thanks to <strong>Arkanaguno, the volcano god</strong>, who provided them with soil.<br/><br/>A century later, glaciers formed and the prosperity of the islands was ravaged by frost. Many natives began worshipping <strong>Solwe, the sun god</strong>, in place of Arkanaguno, believing he was angered by their abandonment of him for the volcano god. Thus, the Kalinago religion fractured into two separate sects.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Once the glaciers melted, ocean storms began to regularly destroy the prosperous ecosystem. Once again, theistic debate arose over the origin of these acts, and some Kalinago began to deify <strong>Buwanu, the moon god</strong>.<br/><br/>While the shamans of each sect disagree on which god should be worshipped by the Kalinago, they all share one universal truth: that life is cyclical. The circle of life remains an essential aspect of each of these three faiths.<br/><br/>Powerful TechnologyWe use <strong>Unreal Engine 4 </strong> to build Sail and Sacrifice. Thanks to its high quality graphics, AAA software, and large community, we are able to create an immersive world for the player to freely roam, battle, and conquer. The terrain, foliage, day/night cycles, and lighting all contribute to the atmosphere of the vast world.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0be/0be4be58c6af4147e92b571145eb72cd.jpg", "website": "http://cagestudios.net/sailandsacrifice.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 416, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CAGE Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CAGE Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
