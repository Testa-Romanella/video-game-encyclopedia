It is the direct sequel to the 2002 spin-off of the series, Stronghold: Crusader. </p>\n<h3>Background</h3>\n<p>Stronghold Crusader II is set in the Middle East in the era of Crusades. The game&#39;s two campaign modes follow the two sides in the Crusades: the Crusaders and the Muslims. The game features historical figures like Saladin and Richard of England, as well as the characters from earlier games in the series, such as Rat and Wolf.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game is similar to all Stronghold games. The player assumes the role of a medieval lord who controls his castle. The player has to build the walls and towers, hire the knights and archers, and establish a productive medieval economy to support the war effort. Most missions involve a siege of a castle, with the player as the attacker, the defender, or both.</p>\n<h3>Economy</h3>\n<p>Everything in Stronghold, from the food to the war, requires the player to establish a chain of production, such as a mill and a bakery to make bread. The player has to produce armor and weapons before hiring most types of units. There&#39;s also a reputation meter that tracks what the people think of their lord. The player can increase his or her reputation by offering the people more food, lowering taxes, or building pubs and churches.</p>\n<h3>Multiplayer</h3>\n<p>Stronghold Crusader II has several multiplayer modes. It was the first game in the series to introduce a cooperative mode that allows two players to control the same castle.</p>", "metacritic": 65, "released": "2014-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-18T13:56:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21a/21a0dacefc6b20dc81c8aad0625eb9a8.jpg", "website": "http://www.strongholdcrusader2.com", "rating": 3.49, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 72, "owned": 1303, "beaten": 44, "toplay": 18, "dropped": 63, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 81, "ratings_count": 125, "suggestions_count": 547, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 125, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FireFly Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["FireFly Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
