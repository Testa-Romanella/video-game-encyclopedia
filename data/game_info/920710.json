{"id": 920710, "slug": "pando-i-am-root", "name": "Pando - I am root", "name_original": "Pando - I am root", "description": "<p>\"Pando - I am root\" is a 2D, top-down game where you as the player aid Pando, a vast aspen clonal colony and a single living organism, defend itself against its threats while facing extinction. One massive root system has been nourishing Pando for the past thousands of years - now, human development, grazing, drought and other menacing factors are restraining Pando in its growth. In the game you can point at the various enemies spawning - stag, moose, rabbit - and shoot birds automatically after the timer cools down. Once you have gained enough XP to level up you can choose between various perks to support your fight, e.g. spawning more birds, bears or fences to keep off opponents. <br/></p>\n<p>Help Pando in its quest for renewal and restore balance to nature. We are rooting for you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T16:34:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b62/b627402801e9f976898c06d52fe6d3d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Black Mae Studios", "pandaris", "Luhrion", "hailfire88", "Zitronenbomber"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
