In this minigame, march along with the music while switching between onbeats and offbeats. Try not to mess up and make your fellow stepswitchers mad.</p>\n<p>I made this remake as a callback to my childhood days of \"gaming\" and also as a beginner's exercise in using unity.</p>\n<p>Yes, there are a lot of missing features (especially practice mode), and there will probrably be a lot of bugs. I'm busy in IRL right now but maybe I'll come back to fix them after the exam.</p>\n<p>All rights go to Nintendo, the owner of the Rhythm Heaven series.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T07:13:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1d/f1d8aa8e10e21edd71d2b4a2b8e49c3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chocfudge"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
