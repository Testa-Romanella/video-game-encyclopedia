You can choose to play the basket, or just be chaotic and beat up your opponent. In Game Ball, all your actions can be a strategy towards victory.</p>How to play<p>Game Ball is a pvp, 2-player basketball brawler with a focus on controller input. Players earn points by scoring baskets or knocking out their opponent. First to 7 points wins.</p>\r\nWho are we?\r\n<p>We're just a couple friends that love playing games, and making games! We were itching to hang out for a whole weekend and work on a fun project. So we set out to\u00a0make a silly and\u00a0fun pvp game\u00a0that we would want to play.</p>\r\nWhat's next?\r\n<p>When we started this project, we were just looking for an excuse to hang out and be creative. But after bringing this prototype to life, a few of us have decided it might be fun to keep iterating on some of the core ideas. With the game jam time restriction lifted, we can now focus on polishing the mechanics and design.</p>\r\nAny final thoughts?\r\n<p>Our designer and programmer sneakily worked on and added an interactive Credits level post-jam. So we kinda, sorta slightly\u00a0broke the sacred rules of the game jam gods. Hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T05:49:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/045/045777d5493a9ffa643f5c11888e9101.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CroissantLess"], "genres": ["Sports", "Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
