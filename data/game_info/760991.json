Play music with any key on your keyboard.\r\n<p>Our concept for a game engine subversion was to use Unity to create a virtual and animated keyboard. Instead of using Unity to create your typical gameplay, we focused on creating a sandbox experience that largely revolves around playing music with your keyboard.</p>\n<p>There were many obstacles that we needed to overcome in order to make this a success, beginning with our camera. Unity 3D camera controls mainly lend themselves to FPS-style games, but due to our use of gravity, we needed to revise the camera controls to work with a top down camera view. The actual audio itself, as well as the keys controlling them, took much finessing in order to work successfully.\r\n</p>\n<p>We hope you have fun with our game. Be sure to try out all the features!</p>\n\r\nContributors:\r\n\r\n<p>Natalie LH (C# Development, Camera Effects, 3D Modelling)\r\n<br/>Matthew B.
