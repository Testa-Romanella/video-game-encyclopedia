The \u201chumanism\u201d spirit brought by the Renaissance was replaced by \u201ctechnologism\u201d. People believe that the development of technology will bring unlimited freedom and even create infinite possibilities. For example, the invention of electronic brains allows people to truly feel what is \u201cimagination without boundaries\u201d. The invention of electronic limbs and auxiliary body parts allows people to see and accept the death of God in religion and the birth of God in technology.<br/><br/>People have become accustomed to and enjoy letting technology dominate everything, from birth to death, from three meals a day to work and leisure, as long as they have money, they can live like gods. There has never been a kind of capitalism that makes everyone so firmly believe in the power of money. Money buys technology, and technology summons God.<br/><br/>Of course, the remnants of the old enlightenment\u2019s \u201chumanism\u201d have not been extinct. They can always survive on the edge of cities and networks. In 2098, in New Dragon City of the American Federation, an organization called \u201cImune\u201d removes identity chips for people for free, to get rid of the information control of the capital government union on individuals. At the same time, the advertising department of Pineapple Dragon, the largest company in New Dragon City, is hunting down \u201cImune\u201d. The player-controlled \u201cchef\u201d is one of the leaders of \u201cImune\u201d. According to the law designated by Pineapple Dragon and the government, such a thought criminal as \u201cImune\u201d will be subjected to \u201cthought deprivation\u201d punishment, implanting brain invasion accessors for criminals, and providing some customers with special services-legal brain invasion (role-playing), to deprive thought criminals of their right to use their own brains.<br/><br/>Some thought criminals will act as cleaners on the outer walls of skyscrapers, some will be arranged as executioners for illegal violent organizations, and of course, there are also some low-stimulation occupations, such as some thought criminals will be assigned to snack stalls as stall owners. It should be noted that this service is different from the \u201cBraindance\u201d system used by ordinary customers. After all, BD is just a kind of \u201creplay\u201d, but this service provides a kind of \u201crealest experience\u201d. Customers can see in reality the consequences caused by their own actions.<br/><br/>In snack cart No. 98, players will invade into the brain of a former leader of the \u201cImune\u201d organization, play as a chef, cook pancakes and get feedback from \u201ccustomers\u201d.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-01T12:28:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81d/81d7b1811ea58b64c70d24446ee7df22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Off Lab"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Off Lab"], "esrb_rating": null}
