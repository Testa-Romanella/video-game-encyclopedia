You will be able to ask the defendants questions to get more information about the case or convict them from the beginning.</p>\n<p>Watch out! Once you close the case, you will not be able to change your choice and the accused will be sentenced to death if declared as guilty.\r\n</p>\n<p>However, if you declare the accused as innocent and he was actually guilty, you now have set a criminal free. Both cases will decrease score points.\r\n</p>\n<p>The only way to earn points is by declaring the cases correctly and finishing as soon as possible.\r\n</p>\n<p>Good luck, don't let any weirdo escape!\r\n</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\nSantiago A.
