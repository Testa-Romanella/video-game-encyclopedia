(Like, *Titan Souls*-esque hard.)</p>\n<p>While it might be interesting to figure everything out by yourself, it may be too frustrating.</p>\n<p>Here are a few tips to make your life easier:</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 1 - Crystals\u00a0\u00a0</strong><br/>\u00a0 \u00a0This shouldn't be hard. Use dash to dodge bullets, and shoot crystals from afar.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 2 - Laser\u00a0\u00a0</strong><br/>\u00a0 \u00a0Simply wait behind a rock, until the boss comes nearby. Then dash sideways, get behind his back and hit him a few times.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 3 - More crystals\u00a0\u00a0</strong><br/>\u00a0 \u00a0This one is tricky. Try to destroy one of the two crystals ASAP, preferably before it starts shooting. Then you can hide behind the boss and chill.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0There is a trick to destroying the second one: Instead of rushing towards it, use boss shield to deflect bullets towards the crystal while sitting in a safe spot.<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0<br/><strong>Phase 4 - Magic\u00a0\u00a0</strong><br/>\u00a0 \u00a0At this point you should know how to dodge.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0First, you need to kill the two small orbs. Beware: when one is destroyed, the other and the boss itself will start shooting at you.<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0After both orbs die, the boss becomes vulnerable, but also aggressive. You'll need to dash a lot.</p>\n<p>That's all, good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f3/1f3abcf511ffc24dc34a5e7bb3917009.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Holy Black Cat"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
