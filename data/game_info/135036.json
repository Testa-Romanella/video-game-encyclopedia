At this stage, it's no more than a simple <strong>\"Walking Simulator\"</strong>. Every play is different from the last, though, as it's generated with random tweaks.</p><p>I decided to give a try on procedural modeling (modeling with code, no external editors like Blender or 3DSMax), because I like to be as precise as possible with my structures. And what can be more precise than numbers? As a result, <strong>everything in the game</strong> except Politron (the character) is 1<strong>00% made from code!</strong> (Meshes, textures, etc.)<br/></p><p>Special thanks to Jayelinda Suridge, whose tutorial (\"Modelling by numbers\") helped me greatly with the procedural meshes.</p><p>As of now, it has <strong>some errors</strong> here and there, but <strong>fixes and </strong><strong>more features on the way.</strong> For now, I'll take it slow. I learned so many things with this project! But I'm worn off too because deadlines...
