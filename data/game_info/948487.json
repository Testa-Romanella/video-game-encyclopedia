The combination of visuals and game mechanics are intended to evoke feelings that are conveyed by the song, including confusion, gloominess, paranoia. Players are able to hear the song in the background as they are playing, and read the lyrics, which are in rainbow text. The player is guided through different levels, each taking inspirations from specific lyrics chosen from the song. At the end, the player becomes influenced by the music environment and transforms into a paranoid, psychotic character.\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T09:21:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/500/50014fb1416967524d312ce706d17f55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["22arthurtang@gmail.com"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
