Without any previous memories, all alone. The only things she remembers are her first name and a song - a lullaby that's stuck in her head. <br/></p>\n<p>One night, 10 years later, she awakens to the sound of the familiar song being sung and follows it, into the town near the orphanage she lives in. But when she gets there, the town is... changed. Not like Haru remembers. <br/></p>\n<p>And when she tries to leave, she can't. <br/></p>\n<p>The main objective of this game is to get back to the orphanage and try to get Haru's memories back along the way. <br/></p>\n<p><em>You are born a blank canvas. Ready to be painted - and tainted. After all, memories make you who you are. You are born without opinions, fears, aspirations and dreams. Only living life, making memories forms you, molds you. <br/>But... what if, one day... you lost them? <br/>...
