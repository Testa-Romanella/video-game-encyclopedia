They liked it enough to continue with the project under the name 'Nuclear Throne'.</p><p><strong>What is Nuclear Throne?</strong> Nuclear Throne is Vlambeers latest action roguelike-like about mutants that spend their workdays trying to fight for the throne in a post-apocalyptic world. The radioactive waste in the world allows mutants to get ahead by mutating new limbs on the fly and the abundant availability of powerful weaponry makes the quest to become the ruler of the Wasteland one frought with peril. All of this is really just an excuse for us to make a fun action game.</p><p>You can buy Nuclear Throne at\u00a0www.nuclearthrone.com.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-26T15:21:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b0/1b0f8ba2dcca57189c7d3c7235a001b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vlambeer"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
