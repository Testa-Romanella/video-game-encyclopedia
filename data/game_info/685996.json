The catch being that you can only jump in one direction (right) in this circular world, and any falls could mean the loss of a significant amount of progress. Can you make it past all 3 regions and make it up to the surface?</p>\n<p>Controls: Hold [SPACE] to jump, [Z] to zoom.</p>\n<p>This game is meant to be very challenging to beat, but if you are especially having trouble or just want to beat the game in pinch, consider changing the difficulty in the options\u00a0to \"Baby Mode\", which enables rewinds to your previous jump location by pressing [R].</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T09:07:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a4/7a4dfa6d218fc53cf0971efc63f14265.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PseudoMonkey"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
