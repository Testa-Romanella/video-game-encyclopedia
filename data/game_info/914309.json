The game garnered a lot of interest upon release. Due to recent\u00a0requests from a few people who have DMed me or shown interest on the Steam forums, I've uploaded the game here, on\u00a0Itch.</p>\n<p>Changes from the Steam version:\r\n</p>\n<p>1. Since\u00a0Steam integration is removed, the one-life mechanic doesn't work. Now the data is stored locally instead. So you can easily reinstall the game or clear your cache to play again.\r\n</p>\n<p>2. The graveyard was supposed to be the leaderboard that pulled data from steam. Since I still wanted to keep the graveyard for the aesthetics, I replaced the text on the graves with quotes about death from famous people\r\n</p>\n<p>3. Changed the game's UI.\r\n</p>\n<p>Future: I'll update the game if the comments here report any bugs. I plan to upload other games that I've\u00a0made over the years to Itch soon.\r\n</p>\n<p>Notes: In hindsight, I can see all the things that are wrong with the game. The mechanics are not explained properly and there isn't enough feedback for some actions. However, I don't plan to update the game and will only fix bugs.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T12:34:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b44/b44e83d9066f4c5372a3d6dea81c971f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 198, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["realfoxy_985"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
