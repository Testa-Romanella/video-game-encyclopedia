This library is the town's signature feature, where inside you can literally get lost in the winding staircases and shelves of books. People of all sorts gather here for a multitude of different reasons, but they all feel the strength of literature--the different effects it has on the soul. Lost people hope to find themselves within the pages, but what if they were to find each other instead? Can hidden loves, once thought to be lost, be found within the walls of pages of Labyrinthe?<br/><br/></p>\n<p>She has a big family, which can only be matched by her big heart--a heart many would consider too pure. She journeys to the suburban town of Everton to study and find her own path as a writer. Her path she is quite unsure of, but her drive to pour her soul into her novel, like the works of the writers she has spent years devouring, is unflinching. When she wanders into Labyrinthe, the largest collection of pages collected in the town, she hopes to find what is hidden from her, but perhaps, just maybe, she will find something else lost she didn't even know she was looking for</p>\n<br/><br/>\n<p>\u00a0She carries herself with poise and confidence, her eyes so intense one could swear she could devour a person with one look alone. But underneath her elegant, dangerous persona, there is a sadness in her smile--like a single crack in a mirror so small one would not even realize it unless they looked closely enough. Will she forever stay fearsome and independent, or will the mirror continue to crack until she is completely transformed into a person even she doesn't recognize? <br/></p>\n<p><strong>==================</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Hello! note from myself here!
