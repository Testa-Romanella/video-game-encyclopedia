We were to use physics to indirectly move a character through a level. So instead of moving the character I decided to rotate the game world. You are a square on a ship trying to collect power to fuel one of the escape pods, you can change your colour to pass through security barriers of the same colour. Escape before time runs out!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-31T03:22:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b76/b7617b9ae00451d6288f3795ef1e65f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bmiller11"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
