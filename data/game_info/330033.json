Created by a small community of Homestuck/Hiveswap fans, Through Green Doors drags our beloved yet ever-suffering MC back through the world of Alternia to meet some more trolls with the goal of maybe making some more friends whilst not dying, hopefully.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-24T04:43:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac5/ac5ca8c4a2cbbe0ef69b6f6f6ffa3769.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Fantroll friendsim"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
