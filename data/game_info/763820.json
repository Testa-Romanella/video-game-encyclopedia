She can\u2019t see it, but there is something haunting her house. She needs to navigate the house, find a key, and leave. But, there is something wrong. When she stands under the moonlight, she can feel the monster\u2019s gaze through the walls. It comes close. To avoid it, she goes to the dark. But in the dark, anxiety creeps in and her vision blurs. Her heart-rate goes up, she hears voices that are not there.<br/></p>\n<p>Originally created for Brackey's Game Jame 2022.1 but sadly never submitted, <em>The Monster's Not Real, Maggie\u00a0</em>is a horror game that makes you use your senses to figure out how much danger you really are in.<br/></p>\r\nHow to Play:\r\n<ul><li>Use the WASD keys to walk and the MOUSE to move around.</li><li>Use SHIFT to sprint for a brief moment.</li><li>Find the key.</li><li>Bring the key to the door and escape.</li></ul>\r\nHow to Survive\r\n<ul><li>Find the key.</li><li>Do not stay in the DARK <em>or</em> the LIGHT for too long.
