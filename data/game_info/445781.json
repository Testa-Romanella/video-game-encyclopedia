The best bet is to crouch when she is near, and listen to her whereabouts. the ambient music is there to throw you off a bit, but she can still be heard. She is alerted when you run and when you walk around her.\u00a0And yes, she can go through walls.... <strong>Good Luck</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>[080]</strong></em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T03:40:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/237/237ae0580df91a4e23ee4ce2016e2771.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["[080] Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
