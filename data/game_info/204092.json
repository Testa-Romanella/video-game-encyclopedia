Two others which are positive, one that doubles points gained thereafter for a number of seconds, and another which slows the speed of all the raindrops for a number of seconds, making it easier to catch the raindrops in time.</p><p>The levels go from 1 - 70 and there are new backgrounds to unlock as the levels progress.</p><p>This is still a work in the making and will not fully work :</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20c/20c1a15bd1396e1cef9150888fe3ca74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GEOVISUAL"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
