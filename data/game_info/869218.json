Check out his project page\u00a0here!</p>\n<p>NOTE: Although this sim is meant to be played in VR, it also includes support for PC standalone.</p>\n<p>One More Cup of EGO is a Virtual Reality experience built with VRTK 4 in Unity.\u00a0 The project takes the form of a room-scale kiosk within a mock-up of an upcoming CS building to be built on campus. The kiosk itself is inspired by the games\u00a0Lobotomy Corporation\u00a0and\u00a0Library of Ruina, both games created by Project Moon. To this end, the kiosk is themed after the Asiyah layer, covering the first\u00a0four \"floors\" from Ruina.\u00a0The kiosk also features numerous interactables and objects the user can\u00a0\"buy,\" which consist of EGO equipment from L Corp.</p>\n<p>The sim can be played on either PC or Quest (or any other headset capable of running .apk files), but is intended to be played on the Quest. The PC version takes the form of a first-person experience, where the player can control the simulated VR controllers via mouse and keyboard.</p>\n\n<p>PC Controls:</p>\n<p>1 - Toggle control body</p>\n<p>2 - Toggle control left-hand controller</p>\n<p>3 - Toggle control right-hand controller</p>\n<p>Mouse - Look, Rotate controllers</p>\n<p>Left Click - Pick up interactable object</p>\n\n<p>VR Controls:</p>\n<p>Click Right Thumbstick - Teleport</p>\n<p>Grab - Pick up interactable object</p>\n\n<p>Feel free to read the devlogs below if you want to read up more on the details that went into developing this project!</p><p>Update 10/18/22 - 1.2 version released, now including proper EGO collisions and a stackable dummy that spits out coins when you hit it!</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Ian Ubaldo - Programming, EGO models</p>\n<p>Robert Petrov - Humanoid Models, Environment Design</p>\n<p>Lobotomy Corporation/Library of Ruina - Assets, Reference Images, and Inspiration</p>\n<p>Other imported assets are credited on\u00a0Robert's page.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T13:50:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac4/ac4083dbe9b4053bacb15e8cd6958721.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lunarium Works"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
