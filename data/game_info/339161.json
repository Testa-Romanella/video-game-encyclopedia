THIS DOES CONTAINT SPOILERS FOR THE GAME HOLLOW KNIGHT!<br/><br/>This project is based on the existing game Hollow Knight, mabe by Team Cherry. I do not own the characters or world this project is based on.</em></p>\n<p>Welcome to my Hollow Knight 3D demo! First of all, this is only a demo, and it's only meant to be a demo. I do not have any plans of making a complete game or any more areas/content. This was made as a school project for me to improve on 3D and trying to learn some Unity.</p>\n<p>I chose to work with Hollow Knight, because I love the game and the universe, and wanted the challenge of turning a world from 2D to 3D. This demo isn't 100% accurate in terms of world and story, but I tried keeping as close to the source material as I could. <br/></p>\n<p>CONTROLS:<br/>Walking: W, A, S, D<br/>Camera: I, J, K, L<br/>Sword: Lshift<br/>Jump: Space<br/>NPC interaction: E</p>\n<p>This should also work with an Xbox controler. There you use the joysticks, and A, X, B for jumping, sword and talking. (I do not know if any other controlers work)<br/></p>\n<p>The demo ends after the credits<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-05T06:00:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f0/8f0ab0087a18fbf3345e18272cb304c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Vegard \u00d8ien Jensen"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
