Unfortunately your cellmate has all the luck, so you'll need him to escape.

You can use it to your advantage!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T14:29:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09e/09ed2d7398ca7fa4328804b475f3a733.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rubidant"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
