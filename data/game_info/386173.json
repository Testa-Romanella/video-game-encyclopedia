Unlike other popular puzzle games, CROSSNIQ+ focuses on speed and technique rather than chains or combos - make crosses quickly and set up multi-crosses to earn bonuses.</p>\n\n<p>In Endless mode, keep making crosses to keep your timer filled - let it hit empty, and your game is over. In Time Attack, your time is a set amount - earn as many points as you can before the buzzer sounds. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Play against a friend in Versus, complete with items and special moves...</p>\n\n<p>...or simply relax to a variety of different, aesthetically striking playfields in Chillout mode, where there's no score, timer, or game overs. No matter your playstyle, there's a mode in CROSSNIQ+ for you!<br/></p>\n<p>Let's Cross! Aim for THE TOP!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-25T06:56:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c0/8c0c0f375796da885c05ad9a8748c659.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Max Krieger"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
