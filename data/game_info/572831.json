You play as a War Mage tasked with\u00a0 driving back hordes of orcs that threaten the safety of the world.\u00a0You do this by placing traps and slaying the green menace with your Arcane Crossbow and Bladestaff.</p>\n<p>We have tried to de:make OMD to resemble the visual style of a\u00a090s RPG, taking inspiration from the Might and Magic series and DOOM. We took some creative liberties with in this department,\u00a0including a switch to the first-person to better suit our target look.\u00a0We were not overly strict with our restrictions on things like colour, but instead tried to strike a balance between the look we wanted and a style that suited our workflow given the time limit.</p>\n<p><strong>Joe McPhee: Designer, 3D Artist, Animator</strong></p><strong>Ed Hicks: Developer, Designer<br/></strong><p><strong>With help from;</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Turlough McHugh: Original Sound Track, SFX Artist</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T07:47:05", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NoAverageJ0E", "matsuringo", "TurloughMcHugh"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
