To the Bartender, Velour, he at first believes it so -- but very quickly, when actually considers it...<br/><br/>No, there was something he needed to do, first. And so, begins a much smaller, much less deadly journey back to a place he once called home...and the surrounding places he goes before and after that.\r\n<p><em>Shards of the Future</em> is a not-so-goofy (but rest assured,\u00a0<em>there will be memery</em>) sequel to my first Renpy game,\u00a0<em>Fragments of the Past.</em> It is recommended to play the first one in order to get what's going on in this second installment! This game includes the following hit new content:</p>\n<ul><li>More text (like, double the amount of text). This means you're going to have to deal with MORE of my typos</li><li>At least two instances of Velour being a complete dumbass (if not more)<br/>\n</li><li>Some of these images have drawings of Velour! Wow! The quality for these are wild, but i had a lot of fun with them.</li><li>You might find a surprise at the end if you're one of the players who was in this campaign :)</li></ul>\n<p>Of course,\u00a0 the content warnings exist and they mostly hit the same as the last one:\u00a0there's a lot of talk about characters who had died (family members specifically, but also about dying in a time loop), a bit of trying to process thoughts (mainly about being in a killing game), and the general concept of recognizing hurt and being hurt. No graphical warnings (the closest 'violent' image is Velour with a small bruise on his face.)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T06:43:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/365/36557f4b8f0da91195df5e893aba1e8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Rubin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
