They have also fixed and brought back everyone's favorite pirate fox, Foxy. The murderer of the four children and one missing child has yet to be found. They also brought back something from the old pizzeria. Something to bring back to the hopes and joys of children and grown ups alike! But the building has yet to be cleaned... Not responsible for injury/dismemberment.\r\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>The Return to Freddy's by BFPFilms424.</p>\n<p>Android port by me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T10:42:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b48/b48158fd446fc64467d56208a96c154b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Rushan Mukhutdinov"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
