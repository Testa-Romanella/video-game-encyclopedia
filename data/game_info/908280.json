{"id": 908280, "slug": "escape-the-fate-2", "name": "Escape the Fate!", "name_original": "Escape the Fate!", "description": "<p>This is a prototype for a game I developed during one of my courses at the university.</p><p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> The sprite assets for the enemies and characters were borrowed from the game Darkest Dungeon for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES only. If you like their style, please go check out their game, its awesome!</p>\n<p>The player walks through a labyrinth trying to find his way out. The combat is based on Rock-Paper-Scissors and you have to gather items that allow you to defeat all types of enemies.</p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY:</p>\n<p>\u00a0- You start the game by choosing New Game in the Menu.</p>\n<p>\u00a0- When in the Character Selection Screen you can choose you character. Each of them represents a type.</p>\n<p>\u00a0- You can choose where to go by pressing the directions on the bottom of the screen.</p>\n<p>\u00a0- The button \"CHARACTER\" at the lower left allows you to see you character card.</p>\n<p>\u00a0- While you walk, you can have to types of encounters:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - Item encounter\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You can come through potions\u00a0while walking and\u00a0these also have levels. Its important to keep a eye on those,\u00a0\u00a0a low level item won't do anything against a much higher level monster. Potions are important because they can DEFEAT\u00a0monsters ONE LEVEL\u00a0above them, only needing to be of the right type. When you find one, you can select which slot its going to. If there is already a potion there, it will be substituted.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 - Combat encounter</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This is were you fight the enemies. The combat is basically a rock-paper-scissors throw. If you choose to \"Attack\", it will be the TYPE of\u00a0YOUR CHARACTER against the TYPE of the\u00a0MONSTER. There is a graphic on the top of the screen that illustrates the types and their strengths and weaknesses(basically, against which they win and lose). The monster's name color indicates if he is above or below your level(GREEN being lower, WHITE for the same and RED for a level above). The type system works as intended for white and green level monsters, but RED ones ignore it. You need a potion to defeat those. To use a potion, simple click on its correspondent Slot button to use instead of attacking. You can also Flee the encounters, the FLEE button ends the battle, but there is a chance you will get hit and lose a life.</p>\n\n<p>That should be it for the main mechanics. Please understand this is a prototype and its prone to a few BUGS.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it! I recommend playing it with sound, as the music tells you if you changed areas and is currently closer to the END!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T10:37:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ada/ada6b44cfab63bcc7de059d73ef14188.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KaleoTS"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
