Enjoy the best composition ever composed by Dvorak, mixed with my personally voiced sound!<br/>You play as Trump, and you have access to power ups that help the fight against this disease.</p>\n<p>\u00a0The goal is to survive as much as possible without getting your population to zero.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The game is in alpha state and is under active development. Critiques are appreciated if useful, i have a lot to add to the game such as Bosses, power ups, skins AND special effect etc etc.</em></strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>A special thank to Godot and\u00a0Krita developers.<br/>A special thank to Dvorak, who composed the masterpiece I used as soundtrack.<br/>But\u00a0<strong>MOST important</strong> thanks to everyone who take its time to download this little little game.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T03:01:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c10/c109665430655997b75857c0345617c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["THEN3LLI"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
