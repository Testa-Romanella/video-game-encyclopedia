Dodge red tiles. Every time you play the level, more red or green tiles will turn into mystery yellow tiles - you must remember if they were green or red from the previous go. Once you have passed the final level, the game will reset with a different map. You can hold down super jump to jump two tiles.</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS</p>\n<p>Left Stick / WASD - Move\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shift / Right Trigger - Superjump</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T14:39:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/511/5110080da691160be4c27267725a9dfd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Jack Taylor"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
