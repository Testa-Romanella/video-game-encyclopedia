The game features a STUNNING cast of characters, INCREDIBLE gameplay, and absolutely no bugs whatsoever, as I am clearly a professional game developer, and I don't make mitsakes. There's an online mode, where you are randomly split into two teams, and the goal is to destroy the other team's burger. No friends? No problem! There's a single player mode, too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Discord Server:\u00a0https://discord.gg/Uf3dp7WeEG</p>\n<p>YouTube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8gvBz0XJgmnRlRZzvX7Xww</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T07:13:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b7/1b7f4898989b9452f311f9b839b19233.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Red Croissant Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
