However, some people think that great power means great fun.<br />\nWhere is the truth? You tell me.<br />\nPriest Simulator is a realistic, well, simulator of living as the most privileged person in town.<br />\nDo the sermons. People will obey you.<br />\nGive the sacraments. According to your own price list.<br />\nVisit people. Collect loot.<br />\nModernize you church. Or your saint laboratory.<br />\nPerform exorcisms on possessed people. Or animals.<br />\nDestroy the sects. Or make alliances.<br />\nFight with other priests in Divine Powers Challanges. Or take part in illegal races.<br />\nSpend money on car upgrades. Or weapons to fight demons.<br />\nBut first of all remember - take care of your reputation. Because you live in a place where almost everyone wants to pull your leg.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": true, "updated": "2020-01-07T22:01:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2b/c2b19672a4fd3d5ef25a647711aa6cb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 12, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 26, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 412, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Delirma"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ultimate Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
