Each plant has a preferred soil type and to check the health of what you just planted, use your magnifying glass to see how the roots are doing! (There's a glitch in the web version for some reason that each field starts with a plant there??? its weird. But you can still plant stuff)</p>\n<p>If the root is red, it's normal and just needs normal water.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If the root is swollen and blue, it has too much\u00a0 water! Water it with ginkgo water!</p>\n<p>If the root is brittle and dry, it doesnt have enough water! Water it with hydrangea water!</p>\n<p>To change your water type, collect ginkgo leaves and hydrangea flowers at the back of the farm and then go to the plant stand in your house.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Sleep to pass the day and see your plants grow!\u00a0</p>\n<p>There isn't a win state and nothing happens after the plants reach their final stage.
