{"id": 306015, "slug": "flow-2", "name": ".flow", "name_original": ".flow", "description": "<p>.flow is one of the earliest and most iconic Yume Nikki fangames, created by lol only two years after Yume Nikki&#39;s 0.10. Known for elements of mass body horror, dynamic storytelling and dreariness previously untouched by the fangame genre, .flow stars Sabitsuki (\u3055\u3073\u3064\u304d), a white-haired girl refusing to leave her room. Instead, she uses her computer to explore a world inside her mind, collect effects and exploring places potentially representing a dark past.</p>\n<p>The title of the game seems to reference both the psychological term of Flow and the prevalent theme of technology. This suggests that what Sabitsuki and, indeed, the player experience is not a dreamlike state at all, but rather an immersive reality.</p>\n<p>The main plot of the game is similar to the original Yume Nikki&#39;s, in that it is a sandbox game with very few exploration restrictions. The player must collect the twenty-five effects to unlock two of the three endings, and three &quot;boxes&quot; to achieve the third and final.</p>\n<p>(via https://yumenikkifg.fandom.com/wiki/.flow)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-04T02:28:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd6/bd650aef4f7dbc70674eb327b983ee5c.jpg", "website": "http://rustlimbo.webcrow.jp/games/flow/index.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 4, "beaten": 6, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
