The player can knock other balls and take roquet in order to position the best winning strategy. <br/><br/>A deadness board, scorecard, and diagram of the court can be viewed in the pause menu. The game is played by selecting a move (i.e. strike the ball, switch balls, let balls lie and end turn) then selecting the court to position the mallet. <br/><br/>Releasing the press will fire the mallet from the indicated position with a power related to the distance from the ball. For the starting turns and when taking roquet, the balls is placed by selecting within the purple line or circle.<br/><br/>From the seasoned croquet player to the novice, Croquet Pro 2 is a unique and fun mobile game unlike any other.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:11:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abb/abb9cfdf63642ef2bd690b434607cabd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Evan Godfrey"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Evan Godfrey"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
