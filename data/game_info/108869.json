{"id": 108869, "slug": "7hours", "name": "7Hours", "name_original": "7Hours", "description": "<p>7Hours is a mystery/horror game set in a small town gay bar. The protagonist plays a man who lost his girlfriend during a blackout in said bar. The lights come back on, the doors are locked, and two people are missing. The game then progresses into a clue-like scenario. 6 patrons, 6 rooms, 6 weapons, and one person is behind all of it. </p><p>Refrain from picking up weapons, as it makes the other patrons suspicious.</p><p>Not everything is what it seems. You have no idea what you're dealing with.</p><p>Game is in mid-alpha, so expect there to be bugs that were not completely combed through before release, and probably won't be for a little while until I gather enough sanity to dredge the game files back up (I spent 3 months, 13-15 hours a day every day working on this with no aid from any other designers, programmers, artists, anything; this game is 100% a one-man project, and I get PTSD just looking at it at the moment. There are a few known bugs with the eye function, as well as some dialogue and animation issues, but 90% sure nothing game-breaking).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79d/79d39540441df2d53602b5345a78e212.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Vanduyn Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
