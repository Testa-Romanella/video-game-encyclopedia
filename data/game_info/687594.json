This is a short proof-of-concept for a project I've been working on for a while now, and while I haven't made it very far in the actual project I wanted to make use of the \"engine\" I finally got set up (and also actually have a game to release for once)!<br/></p>\n<p>Explore three colorful locations within a graveyard filled with pitfalls, ghosts, unusually large lightbulbs, and pumpkins on Halloween night, all while searching for as much candy as you can! It's based heavily on classic handheld Zeldas, but less focus on action-RPG aspects, and more on <strong>platforming</strong>. (It gets kinda difficult by the end)</p>\n<p><strong>~\u266a~\u266b~\u266a~\u266b~\u266a~\u266b~\u266a~\u266b~\u266b~\u266a~\u266b~\u266a~\u266b~\u266a~\u266b~\u266a<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Features music tracks by \ud83d\udc7b\u00a0</strong><strong>Beahives\u00a0\ud83c\udf83</strong></p>\n<p><strong>~\u266a~\u266b~\u266a~\u266b~\u266a~\u266b~\u266a~\u266b~\u266b~\u266a~\u266b~\u266a~\u266b~\u266a~\u266b~\u266a</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>~\u266a~\u266b~\u266a~\u266b~\u266a~\u266b~\u266a~\u266b~\u266b~\u266a~\u266b~\u266a~\u266b~\u266a~\u266b~\u266a</strong></p>\n<p><strong>also a song by\u00a0</strong><strong>Matt</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>~\u266a~\u266b~\u266a~\u266b~\u266a~\u266b~\u266a~\u266b~\u266b~\u266a~\u266b~\u266a~\u266b~\u266a~\u266b~\u266a</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Controls </strong>are escape for pause,\u00a0arrow keys +\u00a0Z &amp;\u00a0X, you can change Z -&gt; C in the 'controls' section of the game's menus if you like.\u00a0The project also has\u00a0<strong>gamepad support</strong>, but there isn't binding customization, so hope you get lucky with your button mapping.</p>\n<p>-------------------</p>\n<p>If you encounter any problems, please contact me on Twitter.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T05:43:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/548/548ba92a351f9fe3ca8b3d7679c4de48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["shockpine"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
