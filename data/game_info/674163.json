Recently an evil force started to take over the island. Monsters appeared, and animals turned wild. Seeing some villages destroyed by the monsters, you decide to take matters into your own hands. You go up to the evil force's lair, but it is protected by three elemental barriers. Going back home, your Gramma reminds you of an old tale: The tale of the Elemental Rings. Three rings hidden within the island, that grants powers of nature to its wielder. Naturally, such power is well protected by the Ring Guardians. Sadly they got corrupted along the local animals, so you cannot retrieve the rings peacefully. Will you be able to collect all of the rings, and save your island?</p>\n<p>(Note: since this is a demo, only the first ring can be collected, the other parts of the game simply don't exist)<br/><br/><br/><strong>CONTROLS:</strong><br/><strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Overworld:</strong><br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A - Interact<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 D-Pad - Move<br/><br/><strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Battle:</strong><br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Menus:<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A - Select<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 B - Cancel<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 D-Pad - Move cursor</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Action QTE:<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A, B, D-Pad<br/><br/><br/><strong>CREDITS:</strong></p>\n<p>Programming, Level design, Game design, Additional sprite work, SFX design:<br/>Geek_Joystick</p>\n<p>Sprite work, Game design, Additional programming:<br/>oshf<br/></p>\n<p>Music, Game Design:<br/>robotmeadows, AtsushiHdez</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T11:02:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f7/9f75387a3427bc800adb299d3b896ff7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Geek_Joystick"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
