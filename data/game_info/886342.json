Hard mode uses reduced speed and increased obstacle size, and you can get stuck on obstacles which slows you down a lot.</p>\n<p>Controls (mouse): Left click to move towards cursor. You can also use the arrow keys on your keyboard, or \"A\" + left stick on your controller.<br/></p>\n<p>I might add a larger variety of obstacles in the future to make the game more entertaining.<br/></p>\n<p>Thx for playing &amp; I'm waiting for your feedback :-)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T04:02:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b34/b34117c741f5782785f1a86d1c22f066.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bonkibot"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
