The more points the player gets, the faster the game will be.</p><p>Brief analysis of the game:<br/></p><p>Idea: After I watched the video of MsMinotaur about her \"Game a Week\" challenge I played her first game and then I came up with this idea. Basically, the player needs to score points by hitting light blue triangles and avoid the red ones, which, instead, decrease the score.</p><p>What went well: Basically the fact that I was able to come up with an idea, that I really like it and that I was able to make it in a game in just two days. Also, I really like how I \"juiced\" it.</p><p>What went wrong: I spent too much time in juice it and not enough exploring its potential. Then, there was a lot of other stuff that I wanted to implement but I didn't have time.</p><p>What I learned: Ironically, I learned the same thing that MsMinotaur learned. The project needs to start early in the week in order to have enough time to experiment with the game idea.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6c/a6ca8b5842fafb3d0826ad2bb11c1d12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ficiu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
