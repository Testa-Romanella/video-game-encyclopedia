Disgusting creatures terrorize a small seaside town in Japan as reality starts to crumble, and the Old Gods reawaken to sate their primal hunger. It's a losing battle, but maybe you've got what it takes to postpone the inevitable. The end of the world is at hand.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nWORLD OF HORROR is a love letter to the cosmic horror work of Junji Ito (\u4f0a\u85e4 \u6f64\u4e8c) and the 1-bit aesthetics of early Macintosh computers. Armed with clues, spells, and your dwindling sanity, you'll investigate mysteries all over the city \u00adand in the realms beyond.<br/>https://twitter.com/panstasz<br/>https://discord.gg/bEPAtBY\r\n<p>You can support the game by becoming a patron!\u00a0\u00a0https://www.patreon.com/worldofhorror</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72a/72a8ab4ee06a0c4630872a5a21b38cd7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 259, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["panstas"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
