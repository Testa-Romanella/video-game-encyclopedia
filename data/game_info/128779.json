Armed only with a shield, you must pilot your tank to the enemy fortress while under heavy enemy fire. There's no time to stop, as you're under the clock! Can you overcome this retro-themed reflect-em-up before the timer runs out? <strong>PLEASE NOTE:  The browser version currently doesn't run as well as the stand-alone executable. For the best experience possible, download the offline version of Reflect Raider.</strong></p><p><strong>Update 10/14/16:  Fixed a small bug where the player would get stuck on walls. New version is v0.7, v0.6 is still available for archival purposes.</strong></p><p>Visit our website for great books, music, and games!</p><p><strong>FEATURING...</strong><br/></p><p><strong>TWO LEVELS</strong></p><p><strong>GUN TURRETS</strong></p><p><strong>TANKS</strong></p><p><strong>EVIL FORTRESSES</strong></p><p><strong>RETRO CHIPTUNE BEATS BY DEFCHEF</strong></p><p><strong>GRAMMATICAL MISTAKES</strong></p><p><strong>AND MORE!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/334/33451169879f0250958537351f6a37df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["RubyCat"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
