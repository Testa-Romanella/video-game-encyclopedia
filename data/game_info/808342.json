In the mech area, you traverse a crumbling futuristic utopia where houses float and have neon pillars for walls. In the forest, there is a tribe of deer hunters, and you can escape by going up the mushroom path or the dead area with wilting trees. In Joe's restaurant, see the seating area, kitchens, and freezer while jumping on bouncy cake and pizza. Finally, there is the White House, which references the previous areas, in the maze of rooms.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is a mix of 3D platforming, and a 3D shooter. However, your gun is the Succ Gun, which can both shoot and suck in slimes to use as ammo. The areas vary in which mechanics are tested, and there are mini-challenges to find costumes and complete the mini-test to equip them.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the\u00a0Summer Slow Jams June 2022: Character Creator. The theme was unintended consequences, so we decided to make the enemies the characters you decided not to pick during the character selector scene. Also, this is the first game jam for our programmer &amp; artist.</p>\n<p><strong>Play Time:</strong>\u00a020-30 Minutes\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\u00a0Mouse (left-click = shoot, right-click = suck), and Keyboard (P/Esc to pause)</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Ian Connors: 3D Art &amp; Animation\r\n</li><li>Caleb Kahn: Overworld Design &amp; Programming\r\n</li><li>Surreal: Music</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T17:01:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/012/0120faa45d654376ac73909b4b7cad96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["EmptyWisp"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
