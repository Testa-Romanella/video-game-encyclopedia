To do that you will have to move, jump, avoid things, and try not to fall. That is it, really. I was initially inspired by SkyRoads, a game I used to love and had been playing recently, but the game ended up diverging from that formula to some degree.</p><p>This game was created as my introduction to Unity, so it is simple, rough, and very short. If you have any problems with the game, let me know, and I will try to address them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37f/37faeece23a4547314117201fe8943b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["PicoFoundry"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
