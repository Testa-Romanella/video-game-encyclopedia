It is honest work, but the farm has a bit of a history.</p>\n<p>A set of train tracks split the land and barricade the farm from a lively forest. The only way to prevent this forest from spreading to the farm is to keep the shrine full on top of doing your chores.<br/></p>\n<p>Be careful as staying in the forest for too long can impact your sanity. Many people who have explored these woods reported unnatural activity -from how quickly they got lost, to encountering a man looking for a new head to fit him.</p>\n<p>Everyone has a different experience, but one thing stays the same; when a train comes, you do not want to get caught on the other side of the tracks.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>This is my first game and it is still undergoing minor development. There are a few bugs that I am aware of but hopefully nothing game-breaking!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Content warning:</strong> Contains blood and gore<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T08:42:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/125/125df483246344a4af9bd4e1d0052765.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Twisted Corridor"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
