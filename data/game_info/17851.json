The players have to mine the resources and to protect the colony from environmental hazards, such as water and lava and different enemies.</p>\n<p>The main objective of the game is to mine resources and find special caves. All of this earns the players gold, which can be spent for spawning new dwarves, upgrading the existing ones or build the town up.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the game, the players choose which difficulty setting to play on and set a time limit. The game ends if the time limit expires or the town gets destroyed.</p>\n<h3>Units</h3>\n<p>The game features two kinds of dwarves: warriors, and diggers.</p>\n<p>Warriors participate in combat, and their numbers are limited. It is possible to spawn more warriors by upgrading a Town Hall or an Outpost. The warriors can also be trained on the Outpost. While not in combat, they will roam around your town and patrol it. </p>\n<p>Diggers, on the other hand, spawn automatically at Town Halls and Outposts. While walking back and forth in the town, they generate resources. If a digger gets scared by a nearby combat situation, they can dig themselves. Sometimes this works against the diggers as they dig into the support walls the hold the water off.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:55:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/857/857c69f58359e999c195ebd4f72cecbc.jpg", "website": "http://www.dwarfs-game.com/", "rating": 2.34, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 40, "owned": 1167, "beaten": 9, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 22}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 29, "ratings_count": 53, "suggestions_count": 245, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 53, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Power of 2"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tripwire Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
