We aim to fill this gap. Additionally, Joustrich exhausts the possibilities of whacky movement controls that bird-based movement combined with twin-stick shooter-like combat offers.</p>\r\nSteering those damned birds\r\n<ul>\n<li>While not airborne your ostrich can accelerate towards high speed and move to the left/right</li>\n<li>Ostriches can jump and flutter a little bit through the air</li>\n</ul>\r\nStick \u2018em with the pointy end\r\n<ul>\n<li>At the same time as moving you need to control your weapon and aim at the enemy knights</li>\n<li>You can thrust your lance forward to throw it at the enemies</li>\n<li>After throwing the lance it sticks in the ground and you have to go and retrieve it!</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>(It only works with XBOX Controllers for now!)</p>\n\n<p>Game Design, Programming and Game Art by:<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Music by:<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Tilemap by the awesome Kenney!</p>\n\n<p><em>Joustrich </em>was developed as a student project at the University of Applied Sciences in Salzburg.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T07:26:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9d/b9d78fdd95c488c803f2372dd6bc7a01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RaMo_teamhellep", "The Pigeon Protocol", "MalevolentGoat"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
