{"id": 551808, "slug": "blobapart", "name": "BlobApart", "name_original": "BlobApart", "description": "<p>This game was meant to be for the btp game jam 3, I actually finished the game on time, but I couldn't submit it on time because I had trouble exporting it, and launching it on itch.io. And also, it was late at night at like 3am from where I live, and I had no idea that the jam ends at 6am, I assumed that the jam will end at 4pm just like when it started.\u00a0So here's the game and you could play it</p><p>THE GAME:</p><p>This is a cute puzzle game where you have to place red blobs or green blobs. The red blobs need to reach the finish line to win, but the green blobs need to stay away from the finish line. However, in the level, there are always blue blobs. There will be less blue blobs the more red or green blobs you have. You lose if a blue blob touches any of your blobs. So.... Why don't we just use a lot of red blobs and remove all the blue blobs??? Well, first of all, you need ALL the red blobs to reach the finish line in order to win. Secondly, blue blobs might reach some places your blobs couldn't. So it's your job to properly plan out and place these blobs... Good luck and enjoy!</p><p>CREDITS:</p><p>Programming, Art, Music, SFX: ME, all made during the jam</p><p>Font: Stay and Shine</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T11:23:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79d/79d7ccc3c910666fe70bc37c70841682.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["No whOne"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
