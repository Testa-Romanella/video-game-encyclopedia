It was created for\u00a0\u00a0Tower Jam\u00a0all the way back in 2013. <em>Remains of the Day </em>is\u00a0based on the Dragon\u00a0Age 2 quest\u00a0\"All That Remains\". Similar to the quest, it's impossible to rescue Leandra from her fate, but I wrote it to give her a little more agency than sitting around waiting for death or rescue.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Note:\u00a0<em>Remains</em> was created in an older version of Twine 1, and despite my best efforts, I was unable to successfully convert it to a format editable in Twine 2, so the formatting can be a little funky during play.
