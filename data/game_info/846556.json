Players were only given a non-damaging freeze gun, so they have no choice but to freeze enemies over traps to inflict damage. Freezing can easily be abused in a 1v1 scenario, so multiple enemies would be spawned in.</p>\n<p>The game would progress in a level-style, where there would be a few stages before a boss. A boss would be fought 1v1, possibly spawning more enemies as time goes on.</p>\n<p>I wanted to at least program the main mechanic in, and I'm glad we were able to finish that part in time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T08:47:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da9/da967e9d8c657fff7b0b84a668dabf9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RocketRaccoon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
