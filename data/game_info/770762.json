I have estimated that you will only need 1 minute for 10 eggs hence you are given 300 seconds to complete your task.</p>\n<p>Have fun playing my game and happy Easter celebrations.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T14:29:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a3/6a38bbc0a2d998ba71fff3ff3c88f2d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["John Delvin"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
