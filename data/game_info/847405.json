A secondary responsibility of the worker bee is to replant flowers at the cost of honey.</p>\n<p>- Drone Bees are responsible for keeping the hive safe by either defending against incoming enemies of the hive or by attacking potential threats.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Credits</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>Ruan Lombaard - Designer / Developer</p>\n<p>Juan-Andre Lombard\u00a0- Sound Designer / Assistant UI Designer</p>\n<p>Tiaan Joubert - UI Designer / Assistant Developer<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T14:43:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ed/1edabc73791ab77f7a8d2811825ec847.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Coded Cookie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
