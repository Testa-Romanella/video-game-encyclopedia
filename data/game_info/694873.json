It was a practice of my Unity skills, de facto a prototype.

The green tank bears a more advanced barrel.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-15T05:43:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7c/b7cd891e77e7b5e004033bad1aec91ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["YuzenPro"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
