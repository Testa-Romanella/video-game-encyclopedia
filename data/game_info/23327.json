With the game inspired by Symphony of the Night, Super Metroid and the Souls series, your duty is to rid London of the Eldritch horrors unleashed by the Citadel.<br />\nGameplay<br />\nUsurper&#39;s battle system is built around Focus; allowing anyone to get into the game, yet still providing a high skill ceiling for those players looking for a challenge. With eight different stats to spec into (along with stat reallocation), countless varieties of character builds are possible. Usurper also features over 90 different weapons and spells; from swords, spears, axes, great swords, sycthes, whips, katanas, rapiers, daggers, bows, guns, rifles, canons, spells and summons.<br />\nIf you&#39;re looking for even more content, then there are innumerable secrets, additional areas and optional bosses to discover. Or perhaps you&#39;d rather set your own difficulty by activating special conditions such as; no focus mode, 1 HP mode, perma-death, or a built-in speedrunning mode.<br />\nHowever you choose to play, The Citadel is a massive and versatile interconnected world. There are countless shortcuts to uncover, and a variety of diverse areas; from human towns to alien landscapes, grand libraries to ethereal gardens, and from an eldritch engine to a crashed spaceship.<br />\nStory<br />\nUsurper takes place in an alternative timeline of 1898 in London. The outer worldly Citadel has landed in the city causing massive panic and releasing the maddening Fog. Recently re-crowned Empress Eleanor has assembled the royal forces and her four most loyal Knights to enter the Citadel - in the hopes of learning more, and hopefully finding a way to rid London of this terror. Meanwhile, Waltham, the leader of the Veimar, uses his own forces to ascend the Citadel and challenge the Navigator for his own...purposes...<br />\nUsurper is a sequel to Shrouded in Sanity, however, knowledge of the first game is not necessary.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T06:21:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ced/cedf46e741e601031cd1cb61e9e05598.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 138, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 18, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 401, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pugware"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pugware"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
