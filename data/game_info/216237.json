You are escaping from a space prison and shoot move the enemies. Good luck!</p>\n<p>The goal is score.\u00a0 When the bar is not full, you gain 60 points per second. When the bar is full, you get 3 times more!</p>\n<p>Using the laser will empty the bar a bit. When full, you also have access to a powerful blue laser, that gives a huge number of points when used on a large group of enemy.<br/></p>\n<p>I first wanted to make the world move, not the player. But that is almost the same thing. So I improvised.</p>\n<p>I soon realized it was too easy to just spam the lasers to never get killed. That is why I added the score system. The game rewards you for not shooting. That is even more obvious when the energy bar is full!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/236/23682e0e9e3b593be318e6a61e312182.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["underdisk"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
