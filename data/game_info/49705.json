Start with one or few controllable fragments and lead them to collect missing parts.<br/>\r\nBut be aware, there are many opportunities to lose: get stuck in hallway; add an extra piece not where you want it; accidentally destroy the necessary part of the shape etc.<br/>\r\nOn the other hand, wave-like complexity, melodic soundtrack, exclusively created for this game, a variety of mechanics are softening possible frustrations of fails.<br/>\r\nAll of this makes you learn every step and enjoy every victory. Complete all 70 lovely-crafted levels and become master of square assembling!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d6/1d63b90ead9bfd61d28f0add75f20b4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 33}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 27, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KirUn", "algamedev", "Alexander M"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["KirUn"], "esrb_rating": null}
