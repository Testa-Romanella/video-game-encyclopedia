However one day she manages to get stuck outside and decides to make an adventure of it by searching for her favorite outside snack- daisies. Bean is also allergic to pink flowers and must remind herself to not mistake the daisies for the pink flowers. While on the hunt for her favorite snack Bean also must avoid the cat next door\u2026 evil Quincy. Quincy is the top cat in town, and is extremely protective of his territory, which in this case also means Bean\u2019s Backyard. The only thing these two cats have in common are their tastebuds, as daisies are also Quincy\u2019s favorite delicacy. Bean must avoid Quincy and remember to not eat the pink flowers if she wants to have a good Backyard Adventure.</p><ul><ul><li>Play as Bean, a cute ditsy kitten who is on the search for flowers.</li><li>Avoid Evil Quincy or lose health!</li><li>Eat 5 daisies to win, but avoid the toxic pink flowers!</li><li>Will you be able to escape the cat next door?</li></ul></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T05:10:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7d/f7d80b5f2f3bca2869c344baf827c9ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["emmachase"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
