But timetravelling is bad for the body. Everyone knows that... So you age very fast!\r\n<p>Your age is your health. Luckily the mage invented magic stones, which can alter your age. Old to young and young to old.</p>\n<p>The older you are the more damage and speed get your fireballs, also you use your magic to jump higher, but you see less of the gamescreen.</p>\n<p>This short game was made for the GameDev.tv Community Jam and concludes just one timeperiod: Ancient Egypt. While you fight your way through a pyramid and defeat a boss in the last chamber, you get a few hints about the gods of egypt.</p>\n<p>Music and part of the SFX\u00a0 by: Soundimage.org, Eric Matyas</p>\n<p>Some other SFX: Found on freesound.org</p>\n<p>Everything else by me.</p>\n<p>I hope you have fun with my game and please leave me a feedback.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot</p>\n<p>Dominik / Exitus19</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T05:21:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad6/ad6053e808519e50d4d26d45b0ea70b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Exitus19"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
