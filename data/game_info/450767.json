But it's even harder if you don't know who your godly parent is and can't pray for support. Take this quiz and answers some questions to reveal your godly parent and know where your demigod lineage comes from!</p>\r\nNotes:\r\n<p>Quiz is based off of your personality and not on the tropes of the gods. So liking pink doesn't give you Aphrodite and liking skulls doesn't give you Hades. With this in mind, answer the questions honestly and you might learn more about yourself along with who your greek god parent it.</p>\n<p>The quiz is also not finished, leave comments for potential changes in questions and if you find any typos. I am also looking for some art to add to the quiz, if you have an interest in showing off your art and draw in a black and white style reach out to me.</p>\r\nPotential Gods:\u00a0\r\n<p>Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Apollo, Hephaestus, Ares, Athena, Artemis, Hermes, Dionysus, Aphrodite, Demeter, Hera, Hecate, Iris, Tyche, Nike, Nemesis, Hypnos, Morpheus, Thanatos, Eros, Persephone.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T04:18:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2cd/2cd613ad3dc081541c78d1672e786624.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["treecki"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
