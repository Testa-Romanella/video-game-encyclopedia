Your focus is on survival as you manage resources like food, morale, and time while facing various challenges.</p>\n<p>You begin each game with a basic deck of cards that you can use to explore the island, scavenge for resources, and encounter events. As you progress through the game, you'll earn rewards that can be used to improve your deck and increase your chances of survival.\r\n</p>\n<p>Event cards have a limited time to complete, and if left unaddressed, they will cause setbacks for your team. You must balance your exploration with your need to complete events, manage your resources, and overcome obstacles to survive.\r\n</p>\n<p>One of the main goals is to reach a high enough escape progress to find a way out of the island and win the game.

With each new loop, you must adapt and try new tactics to overcome the challenges that stand in your way.\r\n</p>\n<p>Whether you're a fan of roguelike deck-builders, survival games, or just looking for a new challenge, this game offers a rich and immersive experience full of mystery and intrigue.
