What Windows/Android\u00a0 you use,\u00a0 what device (if android),\u00a0how often a player comes back, from what country players come etc.\u00a0 I didn't sell those data nor am i or have i been able to track this data down to a specific person since i dont collect device IDs, accounts, emails or anything like that.</p><p>Any data collected will be deleted and further data (if you keep playing the downloaded version) will not be stored anymore.</p><p>------------</p><p>Waves of monster invade your home in this round based game. You have a choice of bouncy magic balls which will bounce off the invaders and walls to make them retreat.<br/><br/>During gameplay you can aquire new kinds of bouncy magic balls (normal, freezing, area damage etc.) which will help you, combined with proper tactics and careful aiming, to defeat the enemies.<br/>In your laboratory you can build a queue of those balls to make a unique strategy fitting your current situation.\u00a0<br/>You need to stop them with bouncy freezing balls? They are tightly packed in a place so you can hit them with area damage balls? Go for it!<br/><br/>With each defeated energy you gain magical energy which you can use for powerful extra attacks like pushing back the enemies or pulling them with a black hole to a location.<br/><br/>Bounce your way to higher levels! Meet new enemies with unique abilites.<br/>There are rumors that a mummy might sometime heal.. spiders throwing sticky webs to catch your balls, dragons breathing long distance fire at you and so on!<br/><br/>If you find a bug, have some idea for a new feature, improvement or balancing, please dont hesitate to contact me.</p>\n\n<p>Note : Current soft level limit is 100. After that you will experience 99 waves per level with increasing difficulty per wave</p>\n<p>Also note: Game was developed primarily for mobile.\u00a0 Menus might appear large on desktop. Gameplay is well suited for desktop too though.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/792/792fd98a2db92513370b9c38b7c3acc9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 224, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["drizztfun"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
