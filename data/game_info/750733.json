It is more of an interactive fiction title that I started to put together for my MA. If you want to be able to read more about how it came about you can follow the link to my website\u00a0here.\u00a0See the Rapid Ideation Week 4!</p>\n<p>In A Murderer of Crows, you play a small crow that is pushed into a little adventure. It works like a Fighting Fantasy book of old where you turn to another page. I made the game in Bitsy, which is a fantastic mini-games dev package that you can run in a browser and is perfect for Interactive Fiction.</p>\n<p>I do plan to keep iterating on this project. I think it has got something about it that is well worth pursuing and there was so much more that I wanted to include before I ran out of time!<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you for looking</p>\n<p>Rupert</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T04:51:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7aa/7aa184c423a93ccd018a38446c412e2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rupert Holdship"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
