You break aliments.</li><li>MeatChop: The one at the middle, you control it by holding [J]. You fill a basket with meat</li><li>Coffee Machine: The one at the left, you toggle it on/off by pressing [V]. You fill a coffee cup.</li></ul><p>You must match the stuff they make with the stuff the sign at their top displays.<br/>It may seem like an easy task, but controlling 3 machines at the same time is really hard! Try to get a friend to control some of the machines!</p><p>In the main menu you can disable some of the machines, or change the difficulty! You can only disable 2 machines at the same time.</p><p>Difficulty changes how many points you lose by not matching an item, and changes the behaviour of the SlapChop.</p>Tips:<ul><li>Get a friend to play with you!!</li><li>Disable some of the machines in the Main Menu</li><li>Focus on the SlapChop and MeatChop, as the Coffee Machine is easier to control!</li></ul>Known Bugs:<ul><li>When you lose, in the \"Game Over\" screen, there are some zeroes at the bottom, no idea what's causing it!</li></ul><p>Feel free to report any bugs you find!</p><p>Made for #LDJam Compo in less than 48 hours by TajamSoft.<br/>Enjoy! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab5/ab585ce8081a57cb73e256da8f4f4209.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TajamSoft"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
