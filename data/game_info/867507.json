You can see all the controls from the main menu and change them if you'd like.</p>\n<p>I have not play tested much, so it's probably extremely rough around the edges.<br/></p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Music is by The Wilted Lotus:</p>\n<p>-Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/thewiltedlotus<br/></p>\n<p>-Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/thewiltedlotus<br/></p>\n<p>Please support them!
