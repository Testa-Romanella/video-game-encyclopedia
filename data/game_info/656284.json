Bombs spawn everywhere in the room, rampantly. The player is tasked to escape each room of the simulation in a time span of 28 seconds - the time it takes for a room to completely blow up. Use the abilities given to you to make it out alive.</p>\n<p>Try to accomplish the game in the fastest time possible!
