Be careful of your ceilings! Depending on how tall you are and how low your ceiling is, you might just hit the ceiling with your controller. I did it during development a few times :( . I don't want anyone else to! Can't have that on my conscience, so be careful! With the hoop-height adjustment in the right controller, you can comfortably play sitting down, if you like.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9de/9de5e2c0159ab773959d481b261580fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gsgs"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
