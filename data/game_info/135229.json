One player controls the Pilot - dodging asteroids, collecting upgrades and scoring points. While the other player is the Tactical Officer, who must constantly type commands to keep the ship running, input the upgrades the pilot is collecting and navigate the ship towards the points. The faster the Pilot flies, the less the Tactical Officer must do to keep the ship going!<br/></p><p>Winner of the Global Game Jam Glasgow 2017 \"Best Game\" Award!</p><p>The game was designed to have a split down the screen, blocking the players' views of each other's screens.
