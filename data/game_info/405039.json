It's quite light on content, but the focus of this project was on building complex systems within Construct 2. <br/></p>\n\n<p>This project taught me a lot about working within the constraints of an unfamiliar engine and I think it has provided valuable experience for me to carry onward.</p>\n\n<p>You can play the game on this page and the Construct 2 project file is available for download also.</p>\n<p>Primary Game Features:<br/>-Procedural Floor Generation, built for expansion<br/>-Upgrade System, built for expansion<br/>-Unique Enemies<br/>-End of Floor Boss Battle<br/>-Basic Minimap<br/></p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: I do not own any of the art/audio assets in this project and any credit for them should go their orginal authors as detailed below.
