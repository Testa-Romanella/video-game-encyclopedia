Drive or run and pickup packages. You will get coins for picked packages and for smashing zombies and mutants. Use your coins to get better cars, hand and vehicle weapons and decorations for your dashboard.<br/><br/>Once you are a senior courier (finish level 4), you will be able to choose, if you want to just drive fast, do stunts or run. There are also time limited challenges to earn extra coins in bonuses and leader boards. Challenge your friends or the whole world!<br/><br/>You will never see ads unless you want to watch them for extra coins. With or without microtransactions, everybody will reach the same final upgrades so competing on leader boards will always be fair and only your skills count at the end.<br/><br/>Enjoy your first day at work and thank you for risking your life.<br/><br/>Best regards,<br/><br/>The Management.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T20:24:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43d/43d6f00703dbb4522281f8d335c1f111.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 333, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SpinningDevs"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
