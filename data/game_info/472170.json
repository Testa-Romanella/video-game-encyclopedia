Get ready for a hilariously chaotic time!</p>\n<p><strong>Runners on Stream</strong> can be perfectly played in the background while afk, as the game runs on an autoloop: guess, run, win! Play it while on breaks, on intro screens etc. as a means to entertain your viewers while away or play it actively, for raffles for example.</p>\n<br/>\ud83d\udee0 How it works\r\n<p>When a round starts, the runners will spawn on the track. Every runner represents a randomly picked Emote from Twitch, FrankerFaceZ, BetterTTV and your channel. Now anyone in your channel's chat can place a guess with \"!lanenumber\" or with the emote itself. The overall guesses are displayed on the track. After the guessing phase the runners will start to run and compete against each other. The winner will be displayed after the finish line is reached.</p>\n\r\n\ud83d\udcfd OBS Overlay guide\r\n<p>The <strong>black background</strong> of the game is <strong>transparent</strong>.
