Each High, Mid and Low area of your player has it's own health point which reduce your players weight. <br/><br/></p>\n<p>PC Port also coming soon!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong><br/>* Due to the small scale and development time of this project, a highly stable WiFi Network is recommended.</p>\n<p>*If it wasn't clear, this does not work over the internet or a large company network with fire-walling. This is designed to be played on a local home WiFi. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T04:06:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/045/045ebeb94cf725176910e67b2a61b954.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["GingerNingerish"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
