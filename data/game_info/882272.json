At the time I started it I was doing a lot of reading around themes of loneliness, immigration and isolating othernesses. It also serves as a test for my research project <em>Storymaker World.</em><br/></p>\n<p>People who use <em>Bitsy </em>regularly  often reflect upon how much it allows for and fosters an environment  for small, private stories, an environment that naturally lends itself to anecdotal, narrative based experiences. <em>Memory Empire </em>is  certainly like that: its rooms host poetry, dialogues about gardens,  quiet in the library, and a number of creatures big and small. It is  also a project that has been ongoing since I started it in 2021. Each  new room is another memory. In that way, the game is as much a diary as  it is a reflection of my last year of the PhD, my childhood, my  understanding of isolation and missing home, and the ways in which I  used my creative practice to make those feelings digestible and  relatable for an audience of players.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T16:34:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/867/8670d16c4c1926883bbe969290188935.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["rynezion"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
