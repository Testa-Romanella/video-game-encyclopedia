This game is a WORK IN PROGRESS and is very basic at the moment! Arenas, Levels and even Multiplayer will be added in the future. For now the game consists of this:Point and click to shoot at enemies! It's that easy! Once enough of your bullets have hit an enemy, it will be destroyed. If your bullets hit an enemy, you will be awarded points! You get more points once you destroy the enemy. There are three types of enemies; The FAST enemy (blue), The NORMAL enemy (Red) and The STRONG enemy (black). Each of these enemies have different properties, such as Hit points and speed. Some will also award you more points than others!The goal of the game is to destroy as many enemies as possible and get as much points as you can, while simultaneously avoiding death! If an enemy touches you, the game ends!As of this version of the game, there is a settings screen that allows you to change ANY property of an enemy, such as the time it takes for it to spawn in and its spawning rate. This will be removed in the future.\r\n</p>\r\nPlans for the game:\r\n<p>Future versions of the game will contain multiple arenas, campaign levels and Multiplayer! If you choose to support this game and want these kinds of things in the game, please support me and this game! This is my first game ever on Gamemaker studio 2 and I worked really hard on it! It would really appreciate your help! If I get enough support, and this gets large enough, I could move this onto other platforms like itch.io and Steam!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE 1.2 CHANGELOG\r\n<p>This is a pretty big update! I worked on it for a very long time! Make sure to check it out and give feedback!\r\n</p>\n<p>The changelog is here:\u00a0https://pastebin.com/mMVN8wwy\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T10:54:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13e/13e5135cd528a05c395d2220eb3ca25e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NikoAnimation"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
