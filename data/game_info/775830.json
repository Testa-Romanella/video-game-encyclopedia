{"id": 775830, "slug": "mythic-realms", "name": "Mythic Realms", "name_original": "Mythic Realms", "description": "<p>What is Mythic Realms-<br/>It is an RPG game similar to that of traditional tabletop games with one exception, the entire game is a Create your based system in where you and your friends create the items while in-game. Then with the help of your imagination, you would type out your moves (similar to that of traditional RP) with an action menu to act like a gm and tell you if you succeeded or failed.<br/><br/>Why Play Mythic Realms-<br/>This game is fully customizable that you could create stories for other games or make your gameplay into a book (or submit your gameplay on your popular story web page). Simply choose on the main menu what you want to export (the story, chat logs, actions, Player Information) And the game will create your file based on your saved data.<br/><br/>When Will Mythic Realms Be Playable-<br/>At the moment I am the sole creator, so it will take a bit of time to flush everything out and fix all the bugs thus far, But the game is in its testing stages so a lot of things are still pending, but manual input and small calculations are done and ready to play. The only thing not finished is actions.<br/><br/>How Can you Help?-<br/>Raise awareness of my game!! lol, I'm always looking for people to help out and share ideas with. If you would like to volunteer to be a part of the creative process let me know!<br/><br/><br/>----------------------------<br/><br/>Update Version 0.2.6.8\u00a0<br/><br/>0.2.6.8 Has completely altered the game book pages to a more pleasing look, I go further in detail with this in the discord but essentially the text shown in the book has been changed to show a more proper format when the player is not editing the page. In previous versions the text was fixed in a sequential order of name, world time, foreground text, background text, rp text and finally action text. Now you can change that order as you see fit per page created. So if you need the foreground text after the rp text, you can. Map info has been added to the game, displaying nearby items, map settings, action text, and editor records. The rename and delete editor records have been fixed and will now display a review of all items changed to reflect the new modifications. Quests are now possible in the character creator.<br/><br/>Proficiencies has been updated to accept points in a more familiar manor. the old manual input is still there for the character creator but the proficiencies hud is a great alternative.<br/><br/>This update removes 3d objects for now saving space, the total size of the game has been reduced to 512mb from its previous 3.1gb. In the future i hope to have a slimmer version of the 3d side, or have multiple dlcs with alternative themes.<br/><br/>There are a few bugs found in creating the video for this update, But a lot of the functions are there and available.<br/><br/><br/>Future updates will be to fix the bugs with the selections. it seems each time i add new variables to it, the old ones loose their way in the code. Once that is fixed up, ill be adding a rotate function to the menus for those wishing to play in single-player mode with multiple people using a table with a tv in it. I've been very interested in seeing this game be used wide scale without the use of the game book. It all depends on the players preferences of course. After that will be multiple huds, i want the ability to look at one character while also manipulating another. With the table idea i also want to slim the map down into the world info hud, so you can move the map around at will and rest your figurines on the space given.<br/><br/>--------------<br/>For the latest releases visit the patreon page and get access to the early builds<br/>https://www.patreon.com/OtterlyGames<br/>Visit us on the discord server where you can engage with me the creator as well as the fans of Mythic Realms<br/>https://discord.gg/C64HKuzAjv<br/>Want to see more?!<br/>Check me out on twitch as I code the game and see features not implemented in the public releases!
