Right now game only offers basic gunplay - Free For All gamemode with weapons dropped on ground.</p>\n<p>Check out controls guide below, pick a name to differentiate from other people (nametag will appear to other players screens) if you actually want to somewhat enjoy the game bring 1-2 of your friends to shoot around, we had bots implemented but I had to remove it because it wasn't fully polished and ready. So at the moment game is completely dependent on multiplayer.</p>\n<p><strong>Basic controls and tips:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>WASD </strong>to walk, full screen recommended to avoid bugging out on some devices.</li><li><strong>Hover over a weapon with mouse cursor (and crosshair) and press E</strong> to pick up a weapon when you stand near it.</li><li><strong>Move mouse to aim your weapon, LMB to fire, RMB to zoom</strong><strong>, R to reload.</strong></li><li><strong>X\u00a0</strong>to drop weapon in hand, <strong>1 and 2</strong> to switch between primary and secondary weapon.<br/><br/>Pick the name when you join a game, or press Play to go with a randomly picked one.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69e/69e4a4520800063c40088c373ffb8e3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Powerworks"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
