You can experience some small bugs with the hitbox or the UI, for exemple. But I intentionally decided to let the game at the stage it was when we finished it, in order to have a memory of what we were capable of doing at this moment. To see how I progressed.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks,\u00a0Have fun !!</p>\n<p>Abdou Sopo\u00a0twitter - instagram - twitch</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T09:12:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/677/67700fc838ee2df825efd434d2c91970.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Abdou Sopo"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
