But I\u00a0watched half of it, thinking the on-demand service of my cable-tv-provider would keep the movie, but I\u00a0was wrong and they erased it. So the game is the movie, for the first half, the second half is a work of my imagination. I\u00a0later could finish the movie, and it turned out totally different than what I\u00a0imagined here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T07:35:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63f/63f0b1277e5f44aa2ff56a7b3579de4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["mauisland"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
