No country's firepower or nuclear weapons can put a dent in it's skin. The world's only hope is a mysterious biologist, who sets off on a mission to enter the body of the\u00a0<em>Gargantuan\u00a0</em>and tear it apart from the inside.</p>\n<p>Explore the cavernous\u00a0innards of the <em>Gargantuan</em> and shred apart any of its giant organs you come across with your blaster and chainsaw. Your primary target is the <em>brain</em>. Destroy it, and the beast will fall. However, the <em>Gargantuan brain</em> is a formidable entity\u00a0- so you may choose to eliminate the weaker organs first to ease your final battle. Will you play it safe, or risk it all?</p>\r\nv1.2.3 Update: Gauntlet Mode\r\n<p>An additional game mode has been added that allows you to fight all the organs one after another at maximum difficulty. This is for if you'd prefer to experience just the boss fights with no exploration in between, or if you're looking for more a challenge.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD to run, jump, climb walls and wall-jump</li><li>Aim your weapon with your mouse, and left-click to attack</li><li>Use the mouse's scroll-wheel to switch between your ranged bio-blaster and melee bone-saw</li><li>Hold E while standing in mucus to reload your ammo and heal a slither of health</li><li>For the .exe version of the game, press ALT + ENTER to enter full screen mode</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The<em> Gargantuan</em> is a humanoid creature. Thus, its organs will be laid out in a similar manner as yours and mine. Keep this in mind if you're trying to hunt down a specific organ.</li><li>Play with <em>assist mode</em> on for your first playthrough to help you get introduced to the game's difficulty.</li><li>If you're not confident in your skills and you just want to experience all the boss fights, play with <em>freeplay</em> mode on to prevent death.</li><li>Small cell enemies drop health pickups.</li><li>Most walls can be scaled with the player's vertical wall-jump.</li><li>Defeating lesser organs will increase your maximum health.</li><li>This game is non-linear, with many branching paths. You can choose to skip bosses, or fight all of them.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Developer Notes:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>This was made for my first proper Game Jam.\u00a0I made I.E in about 37 days for this Jam while working on it casually, so sorry if there are any bugs/inconsistencies, lack of polish, or if any parts seem rushed or unbalanced. I wanted to add more organ boss fights, like the heart, stomach and spinal chord. I <em>may\u00a0</em>add more to this game in the future, but it'd be tricky since I'd probably have to rework a lot of the map's layout and variables that affect other bosses, both of which took AGES.</li><li>I stripped back a lot of the game's difficulty near the end of the Jam as I realized it'd be harder for people playing casually to experience all the bosses. More specifically, I:<ul><li>Doubled the maximum ammo</li><li>Halved the reload time</li><li>Added hp recovery when mucus-recharging</li><li>Added the assist and freeplay modes</li><li>Lowered the power and speed of some of the boss' attacks</li></ul></li><li>There's also a lot of 2D lighting in the game, so it might not run well in a browser.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>I worked on this game entirely by myself, doing all the programming and a majority of the art.
