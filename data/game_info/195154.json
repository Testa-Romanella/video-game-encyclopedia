Benjamin Phillips)", "description": "<p>I started out by making this paper map as a rough outline for my level. It shows the basic level progression, from the player's start point to the end goal. The game is played from a first person perspective, and the mechanics used were a ladder climbing mechanic, a block pushing mechanic, a jetpack mechanic, and kill volume mechanics.* Additionally, I was able to script my own tutorial and a checkpoint system. I even created some moving kill volumes towards the end of the level. This level was built around those mechanics. After I ironed out this outline, I started building the level. After a couple weeks of building, play-testing, and fine tuning I ended up with this finished version.</p>\n<p>Note: Press the lock cursor button to lock the cursor to the center of the game.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>*Note#2: The mechanics featured in this level were all programmed by Dean Soeder, and his portfolio can be found here.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>All sounds are from FreeSound.org.<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Year of production: Spring 2015<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d86/d86b788f0cede604297ddfa3717c9a61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["S.
