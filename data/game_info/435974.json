We shall call her the \"Mother Tree\"\r\n<br/>\r\nWe will help spread her roots to nourish her, gathering both water and nutrients.\r\n<br/>\r\nWe must monitor our reserves carefully. Sunlight is used to learn, water to defend, and\u00a0nutrients to build.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter gathering enough sunlight and resources, we shall sprout life from these roots.\r\n\r\nCome nightfall, the spirits will come to claim Mother's life. We will stop them.\r\n\r\nFinding shrines throughout the grove will let us learn how to grow new and helpful life.\r\n\r\nEventually, we will find the 3 ritual towers and empower them to keep the grove safe.\r\n\r\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p><strong>W A S D -\u00a0</strong>Movement</p>\n<p><strong>Left Click (on\u00a0grass / resource plots) -\u00a0</strong>Plant roots<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Left Click (on roots / plants)</strong> - Open info pane</p>\n<p><strong>Right\u00a0Click -\u00a0</strong>Quick close info pane<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Right\u00a0Click\u00a0(on roots) - </strong>Kill roots</p>\n<p><strong>Z -</strong> Speed up time (only during the day)</p>\r\nTips:\r\n<p>- Make sure you establish roots on nutrients first, you'll need more nutrients to make new roots.</p>\n<p>- You need to connect your roots to a shrine before you can use it</p>\n<p>- Make sure you experiment with different plant types.</p>\n<p>- The amount of attacking spirits is double the current day number.
