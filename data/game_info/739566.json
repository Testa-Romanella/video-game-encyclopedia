To achieve this you use all the weapons that appear from time to time to kill as many enemies as possible and then pass to the next level.</p>\n<p>Among the weapons that will help you move forward and face stronger and stronger enemies are a laser rifle, a plasma shotgun , missiles, bombs, a canon, and some other more. All of them will appear randomly on the stage, so you must be very attentive and always ready.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1997-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-16T20:06:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/114/114e5089481c6ce72071f08dea8e7019.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
