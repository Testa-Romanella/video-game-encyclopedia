You can change the direction of a control arrow by right clicking and drag them to different controls by holding the left mouse button. As the game progresses, you will have more elements to bind your keys and gradually become less \"out of control\". You should mix and match them to solve any puzzle you're facing. Good luck, and have fun!</p><p><strong>Additional credits:</strong><br/></p><p>Sound effects from freesound.org and zapsplat.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T14:02:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00b/00be517ec751a6ad900519eb83e8347d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sunstruck"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
