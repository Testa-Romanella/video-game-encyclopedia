To ensure the safety of yourself and everyone at the asteroid mining station, you can only make pipeline moves that will maintain an unbroken loop of pipeline.</p>\n<p>Reidemeister Station was the winner of the 31st GM48 game jam, and what you're now looking at is an improved upon version of the game with some bug fixes, more levels, and quality of life additions.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is inspired by an obscure field of mathematics - knot theory; in which German mathematician Kurt Reidemeister describes just three moves that can untie certain types of knot. These moves are known as the Reidemeister moves, and are used in the game.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls: </strong>Mouse-only. Left click and Right click to move pipes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T05:03:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1b/a1b0a8b8e79c151bd967ad77341fbce0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["topherlicious", "meseta", "GiftOfDeath"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
