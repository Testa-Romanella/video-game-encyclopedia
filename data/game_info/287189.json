Instead, <strong>every session you play, you add your personal saving score to a global worldwide score</strong>, counting <em>all the squids saved around the planet</em>! <strong><em>Come and help us save some squids!</em></strong><br/>_______________________________________________________________________________________<em><strong>Better with controller!<br/></strong>but we love keyboard users too so</em><br/><strong>Keyboard Controls:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Move: </strong><br/>Classic WASD (or ZQSD) or Arrows<br/><strong>Shoot a bubble :</strong><br/>Spacebar<br/><strong>Dash :</strong><br/>C or X [or M <em>so you can play with both hands in any case</em>]<br/></p>\n<p>_______________________________________________________________________________________<br/><strong>The Resquid Team:</strong></p>\n<p>We made this game during a school project in our <em>National Videogame and Interactive Medias School</em> in France (<strong>ENJMIN</strong>) and this is our <em>first group project</em> for this year. </p>\n<p><strong>We hope you'll enjoy it as much as we enjoyed making it!</strong><br/><br/><strong>Programming:</strong></p>\n<p>Florian ALAZAIS | Flo Alazais (GitHub)<br/>Hugo BOMBAIL | Personal Site<br/><br/><strong>Graphic Design:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>R\u00e9mi LE GALLO LE MANACH | Heskhwis (itch.io)<br/>You-Jeen METTE | Personal Site<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Game Design:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Simon GIRAUD<strong> | </strong>Personal SiteUlysse ROUAULT-LELIEVRE | Razeltif (itch.io)<br/><br/><strong>Management:</strong><br/>Constance GAUTIER | Kallysto (itch.io)<br/><br/><strong>Sound design:</strong><br/>Benjamin DARMON | Personal Site<br/><br/><strong>UI/UX :</strong><br/>Amaury HAULER | Rhadamenthe (itch.io)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-25T04:27:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81c/81c54d4638f08b1c19c87eebc68c2a24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Simon", "HeskHwis", "Kallysto", "Rhadamenthe", "razeltif", "Fleaurian"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
