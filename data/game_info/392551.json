As you know the Khasjou Cat race from planet Neptunus needs to follow in the footsteps of the Rattlekin Rat race by setting up camp on planet Earth. Our little rat enemies are not fed up with us settling on earth. You must descent to earth immediately, but know that the Rattlekin won't let you pass without a fight! Go now! Clear the path to Earth, and Earth itself from the Evil Rattlekin! You have been given a Rocket Launcher and a Blade to aid you. Don't forget to craft upgrades for your weapons with the parts you find on Rattlekin bodies!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T05:23:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38b/38b0466573165291e75bb8fd1c677395.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RebelCampGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
