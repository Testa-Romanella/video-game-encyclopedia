{"id": 978804, "slug": "scp-descent", "name": "SCP: Descent", "name_original": "SCP: Descent", "description": "How many people were lost to the eternal stairwell before it was shut away from the world? What happened to those cursed to walk the liminal spaces for eternity?<br/><br/>Descend the stairwell armed with nothing but a torch and some pieces of chalk while you attempt to keep the monsters at bay. You do not take the journey alone as you are guided by recordings of those who came before. Uncover the reasoning behind the stairwell and look for the exit, if there is one.<h3>Play Time</h3>Approximately 60-90 minutes<br/><br/><h3>Features</h3> - Torchlight: Your light is your best way to navigate the dark depths, but use with caution as those who reside below are drawn to it.<br/> - Stealth Indicator: While moving through the stairwell, every action from running, to direct light, to proximity will increase your chances of getting caught. Manage when to make a break for it to avoid capture.<br/> - Limited Saves: The only way to save the game is by marking the walls with pieces of chalk. Choose carefully when and where to save.<h3>Solve Puzzles</h3>Those who came before have barred the way, solve their puzzles and prove you are worthy to descend.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-22T09:58:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45b/45b78de2e5696e1942c72d51d18a5215.jpg", "website": "https://pixeldripgames.com.au/scpdescent", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pixel Drip Games"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Pixel Drip Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
