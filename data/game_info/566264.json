This project is presented by 'Hope This Works', a tiny improv group of aspiring voice actors.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is this about?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This project includes three visual novels in one. There's Morel's Story, Truffle's Story, and Trumpet's Story. You have a choice to play any of them. <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Morel's Story</strong> follows\u00a0 the slightly hot-tempered Morel. He has found that baking helps manage his anger and he wants to open his own bakery. He tries his best to win a baking competition in order to get his life back together. That's not without its obstacles, of course.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Truffle's Story</strong> follows the timid mushroom, Truffle. She wants to have a tea party under the oak tree out in the courtyard, but she's having a lot of trouble putting it all together due to her shy and avoidant personality. Having a public tea party suddenly becomes a daunting task!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Black Trumpet's Story</strong> follows Trumpet. They want to form a band in order to spread happiness with music, but since others are often wary of Black Trumpets and Trumpet hesitates due to self-hate, it's been difficult to find members.\u00a0 Maybe you can help!<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Why?</strong><br/><br/>We (Hope This Works) decided to make a visual novel together in order to get some voice acting practice in... despite not having experience with making one...! We also tried to finish it within one month, getting our inspiration from game jams here on itch.io. That... didn't quite happen. Development mostly started on December 19, 2020, and the game was released on February 26th in time for Black Nerds Expo. It's here though!</p>\n<p>The idea was that each of us would write and direct a script that followed one main character. After that, we would have one of the others voice that main character. It turned into a bigger thing than I think any of us intended, but we made the thing!<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Any things that might need fixing?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, the game should be playable, but:<br/>-The audio will be fixed eventually. For now , the levels are all over the place. Bear with us. We usually just do the voices and aren't used to editing them to sound nice.<br/>-Some lines of dialogue might be redone in the future.<br/>-Visual problems here and there<br/>-Etc.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T08:43:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/585/585ab38f684e23b1083503b62738af75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Chane Ree", "Pajama-rama", "WolfBrimstone"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
