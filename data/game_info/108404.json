This game focuses on the connection and mechanics of the dreams, both shared and not shared, between Yarn and Nyla, and how these two sisters influence one-another.</p>\n<p>This game was created for the 2017 Dream\u00a0Diary Jam, in celebration of Yume Nikki's 13th anniversary. This is a game that follows a similar structure to Yume\u00a0Nikki, as you explore through dreams and collect Stuff, but is otherwise a self-contained, original\u00a0project.</p>\n<p>This game is very unfinished, and just barely held together. At this moment, there is a bedroom made, ten unfinished maps to explore, and four Stuff to collect. There is no menu option in this game at the moment- All Stuff requires the Number keys.</p><p><strong>This is a prototype- a very early build of the game, to serve as a\u00a0proof-of-concept, and will be updated to a more polished version sometime in 2018 (I hope). Thank you for your interest, and I hope to be able to deliver a higher quality product soon.</strong></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Movement - Arrow Keys, HJKL</li><li>Action - Z, Enter, Spacebar</li><li>Nap - Shift (wait several seconds to enter the dream)</li><li>Stuff - Numbers 1234 (while dreaming)</li><li>Wake Up - Number 0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d35/d354bd25b5151e6949964d7daf7c8edb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nyrator"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
