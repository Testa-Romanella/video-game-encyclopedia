ETA: 36 HOURS 18 MINUTES. \"</p>\n<p>When a planetary computer reports an unmanageable error on an insignificant celestial body in the outer planetary belt, the Central Operator sends a system maintenance team to detect and correct the problem.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Arriving on-site, it turns out that they need to have access to the central unit to fix the fault, which can only be solved by a higher-ranking mechanic. The inside of the machine is saturated with nitrogen and coolant, so it can only be navigated with a special externally controlled avatar. As the rest of the CO\u2019s teams are fully loaded, they are assigned this task to our protagonist, although they do not have the necessary qualifications and experience. With the help of his partner, they set out to get to the central unit, assess and correct the error. The repair process, while it seems like a simple routine task, soon turns out to be a much larger problem that spans the entire galaxy. Our protagonist must not only repair the machine but also find an answer to the processes behind the series of machine failures.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T10:20:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/933/93321ce3492e9907d42e550016ec00ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Etherfield Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
