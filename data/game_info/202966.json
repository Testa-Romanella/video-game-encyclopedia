In Let's Circle Back Later, you're not being a very good boss.<br/></p>\n<p>We've combined the idea of a Management game, where you automate things and make increasingly higher level decisions, with a Real Time Strategy game, where you micro-manage each employee individually.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Help them up the equity of your exciting tech startup by being passionate instigators of change, dog-fooding the product and level-setting expectations. Together, you'll create a B2B blockchain solution that develops the neural network for the future of cats, or something like that.</p>\n<p>As you walk through the procedurally generated office, you'll be telling each and every employee directly whether to work or stop working. Make sure they don't burn out, your retention and diversity numbers depend on it. Don't let them slack off for the sake of employee happiness though - it's a startup after all.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["inzombiak"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
