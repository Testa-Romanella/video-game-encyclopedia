Because how could I not do that?\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's (as usual) a bit rushed, and on the surface probably not very fancy, but I learned a lot about what Twine\u00a0can do!\u00a0 Is it good? Yeah, probably not. Last time I tried to do stuff with Twine kind of showed me how much worse I get at writing under time pressure, but I honestly wasn't really focousing on the story that much anyways. I'm glad I managed to create a visual UI within Twine, that keeps track of more precise scores the player does not have access to. Taught me a lot, and honestly? Just glad I managed to create something again that got some form of finished. And with a little bit of luck, some of you may manage to find some enjoyment in this thing!</p>\n\n<p>- John</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T06:27:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a92/a92e38e22b8a90c0a3b5288fb2527eed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["John_JH25"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
