The positive public image they have created for themselves acts as a vail to hide the experiments they have been performing on us. But it's exactly those shady tests that end up biting the Cirinians asses when they accidentally let loose their most dangerous creation who proceeded to slaughter its creators.<br/>In Experiment Gone Rogue you take the role of a genetically enhanced super soldier who was created with the sole purpose of warfare. Punch your way through enemies, ride flying vehicles, dual wield any gun you come across, fight monstrous bosses, eat cupcakes and visit the interactive Go-go bar to relax after all that rampaging.Main Features<ul><li> Action packed combat<br/></li><li> Various weapons with hidden upgraded versions<br/></li><li> Destructible environment<br/></li><li> Smooth locomotion and teleportation systems<br/></li><li> Multiple exciting boss fights<br/></li><li> Realistic climbing experience at terrifying heights </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:51:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de2/de2db2b397684d5e040f16f710a6e6ea.jpg", "website": "http://www.repulse.com/experiment-gone-rogue/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 291, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Repulse"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SZH"], "esrb_rating": null}
