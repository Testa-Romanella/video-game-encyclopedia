Your goal is to destroy each others bricks within the given amount of minutes. Whoever destroys the most bricks OR falls off their platform loses!</p>\n<p>All of the programming, pixel art, music, animations and sound effects were done by me!</p><p>Font used: 8 - bit arcade by Damien Gosset</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>P - Return to menu</p>\n<p>Player 1:</p>\n<p>A - Move left</p>\n<p>D - Move right</p>\n<p>W - Charge jump meter</p>\n<p>Q: Charge hit meter<br/></p>\n<p>Player 2:</p>\n<p>Left Arrow - Move left</p>\n<p>Right Arrow - Move right</p>\n<p>Up Arrow\u00a0- Charge jump meter</p>\n<p>M: Charge hit meter</p>\n<p>Tip: If you hold the hit meter long enough, you will activate your \"Ballistic shooting\", which causes the fireball to move in a randomized direction.
