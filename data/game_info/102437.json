Come and explore this world created for you to experience. Pay attention as you explore and find the clues to piece together the story that lies within. Currently, we have a pc and mac built for you to play. They are both in their beta stage, so expect there to be imperfections that need to polished. In creating this world, we hope to invoke emotion into the players and make them want to explore the world they are put in. We have worked very hard on developing the story into this game platform.\u00a0 Please leave a comment if you would for us to go beyond a beta. Enjoy!\u00a0 \u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/086/086b1a58bc4fa2c8a0181231ceee1c1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["s3521661"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
