High score should be working and save to each persons version too which is something new for me to have done!</p>\n<p>Highest score seen was 1300! see if you can beat it\u00a0:)</p>\n<p>I'm super happy with how it turned out as its my first solo Games Jam, As well i only had about 7 hours of free time to actually make it! So I'm amazed there is anything there at all.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T18:01:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73e/73ef4b6a9d15c7c7d824a9dc79d1423e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["modking09"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
