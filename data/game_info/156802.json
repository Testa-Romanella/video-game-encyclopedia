{"id": 156802, "slug": "rose-blossom", "name": "Rose Blossom", "name_original": "Rose Blossom", "description": "<p>Rose Blossom is a text-based narrative where the player is a gardener who wants to make his flowers grow again. His rose blossoms have not grown in several years and he is trying to do everything he can to make it happen. The game is user-driven and has a possibility of three outcomes. Thus, the ending of the game varies based on each individual's choices within the game. One player might reach the end of the game much sooner than others because of where his or her actions have taken them in the narrative. Since the game does not take a very long time to complete, the point is for players to go back and play it multiple times to see each result.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0c/c0ce974c2ce7e05c7b82eef7b58713da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["noellaovid"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
