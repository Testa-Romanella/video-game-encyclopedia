Isolated in my office, freezing to death to try and earn enough money to get my family by. Spending time with them whenever possible or going to the beach to stay sane. </p><p>Now it can be your struggle too! <br/><br/><strong>How To Play <br/>=========== </strong><br/>Spacebar - interact <br/>Arrows - move around <br/><br/>Aim: Earn a lot of money, by working at the computer. <br/>Catch: Your office is freezing to work in! <br/><br/>Press space to interact with things in each room. Talking to family will increase your interest, going to beach will increase heat, eating will increase hunger which staves off heat loss. Drinking? You find out. <br/><br/>Let your heat drop to zero and you die. Try to do as much work as possible at the computer before the time runs out, earn them cash dollars! <br/><br/><br/>Let me know how much money you make! :D @2HitMatt</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e3/8e3205d51a952eae3ff6a4cbf177a3e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["2 Hit Studio"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
