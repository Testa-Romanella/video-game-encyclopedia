This game is one of the small experiments that came out of that week. It can be played using a mouse. It is a game for listening.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tWe imagine that further development of the idea would include several vignettes \u2013 one might be made entirely of the art of the children of the resistance, or focus on Shireen's two boys trying to keep their possessions dry as bailiffs evicted them, or on banner making, or flyering outside the Waitrose. That an installation might be built out of the materials (SITEX, brick, turf) of the estate that housed these small vignettes. It would also probably include better art and actual UIs/menus. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b78/b786c126d823e59cb5110d689748c07f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["hannahnicklin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
