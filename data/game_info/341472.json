These will be addressed in the final game.\u00a0\u00a0Some people have stated they want more hints and guidance in the game, however some people said they loved the challenge. I am planning to balance this in some way in the final game, maybe through an optional hint system, but still keeping the challenge there for people who want it. The demo is about 20% of the full game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-15T05:14:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d94/d94e55680854f63a7ca202c0e5f5bbe5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 183, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jason Godbey"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
