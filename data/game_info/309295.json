{"id": 309295, "slug": "overcome-itch", "name": "Overcome (itch)", "name_original": "Overcome (itch)", "description": "<p>Overcome is a Twine game about self-reflection and trying to answer tough experiences we've had in the past. Because of the subject matter of this game, some of the material may be serious and potentially mature. The goal is not to upset the players, but to have them think about themselves and where they are at.</p><p>This game uses pop-up prompts to let the player input personal comments. The game does nothing with this except displays them later. However, I\u00a0cannot attest to the security of such mechanics, so if you're concerned about the security of personal experiences, you don't have to interact with those situations.</p><p>This game was made for the 2019 Spring Game Jam with VGDC at UCI. The theme was \"Lose to Win\". I wanted to try to swing it in a positive way by losing the things that we maybe don't want in our lives.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-15T02:56:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a88/a8891649f6dad0b317cff888e996f133.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dsaname"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
