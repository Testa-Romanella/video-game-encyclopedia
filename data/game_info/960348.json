You can see the unique beauties of these cities better at night. At night, it will be easier for you to create new lines with the lights that illuminate the roads.<br/><br/>You can build roads in different styles using random paths and your own design intelligence. In this way, you can spend less resources and get more results. You can build junctions, bridges, shortcuts and ring roads with random paths.<br/><br/>You shouldn't make the bus lines too long. You can also create new lines for this. In this way, you can carry more passengers to the desired stops by using your limited resources correctly.<br/><br/>You can create the bus line between the stops by placing the random roads in an appropriate way. The most important point in the game of this design simulation is to use random incoming paths efficiently.<br/><br/>https://discord.gg/VsNBFjZmK7<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-05T04:11:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acd/acd2d4c53e982997f5cde084f14c0d5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blue Black Entertainments"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Pointless Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
