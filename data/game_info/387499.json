There isn't much to do and it isn't super fun but I figured since 19k people have seen the VOD somebody might want to try it out themselves. Maybe one day I'll update or reboot this if there's enough demand (lol). Anyways thanks for checking it out and thank you to Vinny Vinesauce (@VinnyVinesauce) for playing it and making 18 year old me a happy boy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Included is a readme that goes over controls (keyboard and xbox controller supported), the various bugs, and some other helpful tips. Also included is the original prototype build if anyone was curious.</p>\n\n<p>Happy Halloween!</p>\n<p>Follow me on Twitter at (@SchaefferAustin)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T03:56:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aff/aff7551785152a44b0a5b3613786afd2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheSchaeff"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
