Hopefully this came together in a decently put together game! Haha.</p>\n<p>I based all the internal stats from D&amp;D and new games / level ups involve dice rolling to increase stats. I took a lot of personal liberties by making more stuff random. Maybe if I revisit the game in the future, I'll add a proper level up screen so you can choose what stats get increased. (Also smooth screen fading between scenes, among a thousand other things, tbh.)<br/></p>\n<p>It's still buggy and needs A LOT of polishing. But I hope you enjoy the basic idea!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>Arrow Keys: Movement / Attacking / Object Interaction (<em>Basically, move and do</em>.)</li><li>Clicking for all Game Menu interactions. </li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>Art: Kenney</li><li>Music: John Leonard French</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T08:21:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce2/ce271514ddd27da8ceb78b69f7f9c26a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nick H."], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
