This is why I decided to skip the three hours limit and explore a thing I have not done so far, which is adding audio events to my game. I thankfully had an old Unity asset, which offered many good audio clips (although not everything fits perfectly, but good enough for a game jam I guess ;))</p>\n\n<p>I hope it is fun, and also a bit challenging.</p>\n<p>Enjoy :)\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Assets used:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Graphics:\u00a0<ul><li>https://craftpix.net/product/top-down-2d-game-kit/</li></ul>\n</li><li>Music / Audio:\u00a0<ul><li>https://motionarray.com/royalty-free-music/happy-morning-1245490/</li><li>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/ultimate-sound-fx-bundle-15...</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T07:11:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e0/5e00b6e3ad3d078989af0fddea342b7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["spinner-web"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
