Your job will be to help the revolution by starving the empire of resources through any means necessary.</p>\n<p>As far as the directors of the empire are concerned, you have just arrived to the space station, and now gainfully employed to support and fuel the empire's power by processing incoming deliveries of goods and personnel. So, why don't you just \"shut up and get to work\" or they will have you executed.</p>\n<p>(If the game looks strange when you open it, try setting to windowed mode and opening at a 16:9 resolution e.g. 1920 x 1080, 1600 x 900, or \u00a01280 x 720)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T07:29:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bed/bed47352c1019d8c61df924ee2cf96c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Offbrand_Valk"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
