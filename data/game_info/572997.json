This first one took around 10-15 hours to make.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>-------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>3D assets: Epic Games &amp; What Remains of Edith Finch free assets<br/>Music: Nebular Focus - Dan Henig<br/>VFX: Particles and Wind Control System<br/>Some SFX: Imphenzi Universal Sound FX<br/>Wind SFX: Mark DiAngelo<br/>Radio Static Buzz SFX: https://www.zapsplat.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T08:29:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39e/39e3578dcfa9e2c977830c1449874ecf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["llnaej"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
