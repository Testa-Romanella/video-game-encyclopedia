It is an indie game partially inspired by Minecraft, but taking the voxel representation to the next level with multiscale subvoxels. Craftica currently supports both creative and survival modes with a main focus on the creative mode.<h3>Voxel and Subvoxels</h3><br/>In Craftica the basic voxel is a full cube and the subvoxels are partial cubes with one or more corner chopped off.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The support of subvoxels in Craftica make it possible to use relatively smooth representations of objects in the game. Also the voxel and subvoxels in Craftica are supported at multiple size levels, so that fine structures can be represented at a scale comparable to the real world.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As an example,  Craftica has very good support for Chinese architectures, and includes a large number of standard structures with Chinese architecture styles.<br/><br/><br/>In fact, these structures and every other models in Craftica are generated programmatically in the game.<h3>Smart Placement of Blocks and Items</h3><br/>Craftica is designed to allow intuitive construction of objects using subvoxels, and supports consistent operations for placing basic blocks (voxels and subvoxels) and items.<br/><br/><br/><h3>In-Scene Crafting</h3><br/>Item crafting in Craftica can be done in the scene, using formulas that are structural and intuitive.<br/><br/><h3>Village</h3><br/>In Craftica worlds, some places are generated with villages. Each village is generated with a few houses and at least one workshop and one defensive fort or tower, and spawns with at least one warrior to defend the village.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The relationship between a village and a player is characterized by affinity. Affinity can be zero, positive or negative, indicating a neutral, friendly or hostile relationship.<br/><br/>The affinities between villages and player(s) are initialized randomly. Normally, there will be more neutral villages than friendly and hostile ones, and more friendly ones than hostile ones. Their actual percentages may vary according to game modes and difficulty levels.<h3>Trade</h3><br/>When a positive affinity reaches certain levels, the player will have free access to some village structures and storages (different structures and storages may have different affinity thresholds). And when a negative affinity reaches a certain level, the village warrior will actively attack the player.<br/><br/>Trading with villagers or defending the village against hostile mobs will improve the affinity between the player and the village. On the other hand, attacking villagers will deteriorate the affinity.<br/><br/><h3>Survival</h3><br/>In survival mode, barbarians and other hostile mobs will be generated. They will attack the player and villages. The only way to survive is to fight back or run!<br/><br/><br/><h3>Instant Help and Hint</h3><br/>Craftica can provide instant help and hint that is relevant to the current state of the game and the player. Such help and hint can be turned on or off with the H key at any time. Instant help and hint is automatically turned on when a new world is started, unless it is disabled in the game options.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T10:34:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/991/99136a7f6d6cd8b9e212b80bd5899350.jpg", "website": "http://craftica.net", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 326, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Craftao Studio"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Craftao Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
