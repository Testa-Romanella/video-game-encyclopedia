{"id": 815889, "slug": "the-junkie", "name": "The Junkie", "name_original": "The Junkie", "description": "<p>The Junkie is an abstract 3D adventure game. The concept behind The Junkie is to allow the player to assume the role of a nameless drug addict - who aimlessly wonders the streets of a unknown city, looking for the dealer character so that he can score his next hit. The levels in the game alternate between the streets of the city and various stages of\u00a0 a drug trip as experienced by the protagonist. The dealer in the game is represented as a small man with a yellow balloon. The yellow balloon is symbolic as it is often used as a graffiti tag in real life by vagrants to identify places where they can abuse drugs discretely.\u00a0<br/><br/>The game objective is very simple. You walk the character around each of the levels and look for the dealer character (the little man with a yellow balloon). When you approach him, press spacebar on the keyboard in order to interact with him. This will take you to the next level. The levels repeat themselves, representing the purgatory-like and nightmarish hallucinations and experiences of the protagonist. However you also have the option to walk away from everything in the last level of the game.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys - Move Around</p>\n<p>Space - Interact with the dealer character (when in close range).</p>\n<p>Page Up/Down - Tilt Camera up/down</p>\n<p>U and O - Rotate camera left/right</p>\n<p>Escape - Quit<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>Important note:</p>\n<p>You need the latest .Net 4.0 and XNA 4.0 runtime libraries installed on your\u00a0system in order to run this game.</p>\n<p>You can download them from here:</p>\n<p>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17718</p>\n<p>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20914</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T09:08:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a96/a9699a1bf8c007ce2b33a67a26860a69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vladstoj"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
