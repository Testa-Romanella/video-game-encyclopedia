You play as a red box, which needs to avoid both the white box, which is continuously following you, and the black boxes, which spawns randomly every second somewhere on the map. If you touch the white box which is following you, you die, the same with the black boxes. So the more the time is passing, the more the number of black boxes will appear, which makes it more difficult to get away from the white box</p>\n<ol><li><strong>\u00a0A,S,W,D</strong>\u00a0to move your player</li><li><strong>Space</strong> to jump (if you hold the space bar, you'll jump higher)</li><li><strong>Mouse</strong> to look around</li></ol>\n<p>The<strong> difficulty buttons</strong> will change how fast the white box will follow you</p>\n<p>P.S. sorry for the \"can become\" annoying background music, this was my first experience with creating a song.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you ENJOY!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T09:13:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/def/defd9fe621d2dd3c95cd4d6687d52a16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Teryu"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
