In the full version at least.</p>\n<p>The demo isn't too long, lasting anywhere from about 5-10 minutes, but it still contains some solid content like underwhelming <em>puzzle</em> and mediocre jokes.</p>\n<p>If you couldn't tell the game itself is actually a Nintendo Game Boy ROM, so you'll need an Emulator to play it.</p>\n<p>All jokes aside this game was made almost entirely by one man; me, out of nothing but love. I've poured an epoch into this project over several engines and redesigns so I really hope you like it, as well as the full version when it comes out.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T03:04:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d5/8d5cd45024cbaf5078a3ceb5ea23efe3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bwogglyswogames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
