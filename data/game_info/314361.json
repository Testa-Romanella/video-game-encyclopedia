She tries to find out what happened to her. While she is unconscious, the events happening in real life are affecting her dream\u00a0, ultimately her goal is to wake up!</p>\n<p>Help Sabah during her quest by collecting checkpoints and by bringing the story together.</p>\n<p>The controls for now are just the arrow keys for movements and the mouse to click on buttons when needed.</p>\n<p>This was project for my Game Developer course. It was very intense since we had a couple of months to make it and had the choice to make every thing from scratch. I learned to make my own sound effects, animations, visual effects etc.</p>\n<p>This version is just the initial idea of the first level so there is still a lot to improve when it come to the game play and story telling. There is also other in-game practical points that need to be refined.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T05:42:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec1/ec179ef1c5fcb8038c939b6efbded7d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["laloopadoo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
