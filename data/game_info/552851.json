This is a game that was collaboratively (and impulsively made) on twitter by the question of hey, how would an Avatar: the Last Airbender TTRPG play like, if you specifically focused on the element\u2019s battles, and how the elements showed not only a cultural and political tension but also the tendency of certain character traits.</p>\n<p>This is Maria (specifically) and I honestly enjoyed thinking about this idea so much that I just had to somehow put this on itch in Jan2021 even if this gdoc form was born back in Jul2020.</p>\n<p>As this is not a full fleshed out game (strictly), I can\u2019t really describe the play-flow officially, (as I\u2019m not the only author) but I can have a pretty good guess and suggestion to what would make things easy for play.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>This is a GM-less game and is best played for 2-4players. It\u2019s played in rounds where 2 players engage in a combat where they use EARTH WIND FIRE WATER - BENDING to sort out their emotions while in hypothetical combat. The players not engaged in combat, choose setting elements and may create additional exposition if they wish.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>PLAY THIS IF:</p>\n<p>- YOU WANT TO DO SOME QUICK ELEMENTAL INSPIRED DUELS</p>\n<p>- WAX POETIC About your emotions and character background via some elemtal themes and motifs\u00a0<br/></p><p>-</p><p>*as this collectively written all proceeds of this game will go to homeless children organization called Tiny Blessings:\u00a0\u00a0instagram.com/tinyblessings</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T15:38:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37a/37a5763c2acf6961e06e270bd84655e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Maria Mison"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
