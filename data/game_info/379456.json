{"id": 379456, "slug": "model-builder", "name": "Model Builder", "name_original": "Model Builder", "description": "<p>The huge experience, that both sides have, enabled Kuba W\u00f3jcik - the originator - to team up with Moonlit - the developer and publisher - to create Model Builder, am exceptional, one of a kind simulator.<br />\nModel Builder brings the joy of, well\u2026 model building, to the virtual world. It allows you to build model machines just like you would in reality, by cutting out, assembling, and then painting and customizing your creations. Fill your shelves with cars, planes, helicopters and tanks from various countries and eras, display them in dioramas to add a bit of shine and tell your own story. Sell your creations for-profit and expand your toolkit or simply let the works you&#39;re proud to be displayed on your Shelf of Glory.<br />\nThe game offers a wide variety of tools and models to choose from, as well as tons of paint colours and decals, that will make the assembled models truly your own. You are bound to have weeks upon weeks of creative fun - and meanwhile, your relatives won\u2019t be able to complain that you fill every bit of free space with plastic toys that smell of glue and paint. Building models in virtual space has never been so fun!<br />\nNot everyone gets to be an engineer\u2026 but everyone can build impressive machines! Get the model you always wanted to build, cut it out, glue the pieces (be careful not to use too much glue though!) and polish the model to perfection.<br />\nIs assembly done? Does your model look solid? Time to make it look amazing. Up until this point, you followed a plan. Now it&#39;s time to unleash your creativity and make your creation look the way you wish it to. Add paint jobs and small details that will make the model your own. There&#39;s a ton of customization options for you to use and discover - making them work is up to you. Your creativity is the limit.<br />\nYou might be already proud of your work, but there is still something to be done: create a story. Arrange your model (or models!) in a diorama, to make it look threatening, powerful, or simply impressive - it&#39;s your call.<br />\nYou have a variety of tools at your disposal - everything you need to assemble your models and make them shine. If you need more specialized tools, there is some stuff to unlock too - as your workshop fills with mighty machines, you will also get new toys to help with precision work and finishes. You will feel like a pro in no time.<br />\nThere&#39;s plenty to choose from in terms of what you can assemble\u2026 and once you are done, there&#39;s a ton more to unlock. Expect dozens of hours of fun and much more in post-release updates.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-17T13:27:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72d/72d140ab7ee76560d37b6936d9fbdb43.jpg", "website": "http://modelbuilder.game", "rating": 3.5, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 45, "owned": 119, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 14, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 75, "ratings_count": 13, "suggestions_count": 214, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 14, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Moonlit"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Moonlit"], "esrb_rating": null}
