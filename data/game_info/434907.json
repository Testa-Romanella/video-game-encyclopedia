Any plants or debris that is on the map at the start of the level can not be moved or picked up. Once you have placed your plant\u2019s press space and it will ask if you are ready and when you accept the bolts of light will emit from the emitter flower. All areas on the map are randomly generated so some plants may be difficult or impossible to revive. You don\u2019t have to revive every plant on a level, you just have to revive as many as you can to slow the decay in that area.</p>\n<p>Plants functions:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Emitter flower - fires bolts of light in all four directions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sunflower - has no abilities.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Splitter flower - when revived it will fire bolts of light in all four directions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mirrors - when hit with bolts of light they will bounce off and redirect.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sunflower rock - same as sunflower but cannot be moved.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Large rock and tall stumps - will stop beams of light.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Small rocks and short stumps - cannot be moved.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Programming - Andrew Roulst</p>\n<p>Art - Casey Gorsuch (OfficialXasey)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T11:01:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/093/093fe05e425f47a755d6630679687bc3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Andrew Roulst", "OfficialXasey"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
