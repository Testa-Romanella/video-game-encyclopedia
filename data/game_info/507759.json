While dragon eggs are able to survive when left alone, they truly thrive when given care and attention.</p>\n<p>The egg takes a fair while to hatch, with most hatching in about a month (yes, a real month). Make sure to come back and check on them every day to see how they're progressing, and to make sure they're happy and healthy!</p>\n<p>PLEASE NOTE: This game is still in active development, and we intend to add more polish and functionality. It is my goal to keep any future versions working with the current version's save file so you can just download the new update and keep going. Please check back before the end of the month to see if a new version is up as the ending is currently only about 50% of what we wanted it to be</p>\n<p>Art by Tri<br/>Code by Ryytikki</p>\n<p>Mellowtron by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4034-mellowtron<br/>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T04:55:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f0/2f052654f030de8ae2bddb9b6cac07f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ryytikki"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
