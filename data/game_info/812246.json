Therefore, in order to provide the best possible playing environment for the official release, we welcome any and all feedback from players during the preview phase. We would like to hear from you via the official Discord server and the Steam community.<br/><br/>Now, I wish you all the best as a hacker.<br/><br/>\"Hack the Babel Inc.\" is a challenging game that aims to combine the experience of a puzzle game with that of a roguelike. We are currently developing the game for official release and improving the gameplay itself based on feedback from the demo version.<h3>Deep Basic Rules</h3>The basic rules of the game are inspired by Minesweeper, but the essence of the game is not to focus on not opening certain squares, but to aim to open certain squares. This limits the detrimental effects of poor choices, and achieves a risk/reward relationship that can be felt in various roguelike games.<h3>Various items</h3>.The official version of the game will have over 150 items, but the demo version has 60 items. The items vary in their power and the form of benefit they provide to the player, and some items are designed with synergies that activate in a chain. You can select and purchase items from the store in the stage to explore the ideal item build.<h3>Selectable control characters</h3>.In the official version of the game, there will be eight different AIs, which are playable characters. Each AI has powerful abilities, and you will need to develop strategies and item builds to take advantage of them. One of the appealing features of the game is the ability to change the puzzle style according to the player's preference, depending on which AI is chosen. In the demo version 2 AIs are available.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T14:53:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/270/270d8af14e92e4f25f24d7368b1ba40a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["AMaytan", "ToAge"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Strategy", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["ToAge"], "esrb_rating": null}
