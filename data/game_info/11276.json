In the campaign mode, the game continues the Modern Warfare storyline about an American spec ops squad Task Force 141 fighting Russian nationalists. <br />\nThe player will control different characters on various military missions across the world. The protagonists from the previous part, Soap MacTavish and John Price, appear in certain missions but are sidelined by several new playable characters, most prominently, the Russian former Spetsnaz operative Yuri. Terrorist leader Vladimir Makarov, the villain of Modern Warfare 2, returns as well, and is trying to provoke the start of World War III. The player\u2019s missions this time will be centered around protecting the West against Makarov\u2019s attacks.<br />\nThe game introduces a new Survival mode, in which the player repeals wave after wave of eternally respawning opponents. This mode allows for multiplayer co-op for two players. The traditional multiplayer mode was revised as well, adding a new reward mechanic, Pointstreaks, in which the player can choose between three sets of rules, called \u201cstrike packages\u201d, to count his or her points.</p>", "metacritic": 85, "released": "2011-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-18T21:13:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/e9c/e9c042d14515eb3ff7cb4db9fe78e435.jpg", "website": "http://www.callofduty.com", "rating": 3.77, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 90, "owned": 3680, "beaten": 1916, "toplay": 96, "dropped": 237, "playing": 14}, "playtime": 8, "achievements_count": 228, "ratings_count": 1543, "suggestions_count": 657, "game_series_count": 29, "reviews_count": 1549, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Wii", "Xbox 360", "PlayStation 3", "iOS", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Aspyr Media", "Raven Software", "Treyarch", "Infinity Ward", "Sledgehammer Games", "Neversoft Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Activision Blizzard", "Aspyr", "Activison", "ak tronic Software & Services"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
