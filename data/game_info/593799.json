At the start of the round you will be able to pick you player similar to Overwatch/Valorant.\u00a0These players will have a set of abilities that yo can use. At the start of each round you will be able to change player. Once you die in a round you will not respawn until last player/players remain on one team, they will be declared the winners for that round. First team to reach 10 wins, wins the game.
