There is no winning, you will eventually succumb to the frost, muahahaha!</p>\n<p>Includes a level editor to challenge yourself. If I were to spend more time on it I'd add more tower types, maybe the frost is coming from something you can destroy to win, larger maps, and the ability to buy additional workers and turn buildings on/off and sell them as needed. Maybe even plant trees to harvest later</p>\n<p>View the devlog here:\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/my-first-game-jam-winter-2020/topic/663492/devlog-frostbite</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-10T04:39:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/374/374b6420e40c110f60b1badb89a966d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Critters"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
