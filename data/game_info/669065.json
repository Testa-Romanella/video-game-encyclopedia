You find yourself on the Demo Map island floating in the sky and need to figure out your exact position. You can look around and move around, you can explore. Just remember that you need to be precise.</p>\n<p>Don't stress out if you are lost or miss by some meters. But if you want some challenge, your time, steps taken, and distance from the exact position are all tracked. Hit the point within 12 meters and you get 200 points. Hit 0 meters within 5 seconds with 0 steps and you get the sense of accomplishment.</p>\n<p><strong>This is just a demo!\u00a0</strong>I've been working on the gameplay basics and the map design for a couple of weeks. It's far from a full game, and I have a lot of ideas for future maps and systems that can enhance your experience. But I want to make sure I'm on the right track and that there is interested for this type of game. So please share your feedback!<br/></p>\n<p>Even though it's a demo, I hope even this map can give you an hour of enjoyment. And if you feel like this an interesting idea, please consider donating for its future development.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T09:14:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edf/edf2050f3f12015103d80f1c0b89a3c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["pycbouh"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
