{"id": 117655, "slug": "gonna-catcha", "name": "Gonna Catcha", "name_original": "Gonna Catcha", "description": "<p>Assume the role of \r\n\t<strong>Pohena Das</strong> and <strong>Donum Dono</strong>, two canine members of the Psychopomp Envoys. Under the orders of Yama, ruler of the Underworld, their duty is to collect and deliver the spirits of the dead to the Underworld for judgement. Their task is not an easy one, as spirits are generally not very cooperative in this endeavour. To make things worse, base creatures known as pretas (or \"Hungry ghosts\") have a habit of getting in the way. Inspired by classic arcade games from the early 80s, <em>Gonna Catcha</em> delivers classic gameplay straight from the old arcades. <br/><br/>\n<strong>Two gameplay styles</strong><br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t\tAlternate playing as Pohena and Donum. When playing as Pohena, your task is to subdue and capture evil sprits while trying to not harm good spirits. However, when playing as Donum, your task is instead collecting the good spirits while avoiding contact with evil spirits. \r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Local co-op mode</strong><br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t\tTeam up with a friend! Each player takes the role of one of the two psychopomps and both must work together to reap those spirits. \r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Designed for the Golden Age</strong><br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t\tFeaturing graphics, audio and gameplay inspired by various arcade titles from the early-1980s.</p><p>\n<strong><br/>\n</strong></p><p>\n<strong>What's new in 1.2.0 </strong><em>(July 22, 2014)</em></p><p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong><br/>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug where Player 2 could not start a Co-op game if their input was \r\nset to Controller 1. \r\n\t\t</li> <li>Factory Reset now properly resets window size. \r\n\t\t</li> <li>Undocumented level select cheat disabled: caused crashes when loading high \r\nscore table. \r\n\t\t</li> <li>Entry of high score is disabled if 30 lives cheat is activated. \r\n\t\t</li> <li>Rolling credits on the credits screen now loop properly. </li> </ul><p> <strong>Improvements</strong><br/>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Game now skips the co-op high score table after displaying the single-player \r\nhigh score table after a game over. \r\n\t\t</li> <li>You can now press [Shoot] to skip the high score tables and the cast screen \r\nand return to the title screen. \r\n\t\t</li> </ul><p>\t\r\n\tSee the full Changelog in the online manual.</p><p>\n<strong>Website:</strong> quadolorgames.com<br/>\n<strong>Twitter:</strong> @QuadolorGames<br/>\n<strong>IndieDB: </strong>indiedb.com/games/gonna-catcha</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/138/138bd8d4cf03b9942b7a43794b4798df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["M.S.T.O.P."], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
