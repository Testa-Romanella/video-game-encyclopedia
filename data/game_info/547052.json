The rules are really unpolished but i guess its understandable\u00a0 and as I said they will be improved too in the future.<br/>The main goal of the game is to have fun, if you dont like some rule just change it, the important part is to laugh, a lot!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T07:01:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc8/cc8fa0e53ff6bb665f8a831cb2de675b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Paulo BF Almeida"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
