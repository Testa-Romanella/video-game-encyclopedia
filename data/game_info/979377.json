You like streaming? you like blackjack? well then do I have the game for you!

Check out the link to the demo stream below (Hopefully it's up right now eheheh)<br/>\n<br/>\r\n       Using OBS and Twitch integration, you can make this game into a twitch overlay to play blackjack with your chat, Players enter their messages via twitch chat commands, so they don't need to download anything to participate!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n       Players compete against each other AND you, the game has a small internal economy and money that you use will be recorded, and if you're unlucky chat may bankrupt you!! turning the experience into a bit of a community effort.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n       Don't actually want to pay attention to the game and just let it run while you do other things? That's fine, the game includes and auto-play feature that will activate dealer commands without any input from you.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n      A cheap and fun game that will create a fun new experience for your fans while you rack up that sweet sweet viewer engagement!!
