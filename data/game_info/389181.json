{"id": 389181, "slug": "the-five-gods-of-kung-fu", "name": "The Five Gods of Kung Fu", "name_original": "The Five Gods of Kung Fu", "description": "<p>The Five Gods of Kung Fu is an action game with fighting game inputs.</p>\n<p>In order to keep the land from being torn apart you will need to find and master the five ancient fighting styles and defeat the different clans who want rule over the nation.</p>\n<p>This is still a prototype for my kickstarter demo. I will update and expand on it regularly. I am very open to feedback and suggestions of any kind.</p>\n<p>Lots of things are still missing, but I would like to involve the community very early on. If you are interested in supporting me and my game feel free to contact me.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here is my vision for the game:</p>\n<p><strong>FEATURES</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Different fighting styles with unique mechanics</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The full game will feature (at least) 5 different fighting styles based on the Kung Fu movies of old. Animal styles like Snake,Tiger and Praying Mantis but also Drunken Kung Fu and others will feature unique mechanics that fit their style. Stances can be switched on the fly for stylish combos.</p>\n<p><strong>Unique\u00a0Input Method</strong></p>\n<p>Not a game for button mashers! A unique input system using the face buttons of a gamepad for inputting motion like strings. I also incorporate ideas from fighting games which you will need to practice in order to truly master them.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Interconnected world</strong></p>\n<p>A big world to explore with charming characters and stunning vistas. Keep an eye out for hints as to where the 5 Kung Fu Masters might be hiding.</p>\n<p><strong>Very tough enemies</strong></p>\n<p>Enemies will learn your attacks and start to counter them if you use them too often. You will need to mix up your moves and surprise enemies with new fighting styles and perfect strikes (timing based) in order to open them up.</p>\n\n<p><strong>STAY IN TOUCH</strong></p>\n<p>Twitter: https://twitter.com/gods_fu</p>\n<p>E-Mail: fivegodsofkungfu@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Dischord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/Z9yxazV</p>\n<p>Youtube: <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T03:32:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/576/576a3a23e64e9e456d6b7ce6c1d7c97b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["knifefoot"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
