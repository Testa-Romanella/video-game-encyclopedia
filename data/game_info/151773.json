Enemies can be hiding on the ladder and under health-packs.</p>\n\n<p>Notes about the game:</p>\n<p>Endless Tower is the first game I made in Pico-8, I adapted it from the very first thing I ever made appear on the screen and it represents the culmination of all my learning about making a game in the engine. Anyone who is starting out in PICO-8 should absolutely look through the code for this game, understand and then adapt\u00a0 it for\u00a0use in your own projects. It contains some of most fundamental things required in a game in Pico-8, such as: collision, health bar, score, game-over screen, main menu, shop window (which is still work in progress, mind!), etc.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If have any questions on how anything works or want to learn more about it, then feel free to message me in the comment section and I will be sure to get back to you!</p>\n\n<p>- Dan</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a0/1a0171b5a73b352f88efc63797f4fbe8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DanielGilchrist"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
