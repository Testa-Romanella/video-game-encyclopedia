With the help of your teammates, a selection of chaos-inducing weapons, and lots of cars out for stealing, explore this city of law and crime and leave your (explosion) mark on the streets!<br/><br/><strong>RAMPAGE game mode</strong><br/>Cops and crooks fight to take control of the city! Players can either join a match solo or with friends on the same team by creating a party. The Crooks will need to hide from the Cops, while causing chaos in the city. Both teams can win by eliminating the opposing team. The Crooks can also win by filling up the Chaos Meter, which can be done by committing crimes, such as dragging money safes with a vehicle or running over citizens. But they need to be careful, because each crime gives away their position to the Cops! Cops can help each other out by marking a Crook's position on the map.<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/><ul><li>Play as either a havoc-inducing Crook or a law-abiding Cop<br/></li><li>Chase and hide on the strange, sprawling streets of Strife City<br/></li><li>A bunch of modifiable weapons to take control of the streets<br/></li><li>Different cars with various attributes to help you chase or get away<br/></li><li>Up to 32 players per match hosted on dedicated servers<br/></li><li>Teamwork is key to getting the job done and defeating your opponents<br/></li><li>Adopt creatures to accompany you on your endeavours<br/></li><li>And more to come!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:12:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/121/121326d0ef6454c6c4aef1eeec3a0b24.jpg", "website": "http://2voltgames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 120, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["2-Volt Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["2-Volt Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
