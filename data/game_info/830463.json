At the cost of another life. Friend, foe, stranger,\u00a0the toll is paid by anyone other than himself.</p>\n<p>Depressed and furious beyond thought and reason, Adriel vows vengeance on the god that has cursed him so. Joining a rather\u00a0unsavory group of brigands, Adriel seeks to overthrow the god Caelus, so he may finally be free to rest with his loved one.</p>\n<p>Dark Rerise features a curious blend of resurrection and permadeath. Resource management and\u00a0strategic sacrifice will be vital as you make your way\u00a0through this choose-your-adventure/RPG.</p>\n<p>Meta checks, multiple unique endings, and of course permadeath all give replay.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Dev Comments:<br/>-Made for IGMC 2022; judges, this game is 100%-able in the hour timer, though if you're running short of time, just follow the\u00a0path marked * to see the main story<br/>-This game is meant to be both extremely punishing, and really, really easy at the same time<br/>-Trigger warning: self-harm</p>\n<p>*I put this below in the download instructions; I'll put it here too:\u00a0Confirm there is a 'www' folder containing a 'save' folder upon download.
