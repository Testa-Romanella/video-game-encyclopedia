The objective of the game is to catch eggs in a hat which are thrown by a chicken without letting any of the eggs hit the ground and break. At the end of each round, the player has a chance to throw the eggs that they have caught back at the chicken in order to win bonus points. The speed of the game increases as the player progresses. The game has two difficulties in which the easier variation gives the player a larger hat to use to catch the eggs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1982-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3b/e3bad10eac38d943834b5f7293163108.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Atari 2600"], "developers": ["US Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["US Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
