Now featuring 4 more digits including a very unique one.</p>\n<p>So I went to Increpare's <strong>Vexatious Match 3</strong> game's source code to see how the game works when I saw that there were 3 unused digits. The sprites were drawn and they were implemented to the editor but they weren't fully functional, so I made them work like the other digits and added a new one. I also showed what I did to the original creator, and he actually liked it ! So I decided to make a full game with that.</p>\n<p>Original :<br/>https://www.increpare.com/game/vexatious-match-3.html</p>\n<p>Mobile friendly version\u00a0:<br/>https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=24e2616f017f37ba2a1783b8ba30ac7c<br/></p>\n<p>Source code :\u00a0<br/>https://www.puzzlescript.net/editor.html?hack=24e2616f017f37ba2a1783b8ba30ac7c<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T07:10:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/295/295c9d98f8aa512f36e3ee011b33874c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Stingby12"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
