The game is developed entirely in JavaScript.</p><p>The rules are simply that you must clear the board of all numbers.</p><p>You can select numbers that are adjacent, even across the gaps of numbers that you've already removed. The hint system will illustrate these situations fairly clearly. Tiles can match horizontally, wrapping to the next line, or vertically.</p><p>Tiles will only match if their numbers add up to 10, or they are the same number.</p><p>If you run out of matches, you can \"repeat\"\u00a0the board to create more numbers to help you. Be careful, though, as repeating numbers will double the amount of numbers on the board. This will not include those numbers that were removed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T12:55:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b3/1b336333e4e4da5c847f436cd5fc2c3a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Homemade Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
