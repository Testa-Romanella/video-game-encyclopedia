It was made during \"My First Game Jam : Winter 2023\". <br/><br/>The goal is to protect the villagers during the construction of the divine Tower, wich will pleased the Gods to save them. You control a biblically \"accurate\" angel sent on the planet to help the villagers.<br/><br/>CONTROLS :<br/><br/>- Arrows : move<br/></p>\n<p>- Space : place a divine area that killed monsters<br/>=&gt; in menu, space/left click to validate<br/><br/>It was a pleasant but very difficult experience and I hope i can improve in the future and make more polished and appealing games. Any feedback is appreciated.<br/><br/>Made with GameMaker Studio 2.<br/><br/>N.B : there's currently a bug that leads to game over when the villager in down left corner is killed, even when there's still villagers alive. I recommand to protect this one in priority.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T10:48:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/641/64147d37885c3ec5c5d74955979a8e1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nemo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
