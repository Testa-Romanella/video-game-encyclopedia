While the collection is not yet complete, what's offered here is both the introduction and the first book in the series,\u00a0<em>Beware the Festival of Fools,</em> as a standalone product. Enjoy hundreds of pages of creepy, kooky carnival high jinks, but just make sure to keep your eyes peeled and your wits about you--otherwise, you just might end up a part of the show yourself!<br/><br/>Included for download\u00a0is both the mac and pc versions of the game; in the game itself, you get to enjoy the introduction, the first book, and all the features that the final, finished product will have, save for the music gallery.</p>\n<p>P.S.
