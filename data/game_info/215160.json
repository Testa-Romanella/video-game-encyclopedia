Eat breakfast to generate music and fill up your stomach but avoid bacteria and biting your\u00a0tongue. This game was made for the\u00a0Game Maker's Toolkit Jam 2018 in GameMaker Studio 2 in\u00a0about two days. If I had more time I would've cleaned up the tutorial screen a bit but I'm pretty happy with how the game turned out overall. I don't think this game followed the theme of the jam very well either as rhythm isn't really a mechanic but whatever.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Controls</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>You can eat with the spacebar or the A button if you're using a controller. You can pause with escape or the start button if you're using a controller.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/045/0458a13e50c20de7c481910e933643b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["patetfisk"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
