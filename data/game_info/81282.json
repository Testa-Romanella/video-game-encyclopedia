It all sounded good until you spent the entire day kicking up the mountain on skins, heel lifters set on high. But now it is getting late, a storm is blowing in, avalanches rumble in the distance, and you are hopelessly lost.<br/><br/>Looking around you spot smoke in the distance -- could it be from your base camp? Maybe you can still make it. It's all downhill from here. What's the worst that could happen? Well, you are about to find out...<br/><br/>Select Training peak or Sierra Nevada, The Alps, or the Himalayas. There are 3 short training trails and 21 long and steep trails.<br/><br/>Ski down the mountain following smoke to your camp. Watch out for trees, cliffs, avalanches, and exhaustion. Your health goes down with each crash and with passing time. If the bar at upper left turns completely red the game is over.<br/><br/>TIPS - If you jump too high or turn too fast you will crash. Smooth S-shaped linked turns are best. Align your skis down the slope when landing. Traverse steep slopes sideways to avoid fatal falls. Turn up hill slightly to shed speed. Watch your altitude; stay above the camp or you may never get there. Avalanche danger is always present.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T06:46:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbb/bbb0d68303dcfc74e5c30bf5905ecd18.jpg", "website": "http://www.resetgame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "iOS"], "developers": ["RESETgame"], "genres": ["Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": ["RESETgame"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
