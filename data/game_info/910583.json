The Demo comes with several levels, and one character. The full game will feature better balancing, increased level counts, and significantly more character/card selection options! Can you beat every level?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Feel free to download and try out the alpha demo now!\u00a0</p>\n<p>We would love to have your constructive feedback!<br/></p>\n<p>Known Bugs/Issues:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Towers do not have a way to show you their range before you build them, nor after. At the moment, most towers, EXCEPT the level 1 mage, can hit enemies from 2 tiles away, the higher the level, the greater the range. The Level 3 Archer, has the greatest range, and can pretty much hit the road from any build location.\u00a0</li><li>The highlighter for the towers when upgrade cards are used, is possibly bugged. </li><li>The MAC version seems unable to be ran by current tests, however if you are able to get it running, do let us know.</li><li>Sift and Scattered Thoughts seem to have exploitable interactions when canceled.</li><li>Sometimes, the first wave will never spawn, the timer will count down from 10, reach 0, then go back to 10. Currently, the programmer is working on a fix, for now, please just exit the game completely, and restart. It does not appear to be an issue beyond level 1, but we'll keep an eye on it.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>Current\u00a0Version Patches:\u00a0<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Enemies now correctly spawn in the later levels</li><li>Wave 11 Win screen works correctly now. </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T11:30:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77e/77e8066c27e97c3bc84a74ff51a4ecf4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["chavezfk", "mewbusi", "Banished Crown Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
