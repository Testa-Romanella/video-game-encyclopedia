However, you can keep any extra you gain-- make a new pickaxe, a sword, some armor. Whatever increases your odds of coming back on your next trip!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures:<br/>\r\nRoguelite elements<br/>\r\nRandomly generated worlds<br/>\r\nFree Content Updates", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T02:49:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/810/810165aee0abc0d1ad66d2ceea1b30a9.jpg", "website": "https://belowthestone.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Strollart"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Apogee Entertainment", "Strollart"], "esrb_rating": null}
