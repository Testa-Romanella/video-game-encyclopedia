Until war came to heaven. One by one, the gods fell. Each Godfall brought with it a fierce meteor shower, as well as the sudden deaths of their worshippers. As the gods continued to fall and entire kingdoms were brought to ruin by the sympathetic deaths of the devout, many renounced their faith in the hope of being spared. Without divine protection, large numbers succumbed to possession and corruption as the demonic powers forced their entry into the world. Now, there is but one god. Her clerics exert dominance over the human remnants, ruling with an iron fist. Nomadic greenskin tribes pillage and burn their way across the land. Ambitious necromancers harvest the bones of fallen civilizations to amass undead armies of incredible size. The human heretics of the Cult of the Outward Path seek to break free from this world, risking it in the process. The dwarves of the Earthern Nations burrow ever deeper, trying to escape the madness of the surface world. Horrors wait there in the depths, ready to boil out and claim the old places. And all the while, sinister forces yet unseen lurk in the shadows and lay their plans. The fate of humanity hangs by a thread. Time to get to work.<br/><br/>Fifty years after the last Godfall, the winnowing of humanity has passed. The survivors and their descendants struggle to survive and rebuild in a world whose balance has dramatically shifted against them.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-11T23:53:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b59/b592903e23bf6ebf8ced63c42976f2c0.jpg", "website": "http://www.monstersdengodfall.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 84, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 45, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 413, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Monstrum"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Monstrum"], "esrb_rating": null}
