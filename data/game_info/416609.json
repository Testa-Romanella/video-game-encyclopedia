Credibility is the system that determines whether you are a good cop or bad cop. Arresting people will gain you credibility (but it\u2019s not an easy task). Killing the enemies will turn the city against you from fear and they will treat you differently. So you need to be careful out there, good cop or bad cop, that\u2019s\u00a0<strong>YOUR</strong>\u00a0choice.</p>\n\n<p>Good Cop or Bad Cop?
