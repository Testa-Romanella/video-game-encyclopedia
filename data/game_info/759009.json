This project started from a small game made to express how depression felt to me. Rather than it being violent or looming, depression is more like a still and silent monster eating at my insides.\u00a0 With A Still Place I wanted to reclaim what quiet places are like and create a place of healing. For me quiet places are the parks near my house, it's my playlist, it's my paintbrush and it's games.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>A Still Place\u00a0is also part of my Dimensional series. These five places are islands that exist in Pocket Dimensions. There are easter eggs throughout the five levels that will help you understand Pocket Dimensions a little more.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The original game was called Failure and is it still on Roblox.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T07:54:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bf/0bfb4415bc36d32683a981607c0c6300.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Christiana"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
