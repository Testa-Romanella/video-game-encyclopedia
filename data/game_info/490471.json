However some behaviors that exist in real life are not simulated in the game like the variations of currents or the resistances and the dissipation of the current in heat...<br/>\r\nA whole bunch of factors considered useless to learn boolen logic. In the game there are only two possible states for a cable type cell: Powered or Off.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game is for the electronics engineer as well as for the new player who doesn't know anything about electronics, as long as you like to learn and know more and more about this game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThanks to the campaign, you discovered little by little all that it is necessary to know about electronics to advance towards more and more complicated levels where one will ask you to succeed in reproducing a table of truth thanks to the circuit which you built.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere is also a sandbox/creative mode that allows you to create levels with custom truth tables and challenge your friends and other players with the system you have set up in the game.<br/>\r\nEvery level you complete will earn you reputation points, you can use these reputation points to publish your levels and compete (features that will come later in the game).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn order to learn more about the development and to help you we are setting up a discord that will serve as a forum to help you find solutions, discuss the game and give your opinion in a more direct way. You will also have the opportunity to discuss directly with the studio.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-10T16:57:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a6/4a6060ab2b166d4d1a02556102442a6c.jpg", "website": "https://discord.gg/wtmavqy", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JamalScript Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["JamalScript Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
