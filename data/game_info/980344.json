{"id": 980344, "slug": "picotrains", "name": "PicoTrains", "name_original": "PicoTrains", "description": "PicoTrains is a retro-styled railway management game, in which you build stations, lay track, and plan routes between urban areas to generate revenue.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPicoTrains is inspired by early transport-sim games, but in contrast to other complex simulations, PicoTrains' gameplay is extremely accessible. Despite the simplicity of its presentation, PicoTrains' mechanics reward careful strategic planning and optimisation. There are two gameplay modes: compete for the highest score in the timed mode, or just enjoy building a rail network at your own pace in the free play mode!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPicoTrains was developed in PICO-8, a fantasy console which emulates some of the typical features of 8-bit microcomputers and consoles of the 1980s. As such, it features 16-colour, 128x128 graphics and 4-channel chiptune audio!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-19T05:48:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49f/49ff84d2c4093e87c3e128823b25d9bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Soundole"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Soundole"], "esrb_rating": null}
