{"id": 357993, "slug": "memroid", "name": "Memroid", "name_original": "Memroid", "description": "Memroid is a modern take on classic watch-the-color-sequence-and-repeat style of games with a (literal) spin!  Quick to pick up and play, and so mesmerizing that you'll want to play it again and again.<br/><br/>Watch the given color sequence play and then repeat it in the same order to move on.  The board spins gently in one direction and then the other, but try not to let it detract you from achieving a high score.<br/><br/>9 levels, each with 3 rounds, get progressively more difficult as you go: the color sequences are presented faster and faster, the board spins at a quicker pace and you'll need to remember more and more colors as you progress.<br/><br/>Enjoy the changing visual and audio themes as you move from level to level.  Only the best of the best can get to level 9.<br/><br/>How far can you get?<br/><br/>How good is your Memroid?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T03:32:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54e/54eb6e2458aef37d0e9c005fa888275e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Prismatic Realms"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Prismatic Realms"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
