Its a demo for a simple game I came up with. I'm hoping to port this to phones as a simple, free game that anyone can learn and play. I currently have a few projects planned for this upcoming summer of 2023, so stay tuned to see what I'm up to in the future.</p>\n<p>I'll continue to develop this until I have a small, functioning, fun game to play when you're idle. If you have any suggestions, feel free to give me some ideas! I'll probably add any ideas I get because I don't have a particular goal for this game yet. I'll probably make levels in the future to provide more structure, although it is unlikely there will be a story at all due to the simplicity of the game.</p>\n<p>Developed on Unity (2D package) with the Unity Personal license,\u00a0sound effects from jsfxr website.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T16:57:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b26/b261aca3433da226cf0d6dd414a4ce79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TT6022"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
