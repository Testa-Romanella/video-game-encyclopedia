It makes him go faster but his vision will be narrowed so be careful...</li><li>You can make him walk once again by pressing the \"walk button (indeed Sherlock!). He'll move way slower but at least, he'll be able to see coins far away!</li></ul>\n<p><em><strong>H</strong>o<strong>w</strong> l<strong>o</strong>n<strong>g</strong> c<strong>a</strong>n <strong>y</strong>o<strong>u</strong> l<strong>a</strong>s<strong>t</strong>?<strong>?</strong>?</em><em>\u00a0</em>\ud83d\udd50</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T11:11:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/373/37328163a584c42cfc90af960533c147.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["AZAR Majed"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
