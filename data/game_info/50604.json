Over time he has three sons: the eldest Shinya, the second child Kasuga and the youngest Aiko.However, in the Iwata family tradition only the men can learn the secret techniques.<br/>This creates a gulf between Tamotsu and his daughter Kasuga, who disappears at a young age to follow the ninjitsu path, hoping one day to prove her worth.<br/>The years pass, the situation does not improve in the USA, and North Town continues to be hit by chaos.<br/>Tamotsu's situation is becoming increasingly precarious and as a result a gang of criminals decides to capture his youngest daughter, to put an end to his dojo and to stop him from helping the weak.
