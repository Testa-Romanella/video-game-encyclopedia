{"id": 924374, "slug": "tendril-lewismci", "name": "Tendril (LewisMcI)", "name_original": "Tendril (LewisMcI)", "description": "<p>Tendril is a metroidvania-esque game where the player is rooted down to a hub room with a large tendril, the player is free to explore multiple rooting paths that expand from this hub where they can encounter many different chamber types, these include puzzle chambers, combat chambers and environmental hazard chambers where the player will be challenged by an appropriate task that befits said chamber. The primary mechanic is that after a certain amount of time the tendril will yank the player back down to the hub room, however all progress the player made is kept meaning they can re-traverese the paths quicker. After the player has progressed past three chambers they will enter a large puzzle chamber where upon completion the player will be able to anchor their tendril to a new location allowing for them to progress further upwards.</p>\n\n\n<p>Made as part of the GGJ at Glasgow Caledonian University #GGJGCU2023</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T14:28:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/349/349c975519814722b3ed9393a120be06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LewisMcI"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
