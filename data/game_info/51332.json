This is the entire first season of the series that watches you.</h1>\n<p>How does it work?<br />\nThink about the fact that everything you do on your PC is interactive EXCEPT when video plays. We&#39;ve cracked that, creating a seamless interactive video experience that is personal to you.</p>\n<p>In #WarGames, experience the story with Kelly (aka L1ghtman) and her hacktivist friends.
