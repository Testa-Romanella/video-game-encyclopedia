Through the use of time travel, you must help your past self enter the building without causing any continuity errors.</p>\n<p>This solo project demo was created for the The Fresh Game Jam ULTIMATE run by StaberDevs. The theme was Anomaly, so it fit the time travel aspect pretty well. I plan to further develop this game to have better artwork/scenery, more voice acting, and some more complexity to the heist.</p>\n<p>Any feedback is greatly appreciated! If you stream or let's play the game, give me a shout by any means necessary. The easiest way\u00a0will be to post in my\u00a0Discord. I also stream a lot of game dev over on\u00a0Twitch, and I post updates on my games to\u00a0YouTube. Feel free to pop in and say hello!</p>\n\n<p><strong>***** If you wish to go into the game relatively blind, stop reading here! *****</strong></p>\n\n<p>The novelty of this game is that your moves from the past are literally recorded frame by frame, so when you see yourself in the past, that's actually you doing what you did beforehand. Also, I hand coded the ray tracing for what your past self sees, so if the game runs like a potato, blame that. I will hopefully be optimizing cycle time for future builds. Also, I threw a clock on the game so if you win, it tells you how fast you were. The fastest I did it was a minute and fifty seconds during development, but I know it can be done faster. Speed runners, have at it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-21T05:07:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/555/555ea4dc7c35cc1e70670d8fa9538aed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JonoExplainsThings"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
