Then the world suddenly changes around him, making everything bigger and hostile.  Fight your way through groups of possessed enemies, find a new place to call home, and maybe just discover a few secrets along the way.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game was designed to be fun, not difficult to beat.  It tells a story more than challenges the player, but that doesn't mean there aren't any tough fights in the game.  Attempt them unprepared and your chances to survive are slim to none.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T02:42:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec1/ec1becc2b9080f56104f7a15193a2d9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joseph Dalman"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Joseph Dalman"], "esrb_rating": null}
