I shan't spoil the plot by elaborating further... but it's not as lame as it sounds, I promise. There are multiple routes and endings to discover, so save often! Hopefully, with each playthrough, you'll be able to unearth more of what's going on and eventually figure out how to get the best ending. Good luck!</p>\n<p>For a list of trigger warnings, please refer to README.txt within the extracted game folder. Do note that reading it may somewhat spoil the plot though.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T04:31:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7d/f7d6dd6b67ba42bf7bbf02484e62c1ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kaelynmauve"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
