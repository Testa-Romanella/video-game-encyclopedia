In this game, you need to place 6 unique plants without knowing their attribute and create as much as oxygen as you desire. They may be hostile or friendly. They may be productive. Their memory may be weak. You need to figure out by placing them on the field and checking their productivity. But in the end, this is an endless game :)</p>\n<p>Solo developed in about\u00a06 hours with Unity3D. Special thanks to Meric Balkandere for the background music.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T07:38:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48f/48f1b960b690a0d2cc967e6cb805c685.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Merve"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
