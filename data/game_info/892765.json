If split more than twice, that ship is destroyed. Destroy incoming attacks for points. The difficulty level increases every 5 enemies destroyed and resets when split. Destroying an enemy\u00a0gives 5 points per level\u00a0(ex. an enemy on level 3 gives 15 points). The maximum difficulty level is 10.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T13:40:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3b/f3b4a9bb357dada4fb4b260e6d362ab9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tempust Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
