Travel with us through this rift to the year 2042, and take first-person control of Consortium agent Bishop Six on his first official mission. The result is a highly unique role-playing experience where you essentially play YOURSELF.<br/><br/>Imagine that YOU are the star of your own sci-fi action thriller. While the game presents you with a seemingly straightforward mission to rescue hostages, you have complete freedom to approach all situations as you see fit. Follow the Consortium mandate and work with your team to accomplish their goals - or work directly against them, even fully joining the other side! Both sides have their own truths, and it\u2019s your job to sort them out and decide for yourself who to believe and why.<br/><br/>We aim for Consortium: The Tower to become the ultimate sci-fi action immersive simulation.  Absolutely everything in this game has a narrative or world-building explanation behind it, including all of the game mechanics. In other words our goal from the very beginning was to ensure there are no \u201cgamey\u201d elements, allowing for maximum immersion.BACK STORY<br/>London, England, December 21st 2042. Terrorists have seized control of the Churchill Tower Power Facility, located in the center of the 1.5 km high Churchill Tower, and taken all of its civilian employees hostage. The global para-military police agency, The Consortium are being brought in to subdue the terrorists and rescue the hostages, and YOU are the principal agent in charge of the mission.<br/><br/>In the weeks prior to this incident industrial nanites, the primary workforce behind the construction of vast sections of The Churchill Tower, have mysteriously gone haywire.  The building\u2019s construction was ground to a halt just days before your arrival. Vast sections of the Tower are unfinished and reshaped, making navigating to where the hostages are a serious challenge.<br/><br/>Due to the unusual nature of the situation, this highly connected society of 2042 quickly become enamoured by your actions. Within hours billions are glued to their VR-decks, hanging off every move you make. Watch as news reports alter based on your actions, and an ever present \u201cpublic opinion meter\u201d determines your overall standing in their eyes.<br/><br/>Besides the specific story unfolding on the tower, the Consortium Universe is extremely vast, encompassing over ten years of development and worldbuilding. Every nook and cranny of every character and event has been meticulously planned, and allows for a completely optional rabbit hole to delve into for those looking to get lost in an alternate future from our own.KEY FEATURES<br/><ul><li>Play this game entirely on its own or import your universe from CONSORTIUM and continue your story seamlessly!
