{"id": 125594, "slug": "enforest", "name": "Enforest", "name_original": "Enforest", "description": "<p><strong>Enforest</strong> is an \"idle game\" about growing your own forest over time. Your trees will generate seeds. Plant those seeds to get more trees and generate more seeds. Create a truly natural forest with trees scattered in seemingly random arrangements, or a perfectly organized orchard with neatly spaced rows. Every single tree is unique, and features a minimalist art style drawn entirely by code.</p><p>Enforest is meant to be played a little at a time. You could leave it running while you work or play another game, or you could just open it up for a few minutes every couple of days. Or you could play it for hours on end, never once looking away from the heart-pounding action of...trees....growing.      That part is up to you.</p><p>Sometimes trees burst into flame. That's just nature. You might have to sacrifice your favorite conifer to save your prized maple. Or your could watch your entire forest disintegrate in a blazing inferno. Again, the choice is yours.</p><p><strong>Thanks for playing!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/154/1542a95305019cad4884b1eb816297f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Max Makes Things"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
