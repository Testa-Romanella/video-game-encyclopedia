There are a lot of bugs, and a lot of rough areas!<br/>My approach to designing this game has been similar to gardening itself: I've \"planted the seeds\" of a lot of different systems and mechanics, without a complete picture of how they'd develop. Some have flourished, finding a more central role in the overall game system, while I've let others \"die on the vine,\" when they weren't working out. With this process in mind, I've come to consider the game to be more like a \"banquet of signifiers\" than a singularly directed experience.<br/>Which is another way of saying that, like a garden, the game will never be complete. If I continue working on this project, I'd like to approach the work like a curator, a cultivator, a gardener. To have an ongoing relationship with it that extends in time, to watch it grow and change with the seasons, and with the ways that I grow and change as a designer.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Known Issues</strong></p>\n<p>There are a couple of buildings in the Garden that have doors that look like they can be opened: They were meant to, but I was having some scene transition issues and so have locked them for now while I sort that out. The Gold Keys that the Ghosts drop were meant to unlock them, so if you get a key feel free to just toss it, it has no use yet.</p>\n<p>For some reason, if you pause the game and click on the 'Resume' button with your mouse, it just locks up and you are forced to restart. This only happens if you use your mouse, it works fine if you're on a game pad or are using WASD/E to navigate the menu.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>KEYBOARD<br/>WASD: Movement<br/>J / LMB: Attack<br/>K / RMB: Pray<br/>Space: Dodge<br/>Tab: Inventory<br/>Escape: Pause<br/>E: Interact / Confirm<br/>Q: Drop / Cancel<br/><br/>CONTROLLER<br/>Left Joystick : Movement<br/>Right Trigger: Attack<br/>Left Trigger: Pray<br/>Y / Triangle: Dodge<br/>Select: Inventory<br/>Start: Pause<br/>A / X: Interact / Confirm<br/>B / Circle: Drop / Cancel<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T10:21:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c46/c460c6b8bcbdaf1e45e01a63e665c760.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Will Rhodes"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
