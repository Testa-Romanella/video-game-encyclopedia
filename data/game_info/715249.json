Inspired by Portal and Half-Life, GROW is a puzzle platformer with a heavy emphasis on physics-based puzzles and platforming.\u00a0It is about 1 hour long and has a bit of replay value with <strong>new game +\u00a0</strong>&amp;\u00a0<strong>playground</strong> mode. I hope you enjoy the demo and can get excited about the full release, planned to come out sometime late in 2022! Comments for bugs you found, issues, and more are appreciated as they will help make the final version even better.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Below is a bit of trivia for those two modes:</p>\n<p>- Two abilities in the game can be accessed through playground and new game\u00a0+, which aren't explained in the demo. These two abilities are detailed below:</p>\n<p><strong>- Dash:\u00a0</strong>Press left shift (or your appropriate keybind) to dash a short length in the direction you are looking. This ability recharges when you land on the ground or wall jump.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>- Overcharge:\u00a0</strong>This ability allows you to grow your cubes extra fast by double-tapping the grow key. This grows the cubes fast and can provide extra momentum when jumping off of a fast-growing cube.</p>\n<p><strong>- Annihilate:\u00a0</strong>This ability shrinks the cubes extremely quickly. This can be done by double-tapping the shrink key. This ability can be used the entire game.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Troubleshooting</strong><br/></p><p>This project seems to have trouble with Steam VR, so if Steam VR tries to run when opening the game, you should close steam and relaunch the game.</p>\n<p>Social media below to stay up-to-date with development:</p>\n<p>Instagram (Progress reports, funny development issues, etc.):\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/xavierlangland/</p>\n<p>YouTube (Occasional trailer for big updates, game music): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdcO1bz8uXh1NaP4RtiBnXQ</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T06:40:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a69/a69947b6e8616710185fb0cc810e736c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chadwick The Wizened"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
