Same buttons and colors.</em></p>\n<p><em>3 - Shoot arrows with button Q, move with button W and shot bubbles with button E. The cannon decide wich color you're shooting.</em></p><p>Clear all the bubbles to finish the level. Then the room starts over but it's slightly harder. There's totally 8 levels.</p>\n\n<p>This is my first game I ever publish! It was made in a week for the Summer Slow Jam 2019: 3-button, 3-color game jam with theme \"One more time\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-27T11:44:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc4/cc47d0d709f819be7869b72016ca17d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Axemachine"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
