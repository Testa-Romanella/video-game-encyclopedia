There is an online leaderboard system. You just have to create and account and\u00a0you will be able to put your name on the leaderboard.\u00a0<br/>You have to avoid the obstacles and collect as many coins as you can. There will be special powerup on your way to help you in your journey. You can upgrade them at the shop. There are many aesthetically pleasing\u00a0\u00a0themes and skins for you to pick so you don't get bored watching at the same graphics.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Swipe up to jump</li><li>Swipe down to jump</li></ul>\n<p>Dev Note:<br/>This was just a hobby project. Its my first mobile game. Its not a world changing game. It's very basic and generic. I dropped it while developing at first because it was not that special but after many months, came back to it and finished it. Because I don't want to leave any work undone. And it really taught me so much. Implementing user authentication and using online databases was new to me so I really enjoyed playing with those. I hope you have fun competing with other via the online leaderboard.</p>\n<p>THANKS !&lt;3<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T06:15:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/173/173a4ce4a60ede828192414b085e3d21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Mohammad Al Rafi"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
