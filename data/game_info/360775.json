The idea was, to create a game with puzzles in that were easily solvable with 2 players, but now that there was only one, required more thought.</p>\n<p>Again, all puzzles are solvable with both one person, and two people, but there is no way to get a second player into the game.</p>\n<p>Enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T19:31:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70f/70f959e93af6a5a02b5d5027deccd32c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Steeley"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
