Travel through a small and quick dungeon by solving puzzles based on your flashlight and the clues around you. Whenever you turn your flashlight away, expect things to change behind you. Nothing lasts forever.</p>\n\n<p>I will upload a video of my process in making the game on my channel in the near future. Thank you to everyone who plays my game!</p>\n\n<p>https://youtube.com/itsjackson</p>\n\n<p>~\u00a0itsjackson</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T08:50:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9f/a9f1207f58c2476c4ef27722ccd3f0c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["itsjackson"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
