The game is a 2d digging game where you pretty much dig ores, the ores can be sold for money so you buy upgrades in the upgrade tree! Please inform me of all the bugs there might be so I can fix them. Thanks!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad8/ad8204abdb74eebf62aa346b396562f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rotciv01"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
