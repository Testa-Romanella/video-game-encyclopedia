Don't leave, the game works.<br/>Note: Fast forward does not seem to work i Web-Build, sorry if the game feels a bit slow.<br/></p>\n<p>How to play: <br/></p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to get the pieces to thte tile of matching color\r\nClick on a piece to select it, and use the menu to give it orders to execute.\r\n  </p>\n<p>When you click play the orders are executed in rounds. For example:  On round 4 the blue piece\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 executes it's 4th order, then the red  piece\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 executes it's 4th order, then the green piece\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and  lastly the purple piece.\r\n    </p>\n<p>Two piece can be joined together, which is indicated by a  symbol\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 above their head. If a piece is joined, the joined piece  will execute the same order at the same time (although they are not  shown on the joined pieces order of list)\r\n    </p>\n<p>Every level has a number of minimum rounds to reach the goals, but as  long as the goals are reached the level is considered completed.\r\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is my entry to the GMTK GameJam 2021.</p>\n<p>I'm solodev, and this is my first isometric game as well as game with more focus on art. If you have feedback I'd love to receive it in the comments!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T19:42:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a7/7a7a48b873aa2c5d0afacfe2eaff6ad5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["ojaoweir"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
