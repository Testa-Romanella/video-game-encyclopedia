{"id": 399002, "slug": "chaos-game", "name": "Chaos Game", "name_original": "Chaos Game", "description": "<p>The chaos game is a method of creating fractals within a polygon by choosing a random point within it and adding another point at the midpoint of that and a random vertex of the polygon. These steps are then repeated with the midpoint as the starting point. The most famous example of this is the Sierpinksi Traingle. A complex shape arising from chaos!</p>\n<p>As it would be hard to do this on paper, here is a customizable chaos game where different fractals can be generated by changing the rules or polygon. Some fractals are impossible to create with this program, for example the Sierpinski Carpet and the N-Flake, but if you would like more customizable features let me know!</p>\n<p>I've also provided the Godot project file if you would like to play around with the code. I've left a lot of comments to try and explain my strange code.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-16T04:05:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82d/82def667dafe097c3d29af5987162b03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HackTrout"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
