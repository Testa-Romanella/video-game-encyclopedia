{"id": 403505, "slug": "hell-jagger", "name": "Hell Jagger", "name_original": "Hell Jagger", "description": "<p>This is a prototype I made with Unreal Engine 4.</p>\n<p>The game is intended to be a Third Person Bullet Hell in which the player will control a robot armed with a big hammer.</p>\n<p>The robot will have a basic attack and 3 special attacks, as well as abilities for movement such as a rocket jump and a jetpack that recharges over time.</p>\n<p>The main goal is to destroy the spiderbots in each wave so you can upgrade your robot in the Workshop and then finally get to the Boss Room and defeat it to win the game.</p>\n<p>The key of the game is that you can access the Boss Room anytime you want, but the more waves you destroy, the more you can upgrade your robot to make that fight easier. Keep in mind that the more time you spend fighting waves of spiderbots, the more chances you have to get killed before defeating the Boss, losing the game.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Please keep in mind that this is a prototype so the AI and the controls aren't perfect. I will update the game ASAP.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-10T03:52:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa2/fa263cf29c47180e6415872e69e754e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JorgeBocheto"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
