I recommand playing the Windows version instead ! /!\\ \r\nWelcome to Super Planet Delivery ! \r\n<p>Your task will be to deliver mini-planets throughout space, across 12 different levels. However, it will not be easy, as multiple obstacles such as asteroids and death blocks will stand in your way...<br/></p>\n<p>On your trusty rocket, press and hold <strong>Z / W to fly upwards</strong> ; release it if you want to go down. You need to grab mini-planets on your way. Once you have one, <strong>press X to throw</strong> it ! Aim for the vortex corresponding to the planet's color. But be careful ! Throwing a planet in the wrong vortex will is an instant failure. By the way, you should know that pressing <strong>C when having 2 planets in hand will switch their position</strong>, so that you can choose which one to throw.<br/></p>\n<p>Your rocket can handle 2 hits before exploding at the 3rd one. You can evaluate how much damage it has received by looking at the black smoke it emits (although the levels are so short that you probably don't have any trouble remembering how many hits you've taken...)</p>\n<p>And... that's about it for the game ! There's really not much to it, it's just some simple fun. The final levels can get pretty tough, so good luck ! I hope you have playing it !<br/></p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made for the Blackthornprod Game Jam 2, using the Godot engine.
