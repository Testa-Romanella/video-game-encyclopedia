It is all happening on one level. Content is loading and light is baking as you go. In many cases, it will be very apparent.<br/>The first build doesn't have a fail state yet: infinite ammo, infinite resources, no damage from enemies (they still attack you) and the tower base can't be destroyed. <br/>Yet, progression triggers and checkpoints are all implemented. <br/>The game in its current state can take 15 minutes to finish. You'll be treated with a final title screen, signifying that you have experienced all it has to offer as of now.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-25T03:10:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c6/5c6c62b20215a26ab77488c2f4b97671.jpg", "website": "https://www.quizcanners.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yurii Selinnyi"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Yurii Selinnyi"], "esrb_rating": null}
