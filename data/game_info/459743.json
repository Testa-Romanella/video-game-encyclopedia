Can you get them to mission control before the shuttle to Mars launches? \r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nThere are three types of cards.  The cards with an hourglass or a question mark must be played before the cards with a color circle.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nThe hourglass card will advance time one space.  Once the time bar fills up -- game over!  The question mark card will randomize the board.  And the color card will advance the chosen astronaut to the next open space of that color (or mission control)!   Choose wisely.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nAlthough this is a two player game, players are encouraged to work together.  \r\n</p>\n<p>Good luck! \ud83c\udf40<br/></p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>This game is built using the Love2d framework and was inspired\u00a0by Hoot Owl Hoot.<br/>All emojis designed by OpenMoji \u2013 the open-source emoji and icon project.
