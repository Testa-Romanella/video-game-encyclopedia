{"id": 437703, "slug": "surge-defense-prototype", "name": "Surge Defense (Prototype)", "name_original": "Surge Defense (Prototype)", "description": "<p>(FYI, Windows build only for now. I don't have a Mac or Linux computer to test on.)</p>\n<p>Surge Defense is a tower defense RPG that focuses on fluid strategy and relationships between towers. With blasters, photon rockets, and domesticated bugs, defend your computer from an onslaught of virtual invaders.</p>\n\n<p>This is a VERY early prototype for a game that I have been working on with a partner. Although we certainly want to try our best to execute well on the staples of the tower defense genre, with the game's tower synergy system and a yet-to-be implemented skill tree (a la Defender's Quest), we hope to create a tower defense game that really emphasizes players making choices about the way they play, and the types of powers that interest them.</p>\n<p>This prototype will be updated with some more levels, enemies, and upgrades in the coming weeks. Feel free to comment below with thoughts, email me at idjones@usc.edu, or tweet me @DragonTechno.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T04:43:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/281/28191b21a5ef359fb281cd2c5c06512a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TechDragoon"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
