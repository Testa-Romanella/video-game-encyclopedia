The game was developed in an in-house engine also developed during the Masters.</p>\n<p>Almost all assets and mechanics were conceived during the development of Twinlight Souls by the team, please find them\u00a0here.</p>\n<p>I ported a reimagined version of that game to Unity to showcase my skills in the engine. The whole port was done by myself.</p>\r\nMIT License\r\n\n<p>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\u00a0of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\u00a0in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\u00a0to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\u00a0copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\u00a0furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\u00a0copies or substantial portions of the Software.</p>\n<p>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\u00a0IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\u00a0FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
