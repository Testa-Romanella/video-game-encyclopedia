Protect your coast from relentless enemies using arsenal of weapons even Chuck Norris would envy.<br/><br/>It's you versus them. Can you make it? The enemy will keep on coming in more advanced vessels, trying to conquer your coast, employing different strategies: many boats at once, boats with varied speeds and zig-zagging movement, battle-hardened destroyers, nuclear submarines, and biggest of them all - air-carriers! They're gonna throw everything at you in order to get you. <br/><br/>And you're the only thing standing between them and your coastline.<br/><br/>But you're not unprepared. You've been training for this all your life, and you're just about to throw them a surprise party. You get to choose between 6 different weapons: machine gun, flamethrower, laser, homing missiles, cluster bombs and torpedoes! You can make a lot of damage! Each weapon has different range, speed and maneuverability, and you can use them to your advantage for maximum effect. And as last resort, there's the shield to protect your base from direct hits. But don't rely just on the shields; you know that offense is the best defense ;)<br/><br/>Coastal defense features great sound effects, mission goals that bring rewards and repair kits scattered throughout the game. Every sunken ship earns you coins, which you can use to replenish your weapons and shields, if only to survive one more wave!<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>- Multiple weapons: machine gun, flamethrower, laser, homing missiles, cluster bombs and torpedoes<br/>- Multiple enemies and enemy strategies, culminating in boss fights with air-carriers!<br/>- Powerful shields using force field technology to protect you from direct hits and crashes<br/>- Two-player offline mode to play with a friend on the same device!<br/>- Cinematic sound effects<br/>- Highly extraordinary game and incredibly fun!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T11:10:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/168/168c94d92ab798e0ca7ea461a30e0f52.jpg", "website": "http://CoastalDefenseGame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Fraoula"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Fraoula"], "esrb_rating": null}
