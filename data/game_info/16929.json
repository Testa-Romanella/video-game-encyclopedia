Playable from both the Axis and Soviet perspective, it strives to recreate the strategy, the forces involved and the general tension of that crucial period in World War II.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nExperience the highly fluid, enormously large battles of maneuver in a turn-based strategy setting. Take command in this mobile, back-and-forth sort of war where logistics and poor weather are often the decider, and defeat and victory are sometimes just a mile, or a day, apart.", "metacritic": 84, "released": "2012-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:55:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/956/95695a93d21a28e88acb866d5b99cfdb.jpg", "website": "http://unityofcommand.net/", "rating": 2.85, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 20, "owned": 376, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 4, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 13, "suggestions_count": 444, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 13, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["2x2 Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dvaput", "2x2 Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
