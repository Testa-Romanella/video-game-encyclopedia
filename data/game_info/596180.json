This will damage the wall - enough damage and that part of the wall will break.</p>\n<p>The NPCs will walk forward when the wall ahead of them is broken - your goal is to break enough wall for all of them to get away and walk off screen.</p>\n<p>At first you can't grab many enemies at the same time since your grabbing range is small, but you can use the shop on the left to purchase the <strong>+Grab Distance upgrade </strong>- this makes it much easier to break down the wall as you'll be able to grab more enemies to toss into the wall at once.</p>\n<p>As you kill enemies, more types will start appearing - including bigger ones which do more damage to the walls.</p>\n<p><strong>Info:</strong></p>\n<p>- Programmed with Java/LibGDX</p>\n<p>- Music and sfx made with LMMS</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T17:17:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/149/149a32efc2087434cba326a5e7749682.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["jordanb84"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
