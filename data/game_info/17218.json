Matt coded the entire engine and game from scratch, did the bulk of the character animations, and illustrated the story. Adam wrote the dialogue, filled in the background art with life and detail, did the other portion of character animations and generally spit-shined things. The game has been in on-and-off development and various states of release for years, but we're proud to say this is the best version yet.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-03T06:50:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/775/775ffadb8200015c28a2b9ccdcdd22c3.jpg", "website": "http://www.fataltheory.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 154, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 21, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 346, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["2 Hit Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["2 Hit Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
