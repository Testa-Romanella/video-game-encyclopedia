{"id": 4340, "slug": "uncharted-drakes-fortune", "name": "Uncharted: Drake's Fortune", "name_original": "Uncharted: Drake's Fortune", "description": "<p>The game that started the popular Uncharted series. It is all about a treasure hunt in the jungle and ancient ruins and thus somewhat similar in mood and aesthetics to the Tomb Raider series, albeit with a slightly more realistic approach. </p>\n<p>The plot follows the adventurer and treasure seeker Nathan Drake, who believes himself to be a distant offspring of the famous Sir Francis Drake. When exhuming his ancestor&#39;s remains, Nathan discovers an artifact that supposedly shows him the way to the legendary El Dorado, the city of gold in the Latin American folklore. Accompanied by journalist Elena Fisher, he sets out on a dangerous journey to a remote island. Throughout the game Nathan, controlled by the player, will have to fight pirates, using both melee weapons and firearms, and explore ancient ruins by jumping the cliffs, climbing the walls and swinging from the ropes.</p>\n<p>Uncharted: Drake&#39;s Fortune includes motion-captured cinematic cutscenes that help develop characters and the plot to the point the game may feel like a blockbuster movie.</p>", "metacritic": 88, "released": "2007-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-18T21:10:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/f2e/f2e6dcf9c27d99ba2551f1094ad41756.jpg", "website": "https://www.unchartedthegame.com", "rating": 4.03, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 78, "owned": 1620, "beaten": 1807, "toplay": 103, "dropped": 107, "playing": 29}, "playtime": 12, "achievements_count": 30, "ratings_count": 1420, "suggestions_count": 603, "game_series_count": 7, "reviews_count": 1438, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Naughty Dog"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
