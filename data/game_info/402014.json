John 'DRJ' Vanderaart is one of the first published game designers from the Netherlands, best known for \"Eindeloos\". Herby was his first game on the C64, which I played as a child. This is also my first game, as I did a remake in BASIC back then. Decades later I found out I still had the source code, so I decided to update it to more modern systems.</p>\n<p>Featuring one maze by DRJ, one by myself, and a random maze generator; and the famous Popcorn as background music. Unlike the originals, this one has save points and an automap.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T02:12:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/286/286d85776337dac9821da399df7176f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Crystal Shard"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
