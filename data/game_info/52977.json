{"id": 52977, "slug": "galaxian-3", "name": "Galaxian 3", "name_original": "Galaxian 3", "description": "<p>Galaxian 3 (also known as Galaxian\u00b3: Project Dragoon) is an amusement park attraction with elements of an arcade game released by Namco in 1990 which was later released as a scaled-down arcade cabinet in 1994. It is a walk-in style arcade game run upon a hybrid of laserdisc and traditional arcade hardware. It uses multiple Namco System 21 boards with synchronized laserdisc players (up to sixteen boards and laserdisc players in the original park attraction, and two in the \"Theater 6\" version) to create the pre-rendered backgrounds of the game. Each player shares the same life meter and takes the role of one of many stationary gunner positions (up to twenty-eight players for the park attraction, and six for the Theater 6 version), who are defending a spaceship called the \"Dragoon\" (hence the later subtitle) against an onslaught of enemy ships as the players try to destroy a space station called the Cannon Seed. It was one of only two games that were released for Namco's \"Theater 6\" arcade system, the other being its immediate sequel, Attack of the Zolgear, which was released in 1994. A simplified 4 player version was later released for the original Sony Playstation in Japan and Europe.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1990-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": ["NAMCO"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Namco"], "esrb_rating": null}
