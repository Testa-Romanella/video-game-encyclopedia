I feel like I've learned a lot since then, and I've seen a lot in the RPG Maker community. It feels like every year we lose yet another asset maker or veteran in the system. I understand and respect their reasons, but it's disheartening all the same. This entry is dedicated to these system titans. I've always dreamed of making a game people could point to and say \"Wow. I can't believe they made that in RPG Maker, it's awesome\". I hope with my entry, some 4 years after my first, I've gotten just the tiniest bit closer to that dream.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you all for playing and leaving your feedback. It means the world to me.</p>\n<p>And as always to the beautiful woman I'll get to call my wife one day: Thank you for supporting me in everything I do.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T10:51:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/157/1571e24e29e4e6fb5caa260735e3a7d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheLastYuriSamurai"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
