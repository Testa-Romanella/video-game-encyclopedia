But nah, every few centuries these pesky adventurers must invade your private space and try to snatch some artifacts. Over and over and over. Gosh... Guess you gotta wake up and dispatch of them.</p>\n<p>The game provides an in-game help menu, but here are the important rules:</p>\n<ul><li>Turn-based. You make a turn (move, attack, cast a spell, or hide in / jump out of\u00a0a vase), then your opponents make a turn (move or attack you).</li><li>Opponents can only attack you from adjacent squares, and can only see you if they have a torch and you are close enough. You can extinguish torches using magic. Enemies can light their torches from their comrades.</li><li>Hiding in vases conceals you from sight, but you can still cast spells. Jumping out of a vase breaks it, but replenishes your mana or hp.</li></ul>\n<p>Unfortunately, the feature with recording results doesn't work, because itch.io does not like me submitting http requests from https webpage. I haven't yet figured out a way to make my server respond to encrypted requests.
