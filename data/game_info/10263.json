Toribash is notable for its unique mix of fighting game and turn-based strategy based on ragdoll physics.<br />\nInstead of commanding character to perform certain attacks or special moves, the players manipulate various joints on the character\u2019s model. It includes relaxing, holding, contracting and extending different parts of the doll\u2019s body. After pressing spacebar, the model starts moving according to the player\u2019s command for several frames and then the next turn begins. The goal of each match is either to gain more points than your opponent or to knock them outside the ring. Players earn points by successfully performing different punches, kicks, grabs and other moves. <br />\nToribash multiplayer offers many different game modes. They vary depending on how many frames one turn takes, the distance between characters or specific aspects of in-game physics.
