I added some new stuff not mentioned in it, like powerups and bounce mechanics. The true purpose of the project was to learn how to use the program, and I might continue uploading versions since I'll still use it for that purpose.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T11:22:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/685/685f6ff563cf99e3deb0d89b676204e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["kusanagi_red"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
