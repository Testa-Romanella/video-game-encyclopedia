Then go to the Jukebox in the glowing area and press E. Wait a few seconds and then you'll hear the audio log playing. Once it finishes or you press F, the next record will spawn somewhere around the Jukebox. Find it and do the same as with the first record to hear the second audio log. Once you've heard the first 4 and found the 5th one you've beaten the game. Listen to the final log for as long as you like.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T07:48:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d0/6d08853e5e063b6f444e0df463bac78f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["katton"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
