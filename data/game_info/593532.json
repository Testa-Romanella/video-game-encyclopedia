Choose which dice to use to power weapons of your choosing. To use a dice, select it (left mouse button) and click the dice slot on the weapon that you want to use. Some weapons require specific dice (3+ for example requires a 3, 4, 5 or 6, and a weapon marked with \"odd\" will only take 1, 3 or 5), some require more than one dice\u00a0to be used, and others take multiple turns to charge up.</p><p>Once all dice requirements are met, the \"Use\" button will activate and you can launch your attack.
