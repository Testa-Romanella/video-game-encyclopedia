Resetting the level won't reset your progress!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>PLEASE READ!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Everytime you reset the level, you drop a glitched clone of yourself where you reset. You can shift places with this clone at will, as much as you want! While resetting will reset the level, you will be able to teleport to where you had reset and continue from there.
