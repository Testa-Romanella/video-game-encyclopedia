Developed in Unity.</strong></em></p>\r\nWhat is The Demons Inside?\r\n<p>The Demons Inside is a short proof-of-concept demo based around a semi-survival horror game. It is 100% playable and FREE for anybody who wishes to play, lasting around 30 - 60 minutes.<br/></p>\r\nWhy was The Demons Inside made?\r\n<p>The idea behind creating The Demons Inside is to show that something cool can be\u00a0designed, built and coded in just 12 weeks:\u00a0<em><strong>1. Spending only 1 - 3 hours a day.</strong></em>\u00a0<em><strong>2. By just one person.</strong></em>\u00a0<em><strong>3. In\u00a0a short amount of time.</strong></em>\u00a0<em><strong>4. By\u00a0using knowledge ONLY learned from my channel.</strong></em>\u00a0<em><strong>5. Without spending a penny.</strong></em>\u00a0Yep, that's right, you could build anything and everything you want, on your own for free just from following the tutorials on my channel and with only free assets.</p>\r\nWhat PC Specifications do I need?\r\n<p>You'll need at least:<br/><em>CPU:</em>\u00a0Intel i5 1.8 Ghz or equivalent<br/><em>RAM:</em>\u00a04GB or better<br/><em>OS:</em>\u00a0Windows 7 / 8 / 10 or equivalent<br/><em>VIDEO CARD:</em>\u00a0NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 or better or equivalent<br/><em>FREE DISK SPACE:</em>\u00a01.2 GB</p>\r\nWhat happens in the demo?\r\n<p>The demo takes place at the beginning of chapter 2 while you're searching for your partner. I wanted to go a little bit cliche with it because I kind of like that sort of thing. You'll see inspiration from several games too. There are puzzle and item elements as well as small randomization elements. You also have choices to make at certain parts of the demo.</p>\r\nAnything else to know?\r\n<p>If something cool can be made in a short time, just imagine what a team can do in a longer period of time. Bugs &amp; glitches will be present, but no game-breaking bugs should exist in the demo.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-18T02:17:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/982/9823907f0215b8eee151112373263389.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jimmy Vegas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
