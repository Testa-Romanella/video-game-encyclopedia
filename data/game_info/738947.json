But this is no ordinary town. In this godforsaken place, two ancient wizards rise from the grave, on All Hallows' Eve, to duke it out in an all-out, fireball-fueled wizard battle. Caught in the crossfire of this ancient grudge are the villagers. These peaceful skeletons and humans, friends by day, are at night forced by the wizards into a terrible battle.</p>\n<p>In this two-player nightmare, take up arms as Malufix, the Wizard of Light, or his immortal enemy, the Dark Warlock Bulfass. Burn your enemies and be the lone winner when the sun's first rays break the dawn. Who will win and become The King of Wizards?</p>\n<p>Game made by:</p>\n<ul><li>Joel Heinerud<br/>\n</li><li>Jens Hulteberg</li><li>Jakob Jarmar</li><li>Magnus Junghard</li><li>Fabian Sorensson</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T07:25:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b84/b84381370b7acf4598b9a01288aa1184.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sfabian"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
