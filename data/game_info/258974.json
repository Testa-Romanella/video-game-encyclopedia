More than 40 species of dinosaurs are waiting for you to bring them back to life after 66 million years!<br/><br/>As a representative of a private company, you have been given the task of building a complete, functional dinosaur fauna on a newly discovered planet while maximizing your company's profits. You have more than 42 species of dinosaurs to choose from - herbivores, predators, pterosaurs, aquatic dinosaurs.  You have access to many locations on the planet where you can try to revive the Jurassic era. <br/><br/>You can organize expeditions and hunts for profit, or you can solve situations by landing on the planet yourself. Technology also allows you to control the brain of any dinosaur you have on the planet. You can also breed dinosaurs, sell their eggs, and perform a variety of tasks. There is also a native alien fauna on the planet that you must suppress.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>STORY</strong><br/>66 million years ago, a 15-kilometre asteroid, Chicxulub, crashed into Earth.  The impact of the trillion-ton meteorite was enormously powerful and caused a worldwide ecological disaster. This catastrophe caused the last known mass extinction at the turn of the Mesozoic Era and ended the dominance of the dinosaurs. The impact created a crater 80 kilometres wide and 30 kilometres deep. The impact released enormous energy, resulting in fires, earthquakes and megatsunamis. The worst effects of the impact lasted 30 years. The impact winter that followed the impact lasted more than a century. The entire planet was affected. The disaster wiped out 75 percent of life on Earth.<br/><br/>By 2190, scientists had deciphered the dinosaurs' DNA and learned to reconstruct it. In 2220, the technology of traveling at the speed of light was discovered and successfully tested.  The exploration and settlement of planets beyond our solar system began.<br/><br/>In 2362, a private company, ACTAS, found a planet that is 85% similar to our earth from 66 million years ago. The planet was named Hope. The company decided to reconstruct the dinosaur fauna and use it for commercial purposes. The entire planet was declared a protected reserve. Only paying visitors are allowed on the planet. Some private companies have not recognised this move by ACTAS. The company expects huge profits from this unique attraction.<br/><br/>The first step was to build a space station in the orbit of Hope. Samples of several dozen dinosaurs were brought to the station. The entire planet has been fairly well mapped. Locations were selected for dinosaur settlement where there is less of an abundance of alien species inhabiting the planet. The company has appointed you director of the planetary colonization project. Your task is to build a functional and harmonious fauna on the planet and maximize the company's profits.
