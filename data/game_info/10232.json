The Virtual Reality revolution has begun and we would love to integrate the Virtual Reality community in our journey to create the all time best VR tower defense game.<br/><br/>We strive to create a community of followers that will participate with important decisions in the following months before launch. We are currently at a stage where the core mechanics are implemented and we are focusing on creating content. We are looking for a community who will be interesting in helping us design maps, enemies, weapons and the general story of the game.Future updates<br/>New maps and enemies are already on their way. We plan on releasing new content periodically. Some of the new features that planned to be integrated into the game are: <br/><br/>- New maps designed from ground up.<br/>- New enemy types custom build with motion captured animations.<br/>- Full player interaction with the menu environment.<br/>- New melee and ranged weapons.<br/>- Turret upgrades<br/>- Alchemist store to upgrade weapons, turrets and other items.Credits<br/>Developed by TreeView Studios<br/><br/>Producer: Horacio Torrendell<br/>Lead Developer and Game Designer: Lucas Szolno<br/>3D Artist and Level Designer: Maximiliano Kossyrczyk<br/>Audio Design, Composer and Video Production: Guillermo Ferres <br/>Graphic Design: Joaquin Amespil<br/><br/><br/>Additional Credits:<br/><br/>mr.Necturus<br/>Manufactura K4<br/>Rohit Kotiveetil<br/>Alex Gomersall", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:14:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/965/965247e3b202949b6d4bc07e55bd9faf.jpg", "website": "http://www.treeviewstudios.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 9}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 285, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TreeView Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["TreeView Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
