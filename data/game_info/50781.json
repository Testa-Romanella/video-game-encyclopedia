The players set out to explore an open shared world. The first thing available to the players is player creation, as the game offers the players to choose one out of eight randomly generated characters. After that, the players are let go to the open world.</p>\n<p>There is no certain objective present in the game. The players have to create a story for themselves. </p>\n<p>Players can take mission known as voyages. Voyages require you to locate an island on the map, sail to it, find a treasure, dig it out, and safely bring it back to the game&#39;s hub island. You will get gold upon completion. Gold can be obtained either through voyages mentioned above, boarding and raiding other players&#39; ships or clearing out a fort full of skeletons who have a lot of gold hidden in their stronghold.</p>\n<p>The gold can be used to buy cosmetic upgrades, such as new ship bodies or skins for your weapons. There are four weapons present in the game, with the players being able to carry two at the time. </p>\n<p>The game relies on the player to player interaction, as they are able to dance, use emotes or even get drunk together either on the ship or on the game&#39;s hub island bar. The ships cannot be appropriately handled by only one player, so it is a must to gather a team.</p>", "metacritic": 68, "released": "2018-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-21T00:48:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/5f6/5f61441e6338e9221f96a8f4c64c7bb8.jpg", "website": "https://www.seaofthieves.com", "rating": 3.68, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 123, "owned": 3979, "beaten": 192, "toplay": 149, "dropped": 669, "playing": 188}, "playtime": 12, "achievements_count": 480, "ratings_count": 1026, "suggestions_count": 460, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1037, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 5", "Xbox Series S/X", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Rare"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["Xbox Game Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
