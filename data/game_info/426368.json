The waves are infinite, so go as long as you can. Upgrade certain attributes with money you get for defeating enemies. Careful, the upgrades are limited and increase in cost when bought!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enemies are also randomized and increase in amount per wave, so there might be some unfair scenarios.</p>\n<p>I might add future upgrades and updates, depends on whether I feel like it or not.</p>\n<p>Developed and created by Gregory Weber.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T03:11:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d11/d116e5710fa1d631ca3f9e9906c7d9ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gregoryweber"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
