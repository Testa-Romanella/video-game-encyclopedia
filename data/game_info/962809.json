{"id": 962809, "slug": "starship-traders-mmo", "name": "Starship Traders MMO", "name_original": "Starship Traders MMO", "description": "Surf the stars looking for Aliens, wormholes, and unclaimed loot. Trade with ports or excavate planets to earn money. With cash, you can buy drones for Alien hunting. Even low-level Aliens carry cash and may well have a better Starship than yours.  Since combat costs resources, you'll want to ensure that you can win before engaging in battle.  Even when you win, however, you won't always show a profit from the loot.  Even so, an honorable kill will earn you experience and honor.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour ship will launch with a large amount of fuel, and you'll incrementally gather more fuel whether you're active or offline.  Movement takes very little fuel, especially if you travel light.  But some activities burn much more.  Repeatedly scanning for nearby starships will consume fuel far faster than travel. Towing large objects around with your ship also costs a lot of fuel.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOne last bit of advice; don't attack any ships lower level than yourself until you're quite clear on the risks.  You can become flagged as 'open loot' for that and it brings several disadvantages.  First and most importantly, you'll become an honorable target for everyone -- which means that anyone can attack you without penalty and loot your cash and ship if they win.  Avoid flagging yourself and your ship and cash will be safe in combat.  Second, your ship normally disappears after a short cool down period when you log off.  But if you're flagged, your ship remains visible until the flag expires.  And, lastly, any stealth effects that you may have are disabled while you are flagged.  Note that none of those penalties apply if you attack an 'open loot' flagged ship -- of any level.  Flagged ships are easy to identify by their red nameplates.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-30T02:49:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d9/6d90ec35e159106c161fc8b0571c3ab0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Ray Yeargin"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["Ray Yeargin"], "esrb_rating": null}
