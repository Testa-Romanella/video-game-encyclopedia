Your <strong>objective is to land on grassy plaforms and try to avoid rocky platforms </strong>as much as you can, as on contact with a rocky platform your health will be decremented. But more importantly <strong>avoid getting out of screen as it will result in immediate gameover.</strong> There are few cool power ups to pick up too.</p>\n<p><strong>Use arrow keys to play and \"Escape\" key to pause the game.\u00a0\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>That's all. Your honest review will be a great blessing to me.</strong> Consider donating a buck if you feel to.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T05:08:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/670/670de328bebc37cf6d71418b99cbde0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AshNDS"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
