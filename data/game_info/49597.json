Civilization has retreated from the world into massive super metropolises leaving the environment to flourish without human intervention.  Humankind has spread to the stars colonizing neighboring systems; taking their first steps into a much larger arena.  This is when the Event happened.  It forever changed the course of history but started with a small explosion in a minor power relay in an obscure Sutropolis on Earth.<br/><br/><br/><strong>LOG: z3077.01.21   [Source: Unknown]</strong><br/>We are trapped behind enemy lines but Vincent the lead scientist was able to cloak our facility before this part of the city was overrun.  Vincent has been studying their technology since the Event occurred and said he was on the verge of a breakthrough.  I hope that's true.  The sounds of battle are around us and yesterday there was an orbital bombardment that could have only come from one of our star ships.  Things must be really bad if they are willing to rain down that kind of destruction on the city.  I have no idea if my family was able to evacuate before the fighting began.  I must put that out of my mind though.  I've been selected to go into enemy territory tomorrow to retrieve tech from an abandoned storage facility.  It's the only way to finish Vincent's device and turn the tide of battle.  I can't fail, I won't fail!<br/><br/>Humankind might not get a second chance.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03b/03be885b9ad67d9538e86a9766ff67c7.jpg", "website": "http://www.operationpolarityhook.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 295, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cronoforge Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Cronoforge Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
