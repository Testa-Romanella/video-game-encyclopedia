You must pay them back, and to do so, you break into homes and steal things, avoiding the police. Eventually, you'll find a way to get revenge on the crime boss himself...\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nInteresting mechanics\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe built the engine from the ground up to support this kind of gameplay, and the game lets you think up your own strategy and complete the objectives your own way. You can use the environment to your advantage, from turning off lights to hiding under furniture.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nLots of different levels\r\n<p>\r\n\t16 hand-crafted levels with visual variety, set in different places, each with it's own backstory. See the trailer to get a glimpse of what the levels look like. It also has a lot of replayability, if you're not satisfied with your scores you can try again with another approach. The game also has a hard mode for extra challenge, where you have to collect everything in every level.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nMade by a small group of indie devs\r\n<p>\r\n\tCreated by three indie developers in their free time. We really appreciate donations.<br/>This game was made before the itch.io devlogs feature, so our blog, which has a lot of additional information on the game can be viewed at thetakergame.wordpress.com</p>\n<p><em>We are still looking to improve the game. Should you find any bugs, please report them on the discussion board.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b8/7b8778d7c0e51a716bf4fd5ddee410d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.0, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6, "toplay": 12, "dropped": 1, "playing": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 16, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 16, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Daemon"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
