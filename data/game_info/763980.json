You need to get to the other side where the grass is greener! Or is it?

It became somewhat of a basic demo then and I wanted to rework some of the code since Ive learned alot of better coding practices since then. I also aimed to port it as an Android game since thats something I've never done before . I made that one of the main goal with this Jam which also is my first one since picking up Unity and C# in beginning of february 2022. Therefor there is both a WebGL version as well as an apk file to load up the game on Android devices. I still think there is alot to work on when it comes to improving\u00a0level design, sound and graphics.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<strong>\u00a0 Development Log (Improve My Game Jam 20</strong>)<br/></p>\n<p>26-28/3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0* Rewrote lots of the code for input, removing Unity Input system entirely</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0* Made system for storing player inputs in list and executing them in order</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0* Changed the build to Android build and enabled touch inputs, <br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 (Had to remove Unity input system for it to work)</p>\n<p>29/3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0* Added four buttons that acts as joystick in mobile game</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 and made buttons on both sides for player preference.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0* Increased size of Menu system and moved stuff around.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0* Removed Button for Post Processing after effects.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0* Speed up movement and made all movement on main camera take up <br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 same amount of time regardless of player changing direction as well.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0* Fixed issue with complete game screen not showing properly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0* Edited some level layout</p>\n<p>30/3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0* Made game respond to type of build.
