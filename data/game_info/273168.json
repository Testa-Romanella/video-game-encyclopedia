Part of the challenge is supposed to be surviving several levels without running out of characters, and obviously this cannot be shown with one level. we already had the other levels designed. so we will upload a link to an unofficial version with the levels added later on, which will not be part of the actual LD jam submission.</p>\n<p><strong>Plot</strong></p>\n<p>The god of blood needs sustenance! But who doesn\u2019t love dinner with a show? Complete his challenge and be rewarded with your sacrifice to him! Use the legions of sacrifices you have brought with you to navigate the platforming puzzles set in place by the god, even use their bodies to make a bridge for yourself if need be, but don\u2019t dispatch too many, or you\u2019ll have nothing left to sacrifice! And don\u2019t die yourself or you\u2019ll have no one to complete the ritual.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\n<p>You are a shaman with the ability to summon forth your villagers, you start the game with a limited amount of villagers types, your shaman must NOT DIE! the rest are expendable. just summon new ones to replace them. You need to bring as many villagers to the the door to the next level before the shaman passes to the next level. anyone left behind on a level will die! Use shift to switch between characters. You can only have 1 type of villager summoned at one time. summon a new one near your shaman using the summon buttons.</p>\n<p><strong>Villagers</strong></p>\n<p>Shaman: You main unit, you must get him to the end of the level. He\u2019s the only one who can pick-up keys and unlock doors.</p>\n<p>Warrior: More sturdy, fights enemies. (we didn\u2019t have time to add enemies, oops\u2026)</p>\n<p>Ahuixotl: Can fix broken mechanisms (Ctrl key), can be used as a spring to jump higher.</p>\n<p>Fodder: This guy is the most expendable, let him die on traps so your other villagers may pass safely.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Arrow Keys: to move left and right and climb ladder.</p>\n<p>Space: to jump.</p>\n<p>Shift: to switch characters.</p>\n<p>Ctrl: (with Ahuixotl) To fix broken elements</p>\n<p>E Key: to use levers after they are fixed.</p>\n<p>Mouse-click: remove a dead body if it blocks your way.</p>\n<p>1 key, 2 key, 3 key: (in the post-jam version) loads level 1, 2, or 3 accordingly.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a42/a420f60ce3208e7e22b5feaf2f6cda52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CyberStarLight"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
