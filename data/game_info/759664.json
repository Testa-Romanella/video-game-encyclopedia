Fullscreen recommended.</p>\n<p>For some reason, the browser game hates Firefox. Seems to work fine in Chrome and Edge.</p>\n<p>A game heavily inspired by Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy. My goal was to make a fun, gimmicky version that adds some mechanics to give it a twist. It was aimed to not be a rage game. Did I succeed? ...mmm, not sure. But it IS beatable.</p>\n<p>This is just a playable version, but it should be feature complete. So the level design, puzzles, controls, highscore, etc. I still plan to work on the game in my free time. Hopefully, to slowly move it towards a more polished game.\u00a0Since this was rushed just get a playable version, there's basically no polish...</p>\n<p>This is actually supposed to be a part of a much grander project. Though, considering the time it took and my programmer artistic ability, I am not sure how that'll go. There's still so much to do...</p>\n<p>If you encounter any gamebreaking bugs, feel free to reach out to me on my twitter: @MikoteyP</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy it!</p>\n\n<p>This is a fan game.
