But beware, space is big. If there are any hostiles out there, you may need to devise a plan...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Space Explorer\u00a0</strong>is very early on its infancy stages, which I hope to work on further after this Game Jam. I hope you enjoy what I have so far! <br/></p>\n<p>If you have any questions, comments, and/or feedback, feel free to comment below.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>'<strong>E</strong>' - Turn\u00a0Engines On/Off</p>\n<p>'<strong>Space</strong>' - Turn Hyperdrive On/Off</p>\n<p>'<strong>W</strong>' - Throttle\u00a0Forward</p>\n<p>'<strong>Right Click</strong>' - Turn\u00a0Weapons\u00a0Systems\u00a0On/Off</p>\n<p>'<strong>Left\u00a0Click</strong>' - Set\u00a0Target/Shoot</p>\n<p>'<strong>Escape</strong>' - Undock</p>\n<p><strong>'Tab' </strong>- Outline SOIs</p>\n<p>NOTE: Your shield repairs overtime, but to repair your hull (or recover shield power faster), you must dock with those green space stations orbiting around each planet.
