One day, while you were serving your soup as usual, you realize that the fire under your cauldron doesn't go out.<strong> Your soup is going to burn!\u00a0</strong>You don't have enough time to remake the food, plus lots of people are already demanding for your soup! There is only one thing you can do..</p>\n<p>\u00a0 You have to use water, salt, spice and oil to balance out your food's tastiness, burnt ratio and ingredient ratio, while also maintaining your customers' satisfaction.</p>\n<p><strong>The end for your soup is inevitable, little chef; but how far can you delay that end?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>How to play?</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Drag the <em>Spoon </em>with your <strong>Mouse\u00a0</strong>and fill the <em>Plates\u00a0</em>with dragging <em>Spoon </em>over them.</li><li>Tap on\u00a0<em>Faucet </em>to fill your <em>Carafe</em>.</li><li>Drag and drop your <em>Carafe</em> over shown position to decrease your Burnt Ratio.

So as you can understand; it has not been easy, therefore\u00a0 there is no menu nor tutorial nor game over scene, there\u00a0might be bugs and bad drawn art. But overall, I'm super proud of myself. This was my second Jam of all time and first online jam, a Compo mode one even. I believe from now on, it is\u00a0just going to get better.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-09T02:33:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e08/e08ed97a348d9380498470f1368034d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tzdevil"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
