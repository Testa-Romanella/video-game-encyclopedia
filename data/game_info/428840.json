{"id": 428840, "slug": "bubble-bounce", "name": "Bubble Bounce", "name_original": "Bubble Bounce", "description": "The world is overrun with bubbles. It's your job to pop as many as you can before time runs out. Unfortunately, walking was also made illegal. Or something. The story isn't important. What is important is the gameplay, which is at its best with up to four players using three unique characters. Each character brings a new ability, such as gliding in the air for a short time or ground pounding send yourself downward quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBubble Bounce currently features a handful of levels, but by the full release will have a bigger handful of six unique levels. Each level will have a unique twist to the not-so-classic gameplay you're not currently used to.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlease note that this game is designed for multiple people. Playing the game in single player would be a great way to get used to the game, but playing without another person will make the game get very dull rather quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo play Bubble Bounce today! Or maybe watch some gameplay or the trailer and decide based on that instead of a vague description.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T06:12:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fce/fce5cbba93bd356db0d0a453d155f4cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TipperNockey"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["TipperNockey"], "esrb_rating": null}
