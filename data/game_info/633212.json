That's it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's not meant to be anything more and probably never will be\u00a0- I wanted to make this, I thought it was fun to drive around and maybe someone else might enjoy it, so here it is.\u00a0</p>\n<p>KEYS: Press C to change camera. Arrow keys or WASD to drive. R to select reverse gear, D to select Drive (yes, it's automatic). ESC to respawn at the beginning.</p>\n<p>Game controllers seem to freak it out, so you may have to disconnect a USB controller sorry.</p>\n<p>Have a nice drive!</p>\n\n<p>* This is pretty much an asset flip - I wanted to explore the car physics system, so made this to try it out.
