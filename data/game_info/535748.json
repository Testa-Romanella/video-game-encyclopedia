It has pretty much been put on hold for a while now and is still in the prototype phase. I don't know if I will ever fully release this game, but I will continue to develop it for the foreseeable future. The main goal of this game is to obtain a high score. You control a ball that is tethered to the center of the screen. Tapping switches the direction that the ball will travel. You have to avoid blocks that are coming from the bottom of the screen. I might add different modes at some point and probably add an online leaderboard. This is one of my first developed projects that I have made in Unity, so there will probably be a lot of bugs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T04:30:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/741/741ec03bf61d5e1c6b7b526c834e0233.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jayscoolthings"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
