Conquer the twists of Suzuka (respect the hairpin!), brave the fast sweeping curves of Brands Hatch, or master the balanced Silverstone circuit.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game has 3 difficulty levels plus a practice mode to learn the courses without the pressure of racing.\r\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Left/Right = Steer\u00a0</li><li>Z/Up = Accelerate\u00a0</li><li>X/Down = Brake\r\n</li><li>Enter = Pause menu</li></ul>\r\nTips\r\n<p><strong>This is a game where you have to slow down for the corners!</strong>\r\nUse the colour of the racing line to judge your speed.\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Green -&gt; You are fine\r\n</li><li>Yellow -&gt; You are close to the limit, but should be able to make the turn\r\n</li><li>Red -&gt; You are likely going too fast for the corner\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>If you're really having trouble, you can switch on \"Auto Brake\" in the pause menu. Auto-brake automatically slows you down for corners, but not to avoid crashing into other cars.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Don't be timid about muscling through traffic</strong>\r\nThere is no damage model. Your car is indestructible. Be fearless! :-)\r\n</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T06:15:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/762/7629486bd4b72f19508114cef659a67b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tom Mulgrew"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
