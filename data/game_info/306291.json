We thought a sequel to our original worldwide hit deserves a MEGA sequel, and that is exactly what we did with MEGA Pimple Popper! Twelve new juicy pimple types to squeeze; levels that randomize when you replay them; your fingers will delight in popping all of them pimples! #MegaPimplePopper<br/><br/>PIMPLEPEDIA and some pro tips:<br/>- Regular Blackhead. First scratch off the tip with your finger; then squeeze around to reveal the kernel. You can also swipe off the kernel when it's out. Delish!<br/>- Regular Whitehead. Squeeze around the center till all the pus is out. Juicy!<br/>- Nutty Center. Keep squeezing until you get the surprise kernel out. Crunchy!<br/>- Conjoined Twin. Start with the smaller pimple first and when that is done, then work on the bigger sized pimple next to it. Twinning! <br/>- Squeezy Cheesy. This is one of our favorites! Squeeze until you get all the oodles and cheesy goodness out. If you like ASMR videos, this one takes the cake!<br/>- Blackhead Cluster. What's better than one blackhead? A cluster of them! No need to scratch; just squeeze the small ones first and then work on the bigger blackheads. It's a party!<br/>- Scab. Scratch it off in the same direction. <br/>- MEGA Iceberg. Squeeze until you get that sucker out!<br/>- MEGA Whitehead. You want to keep squeezing until the bar reaches the green portion, and keep it in that range until the pus comes out. Smooth, easy strokes are good! <br/>- MEGA Blackhead Cluster. Well, it's a blackhead cluster, but so so many more of them! LOL<br/>- MEGA Tar Toothpaste. Oh, this one is a doozy! First squeeze to get the tip loose, then use your finger to pull downwards until the length is out. Keep repeating until you're done! 4 out of 5 dentists will scream when they see this pimple! <br/>- MEGA Crater. Clear the reddish outline of the opening by swiping outwards with your fingers. After that, squeeze to loosen the mega kernel and push upwards with your finger a few times until it's completely dislodged. <br/><br/>More pro tips!<br/>* Can't find a pimple? Rotate around the face with the left/right buttons and zoom in to find that last pimple. Don't forget to check around the neck area!<br/>* You can swipe the hair sections away from the face! There are usually some good ones hidden underneath. <br/>* Um, last we checked, moles are not pimples. If you see one, just go about your day. :) <br/><br/>If you're still reading this, you should stop right now and start playing the game already!
