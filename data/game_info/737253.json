Yet in spite of  this, humankind has long looked up at the night sky in wonder, wishing  to bask in the light of the tiny specks tucked throughout the sea of  darkness.\r\n         </p>\n<p>After a cataclysmic explosion rips through Sol and nearby  systems, the Galactic Empire is rapidly decaying. Corruption and piracy  run rampant. But where there is chaos, there is also opportunity.\r\n         </p>\n<p>Seize that opportunity for yourself in this freeform  space-trading and mercenary game: buy newer and stronger ships, hire  pilots to grow your fleet, or help a faction achieve its goals. Get  credits to use toward your goal by delivering cargo, hunting bounties,  ferrying passengers, or even turning to piracy. The choice is yours.  Along the way, you will help decide the future of the galaxy.\r\n         </p>\n<p>Welcome to the eye of the Imperial storm.\u2026</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T08:30:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7a/b7a1e6959bfd22fdd131b4700c948e94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 279, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["The Diligent Circle"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
