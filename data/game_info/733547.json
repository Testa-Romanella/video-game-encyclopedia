You send teams of four henchorks, henchelves and henchdwarves do your illicit jobs in the city, but be wary, as you'll have to manage their difficult personalities and the relationships that link them. Because your teams focus heavily on teamwork, they'll almost exclusively use abilities in duo, and the alchemy between the two will influence their efficiency.</p>\n<p>SynCOM is a tactical game where you will have to manage your units in and between missions. These missions consist of turn-by-turn, tile-based combat. The main focus of the game is on teamwork and relationships, and units are thus located within a relation graph, and are able and encouraged to use \"duo abilities\", skills that involve two units, and whose efficiency is heavily determined by what the characters think of each other.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T07:00:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a6/3a6b02b72c87f9624d3e43dedf8355b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 249, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MalanTai", "OliveOly", "Lucas Baran", "RomainSntr", "Guit0u"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
