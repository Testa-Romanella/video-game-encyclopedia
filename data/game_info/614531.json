I formed a group and decided to forget about school for an entire weekend and participate in the Jam where the theme was Falling Appart.</p>\n<p>And fall apart we did, we ended up only using 24h of the 48 available, and so we didn't finished the game entirely, but we\u2019re proud of what we have so far.\r\n</p>\n<p>We did make a small narrative for it, despite the fact that it might not be present in the prototype we made. It would be something along the ways of \u201cA giant Mole is eating up a subway, and our main character needs to run away and avoid the Mole from eating him.\u201d\r\n</p>\n<p>It\u2019s full of bugs, from the lack of time, and from the fact I haven't programmed in what feels like forever, but, in my opinion, it adds to the entire vibe of the theme XD.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The bugs vary from random teleportations, buggy collisions, and the fact that we can\u2019t distinguish the background from walkable platforms, and there are some platforms that fall but give off no visual cues that they are going to fall.\r\n</p>\n<p>Here are some images from the game... yes our main character is a green cube, like I said, we had some unforeseeable problems and only got 24 h so we didn't had the time to get player sprites in the game.\r\n</p>\n<p>We have some traps, in the form of electric wires, that are there to slow down the player\u2019s progression through the game. The player character passes through some different colors when he dies since he\u2019s being electrocuted (but since this is an image it only shows the red color).</p>\n<p>And the platforms that fall once the player touches them.</p>\n\n<p>You can check out the game here -&gt;https://gm48.net/game/1796/broken<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T07:35:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c73/c7305cfcf083f60bcd3f771a76d186f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dev-at-work", "MaryTeixeira"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
