But when I discovered this awesome site I decide to share it here as well for (hopefully) your enjoyment!</p><p>It's made in RPG Maker VX.</p><p>You assume the role of psychiatrist Henry Smith, who is trapped at the mansion of his recently gone crazy patient H. Wilkins. You need to explore and solve puzzles in order to escape and find out what is the cause of all this mess.</p><p>Multiple endings depending on your actions (full exploration is rewarded!) and about 2 hours of gameplay for your first time.<br/> There is a hint walkthrough in the game files, and also a few let's plays videos on YouTube.</p><p>This game is fanmade using resources not made by me and as such is a free game. However if you want to donate and help the bill paying while I'm working on my current project, you are more than welcome to do so!<br/>Thank you for taking the time to check the game out, I hope you enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d5/8d555250d36c0a2483739e66afafbdbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ted Latas"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
