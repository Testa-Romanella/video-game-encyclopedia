It was a bit of a learning experience, and overall a fun challenge to fill a weekend.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I\u00a0hope anyone who gives this game a try has as much fun as I\u00a0had making it, I look forward to hearing your scores!</p>\n<p><strong>Please be sure to check the credits page when you start the game, and feel free to click any listings on there to view the authors web-pages. If it weren't for artists like these, games would look and sound a lot uglier!</strong></p>\n<p>Special thanks to Adequate Travesty, who on a last minute ask, put together the main textures/art, please check out his incredible work here:\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://ko-fi.com/adequatetravesty</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>The goal of this is to try and manage the cubes that spawn in on the left and right side of the screen by flinging them into the \"reactor\". There is a \"neutron\" in the middle which changes colors, make sure the cube you toss in matches, if not, the reactor will become more unstable!</p>\n<p>To toss a cube, simply click and drag on it, it will fly in the direction of your mouse cursor.</p>\n<p>The chaos meter represents how many cubes are on the screen, the more cubes you have the higher your score will go up when tossing cubes into to maintain the reactor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The reactor level will steadily rise, but throwing the wrong cube in will cause it to spike, so be careful! Once the reactor meter is full,\u00a0<strong>game over</strong>.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T04:26:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f7/8f7c385bb95f910f5ae1c51a17850cc8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Donkelz"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
