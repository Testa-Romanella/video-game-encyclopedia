Some enemies have darkvision, some may flee from your torch... Successful adventurers will learn to use it to their advantage.<br />\nFight monsters in squad-level, turn-based, tactical combat. Solasta&#39;s dynamic environment offers some interesting tactical options. Bridges can collapse, leaving enemies stranded and vulnerable. Walls and columns can be pushed over - on top of your foes, if you do it right. The world is your playground.<br />\nPrepare to Think in Three Dimensions.<br />\nThe dungeons in Solasta are more than flat game-boards. Climb, jump, or fly around obstacles. Evade or surprise foes from above or below. Push them into chasms or drop things on their heads. Position yourself on high grounds to start the fight with an advantage.<br />\nSize also matters. Escape through narrow passages where bigger enemies won&#39;t fit and crawl through tunnels to find secret areas. Take advantage of the environment to find cover suited to your own size. Watch out, though - the monsters are also thinking vertically.<br />\nTrue to the Tabletop.<br />\nBased on the 5e ruleset of the world&#39;s most popular tabletop RPG, Solasta: Crown of the Magister brings back the thrill, tactics, and deep storytelling of tabletop games.<br />\nAs you play, you&#39;ll feel yourself reaching for your dice and miniatures.
