I honestly didn't have too much time to work on this. But I am writing this after pulling an all nighter lol its 6:49am right now. Anyway, I didn't have time to do any sounds or really fit the \"Side Effects\" theme.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I originally started making this game for the NES but after making quite a bit of progress I found out that I wasn't meeting a lot of the constraints the NES had. So now its for SNES haha.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was my first try at pixel art and 2d frame-by-frame animation which was fun. Also there are a lot of weird bugs, but please try to make it through if you can!</p>\n<p>Anyway,</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move: WASD</p>\n<p>Jump: Tap J</p>\n<p>Attack: Tap K</p>\n<p>Throw Axe: Hold K</p>\n<p>Return Axe: Hold K</p>\n\n<p>The level was inspired by this photo:</p>\n\n\n<p>I used Unity and Photoshop for\u00a0everything.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T08:12:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f74/f748007ae3ed73084c86f15b876e3318.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bewky"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
