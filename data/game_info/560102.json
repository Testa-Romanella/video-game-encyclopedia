{"id": 560102, "slug": "bread-game-yomiparis", "name": "Bread Game (yomiparis)", "name_original": "Bread Game (yomiparis)", "description": "<p>Bread Game is a high-speed simulation game about delivering bread to your fellow townsfolk under the moonlight. Pick up loaves at the local\u00a0bakery (or <em>bakeries</em>) and distribute your bounty as efficiently and swiftly as possible. A number will appear above each household signifying how many loaves of bread are awaited for delivery. Continue to supply the goods, because households waiting too long for a maximum order of 10 loaves will cause you to game over. Also be sure to keep track of the time, as each run only gives you a couple short minutes to satisfy your customers' demands.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>ARROW KEYS\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0 \u00a0move / navigate menus</li><li>Z\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0 \u00a0interact / select</li><li>TAB\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0 \u00a0toggle full screen</li><li>SPACE - pause / unpause game</li><li>ESC\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0 \u00a0exit level (from pause menu)</li></ul>\n<br/>\r\nNote\r\n<p>This game originally began as a light joke, intending to help address\u00a0the apparent shortage of bread-themed computer games.
