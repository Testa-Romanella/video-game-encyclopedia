{"id": 34113, "slug": "hoverrace", "name": "HoverRace", "name_original": "HoverRace", "description": "HoverRace allows players around the world to race against each other in a 3D environment. The player can choose one of four hovercraft before the race begins and competes against others on a track created either by GrokkSoft or by other users. The game supports dial-up connections and does not require a server for races. Instead, up to 10 players connect directly. However, users can connect to the in-game chat server called the Internet Meeting Room (IMR) where they can race and chat with others. While racing, players are able to send messages, shoot missiles, drop landmines, and use speed boosters placed in the race track.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn addition, sports tracks have been made. In some of these tracks a stationary player is used as a ball or puck and other players must hit it where they need it to go. Missiles and other items are very rarely allowed in these games.", "metacritic": null, "released": "1997-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T03:23:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1e/d1e001c80ffe37c7eda9c8f42b5b9f2c.jpg", "website": "http://www.hoverrace.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Grokk Soft", "GrokkSoft"], "genres": ["Racing", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Grokk Soft", "GrokkSoft"], "esrb_rating": null}
