I hope this doesn't become too addicting that will make me want to delete it, if ya know what I mean. ;)</p>\n<p>In all seriousness, I've had this little project in my possession for a couple years now, so I decided to polish it up a bit and release it to the publc. I'm doing this as an excuse to release something for this year while I work on my current project, Knight's Quest RPG.\r\n</p>\n<p>Once again, just like with Man-Pac, if you don't like it, that's fine with me. It's just something very short that I wanted to end up making, and it's not meant to be taken seriously.\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Space Bar: Flap<br/>ESC: Exit Game\r\n</p>\n<p>*WARNING*: If your computer detects the game as a virus, please do the following.
