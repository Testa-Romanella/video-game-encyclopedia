Start each maze by mysteriously falling out of the sky; given an overhead view of the maze they are about to navigate, you can quickly plan your escape. The objective of each maze is to break free of the containment field and escape as fast as possible! While traversing each maze, players collect and return StratoSpheres, tokens that will eventually overload the containment field, all while solving puzzles and avoiding obstacles to survive. When enough StratoSpheres are collected the maze explodes in grandiose fashion as you through to the next level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cd/4cdcf3949e8f12e45cb26283f9bf6e5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 311, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["variancecs"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
