I was inspired by the experience that was Iron Lung and originally my game was to take place in space before I\u00a0decided on a setting I personally fear. The depths of the ocean.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before making a larger full game I wanted to make the demo to first see if there would be interest. A full game would have a complete facility, external diving level, simple storyline and much more polish.\u00a0 I will consider this demo a success if it reaches 1000 downloads</p>\n<p>If you enjoy this demo and want a full game please comment below or follow me on my twitter.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T15:50:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/640/6407161daf95e466dd08d73fc5166134.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Amari"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
