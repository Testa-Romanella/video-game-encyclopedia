Featuring a character selector with 8 differect characters to choose from, and a multitude of 8 bit music. This is also the first game that I have ever made so I used the GDevelop game making software for an easier and more smooth experience, but I will soon move to using the Unity engine for the rest of my games in the future. THIS GAME IS VERY LOUD, so I suggest that you put your volume on a 6-12 if you are on a computer.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>WASD</p>\n<p>CLICK AND DRAG (left click mouse)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-04T04:04:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ab/9abc6d1d74ef70ef7de82b278d00988e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mc JIB"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
