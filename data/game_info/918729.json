Despite being a sequel to emoji ass blaster, the two games only use similar assets. This one is like a bullet hell, where the objective is to dodge the spaghetti rains falling from the sky and the enemies coming at you from either side of the screen. Shooting things increases\u00a0your points! There are also powerups in this game as well, all of which are listed and described in an included text file. Your aim is to collect as many (or as few, if you want to shake things up a bit) points as you can before dying. There is also a more comprehensive instructions text document included with the game.</p>\n<p>I made a serious step up in quality - now only most\u00a0of the assets are stolen from the internet (some were designed by me and my peers using images stolen from the internet), and some of the powerup images are not exactly \"child friendly\".\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T12:27:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/56b/56befebb8f6c225e1bf903dc5b7e0745.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZjamberEaber"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
