This endless hole overflows with  minerals and treasure.\r\n</p>\n<p>You are a dwarf from this village and you  decide to explore this mysterious hole in order to bring plenty minerals  to your village. But be careful as there are monsters as well.\r\n</p>\n<p>The deeper you go, the rarer the minerals found, and the stronger the ennemies you encounter.\r\n</p>\n<p>Will you be brave enough to go deeper and deeper ?\r\n<br/></p>\n<strong>Gameplay</strong>\n<p>You start at the village. From there, you either deep in the Hole or visit the Smith.\r\n</p>\r\n-The Hole-\r\n<p>You  fall in the void, making your way from platform to platform. On each  platform there are either minerals or monsters (maybe both).
