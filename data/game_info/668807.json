The player must navigate the levels by using a mechanic similar to the Rubik\u2019s Cube. Each room will have a different type of solving requirement such as finding loot, solving a puzzle, destroying a target or killing enemies. This will be done by using a combination of level manipulation, object interaction movement and shooting mechanics.\r\n</p>\n<p>Level Manipulation translates to the player being able to rotate a face of the cube just like a Rubik\u2019s Cube. This will lead to some interesting gameplay as the player will most certainly lose his sense of direction as the rooms rotate.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T08:00:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39c/39c5af0582817bc25455ebf7213da42c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Suharun"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
