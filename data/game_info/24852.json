The \n      simple-but-addictive game play revolves around brightly colored blobs \n      and boulders. When the right amount of matching blobs are stacked, they \n      explode and rain down on your opponent\u2019s field of play! Repeat this \n      until your screen is clear to move on to the next round. But be \n      careful\u2014the farther you advance, the faster the blobs fall, and the \n      smarter the opponents get! Are you good enough to help Kirby become the \n      avalanche king?\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
