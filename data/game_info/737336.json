{"id": 737336, "slug": "voider-2", "name": "'voider", "name_original": "'voider", "description": "<p>'voider is a small prototype made for the Phillip's Birthday Game Jam. The game is about avoiding always spawning obstacles and getting the highest score possible. The game was made using only 5 materials,\u00a0 primitive objects (in this case only cubes), made using the Unity version 2020.3.24f1 LTS and contains only 1 scene. It uses the new input system, so it should work fine on both AZERTY and QWERTY keyboard layouts. It was made in 2 days in total as I found out about this jam a tiny bit too late. It unfortunately has no sound as I was too busy with school during the time and participating in Nokia 3310 Jam 4 too.</p>\n\n<p>Oh yeah, if you're Phillip, Happy Birthday!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T08:55:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8d/c8dc3edbaa2974c4125cad2e811dbbcd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["IKDev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
