Keep an eye on your oxygen and fuel levels though, as failure to do so may leave you stranded in space. Best of luck out there\u00a0cadet!</p>\n<p>*IMPORTANT: This game was developed with/for the HTC Vive and the game may not be compatible with other VR headsets. In addition, the widget interaction component is invisible in the final build of the game (despite working fine in the editor), so you will need to navigate menus through pointing at and highlighting buttons.
