Apart from two core gameplay building school construction and the students'/teachers' management you also are free to control the development of the school. You decide the fate of your school, strict eastern style or more freedom western style, it\u2019s all up to you.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Students have their individual interests and life plans, which will result in much more challenges for the headmaster. Such as school prestige rankings, the basic needs of students, clothes, food, and even travel. To make this game more realistic, the pressure from examination also requests the headmaster's attention and control. From outside of school society, the headmaster has to also take care of threats coming from mysterious evil forces and all sorts of potential threats that might cause you go bananas. <br/><br/>  +  + <br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>How the school will look like it\u2019s all up to the headmaster ----</strong> free plan dozens of functional facilities and hundreds of teaching equipment and define the school's style freely.<br/>Extending areas horizontally is not the only thing you can do, you can also extend multi-story buildings vertically to meet the needs of more \"original\" developments and even build some \"bizarre\" buildings.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Teacher's and student's fates depend on the headmaster ----</strong> recruit whomever you want, cramming or being more flexible is all your choice. Developing your teachers will unlock their skills to fit in different positions. The headmaster can arrange elective courses for students which will affect their moods and learning quality, resulting in them having different life paths.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>How to deal with troublemakers in school is all up to the headmaster ----</strong> but always keep that in mind:<br/>school's recreational facilities will affect the students' moods. they could have much low engagement if they start feeling depressed.<br/>Students will gain weight if canteens over their needs. If students start to wear glasses or you notice other strange behaviour it means they might start feeling too stressed.<br/>If students couldn\u2019t use the bathroom for too long, it will cause them anxiety and will result in students using all the school facilities as a toilet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Be aware, students might have prohibited goods so setting up your own punishment system is important for saving many troubles. Additionally, you have to deal with real-time emergencies such as truancy, bullying, and questioning.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Associations, field days, morning exercises, and various events could help students regulate their emotions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Know more please follow our Twitter: @LetsSchool2<br/>Join our discord: https://discord.gg/2q9vtwmBge", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-10T19:20:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/949/949c9ed542df38122bf85e0575acd753.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 49, "toplay": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 225, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pathea Games"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pathea Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
