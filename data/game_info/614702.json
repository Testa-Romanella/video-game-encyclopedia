Any things that you see are made by me. Graphics are made\u00a0 for a main goal. Graphics are here to bring the story. They are quite basic, but made to be intuitive. Between minimalist, and pixel art, they are based on three main colors, purple, green and brown. The purple are basically the bad, the unknown, the green is the good, the done. And the brown is neutral.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We\u2019re a little beam of light in a big big world, full of darkness and void. The space. It\u2019s our world. But we have a goal. Put a little bit of green on all those little planets.But beware of the big black hole under you.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>To play it, you just have to use the gamepad in the right corner. Pull it and you will see the player just flying away like if you used a slingshot. And, that\u2019s it, let's discover the world.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>HEY BEAM! Try to aim everyone, from the child on his phone late in the night to the forties who is playing at the office.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>So, some rules: beware of all that can hurt a light beam, black hole, satellit, etc. And try to bring life everywhere. \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T08:25:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e9/0e95948891e8b32315e45f1332955a37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kpatain"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
