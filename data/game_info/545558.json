It's kind of difficult, when the two main leaders of found robots just can't get along and start a war.</p>\n\r\nCombat:\r\n<p>Fight in a turn by turn bullet hell combat system, with enemies using ever harder patterns and \"coin attacks\" against you. You'll have to dodge during the ennemy's turn, but also get close enough to hit during yours!</p>\n<p>Too hard? Too easy? Featuring <strong>3 difficulty levels</strong>, so that the game is accessible to anybody, for the current <strong>9 chapters</strong> the game offers.<br/></p>\n<br/>\n\n<strong>Other:</strong>\n<p>What? You want to see what's <em><strong>inside</strong></em> the game? Lucky for you, the game is currently <strong>open-source</strong>, so do as you please. Unless you distribute it afterwards. In that case you're uninvited to my birthday party. Shame on you.</p>\n<p>Not here to play, but just to beta test? A<strong> save file with every level</strong> <strong>unlocked</strong> is available to download (The file named Files). Just put it in the game folder and you're done!</p>\n<p>(Game is available for Linux, but <strong><em>has not been tested</em></strong>.
