There's also a new option to adjust the on screen game pad's alpha. I also corrected some bugs with pressing the directionals while the game intro is underway that caused you to be in some random location when the actual game starts, and the 8th menu option showing and overlapping the change character name option when changing the character's name. Also I have added all the main npc's that wander around the towns, the npcs inside houses and the shop owners, you can't interact with them yet and they are currently all the same looking, that will change soon but next I want to implement the shops and shop menus and then the static npc texts. next after that will be the story line, quests and boss enemies. Also of note is the windows version is now an installer style .exe when you download it.\u00a0<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p>Please check it out and let me know your thoughts, thanks<br/></p>\n<p>New menu controls:<br/>In the menu use arrow keys to navigate to the object you want to equip/unequip and press the 'z' key or 'A' button on gamepad<br/>In the items and magic menus there are 2 new buttons on the bottom to choose weather to use or equip the item or spell, note that you cannot use fight type spells unless you are in a fight.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>Arrow keys, W, A, S, D keys / D pad - move player<br/>Z key / A button - Attack<br/>X key / X button - Use equipped spell<br/>V key / B button - use equipped item<br/>C key / Y button - bring up the menu</p>\n<p>Things that aren't finished yet:<br/>no background borders yet, you can still go anywhere<br/>no story line or interactions yet besides the single monster<br/>no shops yet, you can enter them but nothing happens yet<br/>no npcs yet, no one is around to talk to yet<br/>no quests yet, you can go anywhere but there isn't anything to do yet</p>\n<p>Spoiler Cave maps<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31a/31a413f1d017a14ae7f88c8b90fb3831.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Roadhammer Gaming"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
