We laid down the flags and waited.</p>\n<p>Then came the heat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fires consumed the world. Roaring wind carried the ashes far and wide.\u00a0For years the colour green became a memory. The few survivors cherish it. Images of a world we used to know fill the sleepless nights. Trough the eyelids, a blurry streak and sparks as sharp as wolf's teeth. Counting sheep, like our mothers taught us, day and night.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Midway through the 19th century the world's civilizations had all been destroyed by a global cataclysmic event. You step into the shoes of one of the survivors \u2013 a shepherd. Can you guide your herd through a perilous land and into the safety of the enclosure?\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pastoral is a short 3D adventure game intended as a proof-of-concept and an intro level of a bigger project to be developed sometime in the near future. It was created by a team of four students as a part of the Game Development course on MFF UK.</p>\n<p>OnTriggerEnter():</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Josef Schmied</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ondrej Vaic</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Klara\u00a0Kacirova</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Alexander Belimov</p>\n<p>The music was composed by Lukas Brabec.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are grateful for any feedback on the feeling of the game and the controls.
