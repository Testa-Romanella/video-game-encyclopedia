The player finds themselves in a mysterious factory where they must strive to fulfil their own goals whilst trying to survive.</p>This game is a direct conversion of a gamebook/card game of my own design. The player is allowed to choose their character's goal, which determines how the game can be completed as well as some elements of the gameplay.<p>Most of the game is randomly generated each time you play. There are six endings, fifteen events with twenty outcomes and fifteen different items to find. There should be plenty of reasons to play through more than once.</p><p>The Factory's setting is a pretty thinly-veiled metaphor for the depression and grind of daily life. How do you deal with the dull greyness around you?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-22T15:31:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b9/5b97f17436393b58d72e5b0f626ed2ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mighty CheBo"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
