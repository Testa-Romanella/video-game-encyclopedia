Our small team combined life experiences to compose a new-year-esk story you can relate to and spiced it up with some humor, so you wouldn't fall asleep listening to a calming soundtrack. The game features no saves but can be finished in around 20 very satisfying minutes, it's also slightly non-linear \u2013 try again and choose differently if you want more of them crisp wintery dialogs.<h3>Story</h3>It is almost the end of <strong>Hibernation Day</strong>, a holiday of the last day before a long winter slumber. However, the celebration isn't going well and everybody's on edge. Your cool older sister isn't happy to be stuck at home, your silly younger brother is nowhere to be found, and the parents are fighting (as they often do). Help your family get along and find peace in the last day before winter hibernation.<h3>Creators</h3>Developer and game designer: Serezhka Korneevskii<br/>Artist: Nastasia Viatkina<br/>Writer: Aleksandr Korneevskii<br/>You must be aware that this game is our love-child, and if you treat it poorly, you should expect us to visit your parents for the explanations.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-06T15:24:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/868/8685bc71d3c3d2d860b188818ac7d0b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "beaten": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 6, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Ariorick"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ariorick"], "esrb_rating": null}
