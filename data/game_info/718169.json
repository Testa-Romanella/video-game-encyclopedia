Along the way you will find treasures hidden, or in plain sight, in hard to reach locations or even surrounded by enemies wielding weapons.<h3>Weapons</h3>You will find your own set of weapons the more you explore. Expect to find a mix of firearms, swords, hammers and more in various locations. The entire world is physics based, so enjoy decimating a variety of enemies in any number of ways.<h3>Co-Op Multiplayer</h3>Of course you shouldn't do this alone.
