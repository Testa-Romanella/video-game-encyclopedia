If you would please look a little bit down, there wou will read about...</p>\n\r\nThe gameplay\r\n<p>As you can see within the screenshots provided is Bossclicker truly an extension to your clicking power, oh great one. If you click on those pesky heroes trying to invade your domicile you will make them regret their decision.</p>\n<p>Yes, there are a few different types, like Undeads as those won't die at the deepest of nights but you, master of all great power, have the ability to unwrap the misteries of time itself with...</p>\n\r\nTIMEWARP\r\n<p>You can go back and forth in time but, sadly, your powers doing this is limited to yourself. The developer excused that you probably will not need this lavish feature but in case you do, you can...</p>\n<p>- Go forward in time</p>\n<p>Those heroes have no honor and will attack you, godly clicker, but you can harvest the immense power of centuries, raising your power to absolute unlimited infinity*</p>\n<p>- Go back in time</p>\n<p>My powerful master-clicker, you probably know this already but for those not knowing about this... Well, bending time into the past will heal yourself but sadly the pesky heroes, already fighting with you, will be healed to. Not that this will help them anyway.</p>\n\n<p>You also will change the time of day which may weaken some monster and strenghthen others.<br/><br/><br/></p>\r\nTemporary power\r\n<p>Our halls are filled with magical power that will grant you, oh ever so invulnerable master, more of what you already own. More damage to squish those who foolishly challenge you, absorb the vile magical damage that is be used by those wo are already doomed.</p>\n<p>But, those are temporary powers. I am sure you won't need them with your overwhelmingly good clicking powers.</p>\n\r\nDeath - Shame and Pity\r\n<p>Oh, and if you might be temporarily unavailable, heroes being dumb and calling this your death, you would be shamed but someone has pity - not that you would die anyway*</p>\n<p>But... in case this happens a bit too often you can help yourself with some additional powers from the chambers.<br/></p>\n\r\nGreat slumber\r\n<p>And if you're tired from clicking away all day, defeating waves on waves of pesky heroes you can slumber for a century or more! That will increase your timewarp powers even more! Again: Not that you would need it all powerful master of clicking pesky heroes.</p>\n<br/>Tutorial\r\n<p>I know, master of the best clicks in the universe, that you'll not need any form of tutorial but in case you might wonder about a thing or two we will have an assistant at your side that explains how most things will work out.</p>\n<p>And lastly, my fast clicking master, the...</p>\n\r\nEncyclopedia\r\n<p>You can ready anything about those who attack you if you wish to do so. That end's the explanation that you certainly didn't need but maybe someone else. If you excuse me oh best clicker of mouses, I have to bring monsters into the pits.</p>\n\n\n<p>* Death is absolutely certain and timewarp powers are strongly limited by the centuries you have slept.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-10T00:20:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cca/ccae12376d9cca2cad7ffb962947804e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Narsiph"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
