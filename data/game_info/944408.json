The principle of the exercise was to code splines with B\u00e9zier curves and to use them. They allow an object to follow a path predefined by the Games Designers and via a curve. We decided to use them for the enemy ship and the asteroids. It's only for coding and not for game design.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Lo\u00efc Desodt; Game Designer / Level Designer</p>\n<p>Enzo Dufour: Lead Project / Game Developper / Game Designer</p>\n<p>https://enzodufour05.wixsite.com/website<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T10:12:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c7/8c798eaf827bb991e95bf157e00b9be8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ickise"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
