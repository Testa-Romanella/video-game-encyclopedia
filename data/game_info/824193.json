Are you ready to engage in gladiatorial marksmanship, to display the heroism of your extinct species for the edification of the Autonomous Diaspora of Synthetics? No? Unfortunately we don't have the infrastructure in place to support that answer, your only way out is to endure the trials ahead.</p>\n<p><em>Survive the Robodome\u00a0</em>is a PVE wave-based first person shooter, currently featuring three distinct enemy types with unique AI/attack patterns.
