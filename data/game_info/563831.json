It's touch burnt and charred the earth, it's brilliance boiled the oceans. My skin blistered, and my insides cooked- and then, in an instant it was over. The sky went dark, and a silence choked the now ashen landscape. Within minutes, it grew cold, and in ten I was frostbitten.

Mankind withers in the dark, cold and afraid. Small blips of light wander the vast ashen landscape, in search of salvation. You play as a lone wanderer, guided only by the gentle flicker of their lantern. With every step you\u00a0take, the lantern dims, threatening to leave you at the mercy of the dark. Strange noises can be heard just beyond the glow of your lantern, and distant blips of light remind you that you are not alone.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T06:18:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46a/46af02d23faed224705881e239d5a1a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ja_uhelsky"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
