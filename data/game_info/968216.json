Player 1 can play with keyboard or controller 1, while player 2 can play with controller 2.<h3>\u2b50 PRESENTATION</h3><br/><br/><br/>LASERPITIUM is a horizontal 2D shoot-them-up with parallax and multidirectional scrolling, with high definition graphics entirely hand-drawn, with neat sound effects and music, and plays up to two players at the same time. It is inspired by these 2 great classics THUNDER FORCE 3 and HELLFIRE (SEGA MEGA-DRIVE/GENESIS).<br/><br/>Take control of one of the three ships of your choice and go to the different planets to eliminate each threat.<br/><br/>The action is omnipresent: you must destroy enemies but also pay attention to the elements of the scenery that can be even more dangerous.<br/><br/>During your missions, don't forget to collect the different bonuses that allow you to increase the power of your weapons, to recover energy or to earn points!<h3>\u2b50 THE STORY</h3><br/>In 2357, all the leaders of the galaxy S-08G signed a peace and cooperation treaty.<br/><br/>In order to optimize the management of goods, the control of military forces and the well-being of the populations, the computer program EVA is created on the artificial planet HELOS.<br/><br/>A few years later, the EVA program makes inconsistent decisions and creates serious social unrest across the galaxy. Military forces, now automated, directly attack all rebellions.<br/><br/>Today, a group of resistance fighters want to restore freedom and independence to the different planets. The mission is to attack the military bases of the EVA program and to annihilate HELOS.<h3>\u2b50 THE SHIPS</h3><br/><br/><br/>You have the choice between 3 ships which each have their own characteristics.<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>THE HORIZON</strong><br/>It's a military type ship. It can fire forward as well as backwards. The primary fire sends the projectiles forward. The secondary fire sends the projectiles backward.<br/></li><li><strong>THE SECOND FOX</strong><br/>It's the second version of the famous battleship of resistance. Its size is compact, its firepower is impressive and its handling is exceptional. Primary fire sends projectiles forward. The secondary fire sends two projectiles diagonally but they are less powerful than a primary fire.<br/></li><li><strong>THE PROTO.26</strong><br/>Here is the jewel of the technicians of the resistance. The onboard computer automatically locks the enemy closest to the ship: a bright target is attached to the locked enemy. When you shoot, energy dumps are sent directly to the enemy. Primary and secondary fire are identical.</li></ul><h3>\u2b50 HEAD-UP DISPLAY</h3><br/><br/><br/>At the top of the screen you have an head-up display that allows you to see the energy of the ship &amp; the number of lives, the power level of your weapon and the number of points.<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Energy and number of lives</strong><br/>The 3 green bars represent your energy: every time you get touched you lose energy. When you have no more, the ship explodes and you lose a life. The number on the right represents the number of lives: if this counter is zero and you explode, you lose the game.<br/></li><li><strong>Weapon power</strong><br/>Each time you recover a weapon bonus, your gauge increases. This gauge is composed of several levels: the more you activate levels and the more your weapon becomes destructive. Weapon levels are different depending on the ship used. If you lose a life, you lose all the bonuses of the current weapon level.<br/></li><li><strong>Score</strong><br/>This number increases every time you hit an enemy with your shots or you get a bonus points. This will allow you to earn extra lives!</li></ul><h3>\u2b50 BONUSES</h3><br/><br/><br/>To get an energy bonus, destroy one of these green modules. The recovered bonus gives an additional energy bar. If you are already at the maximum, then you get the equivalent of a large bonus point.<br/><br/><br/><br/>To get a weapon bonus, destroy one of these red modules. The recovered bonus gives an additional bar for the weapon gauge. If you are already at the maximum, then you get the equivalent of a large bonus point.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Point bonuses have the appearance of objects and are placed in the scenery. Try to get as much as you can to earn extra lives and finish the game with maximum points!<h3>\u2b50 MISSION START</h3><br/><br/><br/>Start by selecting the difficulty mode: from the easiest for beginners, to the most difficult for advanced players.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Select the mode of campaign. \"Classic\" mode lets you choose the next level at the end of each level, for a short campaign (approx. 25 minutes). The \"Full\" mode lets you play all 10 levels in a row, while choosing the order of the 5 starting levels, for a long campaign (approx. 40 minutes).<br/><br/><br/><br/>Select the ship of your choice, choose the color and validate. Note that during your campaign you will not be able to change ship.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Here we go: the resistance relies on your success!<h3>\u2b50 LEVEL 1: BOTALIA</h3><br/><br/><br/><strong>BOTALIA</strong> is a planet covered with forests and vegetation: for the EVA program, the quality of its rare woods and medicinal plants are of great commercial value.<h3>\u2b50 LEVEL 2: HYPTH</h3><br/><br/><br/><strong>HYPTH</strong> was considered to be the cradle of humanity, with its beliefs and deities. Over the years, mankind has forgotten the knowledge of the ancients. These places are now perverted by EVA machines. Infiltrate the sacred temple and destroy everything that has defiled this great civilization.<h3>\u2b50 LEVEL 3: ROYC-3</h3><br/><br/><br/><strong>ROYC-3</strong> is a hideout for EVA ships: because of its rock structure, it's difficult to enter without being detected. Sneak into one of its many caves, descend as far as possible, avoid the many falling rocks and destroy as many enemies as possible!<h3>\u2b50 LEVEL 4: SILSIUS</h3><br/><br/><br/><strong>SILSIUS</strong> is an ice-covered planet. Due to its extreme weather conditions, it is the shelter of numerous enemy bases that are invisible to the resistance. Get through the clouds, watch out for enemies with optical camouflage and avoid the dangerous ice peaks to complete your mission!<h3>\u2b50 LEVEL 5: ADVITAM</h3><br/><br/><br/><strong>ADVITAM</strong> is a planet in perpetual fusion: it is for this particularity that it is used as a foundry for the EVA program for the manufacture of its military gear. Because of its highly corrosive and toxic atmosphere, you must navigate close to the ground to avoid damaging your ships.<h3>\u2b50 LEVEL 6: TRILTEX</h3><br/><br/><br/>On <strong>TRILTEX</strong>, the mission is to make a lightning attack on a convoy of goods containing high-tech electronic components used in the manufacture of military machines for the EVA program. But beware, the convoy is heavily armed and can reach very high speeds for a machine of this type.<h3>\u2b50 LEVEL 7: NOVA</h3><br/><br/><br/><strong>NOVA</strong> is the planet of the elite. It has all the comforts of technology, and its inhabitants give priority to philosophical theories over human values. Scrupulously protected by the EVA program, you pass through the supply ducts to reach your main objective.<h3>\u2b50 LEVEL 8: S-08G</h3><br/><br/><br/>This level takes place in the galaxy <strong>S-08G</strong>. You cross the space by eliminating the last enemy fleets, just before reaching HELOS (artificial planet of the EVA program).<h3>\u2b50 LEVEL 9: HELOS</h3><br/><br/><br/><strong>HELOS</strong> is an artificial planet created by humans. It hosts the EVA computer program, which manages the entire S-08G system. The mission is to destroy the general power source to make the EVA program vulnerable.<h3>\u2b50 LEVEL 10: EVA</h3><br/><br/><br/>The <strong>EVA</strong> program is your last enemy. You've destroyed all its means of nuisance, and now it can only defend itself. This is the final moment of your mission.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-23T04:21:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/47a/47a755cf10cbc7bb464cc141e149bd51.jpg", "website": "http://www.thereeteam.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 561, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["THE REETEAM"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["THE REETEAM"], "esrb_rating": null}
