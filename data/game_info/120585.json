We modeled the aesthetic on our own development tools, the Ubuntu desktop and Bash terminal. Development was very hectic and we made quite a few mistakes, so the final result is very janky, but we're proud of it anyway! We hope you enjoy it too.</p><p><strong>Special Thanks</strong><br/></p><p>This game is based on a concept tweeted by the amazing @moshboy. Thanks @moshboy!</p><p><strong>Controls:</strong></p><ul><li>Work the main menu by typing a command and hitting Enter.
