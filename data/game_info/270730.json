The Game", "description": "<p>No one gets hurt, at least they say so.<br />\nIn community created arenas you compete with self-designed drones in order to become the smoothest drone operator in the galaxy.<br />\nNot hooked yet?<br />\nExperience an all-new game mode that merges the thrill of rugby with armed-to-the-teeth drones and highly tactical teamplay.<br />\n3-dimensional, fast paced and direct, stealthy or brute force action, team based or lone wolf, racing or fighting, you make it what you want it to be. You can amplify your drone piloting skills by creating the unique set of drones that compliment your playstyle and adjust in realtime to whatever challenges other players impose on you. With an infinite supply of community created arenas, which rank from fresh, over trending, to hot on the D.R.O.N.E. community hub, you can be sure to always have a challenge worth to take on. Heck, you may even create your own arenas, tournaments, and rulesets gaining yourself a reputation as an awarded architect.<br />\nNOTE: The racing game-mode is not publicly available at the moment.<br />\nNot our conquest of space. Not our level of civilization. Not art or philosophy. Not even our scientific progress as such\u2026 when the first contact fleet of the Interstellar Committee of Advancement &amp; Integration (ICAI) darkened the skies above the UN headquarters in New York 2137, the motivation for their intervention was clear cut: we were deemed a beast with tools and habits too dangerous to be left alone.<br />\nAnd to a subset of civilizations in the galaxy that meant: READY FOR THE GAME.<br />\nWarfare out there had become a regulated affair long ago. A ritual. A kind of sport. A source of entertainment backed by a vast and complex industry. Disputes over resources and territory, even the appropriation of some technology were no longer the subject of messy and uncontrollably destructive conflict. Such commodities would often become the formal prizes of tournaments, fought on a variety of natural and artificial stages all over the galaxy by teams representing companies, nations, a planet, an entire species\u2026 or just themselves.<br />\nRead more on the official website of D.R.O.N.E.<br />\nD.R.O.N.E. is currently in a successful ongoing on-site crowdfunding campaign.
