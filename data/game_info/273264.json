Use space to jump over pitfalls and lava, press down to duck under caves, and hold the right arrow key for the duration that you are traversing ice. All keys must be pressed in time with the beat of the song. Shadows of the main character are provided to assist in recognizing beat cues. Every missed beat loses one hit point, and its game over after you lose 3 hit points.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Created by:</p>\n<p>Mylyna Hy (Team Lead)</p>\n<p>Richard Hsu (Programmer)</p>\n<p>Michaela Gonzales (Programmer)</p>\n<p>Josh LeBow (Programmer)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cb/4cb4b762897d3c4fd26bd2326a223479.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["polarPug8080"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
