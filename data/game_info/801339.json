Each time, you try to enter a letter that is in the word.\u00a0If the letter is in the word, it will appear where it would be. Otherwise, a limb will appear on the hang, slowly forming a stickman.</p>\n<p>Example\u00a0here.</p>\n<p>Hopefully you get the point. The less errors you make, the more money you earn by the end of the game. You can buy cosmetics with that money inside the shop.</p>\n<p>Good luck.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T06:29:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e53/e538a2a8f01ada2d6643e9b02c9140c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GGberryNUTZ"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
