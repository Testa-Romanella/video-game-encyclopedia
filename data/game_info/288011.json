{"id": 288011, "slug": "dog-radio", "name": "Dog Radio", "name_original": "Dog Radio", "description": "<p>A 48 hour game made\u00a0by Where's My Duck for Global Game Jam 2019 (unofficially). The theme was \"what home means to you\" and \"Dog Radio\" is the name of our main chat channel in Discord, so it's the home of our friendship. Lovely.</p>\n<p>You must fulfil the requests of the dogs by moving the pipe to the correct location and giving them the objects they desire. They'll love you whether you succeed or fail though, of course.</p>\n<p>If the game isn't running at 60fps it might go a bit weird so.. don't not do that.</p>\n<p>Move around with W, A, S, and D and pick up objects by looking at them (using the mouse)\u00a0and\u00a0holding left mouse button. It might be a bit finicky but that's the price of otherwise unconditional love.</p>\n<p>Press F11 to go fullscreen, escape to quit, and R to restart.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p><em>Scripting/3D Assets - Thomas Mackinnon</em></p>\n<p><em>3D Assets - Gordon Morrison</em></p>\n<p><em>3D Assets - Jimmy Paterson</em></p>\n<p><em>Music and Sound - Ewan Morgan</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-28T04:28:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d9/2d9f64ee43f67475bae3697f93d621b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Where's My Duck"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
