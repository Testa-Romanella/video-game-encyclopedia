The burning rose has been remade for gbjam with added features.</p><p>\r\n\tThe burning rose is a action shmup game of tense combo chaining and score driven gameplay. Coupled with end game resource management and survival. The session time is low, requiring little time investment for the player. I have implmented a quick open ended scoring system for longevity, with the emphasis on maximization. One hit kills and quick restart make it ideal for one more go arcade style play. </p>TELL ME MORE...<br/><p>\r\n\t-Consistant UI<br/>\r\n\t-Local Highscore table<br/>\r\n\t-Autobomb mode, allows beginners to get to grips with the combo system and difficulty at a 10% cost reduction in score<br/>\r\n\t-Now type blanks in highscore entry</p>WHATS CHANGED SINCE LAST TIME?<p>-Reworked sprites to work with 4 colours<br/>-Spritesheet recoloured to allow for Palette swaps in code.<br/>-Gameboy and Nintendo influenced colour palettes.<br/>-Reduced token count to add extra features and optimised code<br/>-Added music tweaks and sfx<br/>-Xbox and xinput Gamepad functionality in browser (chrome and firefox)<br/>-Secret boss battle, for the highscore chasers...</p>HOW DO I PLAY THIS?<p>\r\n\tPilot the Burning Rose through a finite barrage of 500 missiles using only 500 of your own shots to cut a path. Each missile is worth one point. Destroying two missiles without a single missile leaving the screen starts a combo. Keep the chain going and your final score will be multiplied by your highest chain of your run. Push your chaining ability to the limit to make your way onto the local top pilot ranking!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIn one run you're given 3 bombs. Use them defensively to get out of a tight situation and avoid death. Or use them aggressively to maintain a chain and link stray missiles.\r\n</p>WHAT ARE THE KEYBOARD CONTROLS?<p>Menus:<br/>Z - Accept/select<br/>X - Back<br/>Up and down - Navigation<br/>Left - Select colour palette<br/>Right - Auto bomb toggle</p><p>\r\n\tIn Gameplay:<br/>Z - Hold to fire<br/>X - Smart bomb<br/>Arrows - Movement</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/517/517d62101f977f13a3c84bb8f0fcc6ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["grandtraindelta"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
