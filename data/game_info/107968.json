This management-sim was produced in 48 Hours for PTBO Game Jam 02. There's still some work to be done on it before it's really a true game, but here it is as it was upon the completion of the jam, with the exceptions of a few typos having been fixed! For a greater insight on how to play, check out the help page at the start of the game. Keep in mind that there are balance issues due to the short development time, but please offer any critiques or suggestions in the comments!<br/></p>\n<p>While you're at it, why not follow me on twitter?<br/></p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n<p>esarkis<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ba/2ba9a49160e92735665075878e3f1e41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Elisha Alexandre Sarkis"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
