It combines old-school J-RPGs and rhythm game inputs in its innovative Beat-Time Battle System.</p>\n<p>This is an early demo build, meaning this is still in development and many things are still subject to change. All feedback and comments are more than welcome!</p>\n<p>READ BEFORE PLAYING<br/>This game works much better using headphones and a controller. Plug in a controller before playing, as automatic controller detection is not implemented yet.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abb/abbe2d465a621264ab585688e9d648f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Milan Lefferts"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
