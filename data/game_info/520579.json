It was created in order to promote and encourage more diversity within the games industry.<br/></p>\n<p>In the game, you are part of a game studio, called Be Yourself Game Studios, and your job is to make sure that everyone is happy and comfortable being themselves, to maximize creativity and productivity! Sometimes, we can become anxious about certain things about ourselves and this can demotivate ourselves. This also applies to when working in the game industry. So in this game you have to help people get back on their feet and show them that its ok to be who they are!</p>\n<p>I used the Unity game engine and C# to program the game. All assets, including sound and graphics were also created by me too! Thanks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T03:31:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e1/0e14cb86399ade029f46bae6f74643c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tommy Eaves Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
