It's not only about financial help, by selling game in Early Access, but mainly about feedback - what did you like, what was bad, in which direction the game should be developed.<br/>I have a lot of ideas, but I do not know what players expect. Opportunity to play coop? A permanent upgrades system? A multitude of builds? Advanced AI? I have a lot of ideas, but I am asking you to help me decide what to do first!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0eb/0ebdd9ba5dced0458919078462a9954c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 313, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OP Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["OP Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
