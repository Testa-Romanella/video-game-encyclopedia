ViaCAD 2D/3D v9 + 3D Printing PowerPack LT", "description": "<strong>ViaCAD\u2122 2D/3D</strong> brings the power of 3D to everyone; regardless of your design experience. This software provides a seamless marriage of 2D and 3D to help you take your sketched ideas to 3D realism. Powerful but easy-to-use 3D design and drafting tools will help you create like seasoned designers and compatibility with other systems will let you share your designs. <br/><br/>With support for both metric and imperial measurements as well as AutoCAD\u2122, SketchUP, Rhinoceros and other formats to share, <strong>ViaCAD\u2122</strong> is the perfect 3D software to model your ideas. <strong>ViaCAD\u2122</strong> has tools for architectural drawings, mechanical designs, electrical schematics, Do-It-Yourself projects, and much more. <br/><br/>The addition of <strong>PowerPack LT</strong> allows you to prepare and verify your data for 3D printing. <strong>PowerPack LT</strong> provides a collection of tools designed to increase your productivity within 3D printing and managing CAD data by finding common mistakes with your model before printing. You\u2019ll save time and materials with an overall 3D print check.<br/><br/>Here are just some of the types of drawings you can create with <strong>ViaCAD\u2122</strong>: <br/><br/>\u2022 3D models for prototyping with 3D printers <br/>\u2022 Mechanical parts <br/>\u2022 DIY projects: from 3D models of game accessories, characters to furniture and work benches <br/>\u2022 Architectural drawings for drafting documents, room layouts and 3D visualization <br/>\u2022 Inventions: Easily create 3D models of your concepts <br/>\u2022 Educational: Drawings and 3D models for science fairs <br/>\u2022 3D Models shared at the office <br/>\u2022 Objects for use in game development studios <br/><br/>Creating 3D models is easy with <strong>ViaCAD\u2122</strong>, regardless of the design\u2019s complexity. The LogiCursor\u2122 will guide your cursor to help you create drafting documents or even align points in 3D. Editing is as easy as drag and drop with the Gripper\u2122. <br/><br/>\u2022 The LogiCursor\u2122 allows drawing precisely with your mouse and cursor in both 2D and 3D, aligning your cursor with existing points in your drawing. <br/>\u2022 The Gripper provides click and drag style editing for moving, copying, scaling and rotating parts of the drawing, even faces. <br/>\u2022 Push/Pull Modeling delivers intuitive editing of your 3D models, allowing 3D surfaces to be editing with your mouse and cursor. <br/>\u2022 Customizable Grids can be configured as rectangular, polar (circular), and even Isometric. <br/>\u2022 26,000 symbols are included to speed up your designing! <br/><br/>Powerful Solid Modeling <br/><br/><strong>ViaCAD\u2122</strong> provides solid modeling technology found in much higher end products. There is a unique tie between 2D and 3D; which means you can edit 2D profiles used to create 3D objects and the 3D shape will automatically update. <br/><br/>\u2022 Feature-based History Tree for editing <br/>\u2022 Powerful 3D editing tools such as blending, chamfering, and shelling <br/>\u2022 A complete design tool with extrusions, Booleans, surface modeling for more complex smooth surfaces <br/>\u2022 Precise geometry suitable for \u2018concept to manufacturing\u2019 <br/>\u2022 Tools to create 3D from 2D shapes <br/><br/>2D Drafting and Documentation <br/><br/>A complete set of 2D drawing tools is provided for drafting documents and sketching schematics, floor plans, mechanical designs and more. <br/><br/>\u2022 26 industry-standard dimension styles <br/>\u2022 250+ tools for 2D drafting and editing <br/>\u2022 Tools to create Section Views to highlight important drawing features <br/>\u2022 Automatically generate 2D drawings from 3D models <br/>\u2022 Bill of Materials for tracking <br/><br/><strong>ViaCAD\u2122</strong> is built with professional level technology providing speed, precision, and compatibility. Now a 64-bit application, <strong>ViaCAD\u2122</strong> provides a smoother workflow allowing for faster drawing manipulation and working with larger files. Compatibility with AutoCAD, SketchUp and other products means you can share your designs with others. Using ACIS\u2122-based geometry means you are creating with the same technology used by others using software costing thousands of dollars. <br/><br/>\u2022 Includes 19 file formats to share your designs. GES, STEP, SAT, SketchUP, AutoCAD, DXF/DWG, OBJ, Adobe Illustrator, Rhinoceros, STL, 3DS Max, and more.<br/>\u2022 Includes STL export for 3D Printing<br/><br/><strong>PowerPack LT</strong><br/><br/><strong>PowerPack</strong> expands the functionality of <strong>ViaCAD\u2122 2D/3D</strong> with tools for 3D printing.
