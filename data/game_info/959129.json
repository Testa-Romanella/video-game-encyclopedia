{"id": 959129, "slug": "we-still-here", "name": "We, Still Here.", "name_original": "We, Still Here.", "description": "<p><em>We, Still Here </em>is a post-apocalyptic text-based care simulator. Which is to say, the gameplay involves receiving care from the hands of your fellow survivors in an undefined post-apocalyptic environment. There is no way you can fail, no wrong choices, and no bad endings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Made in Twine, gameplay involves the player clicking links to drift through tangents and progress the story. There are two narrative branches, where the player character partakes in a meal or is washed clean, or both. Throughout these activities, the narrative features meditation on interdependence, care and community, and grief and loss.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Content warnings can be accessed by pressing 'game' on the landing page the file takes you to (which will also explain how to play the game for those unfamiliar with Twine), though it cannot account for all potentially upsetting content.\u00a0 Generally, the game explores trauma and surviving in the wake of it, grief, loss, and the complexity of being in relation when living with health (both physical and mental) difficulties. All these are explored through the lens of being safe and cared for in the present, but are applied both to the player character and other characters. Please take care of yourself when playing, and step away from the game as needed.</p>\n<p>Additionally, <em>We, Still Here</em> was written in the hopes of being as reflective for\u00a0disabled player characters as possible, with some notable limitations (for example, there are no options for playing the game as a character who is hard of hearing or is blind/with low vision). This was largely a by-product of time and resource restrictions, and is something I'd be interested in changing in the future for other projects. It is also queer friendly and features only trans characters.</p>\n<p><em>We, Still Here</em> was made for a deadline, and has some coding errors, though nothing game-breaking as far as I'm aware. I thought I'd make it available for others to play in the hope that someone else might find it a source of joy and comfort, but it is far from perfect.\u00a0 This project will not be updated or edited.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T22:56:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f57/f57241ee3649a61062711b3aa3e9b0d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["xvampstampx"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
