This was made for 2-Buttons Jam 2020.</p>\n<p>In this game, you play as a reaper who has 50 seconds to process 100 souls. Cats being cats, some sneaky\u00a0kitties\u00a0have snuck in and are hellbent on annoying you. As you may know, reapers can't reap cats, so they should be avoided at all costs.</p>\n<p>Reap the human souls, spare the cats.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>F - Spare<br/>J - Reap</p>\n\n<p>I originally started off with a different concept, but that didn't work out, so I gave up. Then, on the very last day of the jam, I suddenly got inspired and made... this.</p>\n<p>In total, I spent about 7 hours working on this little game. I hope y'all like it!</p>\n<p>Sounds are bugged in the web version, so if you REALLY want sound, you'll have to download the game. (sorry)</p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T03:56:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/400/40081d8858a7d8a0b55ba0ce22ec9364.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["basklein"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
