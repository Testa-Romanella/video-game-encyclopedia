{"id": 106238, "slug": "the-adventures-of-scottie", "name": "The Adventures of Scottie", "name_original": "The Adventures of Scottie", "description": "<p>\r\nYou play as Wallis \"Scottie\" Campbell, a young female art thief tasked with heist and espionage missions, under the careful guidance of Karen, aunt and mentor. The game series will focus on giving the player freedom of choice, in both dialogue and action, leading to different endings and unique dialogue trees. Different options will potentially lead to new sequences, areas and characters, dramatically increasing replay value.\r\n\r\nThe game will also leave space for varying play-stiles. A careful approach to a heist may yield better results, whilst going in guns blazing may be more exciting, though much riskier. Choices may have unforseen outcomes in the longterm, and the game doesn't feature any reload-checkpoint-and-try-agains. Players are encouraged to deal with situations on the fly, with the consequences of their actions featuring in future episodes. </p><p>\r\nOur demo is a short 5-to-10 minute game that serves as a small teaser for our full game. The demo has 5 different endings, each with a different bonus unlockable scene. </p>\r\nSYNOPSIS <p>The Game is set in the 1950s and follows a cast of less-than-savoury characters as they attempt to pull off international heists.\r\n\r\nYou play as a young female art thief, supported by your mentor, Aunt Karen, a veteran cat-burglar, and Fredi, your chauffeur/pilot/partner in crime. Throughout the game you will explore locations for people and situations that can be used to your advantage, build your reputation, develop relationships and learn more about your companions.</p>Credits<br/>\n<p>\r\n\tGame was developed in its entirety by Fleur Sciortino and Rebecca Portelli.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe game is currently in full-time development by Studio Fonde and is slated for release in 2016.
