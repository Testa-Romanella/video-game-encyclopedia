{"id": 5079, "slug": "mass-destruction", "name": "Mass Destruction", "name_original": "Mass Destruction", "description": "<p>Mass Destruction is a mission-based tank shooting game. Jump into one of three tanks each with its own strengths and weaknesses and take on 24 different missions, each with its own set of objectives. You must complete all the primary and secondary objectives and make your way to the extraction area for a mission to end successfully. During the course of the game, you can pick up tons of different weapons and destroy anything in your path. You&#39;ll encounter a seemingly endless array of tanks, helicopters, infantry, flamethrowers, buildings, bunkers, and gun turrets. Gamers can also expect big bosses and frantic, arcade-based shooting fun. Nearly every object on the screen can be blown up, so shooter fans will be in destruction heaven.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T08:29:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/90e/90e28e746d6845b098a583fee32a4598.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 12}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 188, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "SEGA Saturn", "PlayStation"], "developers": ["Sony Interactive Entertainment", "NMS Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Console Classics"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
