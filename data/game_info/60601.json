{"id": 60601, "slug": "acid-spy", "name": "Acid Spy", "name_original": "Acid Spy", "description": "Acid Spy is a first person stealth action game set in a cyberpunk universe. Infiltrate heavily guarded bases and take down your enemies with skill and finesse. Master the art of quick, deadly stealth to become the acid spy.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nExpect lethal opposition from cyber soldiers armed with laser rifles. Equipped with a silenced pistol and combat knife the odds may seem stacked against you, but in the right hands a silent attack is more dangerous than any rifle.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCombat arenas are designed around player freedom. Study your enemies and attack where they least expect it. Remain unseen or prepare to be hunted down.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nParkour and mastering the movement mechanics of wall jumping and crouch sliding is essential to overcoming obstacles and defeating your enemies.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nStealth is usually the best course of action. This doesn\u2019t mean you have to go slow. A skilled assassin moves quickly and strikes with deadly precision.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCompleting the retro futuristic theme is a melodic synthwave soundtrack from Wolf and Raven.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-13T13:33:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c5/3c56ca10775845cb7272ce10677d9312.jpg", "website": "http://acidspy.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 21, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Acid Spy Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Acid Spy Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
