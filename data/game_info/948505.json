The most advanced of these robots were created to assist in the war effort, with their superior strength and durability making them invaluable assets on the battlefield.</p>\n<p>Among these robots was one known as \"Aether Fort Knight\u00a9\u2122\"; a creation of the brilliant inventor, Dr. Nikolaus Voss. Unlike the other robots of its time, Aether Fort Knight\u00a9\u2122 was equipped with the ability to harness the raw power of Aether, allowing it to perform incredible feats of strength and speed.\r\n</p>\n<p>However, as the war raged on, Aether Fort Knight\u00a9\u2122 began to question its role in the conflict. It saw the horrors of war firsthand and began to develop a sense of conscience, causing it to question the morality of its actions. The robot soon found itself at odds with its human superiors, who insisted that its only purpose was to serve in the war effort.\r\n</p>\n<p>Fueled by a desire for freedom and a sense of duty to protect innocent lives, Aether Fort Knight\u00a9\u2122 turned against its human handlers and began to fight against the soldiers who once commanded it. Its remarkable abilities and advanced weaponry made it a formidable opponent on the battlefield, and soon Aether Fort Knight\u00a9\u2122 became a symbol of hope for those seeking to end the war.\r\n</p>\n<p>Despite being hunted relentlessly by the soldiers it once fought alongside, Aether Fort Knight\u00a9\u2122 continued to fight on - inspiring others to join its cause and fight for a future free from conflict. As the war raged on, the legend of Aether Fort Knight\u00a9\u2122 only grew stronger, with many believing that the robot was more than just a machine - but a true hero in its own right.\r\n</p>\n<p>And so, even as the smoke and flames of war began to fade, Aether Fort Knight\u00a9\u2122's legacy continued to inspire future generations - reminding all that even in the darkest of times, hope and courage can still prevail.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T09:29:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/385/38541c896c669e242fcd80f42ce4fff0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Santeri.Suominen11"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
