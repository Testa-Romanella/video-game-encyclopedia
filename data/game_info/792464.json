I've been creating my sprite sheets in Photoshop and building my maps in Tiled, then piecing it all together in GB Studio. This game demo is a mockup of an awesome hobby store near where I live. I currently don't have any objectives to the game yet, as I'm still learning the software and need to get variables down before going much further. As of uploading this, I just started GB Studio 2 days ago.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T13:35:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac8/ac86a08ca4cb879bb9b7c4e0492756fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["paulgoddard"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
