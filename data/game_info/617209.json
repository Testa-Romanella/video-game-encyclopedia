{"id": 617209, "slug": "redfall", "name": "Redfall", "name_original": "Redfall", "description": "<p>Announced during the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase, Redfall is a new co-op, open-world first-person shooter from Arkane Austin, the award-winning team behind Prey and Dishonored. Play it solo or in co-op with up to four players to face off against a legion of vampires that have overtaken the once-quaint island town of Redfall. In signature Arkane style, you will choose your path across the island and through the vampire masses as you discover what caused this plague of bloodsuckers, then put an end to the threat. Pick from a roster of heroes with unique skills and gear them up with customizable weaponry found throughout the island. Do whatever it takes to build the perfect team of vampire slayers.</p>\n<p>Redfall is coming exclusively to Xbox X|S and PC in Summer 2022 and will be available with Game Pass on day one.</p>\n<p>This Used to be Such a Nice Place</p>\n<p>Redfall used to be a bustling, beautiful island community. It had everything a coastal town in Massachusetts should have: a lighthouse, a lobster shack, a boardwalk\u2026</p>\n<p>When the vampires took over, they blocked out the sun, pushed back the tides, and effectively walled off the island from the rest of society, trapping everyone who remained. Now vampires rule the town by night and the human cultists who worship them patrol the streets by day. Not too many people venturing out of safety to check out the boardwalk these days, and forget about getting fresh lobster.</p>\n<p>Enter: You.</p>\n<p>In Redfall, you\u2019ll choose from a lineup of unconventional heroes, each with their own unique abilities and specialized weaponry, and face off against the bloodsucking legions threatening the island. You can go it alone, building your chosen character around solo play, or you can select the perfect character to round out a roster of heroes in up to four-player co-op.</p>\n<p>Meet the Squad</p>\n<p>\u201cWe wanted players to have an Arkane experience, but with the option of playing with friends this time,\u201d says Co-Creative Director Ricardo Bare. \u201cAs a result, we thought going for heroes with strong personalities and distinctive backgrounds would make for a stronger game. We think players are going to enjoy not only the interaction of their various abilities as they fight the vampires, but also seeing their chemistry develop over time as they liberate Redfall.\u201d</p>\n<p>Redfall features a rich campaign that explores not only the story of the island and the creatures plaguing its streets, but the stories of our four heroes as well.</p>\n<p>Layla Ellison \u2013 She may be the youngest member of the team, but there isn\u2019t much she can\u2019t handle with her wits and wildly powerful telekinetic abilities.</p>\n<p>Jacob Boyer \u2013 Jacob is an ex-military sharpshooter with a penchant for dark clothing and a mysterious vampiric eye. If you need to find him on the field, look for his spectral raven circling overhead. Jacob won\u2019t be far away.</p>\n<p>Remi de la Rosa \u2013 Always spotted with her robotic compatriot, Brib\u00f3n, Remi lives on the frontlines of conflict, using her brilliant mind and strong sense of empathy to protect her loved ones and help those in need around the world.</p>\n<p>Devinder Crousley \u2013 Inventor and internet-famous paranormal investigator, Devinder is ready to prove to the world that vampires are real \u2013 but he\u2019s going to need to survive them first.</p>\n<p>How did they end up in Redfall? Why are they fighting to save what remains? Why do Layla\u2019s powers manifest in the forms of an old-fashioned elevator and an umbrella? You\u2019ll answer these questions and more as you explore Redfall.</p>\n<p>The Things that Bite in the Night</p>\n<p>The Arkane vampire isn\u2019t afraid of crosses or allergic to garlic. They probably don\u2019t sleep in coffins or need an invite to come into your house. Not that long ago, these vampires were just normal people. Well, normal, greedy people. People who were so obsessed with the idea of eternity that they used science to turn themselves into monsters.</p>\n<p>\u201cVampires are perennially fun, classical villains, because they\u2019re ripe for every generation to reinvent and experience in a new light,\u201d says Bare. \u201cIn our case, Redfall vampires are science-inspired, triggered by biotech longevity experimentation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now they\u2019re building an army on Redfall, and there\u2019s a clear hierarchy of power. After their transformation, some vampires develop abilities like the Angler (seen in the trailer), who uses a psychic harpoon to drag you away from your team. These vampires are getting stronger and stronger as they grow their numbers and you\u2019ll need to ascend a ladder dripping with blood in order to reach the creatures at the top that started it all.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-12T09:03:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/683/6834c702c73e28ef2b3b003bb2c54567.jpg", "website": "http://Redfall.com", "rating": 1.91, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 50, "owned": 98, "beaten": 15, "toplay": 144, "dropped": 61, "playing": 6}, "playtime": 8, "achievements_count": 120, "ratings_count": 80, "suggestions_count": 555, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 81, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox Series S/X"], "developers": ["Arkane Studios", "Arkane Austin"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Bethesda Softworks"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
