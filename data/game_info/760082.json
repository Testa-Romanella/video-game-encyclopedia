Look no further! With this mini-window-game you can have endless supplies of virtual bubble wrap, with exciting standard colors too! Reminiscent of old Windows XP games, I hope will bring nostalgia to those who play!\u00a0I'm also really proud of how the audio for the game came out, as I did all the sounds myself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>**(Please not this is just a fun project, and dose NOT reflect the type of game I want to pursue in the future!) First game I actually release, not my first game I've worked on though.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T14:47:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f51/f51b009303cb115bd122bd86e41f3f4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sandyotters"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
