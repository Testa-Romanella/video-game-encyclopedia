Some triggers include; transphobia, gendered language, misgendering, homophobia, acephobia, biphobia and anti-polyamory. If you feel this may not be a good experience for you, please do not play it.<br/>-The Cocktail Societ</p>\n\n\n<p>We decided to make 'Blundr' in order to represent and shine a light on how to be more inclusive and respectful towards members of the LGBTQ+ community. The idea came about from most of our members relating to 'bi invisibility' where they felt like they didn't exist to certain parts of varies communities, including the LGBTQ+ community. We took that idea and spread it to several marginalised groups within the community to show players better and worse ways to respond to someone when talking about their sexualities and gender identities.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T03:25:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d4/1d49ed45be9705c43c1e24cf6c27c3a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheCocktailSociety"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
