You will be able to promote/demote and reward them for their performance. \u00a0The way you treat your crew will affect their performance, which in turn affects the performance of your ship. \u00a0So there is a bit of the Sims mixed in here :)</p>\n<p>This game is also about a story. \u00a0As the story unfolds your success and failures will affect the outcome of the game. \u00a0There are multiple mission paths, and multiple endings.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22b/22bf2ab6ac7a11f5e6e31616c90b69f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mennas"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
