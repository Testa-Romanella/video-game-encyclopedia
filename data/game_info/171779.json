Slimes battle it out in the most ancient of traditions; Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Best your opponent quickly. \u00a0If you take to long to make an attack, they may find you defenseless and attack you openly.\u00a0 As you are fighting, the poison still creeps into the dungeon</p>\n<br/>How to win\r\n<p>The last slime standing is the winner.\u00a0 Ensure all other slimes are defeated, and you will be announced as the winner.<br/></p>\r\nNotes\r\n<p>I'm submitting to jam, but this was a solo endeavor.\u00a0 The only assetes I was unable to create my own was the music, as usual.\u00a0 As such, I am removing the **Audio** category for voting. \u00a0</p>\r\nMusic Credits\r\n<p>**Title Music**<br/>Furious Freak Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p>**Game Music**<br/>Exit the Premises Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce8/ce85f1b7927404ab683d3a49947cea34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ManBeardGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
