This board game was invented to entertain lonely wizards on their long journeys across the vast lands of Aleaspira. The original game is played on a 13 by 6 tiles field (although other variants are wildly popular). The goal of the game is to get an army of soldiers from one point on the board to another. The path they follow is created by rolling a dice, leaving a number mark on each tile. These marks can be activated by one of the magic effects the player purchases in the shop and then imprints in one of the sides of the dice. Those can help the player to overcome obstacles as rocks or towers placed on the board. Came across the game for the first time? No worries, our experienced wizard is here to guide you through all the mechanics the game has to offer. Shall we begin?<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T09:10:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a96/a965fe90692edaedca35648cc0dbb9af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HyperCubic Studio"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
