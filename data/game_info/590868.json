Irresistible.\u201d</strong><br/>- Val McDermid\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>\u201cDark, visceral and disturbing, this highly suspenseful and beautifully written thriller is totally gripping from start to finish. A hugely impressive debut.\u201d</strong> <br/>- Alex Michaelides\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>\u201cOriginal, beautifully written, terrifying and haunting. I won't forget this novel.\u201d</strong> <br/>- Sophie Hannah\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>\u201cUtterly brilliant. Poetry and cinema at once.
