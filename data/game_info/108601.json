Here's a small game I made for fun with my free time.\u00a0 I wanted to learn game design so I promised myself I would finish something even if it was tiny. I made a lot mistakes and learned along the way as the game developed. It's my first time finishing a game from start to end so forgive the clunky design of the overall game. There's so much to learn..<br/><br/>Ah, but you don't want to hear any of this! Let's play!<br/><br/>[CONTROLS]<br/>WASD or Arrow keys to move<br/>Spacebar to shoot projectiles<br/>ESC to pause/leave current level<br/><br/>[TIPS]<br/>From my cousin:\"You gotta keep moving!\"<br/></p>\n<p>Sounds from : http://sfbgames.com/chiptone/<br/>Music is from Kevin Macleod: https://incompetech.com/<br/></p>\n<p>The game is only for Windows. Sorry!\u00a0 Mac users, I think you can just download the .exe and run it on Wine. *Crosses fingers*</p>\n<p>(There was an official Mac version but it runs delayed.. probably bad programming on my end, I learned about optimizing sadly around the end of development.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ee/2eebe40e8e9657c3dc15ff9f820f0756.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["juliansanchez"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
