Catch all the fish you can before someone \n      steals them from you! Strategy is fundamental in this exciting game. \n      Keep moving ahead of the other penguins so that you don\u2019t get trapped, \n      and try to get to the ice floes that hold more fish. Between one and \n      four players can play \u201cPenguins &amp; Friends\u201d at the same time\u2014providing \n      they can handle the polar cold. How to play? The board is made up of ice \n      blocks that have a set number of fish (1, 2, or 3) under them. The ice \n      blocks are hexagonal and form a structure like a beehive. The starting \n      position of the ice blocks can change, creating different game boards. \n      Each player has a set number of penguins (according to the total number \n      of players in the game and the size of the board) that serve as markers.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:38:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e5/2e58d99e553b6fb170728b19a8fc36b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 210, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Gammick Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
