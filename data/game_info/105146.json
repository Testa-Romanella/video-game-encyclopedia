In the highest quality possible (FLAC).</strong></p><p><em>\"This is a game for those who loves b-movies, absurd conspiracies, random LULZ, unconventional videogames that don't take themselves too seriously, Francis York Morgan and the narrator from Stanley Parable. The Last Dogma is a low-budget surreal story that plays with meta-references, social jokes, unpredictable stories and nonsense characters.\"</em></p><p>Positive - Monokoma, creator of Unseen64</p><p><em>I truly value independent efforts, and even more when they take risks as high as the ones taken in 'The Last Dogma', so while, maybe the final product is not as great as it could have been, it's fair to say that I'm looking forward to new developments from Sasha Darko and his crew. (1.3b Review)\" </em><br/></p>79/100 \u2013 Guns and Pixels<p><em>\"It's a very surrealist take on a rapid descent into madness of current political affairs. There's enough plot ends going at any given time that it can be a bit confusing, but for my part, I rather quite enjoyed the sense of working out this bizarre world, and to it's credit it does work out. I also enjoyed the fact that beyond a simple overaching point there really isn't any judgement made here\"(1.3b Review)</em></p><p>Neutral \u2013 Highland Arrow</p><strong>The Last Dogma</strong> is a surreal black comedy adventure game set in the year 1999 of an alternate reality world, where US actively campaigns for world domination after being disappointed with the results of the Cold War.

One day straightforward tracking mission turns into disaster, thrusting him into the village of cannibalistic Christian cult known as \"Holy Intentions\".
