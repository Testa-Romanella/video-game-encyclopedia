Everything in this are effects not glitches. Travel through a badly drawn world made by a little boy called Timmy. Apparently you don't like Timmy's game. Timmy is mad.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All assets but the tileset, fonts and death noise I made. I wrote the music and created the characters.</p>\n<p>\u00a0I'd like to thank Shaun Spaulding for showing me how to use GML through his YouTube tutorials (I'll leave the link down below). Also GameDevDan for introducing me and inspiring me to learn GML.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shaun Spaulding YT channel</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn7FE3Tx391g1tWPv-1tv7Q</p>\n<p>GameDevDan Vs.
