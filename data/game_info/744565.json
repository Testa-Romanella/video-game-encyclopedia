If you liked those, you'll enjoy this!\u00a0While not present in this demo build - there are plans for an overarching story and multiplayer craziness.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I wanted to fill a void in the genre\u00a0of crazy robot shooter games that keep up the level of destruction with\u00a0wacky weaponry, without taking themselves too seriously. Building weapons, levelling up your arsenal, and finding creative ways to blow stuff up is the aim of the game!</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Fractal Gear follows the journey of our little robot hero, Serkit, innocently flying through space with a crew of buddies, their ship is shot down by an interplanetary cannon - causing Serkit and the buddies to crash onto a planet made of scrap and rust.</p>\n\n<p>Picking himself up out of the sand and ash, Serkit is left with a wrecked ship and not a single crewmate left. Being an engineering class robot on board the ship, it's time to unleash robot warfare across the industrial wastelands with any and all makeshift tools and materials you can get your robot hands on!</p>\n\n<p>In this demo version of the project, a small slice of the gunplay and weapons are available to Serkit to train with in a shooting range. It's a great opportunity to see what the game is about, and give some feedback on systems that might need tweaking.</p>\n<p>This game has a lot of lore and multiplayer features planned, but it was important to me to get a working build out as fast as possible\u00a0for both my portfolio and for fans and people interested in the game to play with.</p>\n<p><em>Note: This build has only been tested with keyboard inputs - other controllers or gamepads are untested and may not work with this current build.</em></p>\n\n\n<p><em><strong><br/>No unauthorized reproduction or distribution is permitted of the works contained within this software without prior consent from the creator.<br/>The works within this product are fictional, and\u00a0do not necessarily represent the thoughts or opinions of the creator.\r\n<br/>\r\nAll character likenesses to real persons, whether living or dead, are entirely coincidental.\r\n</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>All rights reserved.</strong></em><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T08:44:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b13/b138b61a33a2c8f6ff20b6f2516d04c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JDSherbert"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
