Every time the Philips hue system sets a lamp to a color, you can blast away the spaceship having that particular color. But beware, if you mismatch the color, the spacship will take an extra step in your direction! Once you manage to blow them all away you have won! But if you miss one you are lost.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:22:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62c/62ce3d008b766766c3af053b0036571a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Martin Keesen"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": ["Martin Keesen"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
