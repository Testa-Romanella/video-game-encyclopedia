Players take control of the titular Last Sprite, a fairy-like being created by a dying god, tasked with destroying the harmful machinery that's sapping life from the land.\r\n</p>\n<p>This machinery was created by the previous inhabitants of the land of Remissar. These irresponsible creatures used their machines to convert life from the earth into energy they could use. The creatures themselves died out, but their machines didn't, and their continued sapping of life from the earth is taking a toll.</p>\n<p>Areas of Remissar are now devoid of colour, and can only be restored by destroying the machines. The Last Sprite - encased in a protective sphere of vines - must roll and swing through the world, find these machines, and break them beyond repair.</p>\n<p>The Last Sprite features a rolling main character, grappling and platforming mechanics, puzzle solving, and a simple-but-heavy-handed narrative inspired by the real-world climate crisis.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T08:11:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f5/3f5706bd0c80cf1bfda4b0e687401281.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 184, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Will Rogers"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
