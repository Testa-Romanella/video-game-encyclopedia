{"id": 821310, "slug": "roll-for-gravity", "name": "Roll for Gravity", "name_original": "Roll for Gravity", "description": "<p>Roll for Gravity is a game about jumping, and falling, and jumping again.\u00a0Become <strong>RD20</strong>, the <em>cosmic icosahedron</em>, and traverse <strong>the spacetime</strong> with <em>the power of randomness</em>! Every time you jump, you roll your 20-sided self and set a new value for the strength of the gravity field in which you are platforming.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is a submission for the GMTK 2022 Game Jam. The theme was \"Roll of the Dice.\" This game\u00a0was conceived and built in under 48 hours. All of the art, music, and writing was done by myself, except for the background which is a deep field image recently taken by the James Webb Space Telescope.\u00a0This is my first time ever participating in a Game Jam, so it's all very exciting! Thank you for your interest.<br/></p>\n<p>*Note: Currently the game only supports input by keyboard. You can move/jump/fall with the arrow keys or w,a,s,d. You can also jump with the space bar.</p>\n<p>Post-Mortem: There were so many firsts for me with this project. I'd done a lot of tinkering and prototyping in Unity before, but I'd never actually built a project and exported it. I've never even had audio in a project before... lol.</p>\n<p>Originally, I wanted each die roll to correspond to a different random effect on the mechanics of the game, like inverting the camera or making the player bigger. I wanted to have other types of dice like d4's and d6's for enemies as well.\u00a0I decided to go with one core mechanic for simplicity, and also because there were so many other pieces that I had to figure out like building the project and uploading it to itch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game ended up being very difficult, and probably frustratingly so. I think that the platforming geometry is a little bit too intense for the ability that you have to control the player. Overall, I'm proud of the atmosphere, the aesthetic,\u00a0and the writing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T07:38:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b57/b57d49a29c0f037635a305727dd79594.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TerraVito"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
