The main purpose of this jam for me was\u00a0to see if I still know how to use Unity after not touching it since last year's jam, which thankfully I still can, but with that said, I do still believe this is my worst jam game yet lol</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Music:\u00a0BBandRage -\u00a0opengameart.org<br/>SFX: Kenney &amp;\u00a0freesound.org\r\n<br/>\r\nScripts <em>(AudioManager and Pathfinder)</em>:\u00a0Brackeys\u00a0&amp;\u00a0arongranberg.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T06:47:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11c/11c3c82bcfc6250e67ddfb5efc3f23e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Break Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
