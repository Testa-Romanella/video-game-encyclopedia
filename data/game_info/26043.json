Immerse yourself in a new gameplay experience \n      that will reveal mind-hand-eye coordination skills you never knew you \n      had! Absorb viruses of your own color, but steer clear of the others. If \n      you need to, you can cleverly merge your ships together to create new \n      colors. Buzz past your enemies to keep your combo and clock up a new \n      high-score record. Explore an extra dimension to the game with the \n      multi-player mode and share the unique experience of cooperative play \n      between friends. Pool your forces, synchronize your movements, and \n      become a unified team (of up to 3 players) to meet the challenge \n      together!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:38:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce1/ce1f07e96b4181c72cd69bc4d4d76cfb.jpg", "website": "http://www.colorz-thegame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii", "iOS"], "developers": ["Sam Hardy"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Casual", "Family"], "publishers": ["Exkee", "Sam Hardy"], "esrb_rating": null}
