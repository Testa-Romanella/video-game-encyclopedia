Myalgic encephalomyelitis (M.E.) is a commonly post-viral disorder that can be debilitating and lead to extreme fatigue and even becoming bed bound.

Balancing when to push yourself and when to rest, knowing when to say yes to an invitation and when to say no. I myself do not have ME, but I do have chronic fatigue from other conditions. I have decent control over it at this time,\u00a0 but it still affects my day-to-day decision making. This game is inspired by my own experiences with fatigue and trying to handle relationships during flares.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T05:51:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/486/486ab9b2c76f522bbd0d89bd5ce0cb9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["singingstranger"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
