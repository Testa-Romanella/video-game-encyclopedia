In Unchosen, you are put to the test to ascend to the role of guardian. You are bestowed a power, although it is imperfect. You will have to earn the rest of your powers through trials of combat and maneuverability challenges.</p>\n<p>We built our game utilizing two meanings for this Jam: Bugs and \"Bugs\"</p>\n<p>This double meaning was fun to play with. Our gameplay concept revolves around earning an ability, but at the cost of another. And through this, you are challenged in unexpected ways of environment traversal or combat hindrances. We had hoped to explore many more options, but here's our demo :)\u00a0Hope you enjoy our prototype!</p>\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<p>Developers -\u00a0Vikerish,\u00a0Calexper</p>\n<p>Music -\u00a0Tetsu</p>\n<p>Sound Designer -\u00a0Jonathan</p>\n<p>Artists - mbt86,\u00a0QuineaPig,\u00a0Tetsu</p>\n<p>GitHub Repository:\u00a0https://github.com/Vikerysh/GameOffJam</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T07:14:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d8/4d8b875e4b69b084aa14945ae3b30c1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["QuineaPig", "Krqck", "Calexper", "Vikerish", "Tet-su"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
