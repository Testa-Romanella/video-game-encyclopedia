Dad's always in a bad mood. You're the elf who has to report to Santa about whether Barney has been naughty or nice this year, and it's not looking good. <br/></p>\n<p>This was made during Global Game Jam 2021. Created with PowerQuest for Unity, a 2D Adventure Game Tool made by Dave Lloyd.</p>\n<p>We are a team of musicians, so we have all been doing jobs we don\u2019t usually do! If you find any bugs (we finished this up super quick), contact @indiegames_muso on Twitter. (Or for a hint.) Some people have had trouble with the Mac build. Try The Unarchiver. Or ping Meg on @indiegames_muso. Thanks for playing!</p>\n<p><strong>Mac-specific</strong></p>\n<p>Try using The Unarchiver</p>\n<p>Also note that if running Catalina you will need to bypass GateKeeper by right-<br/>clicking the .app, then hold shift and click \u201copen\u201d.
