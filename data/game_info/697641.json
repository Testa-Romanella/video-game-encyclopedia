Point and touch the correct Guy to capture him.\u00a0</li><li>Pairs: Find pairs of identical Guys in the grid and drag a chain from one to the other to connect them.</li><li>Going home: Guide the Guys to the house of your team to earn points. Touch the road pieces to rotate them and allow the Guys to pass through.</li><li>Fence the clones: Each team has a original Guy inside a fence, and a bunch of clones in the crowd, drag your clones to your fence to earn points.</li></ul>\n<p>To play you will need a host computer with a screen big enough for everyone to see confortably and each player needs to install TheCrowd on their phones\u00a0to use as a remote pointer.</p>\n<p>The phone should connect automatically to the screen in a few seconds once both the host and the app are on. If they don't connect you can press the \"Connect IP\" button on the phone to type the host local IP and connect manually.\r\n</p>\n<p>To control the pointer you'll need to calibrate the phone. This is done by holding your phone and pointing it at the screen in three specific positions so the phone can understand where the screen is in relation to you.</p>\n<ol><li>Point at the center of the screen and touch the blue space on the phone screen;</li><li>Point at the upper-left corner of the screen and touch again;</li><li>Point at the bottom-right corner of the screen and touch one last time;</li><li>You're done. You should be able to see your pointer on screen and move it by moving the phone.</li></ol>\n<p>If you feel the need to calibrate again just press the \"Calibrate\" button on the phone, or press the \"Center\" button to position the pointer at the center of the screen.</p>\n<p>On the menu screen you can choose what colors the game will use, if you can't distinguish some of these colors you can disable them.
