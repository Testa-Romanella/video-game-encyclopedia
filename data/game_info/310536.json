Horde Tactics was the answer!\r\n<p>Crowdfunding is a magical way to turn the impossible into possible through the power of community-building and mutual trust. That said, we weren't fond of the fact that in most cases it had to be the community to take a leap of faith towards the success of a project. Everyone understands why it has to work that way for most cases, but we decided to put our heads together and question ourselves if we really had to fit in \"most cases\".</p>\n\r\nShort answer? Nope!\r\n<p>While we can't finish our big project in two months, we took our own leap of faith and invested our time and money to create a complete tabletop adaptation based in the world, lore and mechanics of A Horde Too Many and we made it a full featured collectible card game as an exclusive Kickstarter reward!</p>\n\r\nBut it wasn't enough!\r\n<p>We knew we could get our cards and boxes printed and delivered soon after our campaign was over, but we didn't want to settle for \"soon after\", so we rolled up our sleeves once more and also turned it into a\u00a0<strong>full featured DIGITAL collectible card game</strong>\u00a0that you can play online right now!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-19T06:12:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddf/ddfa2d193bf342d99ed862790cb79ab5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AHordeTooMany"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
