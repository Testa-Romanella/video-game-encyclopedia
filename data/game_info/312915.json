The Trickster answers the question to the best of his knowledge and belief.<br/><br/>- Once everyone has typed in their answer, the display shows all the suggested solutions, including that of the Trickster, which has to be guessed. <br/><br/>- Now every*r* player* types in which of the statements he/she thinks the Trickster has written. Then the game is resolved. <br/><br/>- Points are awarded to any player who has correctly guessed the Trickster's statement. Points are also awarded if the player's own suggestion has been made. The trickster receives points for every correctly guessed tip.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:38:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7c/c7ce8c40134b38faaca8e33c821b7262.jpg", "website": "http://www.flyingpotato.de", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Flying Potato Entertainment"], "genres": ["Card"], "publishers": ["Flying Potato Entertainment UG haftungsbeschrankt"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
