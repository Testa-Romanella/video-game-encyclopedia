Finger scrolls will spin around to move the blocks. Start at \"Shuffle\" with auto shuffle, or stir by yourself, turn round and round.  There are 9  stages in \"Blocks\". \"4 x 4\", \"5 x 5\", \"6 x 6\", each have \"only color\", \"only numbers\" and \"color and numbers\". \"Color only\" is easy. \"Numbers only\" and \"Color and number\" are the same, but \"color and number\" is easier to distinguish. By the way, \"3 x 3\" is the first time only.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:22:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe7/fe78ac54f32ecc3e07f65e84699054ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Currach Software"], "genres": ["Family", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Masuo Yoshida"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
