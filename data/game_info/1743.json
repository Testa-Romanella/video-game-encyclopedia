{"id": 1743, "slug": "massive-chalice", "name": "MASSIVE CHALICE", "name_original": "MASSIVE CHALICE", "description": "<p>Massive Chalice is a fantasy turn-based tactical game in the vein of XCOM. </p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The player assumes the role of an immortal leader in a fantasy kingdom. A dark power called Cadence repeatedly attacks the kingdom, corrupting everything it touches. There&#39;s a magic item called Massive Chalice that can purge the world of Cadence. However, the Chalice takes 300 years to recharge. The player&#39;s task is to hold on until the artifact reaches its full power. The Chalice has two souls that serve as the player&#39;s advisers.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player rules the kingdom using the world map in the Strategy mode and directly controls the units in the Tactical mode. The king himself does not appear as a unit. Instead, the player controls a group of champions with various skills and attributes. Some of the Cadence monsters that oppose the heroes have unusual attacks such as stealing the hero&#39;s XP points or aging the character.</p>\n<p>Since the player is immortal, the time is very compressed. The heroes eventually die of old age, which makes them disposable. The player has to breed new heroes and build dynasties by arranging marriages. There are three main classes of heroes: Caberjacks (heavy warriors), Hunters (ranged archers), and Alchemists (similar to wizards). Newborn heroes inherit their parents&#39; class, but if their parents are of different classes, they can learn certain skills from both. The heroes can also inherit artifacts that become stronger after being used by generations of ancestors.</p>", "metacritic": 73, "released": "2015-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T12:13:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00f/00fab9a3c5d62f286f3a269bbd2c7650.jpg", "website": "http://www.massivechalice.com", "rating": 3.12, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 102, "owned": 1287, "beaten": 31, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 76, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 56, "ratings_count": 129, "suggestions_count": 468, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 131, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Double Fine Productions"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Double Fine Productions"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
