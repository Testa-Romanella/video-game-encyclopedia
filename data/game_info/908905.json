You take the role of that scarecrow, but maybe you don't only defend the carrots from the crows. Maybe you can harvest some souls and put them to better use.<br/></p>\r\nGameplay\r\n\n<p>In the game you...</p>\n\n<p>...defend the harvest from crows by drawing barriers (hold right mouse button and drag)...</p>\n\n<p>...and from farmers by pulling out their souls (drag with left mouse button and then cut the soul).</p>\n\n<p>For every 2 souls collected, you can bring a carrot to live (click on it). </p>\n<p>There\u00a0is also\u00a0a\u00a0tutorial\u00a0explaining\u00a0the controls.</p>\n\r\nAudio Controls\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>I didn't manage to implement a menu for audio controls.

The graphics are made by myself and the sounds are created with Bfxr. Sadly I had no time  to make any music.
