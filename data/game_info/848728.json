It's a detective/murder mystery-type game where you are a detective tasked with solving a murder case. The theme for the game jam was a bowler hat, so me and my friend decided to make all of the characters in the game into living hats. Each character was supposed to have a specific personality which was reflected by what type of hat they were wearing. There were also extra points to be had if your game could include an artichoke in some way.</p>\n<p>The game jam lasted for 5 days and while I managed to implement a lot of different systems, the gameplay had a lot to be desired. Even so; this short demo still has lots of charm to give!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>W, A, S, D - Walk</li><li>E - Interact/talk<br/>\n</li><li>F - Accuse while interacting with something/confirm shot while accusing</li><li>ESC - Exit game</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T23:55:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73f/73ff0658ffc5af35ad51db4955a1ee62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lobsternator", "cursedprick"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
