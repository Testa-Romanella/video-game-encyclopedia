Infinitely complex.\r\n<p>Our teams' entry into this round of Ludum Dare's game jam is called <strong>Active Cell</strong>, a sci-fi-inspired puzzle game. The players goal is to solve increasingly complex levels by commanding a specific amount of moves, which are looped by the game. The game has a steep learning curve and later levels might require some trial and error to solve due to the number of iterations that would have to be computed by the player. However, the maximum amount of moves that need to be selected in a single level is seven, keeping the game accessible to the player.</p>\n\n<p>Featuring 16 challenging levels with self-made graphics and sound, unique music on each level and a drive-by tutorial leading players through the game, we have poured all our creativity and most of our time into this project and are very proud and pleased of the outcome. \u00a0</p>\r\nThank you for playing!\r\n\r\n@der-finski (Coding)  \r\n@jonas-michael (Coding and UI)  \r\n@hanna-knop (Art and Animations)  \r\n@odyze (Coding and UI)  \r\n@c42 (Level Design, Music and Sound)  \r\n@MelonFace (QA and Sound) \r\n<p>Are you stuck?
