The principle is, that the player with heavy artillery has the support of at least one player with lighter artillery. During the heavy artillery overcharging it is appropriate to be protected by another player, whose gun takes shorter to be overcharged.<strong>The Game and its balance</strong>The players can use the weapons which differs by power. The balance is made by length of artillery overcharging.  It means,  if the player, who has heavy artillery, fired, has to wait for overcharging longer than the player with light artillery . More powerful weapon requires bigger accuracy of player and his/her manoeuvrability. By this it is ensured that the player with weak artillery has possibility to defeat the player with strong artillery.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5f/d5f638a1008f0c5fc52fb5b45050d067.jpg", "website": "http://rendersystem-games.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 21, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 14, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 574, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Render System"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Render System"], "esrb_rating": null}
