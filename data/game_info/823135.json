Your goal is to, with the help of the magical dice left behind by your family, escape from the dungeon and reunite with your loved ones! Use your dice to beat the enemies in the rooms ahead of you, and collect items that you can use to increase your chances of winning! But be careful, if you were to lose an encounter, you will lose that dice roll, and won\u2019t be able to use those dice again! Can you make it out of the dungeon? Can you survive, and live to tell the tale?</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/></p><p>The mouse is used for everything in the game! Click to select dice, navigate menus, and use consumables!</p><p><strong>GOALS</strong><br/></p><p>Your goal is to get to the end of the dungeon, and try to get the highest score possible! You can roll your dice and the more dice you have at the end of the game, the higher your score will be!</p><p><strong>HOW TO WIN</strong><br/></p><p>Select your dice and roll them to roll higher than the number the enemy is saying! If your total roll along with any modifiers is higher than the enemy's number, then you move on to the next room! If you roll lower than\u00a0 the enemy's number, however, you lose those dice forever! You will not be able to regain those dice unless you have a powerup that prevents you from losing those dice! In addition, while it might seem useful to use every single dice you have, be warned!<strong> The more dice you use, the less sides the next die you earn will have!</strong></p>\n<p>Post your high score in the comments below, and see who can reach the end of the dungeon!!</p>\n<p>Update 1.1 - We have adjusted some minor bug fixes and changed one of the enemies! The Umbrella now restricts you to rolling only 7 dice!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T21:03:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bd/6bd09cbbc233703947da8fc7915a5e79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MusiCalyT", "SorcerousOrigins", "Warotar", "vInvent", "Familiarflower"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
