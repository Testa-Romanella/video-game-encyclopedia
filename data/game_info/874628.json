When you have enough mana, you can summon characters to the battlefield.\u00a0Click on a character's button to summon them, then click on the courtyard on the lower half of the battlefield to place your summoned character.\u00a0The character will move towards enemies or the enemy's towers and attempt to destroy them. Destroying the center tower immediately ends the game. You can also win by destroying any of your enemy's towers when the game enters the \"<em>sudden death overtime</em>\" phase, which occurs\u00a0after 90 seconds of regular play.</p>\n<p>Good Luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T06:47:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9fd/9fd5abbe3a451d456be7c713b51af9b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Game-U"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
