The only thing that calms the dragon is food. Luckily your village has a cannon designed to shoot balls made of vegetables, fruit, and meat.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Theme: <strong>Tame a Dragon</strong></p>\n\n<p>Feeding the dragon fills the tame bar. The temper of the dragon affects how much the multiplicator increases with each successful shot. Hitting the dragon or missing entirely resets the multiplicator to 1. When the angry bar is full the game is over and the dragon destroys your village! The dragon gets hungrier over time so time is of the essence. Now go and try to save your village from the inevitable demise.<br/></p>\n\n\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<ul><li>Mouse Only</li><li>Drag with your mouse, aim, and release</li></ul>\n\n\n\r\nFOOD BALLS\r\n<ul><li>Vegetables = 1 Point</li><li>Fruit = 2 Points</li><li>Meat = 5 Points</li></ul>\n\n\r\nSOURCE\r\n<ul><li>The game was made with Godot 3.1</li><li>Source project available in the download section</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-31T05:21:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ff/4ff39f2cfedc1067f194c162cacabd90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Solo Byte Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
