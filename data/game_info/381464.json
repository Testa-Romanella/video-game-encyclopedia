Isn\u2019t it the basic knowledge? \u2013 the narrator</p>\n<p>For more : LONG PRESS 'E' to use ability, TAB to select ability, SHIFT to skip the dialog</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a procedural-generated platform-falling walking-simulating gamble game. Fine, let\u2019s call it randomly walk.</p>\n<p>I called it \u2018My Dear White Garden\u2019 because the reference \u201cMy Deat Esther\u201d. However, the narrative part become so limited that I can no longer be regarded as a narrative game. I find it fun when you handle with all the random elements. So let\u2019s just emphasize the randomness.</p>\n<p>You\u2019re falling in the beginning. And the you land on the platform. And then you\u2019ll find your task is to go down to find a next platform. And then next and next and next. Yes, life is hard \u2026 But in the meanwhile, you can learn different skills to enhance your ability. For example, you can learn a DESTORY spell to kill the floating cubes. Or you can learn a flash spell to transport yourself onto the top of a cube. And there is no mana system, Yeah~~~\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, the spells are so powerful that they break the balance of this world. You\u2019ll experience some randomly happened event(punishment) as you cast spells. So you\u2019ll use some randomly-learned spells to run over the randomly-generated level get some random awards and face some random events. I should name the game \u2018Start form nothing and random everything\u2019. Hahahaha\u2026.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T06:17:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4da/4daa4487730d861f262ff140ed3c50de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Atwood Deng"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
