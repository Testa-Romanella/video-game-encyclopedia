The theme of the jam is \"Then the night changed everything\". My game is set in a building at a carnival where the clown who stole your money runs his puppet shows. There are currently 3 levels. Try to get back as much money as you can.</p>\n<p>Note: you cannot currently get hurt by anything in the game, this will change. I'm looking for feedback on how the game plays, especially the timing of events.</p>\n<p>Left/Right arrows to move. Z to fire your slingshot.</p>\n<p>A lot of the artwork is placeholder and it should be obvious which of it is more finished. My artistic ability is a bit lacking, but I'm trying my best.</p>\n<p>Only available for Windows right now but it will have a Mac version as well.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T10:14:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0b/e0ba15da538882ba406d9c991b7aa980.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["srcleaves"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
