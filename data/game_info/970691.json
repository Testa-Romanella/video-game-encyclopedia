While attempting to seek help for both his addiction and mental health, Theodore has found himself in the hands of a rather questionable individual. Dr. Blazier from ECCO (The Electro-Convulsive and Cognitive Therapy Organization) promises Theodore that everything will be routine when in fact something more sinister appears to transpire. Quickly after, Theo realizes that the situation is not in his favor as he has to learn how to deal with some entities that do not appear to be the most friendly in nature. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Fast reflexes, attention to detail, and a steady hand may help Theodore escape this new dilemma. What is this new environment he finds himself in? Why is he trapped here with no way out? Who are these other entities that seem to want to keep him here? Can Theodore survive long enough to escape this dark situation that he now finds himself stuck in?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Smile is a first person horror game that utilizes time management and fear of the unknown, along with semi-difficult gameplay, in order to create a truly haunting experience. A deeper story that is open to interpretation leaves the player wondering why we are truly here and if there is really any way to escape.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T18:44:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a0/7a05395f7b7796ec1d1fc57d299ece5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ecco Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ecco Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
