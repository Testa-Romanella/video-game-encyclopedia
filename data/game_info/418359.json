We plan on restructuring the entire game from the ground up sometime in the future, but probably not any time soon. The purpose for uploading this demo is to show what I've been working on. Comments are welcomed and appreciated, but any bugs found during a play session don't need to be reported because this version of the project isn't being pursued farther.<br/></p>\n<p>THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO TRIES THE DEMO!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T04:33:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/773/773ddebb67ab14665864b1c2b0934a5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SoulSair"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
