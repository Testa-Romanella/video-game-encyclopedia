A day later, Snow accidentally lets her daughter get eaten by a shark. Shady seems mad so he chases it down in the water and realizes all the sharks in the water are actually robotic. So he then tears all of them apart to find his daughter, Sarah Alice, hidden away unharmed. They all want to know who sent out the robotic sharks so they travel in the sky and follow distant sharks that Shady didn't get to. So, this is where the story rests for now until you play the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T18:38:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1f/b1ff24c8e6b71cda31d86ffbdd1dfeaf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HyperAlice"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
