Your mission is to descend to the ocean floor and confront the colossal goldfish, The Nugget Nibbler. To get its attention, you must first fight and eliminate an army of crabs in the surrounding areas. These crabs, along with other sea creatures, will act as obstacles and enemies throughout the game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou will navigate through three combat arenas, each with its own unique challenges and environments. As you progress and clear each arena, you will unlock a new weapon that will aid you in your battles against the crabs and other sea creatures. These weapons could include underwater firearms, explosives, or specialized gear designed to tackle underwater combat.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOnce you have successfully cleared all three arenas, you will have summoned The Nugget Nibbler, the formidable boss of the game. The final battle will be a fight to the death between you and the giant goldfish. It will test your skills, reflexes, and strategy as you try to overcome the powerful boss and emerge victorious.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThroughout the game, you will experience a blend of elements from the wild west, adding a unique twist to the underwater FPS genre.
