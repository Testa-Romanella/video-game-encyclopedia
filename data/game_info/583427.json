Game is kinda hard, and missing some features!

Just run away as soon as possible!<br/></p>\n\n<strong>I'm stuck between 2 enemies and can't get out!</strong>\n<p>If you get stuck without a sword, unfortunately the only way out is death (sorry!). Hit spacebar repeatedly to 'wait' until enemies kill you.</p>\n\n<strong>I keep getting lost!</strong>\n<p>I'm sorry there's no minimap! I've made a little guide map if needed:</p>\n\n\n<strong>I keep dying to the big dangerous guy!</strong>\n<p>If you haven't gotten the 'dodge' and 'forgiveness' powers, definitely don't take this fight on. If you have, see below.</p>\n\n<strong>What's \"one thing left to do\"? What do I do after I get all my powers?</strong>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Go fight the big one! I know you can do it!!!</p>\n\n<strong>Combat is just too difficult.</strong>\n<p>If combat's too hard and you still want to go through the game, enable debug mode by hitting TILDE (`) eleven times. You'll hear a small noise.</p>\n<p>After that, when in combat, rapidly left click (or press X) while holding TILDE (`) to 'never miss' your attacks basically.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T23:00:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8bf/8bfb34e818e210bd0f71d06a3e09ea34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hydezeke"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
