You will unlock new items (skins for the ball, line and much more!) while completing new levels and getting all the coins!\u00a0</p>\n<p>You'll have to do your physics calculations before you complete it because here you can't use you physics calculator.</p>\n<p>Will you make it to the last level? Only a few are able to do it! Try to beat every single player and be the best physic drawer alive! If Einstein or Newton were still alive they would be able to pass this game with honors.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you're openminded and like logic puzles, such as MINGZE, rubik's cubes or just good at arcade physics based games you should give it a try.</p>\n<p>In this indie brain teaser game, you'll have to brain it on! Just as if you were drinking a glass of water and had to guide the water to your mouth! There are a lot of ways to do it and get all the stars as possible!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T05:58:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f02/f02e9307b5d330bc33086943fed5ff46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["High Level Indie"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
