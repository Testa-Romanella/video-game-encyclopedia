Blast your way through 13 challenging levels while collecting space donuts and keeping an eye on your weapon's charge. Gradually increase the size and stats of your ship as you progress through the game. Play for a high score in the endless post-game survival mode. The controls may be simple, but how long can you survive? This is the first game I've ever actually finished and released so I am quite happy with the results even if it's not exactly genre-redefining.<br/></p><p><strong>Controls</strong></p><ul><li>Move mouse to aim</li><li>Left click to move</li><li>Right click to shoot</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e36/e3616ae88b1d7b3d47f7b827c37e52c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Curtamyth"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
