This requirement may be lifted in the future updates.</li><li>At the time there are no Mac/Linux versions but the game should run well enough via Wine/Crossover.</li><li>This is a free user-created mod that <strong>is not affiliated</strong> with Vlambeer.<br/>Donations (if any) go towards producing more multiplayer games and experiments.</li><li>Given that this mod is rather experimental, you may encounter bugs or problems. Do tell if something breaks.</li></ul><p>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:26:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9eb/9ebdbf127b4b3c5d8e4e9bb714316de2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["YellowAfterlife"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
