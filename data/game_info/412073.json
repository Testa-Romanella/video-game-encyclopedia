THING???) that lives in a world with others like them. They all have hats and ties but one day the evil Blink steals the world's hats and ties, but he forgets a certain blocky boi's hat... yours. Now it is up to you to defeat Blink and take back all the hats and ties!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There are many enemies, but can you defeat them without directly hurting them? Slink is after all a pacifist!</p>\n\n\n<p>This game is also available on hacked Nintendo Switches if you have atmosphere installed. Check my github repo of the source code to see how to play it.
