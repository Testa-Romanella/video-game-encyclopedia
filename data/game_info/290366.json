You will need to find items to unlock doors and run or hide from the masked killer searching for you.</p>\n\n\n<br/><br/>\n<p>This is the first game I've ever released to the public. I made the game for a university project and thought it would be cool to upload it online for others to try out. The game is not perfect and there are a few bugs I plan to fix (mainly some camera issues) Please let me know what you think of the game, I appreciate all feedback.</p>\n<p>If you would like to contact me, you can message me on twitter.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-04T03:21:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e84/e8436f637d0a871b5a19badb6f09819a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dizlen"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
