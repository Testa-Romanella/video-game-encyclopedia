As a kid, I used to play at my grandparents farm. There were a lot of farm animals including a bunch of sheeps. After my grandparents passed away the sheeps still remained on the meadow. Somehow they were forgotten until a few weeks later in the summer. I remember seeing a bunch of sheeps on a hot summer day gathered in the shadow of a nearby broken shack. I don't know, what became of them. I guess mutton chops is a possibility. Whatever. This game is dedicated to the poor sheep. And to poetry.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/471/4719851c5e7fd831a7c57212f4209bc2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Torsten Hartmann"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
