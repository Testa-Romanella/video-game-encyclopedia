However, not everyone has the resources or confidence to make something that reflects what they want.</p>\n<p>How can we fix this?</p>\r\nTHE SOLUTION\r\n<p>Enter Make Faces, an app for your Android smartphone.</p>\n\n<p>Using the app, the user can customise a portrait that is unique to them with a variety of skin tones, eyes, hair, noses, accessories, and other options. When the user is happy with their creation, they can save the picture and use it on social media as they please!</p>\r\nOUR PROGRESS\r\n<p>Make Faces is currently in development, and the build you can download here is a very early alpha build- there are definitely a few bugs!\u00a0Many features and assets are missing, but the basic functionality of the app is working.\u00a0</p>\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p>Cole Williams - Art, Design</p>\n<p>Emily Latta - Production, Design</p>\n<p>Rhys Boer - Programming</p>\n<p>Cassandra Gray - Marketing &amp; Social Media</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T12:53:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6f/c6f644dfa204b7a24af47663bb46120e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["EmilyGameDev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
