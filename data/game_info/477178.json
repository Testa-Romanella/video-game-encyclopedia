{"id": 477178, "slug": "hi-q-einstein", "name": "Hi-Q Einstein", "name_original": "Hi-Q Einstein", "description": "<p>Hi-Q Einstein is a classic peg solitaire game that sees you moving pegs around to get from one colour layout to another in as few moves as possible.<br/></p>\n<p>I was introduced to this game at the age of 7, when my dad brought it home from a business trip. I loved it, however it was lost when our basement flooded. Over the years, I would search the internet for information or a copy of the game but to no avail. Finally in June 2008 I was able to track down one copy (thanks mom!) and purchased it immediately. Since it was becoming clear that this game was on its way to obscurity, I decided to revive it and bring it to the internet via Flash and Newgrounds.com.\u00a0\u00a0Now, because Flash is on its way out, I've made it available\u00a0here for you for PC.</p>\n<p>I HIGHLY advise that you read the instructions before playing for the first time to get max enjoyment from this title. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!</p>\r\nReturn to the Arcade!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T06:27:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f3/9f31b8cda8ed4d95ab3dcee2851be036.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Holmade Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
