He has access to a machete, pistol and bombs! Icarus is a human, getting hit would kill him. However he wears armor which slows him down and takes a hit for him.</p>\n<p><strong>Special edition:</strong></p>\n<p>A local multiplayer system, to play with friends online you'll need some third party software. But if you have extra gamepads around and some buds you can play together.<br/></p>\n<p>Hard mode. The original was a bit easy so I decided to make a hard mode, it makes you restart the whole thing if you die.</p>\n\n<p>I hope you have fun! <em>Also yes, I am scared a bit since it's my first upload.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T15:56:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/953/9539ebb204d94a82a4232e7348e53e3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DaveLemon"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
