After the first three levels, all of the puzzles are generated on the spot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I have other larger projects on the way, but I figured that this is worth sharing, especially because you can check out how the random generation works yourself at the\u00a0linked below.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Arrow Keys/WASD: Move\r\n</li><li>Spacebar or X: Select menu options\r\n</li><li>Z: Undo\r\n</li><li>R: Reset</li></ul>\n<p>Source Code:</p>\n<p>https://www.puzzlescript.net/editor.html?hack=55ccceea0d1654f0cffc016d2d28ff83</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T13:21:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46c/46c32f8513675d2369ba2a0076211f49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Neonesque"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
