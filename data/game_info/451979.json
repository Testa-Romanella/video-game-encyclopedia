Also use the \"Start\" and \"A\" buttons.</p>\n<p>- Hold the Y\u00a0Button in certain menus to see addition helpful information.</p>\n<p>Gameplay:</p>\n<p>- Left Joystick controls how the tank moves.</p>\n<p>- Right Joystick controls your tanks gun (Where it's aiming)</p>\n<p>- Right Trigger Fires your Primary shot</p>\n<p>- \"A\" Button allows the tank to jump, hold this down to jump higher</p>\n<p>- Landing after a jump gives the player a speed boost, *Unless the player lets go of the left joystick while in the air</p>\n<p>- Each tank has a health bar, can be seen above tank</p>\n<p>- Each tank has a reload bar that displays the number of shots in your clip along with how long till the next shot is reloaded</p>\n<p>- Shooting before a shot is reloaded results in lost reload progress</p>\n<p>- Shooting right after your clip becomes full results in a faster shot.</p>\n<p>- All shots give the shooting tank and the shot tank a force depending on that projectiles stats and the velocity of your tank.</p>\n<p>- Acceleration and Max Speed are independent values, (A tank could have poor acceleration but have a very high max speed. Players that are able to maintain their momentum will be better able to take advantage of this stat.)</p>\n<p>- Black bullets go through white bullets\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Bullets of the same color destroy each other when they collide.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-\u00a0PS.
