While life events delayed us from sharing it sooner, we had a blast and were thrilled to have made something together despite having\u00a0very little experience overall! (Also, the idea of making\u00a0a fan-game before the actual game was\u00a0technically even released really tickled us).</p>\n<p>We held this fan-made jam both for fun, and as a love letter to the devs at Klei for their diligent, passionate work and the journey of bringing\u00a0the world of Havaria to life.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now that\u00a0<em>Griftlands</em> itself has released fully June 2021, we thought it would be the perfect time to share and celebrate!</p>\n<p>Please feel free to check out the actual game of <em>Griftlands</em> which inspired us, and send some love Klei's way!<br/>Griftlands Website |\u00a0Griftlands on Steam</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T04:10:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37e/37e005a7fc027cea5223c51d02bead00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fymir", "Tasch"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
