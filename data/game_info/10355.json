{"id": 10355, "slug": "fractured-space", "name": "Fractured Space", "name_original": "Fractured Space", "description": "<p>This space opera game lets its players assume positions of starship commanders in a distant future, and fight each other as multiplayer teams. Its setting is reminiscent of EVE Online, however, the gameplay has more in common with DOTA or World of Tanks. You are in full control of your ship, which is an enormous, multi-kilometer battlecruiser. However, you are also a part of a larger Starfleet, so you have to complete the mission objectives to win. Each battle is fought on a map that features the player&#39;s and enemies&#39; bases on the opposite edges, as well as Forward Bases and Gamma Sector in between. Battleships are able to jump between the sectors of a map using hyperspace tunnels.</p>\n<p>Between the battles, you can purchase and upgrade new spaceships. The game is free-to-play, so the resources can be either earned in the game itself or with microtransactions. Every ship has virtual crew members that you can hire and take five of them with you to the battle. Depending on their specialization, be it Engineering, Navigation, Repair, or something else, they provide your ship with specific bonuses. They will also advise you and overall act as if they were real people.</p>", "metacritic": 79, "released": "2016-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:50:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/e10/e10258b8e132c269dd2b0faeba0d8057.jpg", "website": "http://www.fracturedspace.com", "rating": 2.4, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 190, "owned": 2533, "beaten": 10, "toplay": 14, "dropped": 83}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 34, "ratings_count": 151, "suggestions_count": 463, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 151, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Edge Case Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Edge Case Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
