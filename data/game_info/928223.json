It's the first demo I made and I made it many months back so a lot of feedback I know people will notice I likely already fixed. But if people have questions on the narrative or find other bugs people missed out on, I'm more than likely here to help. A lot of this may be outdated, including any potential issues but I thought I may as well make it semi-public now while I still work on the game.</p>\n<p>Yes it took me many months to bite the bullet and upload this on\u00a0Itch.\u00a0I sent this out to friends who ended up showing most of the issues to me and I fixed them, which are listed below.</p>\n<p>Dimensional Crossroads Zero is a turn based Modern-Fantasy RPG about the story of a young boy whose fate changes when he finds an ancient amulet, leading him into a decade of mystery and pain.</p>\n<p>Run time would be about 30 minutes to an hour or two depending how things go.</p>\n<p>Bugs/errors noticed in this demo that was fixed:\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Main character slot Xos isn't locked in place, creating odd issues with cutscenes if the player rearranges the party. FIXED.</p>\n<p>- Typos and misspellings, especially at the beginning. FIXED.</p>\n<p>- Gamebreaking softlock where if the player pursues a Pig before encountering the wolf in the dungeon. Didn't take into account of people pursuing the pig first so post-demo I made a second variable of if the player goes after it first before encountering the wolf. FIXED.</p>\n<p>- Issue where the final boss in the demo can silence the entire party and due to no one having a Silence removal.</p>\n<p>- Final demo bosses name may or may not be changed?\u00a0Some people don't mind it and others find it too goofy. I am still unsure here.</p>\n<p>- Possibly shorten the intro? It's a bit hard to think of what to cut out without 100% entirely redoing the whole intro.</p>\n<p>- A lot of stuff is currently placeholders. I do intend to get some better spritework and even commission or draw some faces or sprites.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Usual balancing issues with enemies and party members.\u00a0This is a bit ongoing and wouldn't mind hearing more peoples thoughts here.\u00a0Some enemies shown here are getting reworked and others I wouldn't mind hearing about.</p>\n<p>Also due to the plugins I use, resending this can be a bit finicky. If there's any issues with this, tell me.</p>\n<p>Also I\u00a0may end up dropping more demos/prototypes of progression of the game here if people really want me to. I am a bit nervous of opening up to the public like this but I will give it a go.</p>\n<p>I may have forgotten to credit some stuff but if you find something missing that is currently in use that isn't credited, tell me. I want to fix that ASAP for future references.</p>\n<p>Maybe if people want me to, I won't wait like almost a year to open this demo up in the public while I work on the game.\u00a0Next demo I could make it public to friends and the general audience here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T21:13:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cb/4cb1e93e47c0429d268276cc7e5599fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bern"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
