I'm a beginner at this so I wanted to make a little game in an hour just for some practice. This game kinda went over time with me finishing it in about two and half hours. There were some things I learned while making this game like how to use events and do some follow mouse movement. One thing that definitely made the game go overtime is the Googling I had to do, I guess it's just one thing that comes with experience.\u00a0\u00a0I do want to make some fixes to the game and the code but I feel like it'll be better just to have this as a kind of milestone to judge future projects on, maybe I'll comeback to it and make it well an fully fledged game for nostalgia. For now I my current goal is make a game at this level in an hour. Thank you guys for reading\u00a0(If anyone finds this)!\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T04:29:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af1/af16a9b6654d67f492649612db722060.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Xtop175"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
