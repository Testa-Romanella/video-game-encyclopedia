The main theme of this game is to retrieve all the colors token by the monsters and make the black and white world back to a colorful one. Like other RPGs, players in Retrieve can also enjoy the process of saving the world gradually after defeating each Boss. The beautiful world with color can also attract players to retrieve more colors and enjoy the retrieving process.<br/>Currently, we have made four levels for this game. There are still tons of items and monsters we will add to the big map, and the game must have more fun with them. I hope you enjoy playing the early version of Retrieve.</p>\n<p>Keyboard Controls (Recommended):<br/>A/D or \u2190/\u2192 = control the movement<br/>W/S or \u2191/\u2193 = Climb on the ladder<br/>Space = Jump<br/>Left Click = Attack<br/>Movement + Right Click = Dash<br/>F11 = Refresh the character<br/>F12 = Invincible Mode<br/>Controller Controls (Still need mouse to click buttons):<br/>Left Stick = control the movement and climb on the ladder<br/>A = Jump<br/>X = Attack<br/>Left Stick + LB/RB = Dash<br/>F11 = Refresh the character<br/>F12 = Invincible Mode</p>\n<p>Team Members:<br/>Designer: Pan Yiheng<br/>Programmers: Pan Yiheng, Zhao Lei<br/>Artists: Wu Xiaohui, Yang Xiaotu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T13:59:34", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MCATIN"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
