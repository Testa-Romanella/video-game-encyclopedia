All\u00a0</p>\n<p>files starting with \"sdl_*\" refer to the platform\u00a0</p>\n<p>layer written in SDL 2.0 and contain code that needs\u00a0</p>\n<p>to be rewritten for the other platforms. All files\u00a0</p>\n<p>starting with \"game_*\" contain platform-independent\u00a0</p>\n<p>code that must not be modified during porting.</p>\n<p>The \"algs.cpp\" file and \"mmath.cpp\" contain extremely\u00a0</p>\n<p>specific code, and if the \"mmath.cpp\" is just slow and\u00a0</p>\n<p>there is a better alternative (the standard library,\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"std::sin\" function is faster then \"Sin\", I checked),\u00a0</p>\n<p>then the \"algs.cpp\" file contains code that depends\u00a0</p>\n<p>on the processor architecture (SSE/AVX) and compiler\u00a0</p>\n<p>intrinsics. I left it only because it is a valuable\u00a0</p>\n<p>experience. The \"debug.cpp\" file contains trash code\u00a0</p>\n<p>for debugging, just ignore it.</p>\n<p>Also, it's worth mentioning that the entire codebase\u00a0</p>\n<p>has been reviewed by a C++ person, github.com/saiel,\u00a0</p>\n<p>thanks to him for the advice. Ask if you have any\u00a0</p>\n<p>questions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T10:33:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/876/8760a9b89473e308145f7f674270cdb4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Anna Dostoevskaya"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
