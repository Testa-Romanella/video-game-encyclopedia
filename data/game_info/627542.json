Keep the SPACEBUS running and deliver as many passengers as you can to their destination!<br/><br/><strong>HEAD MECHANIC</strong><br/><br/>As the Head Mechanic (and also the only mechanic) aboard the SPACEBUS, it's your duty to keep everything in tip-top shape.<br/><br/><ul><li>Maintain Machines to keep them running properly.<br/></li><li>Repair Machines that have broken down by finding the proper tools.<br/></li><li>Too busy to repair something properly? Throw some tape on it and come back to it. It should hold just fine.<br/></li><li>Things really starting to go sideways? You can always jettison a few passengers to lighten the load.</li></ul><br/><strong>THE SPACE METRO SYSTEM</strong><br/><br/>The Space Metro System is one of the oldest and cheapest transit systems in the galaxy.
