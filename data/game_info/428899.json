Lead the nation to prosperity \u2013 or witness its downfall!<h3>IT DOESN\u2019T IMITATE, IT IS.</h3> Some political simulation games approach politics as if it was a Shakespearean play. Yes, politics is often entertaining, but it doesn\u2019t follow a scripture. Therefore, in Mobocratic, we don\u2019t just play you the play, we bring you in the middle of everything. Everything is simulated! Relations \u2013 check, jobs \u2013 check, bank transactions \u2013 check, court\u2019s cases and convictions \u2013 check, political opinions \u2013 of course and much, much more. There\u2019s nothing like being a Mobocrat!<h3>BE A MOBOCRAT.</h3> As the Mobocrat (or as somebody could say, the President) you don\u2019t only try to pass your proposals to apply new policies and build new buildings; you also nominate the justices to the supreme court, meet new people, make deals with businessmen, hire criminals and send them to do your bidding, spy peoples\u2019 bank accounts and criminal records and\u2026 even that\u2019s not everything. You wanna try? Then, be a Mobocrat!<h3>MOD EVERYTHING. *almost:</h3> Mobocratic is the only political simulation game that allows player to mod their games with large scale. So you can make this game to be almost anything you want. Isn\u2019t that exciting?<h3>GUARANTEED UPDATES.</h3> We guarantee our players a continually improving experience. You buy the game today and like it. In some months, the experience will be even better! We are committed to creating value to our players and want to create a game that we ourselves would like to play. This is why we guarantee continuous updates for at least one year!<h3>A FINNISH INNOVATION.</h3> The Finnish people are known for not trying to talk up themselves. We\u2019re not an exception. We don\u2019t want to boast and exaggerate our accomplishments. Despite this, we have to say we\u2019ve made it this time. Mobocratic is a game the likes of which you\u2019ve never seen before. Mobocratic has been in the works for two years. We were about to give up. But we didn\u2019t. With the Finnish SISU we carried it through and made the masterpiece Mobocratic is. This is good. Not good, GREAT! A revolutionary game for the new generation!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T06:48:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/378/378e1df6247ca3844b0d130bd276b9c2.jpg", "website": "http://www.proqet.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Proqet Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Proqet Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
