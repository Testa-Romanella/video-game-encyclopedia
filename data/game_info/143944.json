It is mainly text based but there are a few minigame type puzzles and reactionary scenes that serve to heighten the mood.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tUnfortunately I didn't get to finish the game. At All. I only managed to work on it the last few days and only for a few hours so it was nowhere near what I wanted, even the current 'Acts' are not fully realized but hopefully I'll find some time to continue working on it. </p><p><strong>Tip: You know it is the end when it hits the credits, it does not get stuck in a loop in a certain scene, it's made to make you think ;)</strong></p><p>Please leave a rating or comment if you would like to see more, any support would be greatly appreciated.<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tPlease Play With The Sound ON, otherwise you'll miss out on some amazing music by Kevin MacLeod.
