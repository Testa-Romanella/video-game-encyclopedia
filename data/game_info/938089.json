But don't let appearances fool you! In this small town, a determined little boy sets out to sneak into all the houses and steal valuable items.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour mission is to achieve the goals without getting caught by the vigilant homeowners. Be careful and avoid any suspicious behavior that could attract attention. You need to make sure the owners are busy or asleep before you start searching the houses.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBut this game is not just about stealing objects. There are also a series of hidden boxes that contain fascinating superpowers. You can become invisible, jump twice in a single move, or even teleport. But again, be careful of the homeowners - if they catch you while he's trying to teleport, they might give him a strange look!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUltimately, your goal is to be as fast and discreet as possible while collecting valuable items and additional powers. Each house has its own challenges and obstacles, so make sure you're ready for anything. Are you ready to join the adventurous little boy in the game of your life?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHave fun with Oli One!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T06:14:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/594/5941beb36a8e173c6e9e617968960187.jpg", "website": "http://anarogames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 203, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arghirescu Constantin"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Arghirescu Constantin"], "esrb_rating": null}
