For the latter, we developed a symbol based language which the player can attempt to learn in order to \"speak\".</p>\n<p>In its current form there is a limited number of possible symbols to learn, as we are still in early prototyping stages, and more than anything we want to see how you like this mechanic. You will notice there is a language wheel in game (hold \"Tab\" to open) with many empty slots waiting to be filled.</p>\n<p>Once we have the opportunity to expand on the language mechanics you will be able to play around with a more complex system of symbols.\u00a0 The goal is to create a system in which the players can string various symbols together to create phrases, and give the npcs an ability to react accordingly to what is being said.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T04:32:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a1/0a17eabff406c4d29abcc9ebd9a25511.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eyot_Zex"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
