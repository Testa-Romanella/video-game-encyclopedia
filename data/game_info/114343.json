You are a ghost that has an instant camera in his head and you have to snap everyone else before they snap you!</p>\n<p>The catch? Everything is dark and you can only see when you flash your camera. The flash has a cooldown time so be sure to time those photos right!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Are you lost and want to check your position in the map without spending a precious flash? You can taunt! A small silhouette will be shown around your character and reveal your position...everyone else will see it too...and you'll hear a funny sound as a bonus!</p>\n<p>This was a game done for the Invictus Game Jam (https://invictvsgamejam.fabamaq.com/) and it got us the first place! :D\u00a0</p>\n<p>2nd place game:\u00a0Davy Jones' Locker<br/></p>\n<p>3rd place game:\u00a0Shot In the Dark</p>\n\n<p>Do you think we should keep working on it and release a proper full fledged game?</p>\n<p>Shout out from all the team!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/382/38239327555ebf5e89fa83ad979b1d76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["monteiro", "Pr0file", "jasnchz"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
