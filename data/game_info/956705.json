Help Cyat navigate Catropolis and save up to finally buy a home.</p>\n<p>The player will interact with characters that will either send them on quests, buy catnip from them, help them upgrade their home, or punish them for their illegal way of finding work. Over the course of the game, Cyat will have a multitude of opportunities to expand their service area, meaning they will gain new customers and allies, and have the chance to build themselves a place they can feel safe to call home in the scary unknowns of the new world. </p>\n\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><em>We created this game for our 2123 Writing for Games &amp;\u00a0</em><em>Interactive Media II.
