I recently saw a fake game facebook ad that took this concept and made it 3 police versus a robber and it looked like fun, but of course the game was fake so I couldn't play it without sitting through hours of garbage game content. So I decided to make my own version of it, and I've managed to work in bugs and a bunch of bug trappers in order to fit within the theme of the jam.</p>\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<p>Music and Sound Effects (made by me prior to the jam)</p>\n<p>Animated Paper Gif -\u00a0https://giphy.com/gifs/texture-textures-jef-rcFs59ww1R7yeFszmo?utm_source=media-...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T16:55:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f3/7f3cfe1b5ce3f623dc77a5dd36b445e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mightyjor"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
