With the neverending waves of colons constantly destabilizing our new eden, you are more important than ever !<br/></p>\n<p>Use the four sliders in front of you to control the power of the four different thrusters.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the middle, our rotation and vertical speeds are indicated.</p>\n<p>Be careful ! The city is a <em>litteral</em> boulder, so it is heavy and slow. <br/></p>\n<p>Avoid the lava, avoid tilting us and avoid air pockets !<br/></p>\n<p>Good luck ! A lava mojito is waiting for me in our new bar !</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTEXT:</strong></p>\n<p>Made for the Trijam 161: Pressure Rises in around 7h.</p>\n<p>This is my third submission overall so I hope you will like it !</p>\n<p>My personal highscore is 2579 !<br/></p>\n<p>The idea, gameplay and programmation are mine, using unity and bolt.</p>\n<p>The music and sprites are copyright free assets.</p>\n<p>Was sadly unable to make it work as an HTML file.
