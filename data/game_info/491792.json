This metaphysical theory which posits that the universe consists of inseparable immortal substances endowed with souls and spirits intrigued OUBEY so much that he dedicated this painting to it.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis VR takes you to the very centre of the monad universe where you\u2019re totally surrounded by the enchanting diversity of the painting\u2019s elements. And you can touch these elements too, play with them, float them, fly them and let them cavort freely through the depths of space.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T06:32:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb3/fb38de10aaf6b23c0fa2760ddd1a6aa8.jpg", "website": "https://vr.mindkiss.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kubikfoto"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Kubikfoto"], "esrb_rating": null}
