The Vikings of the north became revered as the greatest of all the worlds' warriors, a people sworn to fight until the day they died. In the midst of the chaos a two factions stood above all others, the Wolf-Manes of the East and the Stag-Horns of West. In the year 1036 AD the two mighty clans clashed each led by a Viking warlord. The Viking warlords Balgruuf of the Stag-Horns and Olaf of the Wolf-Manes meet in battle. Their skills were so evenly matched at the end of the battle neither Balgruuf nor Olaf were left standing. Upon their death they were to be given their final resting place in the kingdom of Valhalla; however, the constant warring of the land leaves little room for new entry, forcing the two Viking warlords to fight each other in one last battle as they climb the stairs of Valhalla.</p><p>Producer/Lead Designer - Christian Boyette</p><p>Lead Artist/Character Design - Jack Banta</p><p>Enviroment Artist - Matt Young</p><p>Designer- Alec Paquin</p><p>Programmer - Stephen Mangold</p><p><strong>requires 2 xbox 360 controllers.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7a/b7ae9bd3ae5841da654394a522d8df27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Stephen Mangold"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
