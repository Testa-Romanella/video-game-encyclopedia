The game is set in a dark and isolated environment. The player would have no actual contact with any other characters barring a single antagonist who is constantly pursuing the player. The player will have limited tools to make their escape and will need to rely on audio and visual cues as well as their ability to hide in the environment to avoid death. The game is designed with the intention of the player feeling like they are alone. Of course there is a single other character to interact with, but any interaction with that character is designed to end typically in death. As such the Player has no safety net to fall on, they are left entirely on their own.</p><p>The game as it is downloadable now, is in a testing stage.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/010/0104d691630f989d328cdf5cc37c702e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ryan C"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
