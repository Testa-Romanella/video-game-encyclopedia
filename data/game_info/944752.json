This revelation pushed certain individuals to work together to create a solution. It took ten years, but there was finally a solution to the world ending: find a new planet. Thus, The Flagship and its fleet were created with a purpose of pioneering a path towards humanity\u2019s survival.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Twenty years after the Evacuation, the fleet is light years away from Earth- well, what's left it anyways. Each day that passes pushes humanity toward an unknown destination.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Is there truly a planet out there that's habitable enough for humans?\r\n</p>\n<p>As things start to grow peaceful on The Flagship, there seems to be an underlying tension that floats around the high officials. Crime seems to be on the rise, there\u2019s a revolution in the making, and an unsolved mystery that has absolutely everything to do with your father and nothing to do with the discovery of a new solar system. The Sovereign seems to be losing his sanity, the Council is falling apart, and the public is one wrong sentence away from a civil war.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Surely nothing else could go wrong, right?\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>What will you do when you're tasked with exploring an unknown, possibly toxic and definitely frozen planet with a bunch of criminals against your will?\u00a0\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Romance Options:</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>\u2748 The Blue Forget-Me-Not</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>[Gino Miller | He/Him | Human | 23]</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Tall, cold, and skilled in combat, Gino is the unofficial official leader of your makeshift group. With a mysterious past and unfiltered hatred for the head scientist, he seems to know more than he lets on. He may not trust you or anyone else in your group, but that doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t protect you like his life depends on it. And maybe it does, more than he realizes.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat could possibly be built out of something already so broken?\u201d\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>\u2749 The Red Hydrangea</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>[Nicole Williams | She/Her | Human | 22]</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Mature, charming, and an incredible caretaker, Nicole takes on the role of caring for your makeshift group. With an obvious grudge against her mother and resentment of the Sovereign, she\u2019s a fierce friend (or lover) to have on your side. She cares about you and your group more than she\u2019s willing to show.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI only have half a heart to give to you and I hope that\u2019s enough.\u201d\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>\u2747 The Purple Snapdragon</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>[Daniel Lovesmith | They/Them | Human | 20]</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Intelligent, sly, and cocky, Daniel is the most knowledgeable in your makeshift group. With a long criminal record and a\u00a0 clear hatred for their parents, they appear indifferent about their reputation amongst the group. They care more about what the group thinks of them, far more than they\u2019re willing to admit.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd time goes slowly, and time can do so much, are you still mine?\u201d\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>\u274b The White Orchid</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>[Jordan Salas | He/Him | Human | 24]</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Troubled, quiet, and a weird habit of fighting, Jordan unintentionally takes on the role of protector for your makeshift group. With an obviously troubled past and pure hatred towards the Lovesmiths, he distances himself from everyone and can barely contain his hatred for one of the group members. He craves companionship far more than he\u2019s willing to say.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve hungered for your touch.\u201d\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>\u2743 The Yellow Lantana</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>[Arwan | He/They | Innae | 23]</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Fiery, weird, and skilled in hunting, Arwan is a warrior part of a tribe that comes across your makeshift group. With an easy going smile and genuine curiosity, he\u2019s not afraid to show his interest in you and your group. While they may not hide the fact that they\u2019re considered an outsider in their tribe, he does hide the fact that he wishes he belongs somewhere.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to forget someone who gave you so much to remember.\u201d\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>\u2746 The Magenta Angelonia</strong>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>[Revna | They/Them | Innae | 23]</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Sweet, patient, and uncharacteristically good at deception, Revna is a warrior part of a tribe that comes across your makeshift group. With a gentle smile and open suspicion, they\u2019re weary of your group\u2019s arrival. Kind as they may be, don\u2019t mistake it for weakness for they are a warrior for a reason.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI swear that I\u2019ll be yours forever, until forever falls apart.\u201d\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>\u2744 The Pink Allium</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>[Camryn Eldridge | She/Her | Human | 25]</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Calm, stalwart, and weirdly talented at politics, Camryn finds herself becoming the communication liaison for your makeshift group. With a quiet and reserved demeanor and calm energy, she gets along with just about anyone. Despite her calm appearance, she wants nothing more than to find people who love her just the way she is.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cThe light of my eyes, I said, light of my eyes, light of my world, that\u2019s what you are, light of my life.\u201d\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>\u274a The Orange Dahlia</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>[Sloane Attwood | She/They | Human | 21]</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Energetic, quirky, and suspiciously good at making bombs, Sloane is the designated weapons maker for your makeshift group. With a sporadic lifestyle and weirdly close relations to a certain scientist, she\u2019s not afraid of being an outcast. While she may not care about her reputation, they do care whether you or your group truly likes them for them and not just for their skills.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI want some to look at me and say \u201cIs it worth it?
