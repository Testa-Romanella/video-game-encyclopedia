Destroy asteroids, collect their materials, and return to base to gain new upgrades. Your material meter at the top will let you know how much you material you still need for an upgrade and will count how many upgrades are waiting for when you return. Be sure to keep an eye on your fuel in the lower left. If that gets used up, you will be left stranded. Your fuel will refill whenever you return to base.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As for controlling your ship, you can rotate it using the A and D keys and can apply the thrusters with the W key. The weapons can be fired with a simple click of the Right Mouse Button. If you ever need to take a brake from the mission or abandon it, ESC will bring up the Pause Menu.</p>\n<p>I wish you luck, hope you have a good time, and I am grateful for any feedback you'd be willing to share. This project will be continued to be updated beyond the Game Jam, so your suggestions can really help guide the future direction of it.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T17:27:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e8/0e8e4b98b98da2afc7be6fd08be6ad61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dale Mauldin"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
