Hide in plain sight. Leap, sneak, and dash with both speed and style. Strike hard and then fade away before your position is revealed. <br/><br/>Play locally in 1-on-1 or 2-on-2 matches across 9 varied maps with their own selectable color schemes. Build tournament playlists, or jump right into a random map for instant action. Use a shuriken to stun from long range. Build the best strategy for each map's unique features. Show off and customize your fighting bird with fanciful hats and weapons, but remember: style comes with a cost. The bigger your hat, the easier it is for opponents to find you.<br/><br/>Duel alongside friends in a world like you've never seen before. <br/><br/>Winner of the 2015 BAFTA Ones to Watch Award, IGF Nominee for Best Student Game, Official Selection IndieCade 2015, Dare ProtoPlay finalist, and finalist in the E3 College Game Competition.
