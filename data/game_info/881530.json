Since the enemy is part machine, using an electrical grenade will easily stun the enemy for a short duration\r\n</p>\n<p>\u2022 Other smaller items to pick up would be a key to unlock the final door and escape the level, as well as small lore secrets scattered throughout the level allowing for theorists and casual gamers alike to start piecing together the deeper story within\r\n</p>\n<p>\u2022 An important part about any survival horror games is the location of hiding spaces, these are scattered throughout the levels and allow the player to hide and become immune for a short amount of time while the enemy continues to patrol the level\r\n</p>\n<p>\u2022 And the most important thing to any survival horror game is the enemy itself. The enemy will begin patrolling the level when the player awakens it upon nearing its hibernating frame. Once spotted, the enemy will chase the player until it either loses sight of the player or it catches the player, killing them instantly.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T10:51:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92a/92a5ee474a34fc6d485ef980fb4ca92f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Monster_Mash"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
