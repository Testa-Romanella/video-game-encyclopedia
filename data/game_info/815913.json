The player will only stop at walls or obstacles. Reset the time to use your past self as a steppingstone! (level 9 +) Think carefully! When using the clock to reset the time, your past self will move the same way you moved before. Stuck? Restart the level. Find smart ways to work around doors or tiles blocked only for the player or its past selves.</p>\n<p>------------------------------------------ CONTROLS\u00a0------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Use the arrow keys to move. Jump back in time by clicking the clock. I really recommend to not skip levels since new mechanics will be introduced slowly!<br/></p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>This game was created\u00a0in\u00a0Scratch\u00a0and I created a PC port of it using the features of\u00a0Turbowarp Packager.
