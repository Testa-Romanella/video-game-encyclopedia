Honestly it has been missing for about a week now and he starting to get really upset. I saw him crying in the break room, it's pretty bad.</strong><h3>FEATURES:</h3><ul><li><h3>Play Together</h3>Get together with up to 3 of your friends and cosy up on the couch for hilarious crime solving adventures. Each of you will take control of one of Detective Bot's limbs and together you will have to use your brains to solve some challenging cases.<br/><br/></li><li><h3>Unique Physics Gameplay</h3>Detective Bot is controlled by moving his limbs individually which if you think about it is actually the most realistic way to control a character that has ever been done in a videogame. Bold of us to push gaming into the future you say. Why yes it is! On your adventures you will encounter all kinds of contraptions and objects for Detective Bot to play with which will result in silly and fun physics interactions that you won't be able to get enough of.<br/><br/></li><li><h3>Become a Detective</h3>This game isn't just about silly physics it's also about Detective stuff too. You will have to solve some really tough mysteries but don't worry you have a bunch of tools at your disposal, you can question witness, look around for clues and build up a case against the bad guys using your detective board.<br/><br/></li><li><h3>Wear a Hat</h3>Yes!
