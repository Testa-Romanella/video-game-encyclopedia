(Or Pico 8 in this Case!)</p>\n<p>This Shmup was created as part of the\u00a0Basic Shmup Showcase. In June I started the Lazy Devs' Basic Shmup tutorial as a way to battle my mental health issues and to have something to do while I was on leave from my job. Finding this tutorial has totally transformed my life for the better.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Between the mental health challenges and the fact this is the first time I'm \"really\" programming in my life. (HTML in the 90s doesn't really count, does it?!)\u00a0It has been an absolute struggle to work on it as much as I've wanted but I\u00a0am happy that it came out as good as it has. It is somewhat disappointing that so many parts of Collective Mischief are very similar to the base tutorial.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Towards the end of making this game I ran out of tokens and spent most of my time trying to fix things while sitting at ~8100 tokens. Since I am such a beginner at Pico 8 and game dev in general I didn't know the best tricks to further reduce the amount of tokens being used so I\u00a0just went with it. This game is not perfect but I think it demonstrates how much of my own flavor I put into it. (Hopefully.)</p>\n<p><em>It bears noting that this is not a licensed Star Trek project and is considered a fan project only. No payments will be taken for the production/procurement of this game and will be completed for educational/portfolio purposes only.</em><br/></p>\n<p>Most of the programming and all of the art assets were created by me\u00a0(Chaz).</p>\n<p>If it wasn't for\u00a0Krystian\u00a0I would not have began my Pico 8 and game dev journey at all. Thank you to him most of all! This three month long adventure has been absolutely wild and I've learned so much. Consider me absolutely JAZZED for phase 2.
