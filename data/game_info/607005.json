The player will take control of the Samurai Chef, as he fights his way through food-based enemies in an effort to get back his famous cookbook. At the end of each level the player will collect a page form the cookbook that can be then read in the Recipe section of the home page. If the player does not manage to collect all the collectable ingredients along the way, part of the recipe will be missing. Replaying the level and collecting the missing ingredients will reveal the missing words on the recipe and the player then has the option to create the dish at home. The demo made to showcase the game was created using the Unity Engine and will focus on a Mexican food themed level.</p>\n\n<p>The Samurai Chef is known far and wide for his food and famous cookbook, and when it is stolen he must use his clumsy yet agile abilities and trusty \u201cPan-tana\u201d to run, jump and attack his way to get it back.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to get people interested in cooking while also being entertaining at the same time. By giving the player the option to create the recipes they collect throughout the game increases its longevity as well as giving the user a useful skill they can use in everyday life.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Objective:</strong></p>\n<p>Collect all the food items and the Recipe page to pass the level while avoiding or confronting enemies along the way.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Right/D button: Move right.</p>\n<p>Left/A button: Move Left.</p>\n<p>Left Click/J button:\u00a0Attack</p>\n<p>Space Bar: Jump.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T10:09:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d2/6d2fa3d0e16b1242923276c4fc4cbbf2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jack_Falvez"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
