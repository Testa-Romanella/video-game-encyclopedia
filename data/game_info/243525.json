{"id": 243525, "slug": "gipf-for-ipad", "name": "Gipf for iPad", "name_original": "Gipf for iPad", "description": "GIPF is a strategic game for two players based on a classic concept: in turns, players introduce one piece into play until achieving four-in-a-row. Players then remove their row and capture any of their opponent's pieces which extend that row. This principle of capturing pieces creates each time again completely changes situations on the board. The purpose is to form successive rows of at least 4 pieces, until the opponent has no piece left to bring into play or when he has no more GIPF-pieces on the board.<br/><br/>Aim<br/>The first player to create a situation where his opponent either has no more pieces in his reserve or no more GIPF-pieces on the board, wins the game. So, keep in mind: make sure to always have at least one piece in reserve and always at least one GIPF-piece on the board. <br/><br/>Pieces<br/>The players start with 18 pieces in reserve each. Pieces in reserve are pieces of your own color that are not in play. A GIPF-piece is 2 pieces stacked one upon another. <br/><br/>The board <br/>There are 24 dots at the edges of the pattern on the board. Dots are not part of the play area; they serve to position a piece before bringing it into play. The play area is made up of 37 spots (intersections). Only the pieces covering a spot are part of the game. The lines indicate in which directions pieces may be moved. <br/><br/>First move: GIPF-piece <br/>Yellow begins. A yellow disk on your side tells you it's your turn.<br/>Your first move must be a GIPF-piece. Touch and drag a piece out of your reserve and put it on any of the black dots. At your first move, two pieces are sum stacked and moved together. Next push the double (GIPF) piece onto an adjacent spot. You may move a piece only one spot at a time, never two or more. <br/><br/>Then the turn of your opponent comes. A red disk on his side indicates it is the red turn. The red player should touch and drag a double (GIPF) piece to an empty black dot. Next push that piece onto an adjacent spot.<br/><br/>Moving other pieces<br/>Both players have made one move. When introducing a piece you can either move it to an empty spot, or to an already occupied spot. If the spot is already occupied, that piece is automatically pushed to the next spot on the line (if that spot would also be occupied, then this piece also moves over one spot, etc.)<br/><br/>Introducing single pieces <br/>Both players may introduce as many GIPF-pieces as they want, until they bring a single piece into play. After the first move, every time a player drags a piece into the game, he may choose if a double (GIPF) or a single piece should be moved. After you have inserted a single piece, you have no more choice: all the following moves will insert single pieces. When learning the game, we advise you to play with 3 or 4 GIPF-pieces. <br/><br/>Two restrictions: <br/>1. A piece already in play may not be moved as a separate piece. A piece (or more pieces) on the board can only be moved by introducing a new piece. All of the pieces in play may be pushed by both players, black and white pieces, single and GIPF-pieces.<br/>2. When all the spots on a line are occupied, you cannot play in the direction of that line. If you would, you would push a piece out of the game at the opposite site and that is not allowed. <br/><br/>Recycling and capturing pieces<br/>As soon as 4 single pieces of your color are lined up on adjacent spots (dots don't count!), they are taken from the board. Moreover, not only must these 4 pieces be removed, but also the pieces that form a direct extension of them. The pieces of your own color are returned to your reserve, the pieces of the other color are captured, thus lost to your opponent. Opponent's GIPF pieces are automatically removed; your GIPF pieces can be removed or left, at your choice.<br/><br/>End of a game<br/>There are two ways of winning: you must capture your opponent's last GIPF-piece or you must exhaust his reserve. As said in the beginning: a player who has either no more GIPF-pieces on the board, or has no more pieces left to make a move, loses the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:14:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/977/9778d7d823274fb0a051fec6089f9d42_U2IwqIS.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Luigi Fonti"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Luigi Fonti"], "esrb_rating": null}
