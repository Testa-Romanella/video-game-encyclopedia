When a woman is not too feminine and man not too masculine, the idea is quickly overthrown to spirals and mockery: \u201cWhat a complete disgrace.\u201d<br/></p>\n<p>A woman should be, if not sophisticated, aggressive, strong, and confident. As for a man, well\u2026 the opposite of a woman, I suppose- if not seductive, then sensitive, submissive, and gentle.</p>\n<p>Gender in society quickly gives out a person\u2019s role even if you are the granddaughter of one of the richest in the country. It is absolute, and no one could defy it. That is why, Ashley Violet must face her marriage seriously when from the very start, she does not qualify at all from the feminine standards of this world of theirs.</p>\n<p>And to top it all up, it is not like her husband-to-be candidates are normal at all. Shan Klavir, Kian Kami, and Luciel Hale are more than just a bunch of guys- they have their own kinds of crazy. They were sent so that her family and one of theirs will hopefully unite for business. It is arranged like that, but Ashley is willing to make new arrangements for the future that she always wanted- if not to overthrow the ridiculous gender roles, it is to at least free herself from it. She knows she is not the only one.</p>\n\n\r\n\u00a0C H A R A C T E R S\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0F E A T U R E S\r\n\n<ul><li>Customizable Name</li><li>Spend time with 3 Love Interest</li><li>Over 15,000 words\u00a0</li></ul>\n\n\r\nG AM E\u00a0 \u00a0N O T E S\r\n<ul><li>This game would only be a demo.</li><li>There would be future updates, if there is any bugs encountered while playing please comment down below or reach out on our email chanchangames0@gmail.com</li><li>Official Twitter for updates:\u00a0ChanChanGames</li></ul>\r\nT H E\u00a0 \u00a0 T E A M\r\n\n<p><strong>GUI Programmer-\u00a0Marionnete<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Programmer-\u00a0Maxfield<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sprite Artist - Nacchi.Yan\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Writer-\u00a0</strong><strong>cinnaroll</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T09:48:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5bf/5bf0666a7f6fa416cd32fa09d4a97078.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ChanChan Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
