I know what will happen, but I can't not go down there, because the creator of the game make me to. So low, so abusive of his power. But it's all right, it's my fate. I will definitely DIE sooner or later!!\" <br/><br/><strong>\u2022 Features:</strong> <br/>A ball (or whatever you think it is) <br/>A deep dark hole <br/><br/><strong>\u2022 How to play:</strong> <br/>Roll the ball, avoid dangerous things. <br/><br/><strong>\u2022 Note:</strong> <br/>This is my first time I'm trying to make a type of game like this, and I really enjoyed making it. You can finish this game in about 10 - 20 minutes (or longer). I hope you guys love playing the game, and feel free to give me some feedback, thank you. :) <br/><br/>And thank you Blurry Mind for translating the description.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ae/0ae4883952421100ba4890610edcf80d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sang Hendrix"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
