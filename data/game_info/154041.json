RGMMC is an uncomplete mess of fun but ultimately unrewarding and unpolished experiences that will waste a few good minutes of your life. Alas, in it's imperfectness lies an ultimate expression of what college life is - a random trudge to figure out WHAT THE HELL YOU ARE GOING TO DO IN LIFE, with the possible safety net of a degree resulting in a 60% chance of being hired...wait no, 50%, wait no, 30%, what's that? 5%? GG</p>\n<p>Well, Good Luck, Have FUN (GLHF)</p>\n<p>Oh, umm there's some copyright material in FExGalaga mini-game - like Fire Emblem sprites and music I don't own, but I'm not claiming any of it, so here's the info:</p>\n<p>Fire Emblem Sprites from Spriters-Resource<br/></p>\n<p>Song - Horns by Bryce Fox</p>\n<p>And that's it!
