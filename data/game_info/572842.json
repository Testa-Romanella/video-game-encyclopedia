Also our first game jam and game. The theme was SIDE-EFFECTS but we chose not to use the theme.</p>\n<p>\u00a0You play as a Pirate who wants all the gold in the (small) world. Go to the nearby Island to collect gold coins, ancient treasure chests, and cursed skulls. Luckily for you, you know a few people who are willing to take those things off your hands for a decent price. Make deliveries for the Outpost's folks and claim the rewards.\u00a0 Eat plenty of fruit when your hurt and slice away at those evil skeletons.\u00a0But watch out, you aren't the only pirate in the Sea of Thieves. How much gold can you get?</p>\n<p><strong>CHARACTER CONTROLS:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>WASD - movement</p>\n<p>LEFT CLICK - attack</p>\n<p>SPACE - jump</p>\n<p>E - interact</p>\n<p>ESCAPE/P - pause</p>\n<p><strong>BOAT CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p>WAS - move forward and turn left/right</p>\n<p>LEFT CLICK - shoot left cannon</p>\n<p>RIGHT CLICK - shoot right cannon</p>\n<p>The game has limited controller support as well.</p>\n\n<p>As mention before, this is our first game jam as well as our first time making a 3D game. Lots of firsts with this project, so it may not be as smooth as we want it to be. We would like to continue working on this project and give it a bit more of a platformer feel, so feedback would be cool. <em>I also put in some secrets, try and find them :)<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>All sounds grabbed from FREESOUND.ORG</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T07:50:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65d/65dd79488a812dafc424c1996137530b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hermendez"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
