I am planning on making a mobile port, but that will take a while to create. Give me feedback, I'm open to suggestions thanks!

If you ever feel overwhelmed remember to use power-ups you may have collected along the way. Most importantly have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T08:54:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/468/468d53434385d09ff67ce9771e1407fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["coolboi_21"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
