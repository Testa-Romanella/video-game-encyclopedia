The story is that our hero, a powerful sorcerer, was cursed by a demon with an anti-magic dome, that blocks every spell our hero tries to cast from inside it but leaves him vulnerable to attacks from outside. But! Being very powerful, he is able to tear two small slits into this dome, through which he can cast all his quantum spells, defeat his demon enemies, and beat the curse!</p>\n<p>Mechanically, this is an RPG with first-person turn-based combat: adjusting the slit sizes and distance from each other, his attack spell will produce an interference pattern indicating where his spell is most or least likely to hit.</p>\n<p>This game was developed during the 2022 Quantum Game Jam by:</p>\n<p>Julio Garcia - Game Development, Art</p>\n<p>Carlos Vieira (me) - Game Development<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T13:03:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b91/b911cf4fb54cbe15d21f91a66488899e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cacov"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
