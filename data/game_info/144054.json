But most importantly, run away from your impending doom. A massive explosion is quickly catching up to you.\u00a0There will also be enemies that block your path. Use Spacebar to shoot missiles at them! Be sure to avoid their mines though.</p>\n<p>That's it. One level. One chance. Good luck!</p>\n<p>Bug Fixes:</p>\n<p>* Score correctly resets after each game</p>\n<p>P.S. If you are getting weird behavior (like dying too quickly to the explosion), run the game on lower quality/graphics settings. Unity makes that pretty easy. It should fix your problems.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/758/758d2a97ad75b46639de1aa37554316d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ColinM"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
