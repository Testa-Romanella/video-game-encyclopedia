'Right' and 'Left' will strike with the right and left arms, respectively, and 'High' and 'Low' strike at their respective heights. Each direction has its own pros and cons, depending upon the opponent, weapons equipped.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\n<p>Use combat commands to create attack combos.\u00a0Certain strings of attacks initiates a \"Charged Attack\" which are special combo attacks that deal significantly more damage. It is up to the player to uncover each character's special combo by experimenting\u00a0with command strings. Once the player has determined the correct string, it is saved in a list which can be viewed during the player's turn.\u00a0 For example, to initiate Flaming Fist, enter the command: Right-Left-Right.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Charge Attacks expend AP. Combine Charged Arts with Normal Attacks to maintain your AP.</p>\n<p>Discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/dCyTm7kH</p>\n<p>Twitter: https://twitter.com/Anthony51239244<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T15:19:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a6/6a6b24a8717a103349da5bafbe681f7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 354, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AniyStudio"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Strategy", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
