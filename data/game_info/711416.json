They are claustrophobic, mazes, and a matter of survival. You play as one of the tunnel rats as you delve into the Vietcong tunnels as part of your mission. However, slowly you began to see weird things within the dirt walls. 17 hellish levels of war await you.</p>\n<p>The game was made with specific inspiration from Total Eclipse (1988), Maze war (1973), and Phantom slayer (1982).\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is extremely hard. You will also feel some psychological effects. Trust me, this happens to me as I feel uneasy as I delve deeper into the game. There are also some horror themes inside which will really startle you. That is why parental guidance is advised. I am not joking.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T05:21:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e1/7e10b04d1a87a07adcbcbb76bda03829.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Endeavour"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
