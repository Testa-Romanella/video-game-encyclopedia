Dash", "description": "<p><strong>B.E Dash</strong> is a<em> single-player survival game</em> based on the <strong>journey of engineering</strong>. It shows how difficult it is to go through each year and how at the end of each year, there are portals where there is a sudden switch from knowing everything and knowing nothing, showing how dynamic levels engineering has, and so does this game. Since engineering has a <strong>hardcore difficulty</strong>, so will this game. So, while you grind in this game every hour of your life, try and enjoy the beauty of each year (each level in the game) as well.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T22:00:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc5/cc5d06343e71d2029d0ca6c52c1e775c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KushalBhalgat"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
