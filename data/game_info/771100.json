If so, this platform game is for you! Are you skilled enough to\u00a0make your way to the top while dealing with moving platforms, springboards, wall jumps, and breakable platforms which are there to turn you into grated cheese?

The task was to create a 2.5D platform game with a minimal artistic touch, and the main focus on character movement, camera, and controls.
