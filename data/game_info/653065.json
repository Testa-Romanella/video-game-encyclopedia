It will constantly chase you through the levels. As you take damage from the obstacles or enemies that come from the Calamity, the Calamity will inch closer to you.\u00a0<br/><br/></p>\n<p>If you manage to successfully outrun the Calamity, you'll be presented a few options to upgrade your ship and how you want to deal with survivors. You only have a finite amount of space and need to decide if you want to bring more survivors at the cost of upgrades or leave them behind to their own fate.</p>\n\n<p>Use\u00a0WASD to move, Left Mouse Button to shoot.<br/><br/>Assets we did not create:<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Music from We Love Indies:\u00a0<br/>kf021705-escape-the-tower <br/>kf020904-march-through-hell-28<br/>rmx-29<br/> <br/>audio from Freesound: <br/>Assault_Rifle_06_Single_Shot_01 <br/>AssaultRifleLarge <br/>blasterfire <br/>laser <br/>RifleSpread01 <br/>RifleSpread02 <br/><br/>Megascans: <br/>T_BrushedMetal_shlaffmc_2K_MR <br/>Metal Panels <br/>Mossy Rocky Ground <br/>Painted Metal Metal Door <br/>Scratched Painted Metal Sheet Other,<br/><br/> Marketplace: <br/>MAT_Wave from Muzzle Master pack</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T05:22:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48e/48e12daac8422c0f1527b6f2cc54589f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Djriff"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
