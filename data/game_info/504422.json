{"id": 504422, "slug": "satelloop", "name": "Satelloop", "name_original": "Satelloop", "description": "<p>Satelloop is an infinite arcade/resource management game about surviving on your Satelloop.</p>\n<p>You\u2019re on board your satelloop - floating among asteroids. These asteroids are both your lifeline and your immediate danger. Mine resources from the asteroids with your drones, but make sure to destroy them with your drone if they get too close. Your drones can be used to repair your Satelloop as well. Creating drones take time and resources, so manage your drones carefully!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls and How To Play</strong></p>\n<p>(There is an in-depth tutorial in-game if you don\u2019t want to read all these.)</p>\n<ul><li>A/D or Left/Right key to move around.</li><li>Left Mouse Button to shoot a drone. The more you hold, the faster you shoot.</li><li>Right Mouse Button to shoot a retrieval hook. RMB again to pull it back. If the hook attaches to a drone, you can press Left mouse Button to detonate the drone (you lose it), or Right Mouse Button to pull the drone back.</li><li>S/Down/Space to interact (Flip sides on a flip hatch, turn on/off drone generators).</li><li>Asteroids will destroy parts of the ship if hit. Flip to the inner side and shoot a drone there to repair that part. This consumes the drone.</li><li>The drone limit (how many you have in hand + how many are active total) are shown on screen.</li><li>Drone Generators show how much longer it\u2019ll take for them to produce a drone. More active drone generators consume resources faster.</li><li>Game is over if you run out of fuel or your satelloop takes too much damage. Score is number of days survived.</li></ul>\n<p>Made by Diptoman Mukherjee (Programming, design), Pranjal Bisht (Art, design) and Joel Montpetit (Audio) for LD47: https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/satelloop<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T11:15:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/873/87389eb21054a6bf4cefc5315bf7b4ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 198, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Diptoman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
