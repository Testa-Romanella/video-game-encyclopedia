In this game you have to pass 3 mini games to get the treasure of La Buse. Some of the meshes were made by me. The person who wins the most mini-games wins the game. I was mainly in charge of the Level Design and programming. This game was made with S\u00e9bastien Puylaurent.</p>\n<p>The 3 mini-games:\u00a0</p>\n<p>BoatPong :</p>\n<p>- The goal is to destroy three parts of the opponent's boat that are bounded by the cannons. The two cannons serve as a bouncing bar for the cannonball.</p>\n<p>Catch the Dodo:\u00a0</p>\n<p>- The goal is to successfully cast 5 times the net to catch the dodo. It runs around the area. The opposing player can slow us down or scare the dodo to take the advantage. Lava can prevent you from passing</p>\n<p>The treasure of La Buse :</p>\n<p>- You have to put weight on a plate to draw the chest towards you. The opposing player can throw objects at you to stop you. Traps may appear that make you start over at the starting point or prevent you from passing.</p>\n<p>Controls :\u00a0</p>\n<p>Player 1\u00a0 :\u00a0</p>\n<p>move : ZQSD\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jump : Space Bar\u00a0</p>\n<p>Interact : E</p>\n<p>Player 2\u00a0 :\u00a0</p>\n<p>move : Arrows\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jump : Right Ctrl</p>\n<p>\u00a0Interact : 0</p>\n<p>Links :\u00a0</p>\n<p>S\u00e9bastien Puylaurent :\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://nukaccino.wixsite.com/sebastien-portofolio?fbclid=IwAR1uRIyvIwZsaKRVU0dO...</p>\n<p>Gurvan Nativel :\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://www.artstation.com/phoenx974<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T04:21:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/377/3775747d0272a1cb8fd89912d716e597.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PhoenX974"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
