In this game, you have six numbers at your disposal, and a random number between 100 and 999. You have to find a way to get the random number by adding, subtracting, multiplying or dividing them. In my game, I add the power and modulo operand to make it much more fun. You also can choose the maximum number of moves and time you want.</p>\n<p>Warning: you cannot exceed\u00a02000.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T13:12:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/196/1961457ccb1757ce379e0d6275e50f56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Westerbay"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
