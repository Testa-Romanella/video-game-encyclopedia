You can teleport next to the goal and move into it as well.<br/>2. You can teleport on top of 404 nodes to use the links around.<br/>3. Each level has at least one solution that **teleports** you to the goal in _difficulty_ moves.<br/>4. If there is only one such possible path, it is guaranteed not to have 404 nodes.<br/>5. If there are multiple such paths, but all of them share certain nodes, those nodess cannot be 404 nodes.</p>\n<p>Made for Js13kGames competition, competition theme is \"404\".<br/>Also, reasonable people would use the entire 13kb **minified and zipped** limit.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T05:14:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/864/86490bcd1fce92872c913e2fd4d207d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BIHENASO"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
