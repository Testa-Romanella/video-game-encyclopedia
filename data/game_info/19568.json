Former Navy Seal officer and a friend of Sam Fisher Victor Coste is taken prisoner by an unknown group of people. The is conducting an interrogation, while he remembers the story of Sam. </p>\n<p>Gameplay-wise Conviction is a bit different from other games in the series: while crawling in the darkness is still a thing, Sam spends fewer times in the shadows this time. Thanks to new Mark and Execute feature Fisher can take on multiple enemies at once finishing them in one spectacular move. </p>\n<p>Singleplayer campaign is good enough but it gets better when another player added to the mix -- the game features cooperation mode with a fully separate story, which allows going through Sam Fisher shenanigans with a friend. Players can coordinate each other&#39;s attacks, and plan the enemy encounters and compete against each other in Face-Off mode.</p>", "metacritic": 83, "released": "2010-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-12T08:20:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/366/366e521df82c81218984915203aa3644.jpg", "website": "http://splintercell.us.ubi.com/conviction/", "rating": 3.83, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 134, "owned": 2237, "beaten": 717, "toplay": 76, "dropped": 133, "playing": 10}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 54, "ratings_count": 668, "suggestions_count": 593, "game_series_count": 7, "reviews_count": 670, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "Xbox One", "Android", "PC", "macOS", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["Ubisoft Montreal"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Ubisoft Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
