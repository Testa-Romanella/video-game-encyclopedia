Good thing you are a mean old space cat who won't back down. </strong></p>\n<p><em>Scroll to bottom of page for PC and MacOSX Downloads. Do not play the Web version on the Safari Web Browser - it comes out super dark.</em></p>\n<p>\r\n\tMade for A Game By Its Cover Game Jam #AGBIC. Inspired by the Far Above The Moon cartridge by Daruma Studios. I ran out of time at the end, so: the later levels may be a bit daunting; death isn't really handled, so don't die (run out of oxygen, or lose hull integrity); and I had just started on the building upgrades feature; the text of the levels was banged out in the last few minutes and is crummy. I'll continue work on this game more after some sleep.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>CONTROLS:</strong><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Look: </strong>Move Mouse<br/>\n<strong>Thrust:</strong> WASD, Q (up) and E (down)<br/>\n<strong>Slow Down:</strong> Hold Spacebar<br/>\n<strong>Pounce:</strong> Get close to a moon mouse until you see the red circular reticle.
