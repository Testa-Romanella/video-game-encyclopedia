The game fit's the theme of \"TWO\" because there are two places the zombies can spawn from \u2013 the top left corner and the bottom right corner. Everything in this game was made in Scratch.\u00a0https://scratch.mit.edu/\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0According to the jam rules, I'm not a beginner since I submitted a game to itch.io before, but I still think that I have lots to learn. This was the first time I tried to make a game in 48 hours. That's why it's not that great and you have to refresh the page to try again. I also have to sleep because i'm still in middle school and I don't have a choice (but summer break though). I really hope you have fun playing my game and I can't wait to hear your feedback in the comments. Now I'm gonna go flop onto my bed and sleep forever.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the\u00a0United Game Jam 2020</p>\n<p>-Matthew Deng</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T04:23:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/636/6360d8a00f087919f11c83518adf6938.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Expositive"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
