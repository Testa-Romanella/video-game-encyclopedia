It's a game about rebuilding a garden, but the garden is also someone's mind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yes - this game has no audio, there's no interface in game, just the menu. You gotta figure out what to do from the game's \"cutscenes\" using only buttons to walk, mouse to look around, key for interaction with objects and action to act with objects on another objects.</p>\n<p>You can move around with a gamepad using X\u00a0 -Interaction | RT - Action but it will not work in the menu or custscenes. Same for VR i think but didn't test.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T06:08:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c5/9c5ab1d597fef88f7c567f39b436d5d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MrKosiej"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
