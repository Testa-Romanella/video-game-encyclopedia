Hit escape!</p>\n<p>1.\u00a0 \u00a0 This game was originally inspired by old styles of Legend of Zelda RPG games. We originally wanted to do a full open world with dungeons but we lost a guy and due to some other restrictions we wanted to keep it to a single dungeon and have the player start there. Because of the theme, we wanted not only our mechanics, but our story to coincide with the theme. Our story is a Princess of Day falling in love with the Prince of Night. While she wishes to be with him, they cannot both exist with eachother, but she still fights constantly if only to see him for a short time to create the title of the game, Daybreak. The prince of night gave a gift to Princess Talia. A spell to fight off creatures of the night, the true final boss though is the King of Day, Ulrich, Talias father. Because of these spells while attacking a creature of either tribe, Talia can only defend against those who she is not attacking. So while attacking with Night magic, she can only block Day creature attacks, calling for balance in switching elements. We ended up not having time to flesh this out, so we only have day and night bears.<br/>2.\u00a0 \u00a0 To fit the theme we not only tailored our story to having two people who are polar opposites fighting to be together, but only having two types of attacks that constantly need to be balanced also show adherence to theme. To switch between attacks, press shift. One attack is good against one type of bear another is good against the other.<br/>3.\u00a0 \u00a0 All assets used were created during the game jam except for the two music files found in the repo, they may or may not be in this specific build of the game, though they are there. Furthermore, we based our early tiling development on A Link to the Past tiling.\u00a0The assets used in the final build are ours.</p>\n<p>We use Phaser and have limited experience with game development.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To run the game you must have npm and node install.</p>\n<p>cd into the src folder and `npm install` then `npm start` and the game should be running.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T03:36:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b8/8b8dcb012adda25d67fce377134fd902.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kipdec"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
