You'll need to memorize enemy patterns and placements, and execute a meticulously thought out plan to succeed! Or...y'know. Just dive in and shoot some fools with a tommy gun.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTrapped at a never ending office Christmas party for WEEKS by militant holiday fanatics, you're forced to grab what weapons you can and fight your way out. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nBlast through through 21 increasingly difficult levels, leaving nothing but a trail of bodies behind you. Shoot bad guys until you run out of ammo, then throw your gun in their face and beat them to death with a baseball bat. Then maybe even take their shotgun and murder their friends! It's all very much in the holiday spirit.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb3/eb390f6fe6a54cc788ff2f4d916f7e0f.jpg", "website": "http://codeavarice.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 22, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 19, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Code Avarice"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Code Avarice"], "esrb_rating": null}
