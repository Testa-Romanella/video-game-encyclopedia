The lights move and change colors\u00a0in time with the music, and other components like the dancing characters (originally designed by BTS themselves),\u00a0 stage screens, live concert audio, and various\u00a0different camera views help make the project come alive.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My main goal is for every individual to feel like they are at a live concert, and to get exposed to something that they may be unfamiliar with.\u00a0It's such a unique experience seeing so many lightsticks light up differently depending on where you're sitting. Every lightstick is independent of each other, which makes each person feel like their presence matters. I hope my project conveys that feeling of belonging and can be an overall fun experience for everyone!</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Use the mouse to look around the screen and press numbers 1-6 on the keyboard to change the camera view.</p>\n<p>Camera 6 is a free roam cam.
