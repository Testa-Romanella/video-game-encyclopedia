In order to last as long as possible you will need to utilize the varied units and buildings at your disposal.</p>\n<p>Each element has a summoning building to grow your army, an economy research building to advance your economy, and a military research building to make your military units more effective. There are\u00a0</p>\n<p>Half-way between each wave you will be forced to select from one of three random options, giving you a reward of varying strength, but also modifying the difficulty of the next wave. Select too weak a reward and you'll be outpaced by the enemy strength later. Select too strong a reward and be overwhelmed right away.</p>\n<p>This game is in early access. This means that you may experience crashes and some units or upgrades may be excessively strong or weak. Experiment with lots of different builds to find what suits your playstyle and remember to focus on enjoying yourself!<br/><br/>If a unit gets stuck there is a teleport ability on the command post. There is also a resource dummy in the game you can use if you're in an intense match but something scuffs and you deserve a refund.</p>\n<p>Comment below if you encounter any errors or have balance suggestions.
