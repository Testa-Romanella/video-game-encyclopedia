You will play as a commander of the egg family to help them build positions against the enemies from the Dark Forest.<br/><br/>Inspired by classic tower defense game such as Plants vs. Zombies, Bloons TD and Kingdom Rush, etc. The Territory of Egg integrates the elements of tower defense and roguelite to provide a unique gaming experience.<br/><br/><br/>You can place 6 types of basic eggs and 20 types of advanced eggs to form a front and expand your territory. Each type of egg is good at dealing with different enemies and terrains, so you need to arrange the eggs according to the situation of the battlefield.<br/><br/><br/>Each advanced egg has 6 optional skills but can only learn 3 skills at most. You can build your own build with a large number of skill combinations.<br/><br/><br/>You will face different types of enemies with different abilities. Pay great attention to those invisible and ethereal enemies which can be damaged by eggs with special skills. Any carelessness may result in disastrous consequences.<br/><br/><br/>You will get the chance to retreat safely whenever you defeat enemy lords. You can leave the battlefield and take all the loot with you, or you can choose to continue fighting and pick one of three random evolutions to power up the eggs to take on more threatening enemies!<br/><br/><br/>You can unlock new skills and abilities in the Tech Tree with the resources collected in the levels. As the battle progresses, the eggs will grow stronger.<br/><br/>The game adopts a minimalist art style. Although it\u2019s easy to play, The Territory of Egg will challenge your power of observation, strategic thinking and techniques.<br/><br/>Don't forget to Join our Discord and follow our Twitter.<br/><br/>Music by Jordan Powell", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-11T02:30:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc0/cc02554f77b7102eec370d5a33f1d8b5.jpg", "website": "https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/hawthorngames", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZGameStudio"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hawthorn Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
