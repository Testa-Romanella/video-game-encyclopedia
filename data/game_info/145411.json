Sounds simple? Then let's add to this the whole computer simulation.<br/><em>Really weak computer.</em></p>\n<p>As you progress and more enemies show up on screen, you have to balance game's RAM usage by disabling parts of the game.<strong> If memory usage is too high, you will not be able to start another round.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Still not enough? The game (I mean, the game IN game) has no interface. For example, to see your statistics and stuff you have to open your save file. And it's still not that simple, because you have limited space for all windows.<br/></p>\n<p>Still there? Then what are you waiting for? Let's see if you can survive 5 rounds...</p>\n<p><em>Good luck and have fun!</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>TOOLS USED:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>GameMaker: Studio 1.4</li><li>GIMP 2.8</li><li>SFXR</li></ul>\n\n<p>And yes, I'm aware of few bugs, like windows not correctly sticking to cursor and some objects clipping through others. But they're far from game-breaking, I'll eventually fix them someday. Let me know if you encounter any other bugs!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/074/0745658a74fc45593b533c0f4f210713.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Emki"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
