{"id": 513083, "slug": "pentix-nova", "name": "Pentix Nova", "name_original": "Pentix Nova", "description": "Reimagination and a remake of the immortal classic. Arrange the falling pieces to fill up and clear the lines. Clear as many lines as possible to advance through levels or complete various objectives. This game is inspired by the four brick falling blocks games. But instead of easy four brick pieces, where the name Tetra comes from, this game uses five bricks pieces, thus the name Penta. Of course, you are not limited to either set of pieces. Play any combination you would like and consider more fun.<br/><br/>Fun question: Do you see the black dots when you are looking at the game title screen? Do you think they are there?<br/><br/>Features:<br/>- Play an endless game or complete objectives.<br/>- Play individual levels or progress through the campaign.<br/>- Smooth and customizable controls.<br/>- Various difficulty levels.<br/><br/>Controls:<br/>The controls were designed to make the gameplay smooth and enjoyable. Below are the few highlights that make this game stand out.<br/>- Tap with the second finger or swipe down to drop the piece. Of course, you can use the \"Drop\" buttons too.<br/>- Swipe up to stash the piece and use it later in the game. This allows for more strategic play.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T02:14:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0dc/0dc4e5245422a2dafd4169e0f7505ff7.jpg", "website": "http://www.irixstudios.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Irix Studios"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Irix Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
