The idea on this is to make a game that plays similar the NES Ghost N Ghouls with some parts from Castlevania Aria of Sorrow (the soul use ability) . I made a quick demo to try out and see what players think.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This demo does not have any player live so if you could survive being hit or going in water.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For controls click on the Setting icon on the top right. You can lower the volume as needed</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T10:28:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e6/9e677db0e835845a56220d708f1007ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Miguel Morgado"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
