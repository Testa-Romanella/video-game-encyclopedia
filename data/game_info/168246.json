Conversation is one thing, but this friend just never stops chattering on, bouncing from topic to topic faster than you can think. You'd better pay attention, though, or you won't be friends anymore. And you can hardly afford to lose a friend.\u00a0On the other hand, don't forget to watch where you're going, or you might get run over by a car.</p>\n<p>Objective: Escort your friend to their destination without hitting too many people, getting run over by a car, or angering your friend by giving too many incorrect responses. For many questions, a \"filler\" answer (ie \"Mm-hm.\") is sufficient, but there is always a \"correct\" answer available as well.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>WASD = Walk (move your character on the left side of the screen)<br/>Arrow Keys = Answer your friend (choose from the answer options on the right side of the screen)</p>\n<p>Walk and Talk was made in two weeks for My First Game Jam (2017).
