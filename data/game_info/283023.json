By applying the best painting techniques like the \u201cGrid Method\u201d and \u201cRight Brain Drawing\u201d with the benefits of gamification, a killer toolset, and advanced image processing, Simile turns painting a masterpiece into child\u2019s play. Choose from the many built-in paintings covering still lifes, portraits, landscapes and more. Even better, you can paint your own photos and make them as simple or as complex as you want. Simile also makes painting a social activity. You, your family and your friends can collaborate on paintings. When you\u2019re done you can share these masterpieces online, order high-quality prints and canvases right from within the app, or if a t-shirt is more your style, you can wear your art on your sleeve.<br/><br/>Grid Method:<br/>Borrowing a technique first used in ancient Egypt and mastered by Leonardo Da Vinci, M. C. Escher, and Vincent van Gogh, Simile uses the Grid Method. It divides the painting into a grid and, as a result, changes a challenging painting into a series of smaller, easier paintings. The technique ensures that results are accurate and have proper proportions.<br/><br/>Right Brain Drawing:<br/>A challenge for anyone learning to draw is to turn off the symbolic part of their brain, that part that tries to interpret the world around it. This makes it difficult to draw what is seen and not draw the \u201cmeaning\u201d of what is seen. For example, when trying to draw a person, most beginners will draw something that resembles a stick figure. Simile only presents one small part of the entire image at a time, hiding the rest. The intent here is to make it unclear what part of the image you are drawing, which in turn, switches off the brain\u2019s symbolic processing so that it won\u2019t get in the way. <br/><br/>Gamification:<br/>People often do better at a task when it\u2019s made into a game. So why not apply that to painting. Simile scores your painting in real time as you work. By trying to maximize your score, you\u2019ll be improving your painting. Simile\u2019s arcade mode also adds timing to the mix; not only do you have to paint well, but you also have to do it fast. This challenge is surprisingly fun, and the results are far better than you might think. I\u2019ve gotten much better the more I\u2019ve played. I bet you will too.<br/><br/>Killer Tools:<br/>Simile has the standard tools, like paintbrushes, a paint bucket, undo, and supports the Apple Pencil (types 1 and 2) on the iPad. It also has a False Color tool which makes it much easier to distinguish between two shades of the same color (with extra options for color blind people). Simile's Grid tool further extends the Grid Method to each tile, and if you\u2019re really stuck, you can turn on outlines which shows you the boundaries of each color. Simile rounds out the toolset with a pipette to help pick the right color. <br/><br/>Advanced Image Processing:<br/>Another challenge for beginning artists is to represent the real-world (which has an infinite variety of colors) with a finite set of paint colors. Simile\u2019s advanced image processing simplifies images to keep things looking real, without being too hard.<br/><br/>Multiplayer:<br/>Simile\u2019s masterpiece mode supports up to 100 people collaborating on one painting. This feature is great for making a grandmother\u2019s day present from her grandkids or for a group of friends that want to complete a painting together. No In-app purchases are required to use this feature, so the sky\u2019s the limit on who you invite to join you. Also, because Simile uses iCloud for collaboration, there is no sign-in needed.<br/><br/>High-Quality Prints:<br/>Simile has partnered with Kite.ly to help turn your virtual art into real-world art. You can order canvas prints, framed prints, posters, t-shirts, mugs, magnets, and phone cases of your artwork.<br/><br/>Music:<br/>We\u2019ve included background music made exclusively for Simile by Leonty Music. It's designed to subtly change as you touch the screen when painting. We also recommend painting to your favorite songs, books or podcasts.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:32:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/472/4728cefc6d8d72c09936c70c3f79ae9a.jpg", "website": "http://save-the-machine.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Save The Machine"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Family"], "publishers": ["Save The Machine"], "esrb_rating": null}
