You can also move in mid-air.</p>\n\n<p>The Jupiter font is created by Isurus Labs and is in the public domain.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T20:13:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/542/5427b371d57eee57fa5c32078dc58399.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["abocado"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
