On behalf of the sick prince, the princess leaves to save the king.<br/>Can the princess who followed daemon who ran away through the door that appeared in a small pond on a hill near the kingdom save the king.<br/><br/><strong>The purpose of the game is to save the king from Daemon's prison located on the 11th floor.<br/>This game belongs to a casual 3d puzzle. But it's never easy.</strong><br/><br/>How to play: <br/>1. Press and drag the left mouse button.<br/><br/>2. The princess changes direction with the dragged direction.<br/><br/>3. The length of the dragged line is the force that indicates how far the princess will run.<br/><br/>4. If you have decided on the direction and force, release the left mouse button. The princess is running.<br/><br/>5. The princess jumps when you press the space bar.<br/><br/>The game features:<br/>1. Each floor is in the form of a maze, but the maze consists of only roads without walls. <br/>It means that when the princess gets off the road, she immediately falls down. So strength control is the most important thing.<br/><br/>2. There is nothing on the first floor except the road, but the road moving from the second floor and about 10 kinds of traps from the third floor interfere with the princess.<br/><br/>3. If you fell from a maze above the second floor, you should fall down and go up again from where you arrived.<br/>If you are not good at controlling your strength, you will fall down a lot, so you will increase your patience and calmness.<br/><br/>4. From the second floor, a skull-shaped bullet flies toward the princess from time to time.  If it is shot, the Hp gauge located in the upper left Ui will be reduced, and if it is shot 10 times, the princess will die.<br/><br/>5. From the 2nd floor, in addition to skull bullets, Hp recovery bullets fly in the direction of the player. After 10 shots, you will recover 100%.<br/><br/>6. Traps function like getting off the road, moving to the starting point, stabbing with a thorn, or sending it downstairs. Traps also appear on the road two in a row.<br/><br/>7. Time flowing through the ui in the upper left affects the ranking. Other than that, there is no stress or disadvantage to the player.<br/><br/>8. When you reach the final floor on the 11th floor, don't worry if you fall down because you're inexperienced in controlling your strength. It starts again at the starting point on the 11th floor. The developer is niceguy.<br/><br/>9. Get the key on the road on the final floor before saving the king on the final floor. It's necessary to destroy a prison.<br/><br/><strong>Now you have the key and save the king!</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-08T02:40:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c6/9c6087f4c6c3663a603282779ef62280.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 244, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CodeBlues"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CodeBlues"], "esrb_rating": null}
