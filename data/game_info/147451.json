That's my first Ludum Dare and for it I just made a <br/>mini-game about Wild West duels. I made two button controlled gameplay <br/>for the Ludum Dare theme. Also my friend (listed in credits) made a <br/>music for the game (that's why I'm starting in the Jam, not the Compo <br/>:P).</p>\n<p>I was making it for about 12 hours. It's not a piece of art, but I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p><strong>Tools used:</strong></p>\n<p>+ GameMaker Studio</p>\n<p>+ ChipTone</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c0/2c05a9cd2418bb2c31372a6900b8c8dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Emki"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
