The normal experience is enhanced\u00a0with added animations and SFX.</p>\n<p>I have high hopes and dreams for this project, after a whole year I still believe this could be a big hit. Every penny I earn will go straight into better quality gameplay.</p>\n<p>You cannot download the game yet, there are yet too many things that need to be fixed. Right now, I am able to queue two builds against each other, both with a starter deck, and play them\u00a0against each other.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It a real prototype, but expect a lot more from me!</p>\n<p>If you already love what you see, then I highly suggest giving their site a visit:\u00a0https://www.gemblenders.com/home/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T14:35:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/843/8434602243e78b5d543794afd4ac2130.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GOAT Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
