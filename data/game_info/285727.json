Shoot enemy interceptors from a first person view and support friendly air forces to finish the bombing mission. There are 4 types of turrets available: chose between side, tail, top or nose gunner positions to resist enemy attacks. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn this game you are not allowed to pilot the airplane because the main focus is a gunner view of the battle, so you can observe, shoot and override some orders. This game features detailed movement inside the airplane including passages that exist in real B-25.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe main objective is to drain enemy reinforcements by destroying enemy airplanes and/or fire support ships.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:49:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65a/65a4cedc010e96f9d7cc2eb658a61b6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Denys Li"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Denys Li"], "esrb_rating": null}
