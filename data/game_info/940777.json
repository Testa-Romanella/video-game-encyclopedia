BOOM!\r\n\n<p>In \"Yeet Bombay\", you yeet bombs, hit yourself\u00a0and scream \"Yay!\".</p>\n<p>This Game was created in 48h GameJam with the theme \"Tick, Tick ... Boom\", organized by \"alpha\", a student organization of\u00a0\u00a0\"University of Applied Sciences\u00a0 Mittweida\".<br/></p>\n<p>This Game tries to invoke the rubberband-feeling of a ticking and exploding bomb, but mixed with a\u00a0joyful anticipation instead of just being scared of a depleting timer.</p>\n<p>The Concept revolves around the Bomb-Throw mechanic. The player can shoot a bomb into the air and the longer it flies, the stronger it gets. <br/>This is used for the main way of moving around in \"Yeet Bombay\".\u00a0When the explosion of the\u00a0bomb hits the player, they are catapulted away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And that's all it is, the player can walk slowly and fly around by exploding left and right. With these tools, he has to try and reach the end of the level.</p>\n<p>This is where the Game-Flow and Feel originates. We call it \"Stop and Blow\". The player cycles between the three states of Stop, Boom and Flow. Firstly, they have time to inspect the passage,\u00a0think about their next actions and while doing so, they stretch the rubberband and\u00a0\u00a0anticipation of the next step: The Boom. When the player is hit by an explosion, the game picks up the pace. The players\u00a0fly through the air and bounce from the walls. They don't have time to reconsider, but that's exactly as intended. Because the last state is \"Going with the flow\". We want the player to feel simply cool by keeping on\u00a0going and by\u00a0landing trickshots, like hitting himself midair.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sounds easy? It isn't!<br/>This game was designed as a Foddian game.\u00a0 So if you mess up and fall down, there are no checkpoints or ways to reset your position. You'll have to earn your way up again. This strengthens the feeling of tension and fear of failing the next move\u00a0and vise versa makes every little success feel way more impactful.</p>\n<p>Additionally:<br/>Maybe there is a little reward hidden at the end for the first player to finish the game. :)</p>\n<p>So Good Luck, Have Fun and Bomb off.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Controls:</em></strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Move</strong> Left and Right - <strong>A</strong> and <strong>D</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Aim</strong> Throw - <strong>Mouse</strong> Position</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Throw</strong> Bomb - <strong>LMB</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Charge<strong> Throw - <em>Hold</em></strong><strong> LMB</strong></em></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T11:54:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4f/c4f52d729faeb14bcd9ac88160955031.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ibrahim K.", "JescoVogt", "MarchTales"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
