{"id": 46932, "slug": "aimerball-2", "name": "AimerBall 2", "name_original": "AimerBall 2", "description": "AimerBall 2 is an indie arcade action game where you need to take your aim and shoot the balls to take out different shapes. You only have 1 ball to shoot at the start. You need to decide about its direction and plan it so that it hits more than 1 object on its way. Once the ball hits bonus balls, you get more balls to shoot in the next round. Remember - you only have to make one aim and all the balls you have will go in the exactly same direction. Use the balls smartly and calculate the best way possible.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77f/77fbba349eb26aca9d4e90d6351d0137.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Floop Productions"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Silicon Echo"], "esrb_rating": null}
