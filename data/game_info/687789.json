Be wary of your surroundings, as they might help you survive this treacherous castle.</p>\n<p>For reasonably experienced ZZT players, you are warned that there are<strong> A LOT OF STARS TO DEAL WITH.<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Remember to save your game!</strong><br/></p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>To get started, select (Keyboard) and (C)olor after starting the game  and then press P to play. Move using the arrow keys. Once in the game,  you can pause by pressing P and unpause by moving. The in-game sidebar will give you more instructions on moving, shooting and saving.<br/></p>\n<p>For more information on ZZT as a whole, I recommend visiting the Museum of ZZT.
