I used p5.play, p5.clickable, p5.sound, p5.scenemanager, and p5.js. All the flat design art that was used was created by me through Adobe Illustrator. All sounds were not created by me.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T05:32:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2e/b2e20bd7a7a129abc75d517ac1c28a4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DavidZen77"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
