As soon as you and your buddies jumped the fence, you all felt a presence take hold of you. You suddenly find your group inside the Trap House. The presence inside of you assures you only one member of your group can escape, but not without its assistance, as it seeks escape through you. Each room is filled with fire, blood covered spikes, shattered glass, killer bees, monsters, iron maidens, and more, with little to no hope of escape. What would you do to ensure your own survival?
