Each player is then given\u00a0<br/>1 face-up card from the NOUN deck; this is their HOME card.</p>\n<p>Gameplay<br/>On their turn, a player uses the cards from their hand to make a new 3 word sentence by playing 1 NOUN card and 1 VERB card, connecting from the outermost NOUN cards in front of them (on the first turn, this will just be their HOME card).</p>\n<p>A player may also play a VERB card to connect their outermost NOUN to an adjacent player\u2019s nearest NOUN to make a new 3 word sentence, connecting the two players.</p>\n<p>Instead of playing any cards, a player may discard up to 3 cards of one type from their hand.</p>\n<p>At the end of their turn, a player draws NOUN cards and VERB cards from the respective decks until they have 3 of each.</p>\n<p>Game Modes<br/>Shortform: Taking turns, each player uses the cards in their hand to create the shortest connection between each adjacent player. Once a full circle is achieved and all the players are connected, the players score 1 point for every card on the table (including the discarded cards). Aim for the lowest score possible!</p>\n<p>Longform: Taking turns, each player uses the cards in their hand to create the longest connection between each adjacent player. Once a full circle is achieved and all the players are connected, the players score 1 point for ever card on the table (excluding the discarded cards). If either deck runs out of cards with any players unconnected, the players lose. Aim for the highest score possible!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T19:09:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d9/8d9d2b7fdf0bda925e07039bf711f8a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["stuntmantan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
