Have more Dwarves join in, craft resources and upgrade literally everything!<br/><br/><h3>Semi-Idle?</h3><strong>Semi-Idle</strong> is where you can play the game if you're active on your PC or if you're AFK, it'll play by itself (Idle). Basically, it's a time filler to micro-manage what you need to within the game. The Semi-Idle idea we added is for the player(s) to enjoy the game both ways: Idle and Active.<h3>Dwarves, Upgrades and More!</h3>Grind, grind, grind! Dwarves will work hard to make all the numbers go up, but you're the leader! Take charge in setting their behavior, ensuring they are prepared for combat and more! Each Dwarf has their own stats. Statistics are based on the current floor your Dwarf is in, allowing you input points in separate certain stats and come up with different ways to grind for materials and items!<br/><h3>Areas &amp; Floors</h3><strong>Areas</strong><br/>Each Area has a level and is 8 tiles long. Between those tiles are mineral deposits. If all of those materials are mined within an area then a new area will spawn. Progressing through area levels will unlock new ore types and more!<br/><br/><strong>Floors</strong><br/>Floors contain areas. This is one of the major progression unlocks of Dwarves Mining Idle. The idea is; the more floors you have, the different ways you can customize each floor with upgrades and build them how you want to grind for materials, items, etc. Each floor has a limitation on Placeable Objects and Dwarves.<h3>Combat</h3>The further your Dwarves mine, there's a chance for enemies to attack because you're disturbing their rest. Enemies can drop special items for crafting or Dwarf upgrades.<br/><h3>Crafting</h3>What's the purpose of mining materials if you cannot do something with them!? Each material has its own purpose. Most materials can be smelted or become apart of a recipe to craft upgrades for your Dwarf or other valuable perks.<h3>Placeable Objects</h3>Placeable Objects are highly important. Progressing, you will eventually unlock these objects to place down on a floor to help you smelt, craft, fuse together materials and more!<br/><br/><br/>So what are you waiting for? Come join the Dwarves and conquer this different style of the Idler genre.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-29T03:59:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f4/3f41890b3a6322618ef5d553440febe6.jpg", "website": "https://www.littygames.net", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Litty Games"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Litty Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
