Maps and enemy placement are randomized each time you play, so no two runs are quite the same.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to Play:</strong><br/>D-Pad: Move around <em>and</em> attack enemies.</p>\n<p>You can move freely\u00a0in any direction, but when there's enemies onscreen, everyone moves <strong>to the beat of the music</strong>. Enemies move to the groove, so learn their patterns and avoid their attacks. When you move <em>towards</em> an enemy, you'll swing your weapon. Each weapon works a little differently, so try them all and find your favorite.</p>\n<p>Your objective on each floor is to find the <strong>Big Key</strong>, then use it to unlock the <strong>Stairs</strong> to the next level. If you clear a room of enemies, you'll get a chest containing <strong>hearts</strong>, <strong>weapons</strong>, or\u00a0<strong>treasure</strong>. (You can also move more quickly in cleared rooms.) Should you race for the exit in as few beats as possible, or challenge all enemies and shoot for a high score? The choice is yours!<br/></p>\n<p>Programmed in one month for the NESDev 2022 Compo, with original music and artwork. Currently more of a demo, featuring the first planned zone and a variety of enemies.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T15:43:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/172/172ace0e70819bb274e585d3729dd435.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zeta0134"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
