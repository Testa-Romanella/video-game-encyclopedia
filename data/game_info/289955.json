The model for this vehicle was purchased in 1984 in a series of 40 buses for the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe.MB E2H85 \u0096 This series was introduced in 1985 which was the last year of acquisition for the first generation of standard buses. The series featuring eight vehicles was part of a fleet trial with new forms of propulsion. The buses are for example driven by methanol. Following the end of the trial in 1989, the vehicles were re-equipped with diesel engines. The models of these vehicles were retired until 2003.Standardbus 1977 \u0096 This is a citybus that does not have a real-world counterpart but features ivory livery and red leatherette seats and thus represents the 1970s and 1980s. A bus like this could be seen in the traffic of lots of smaller and larger towns.Neuendorf \u0096 Neuendorf is a medium sized fictional town in the middle of Germany where you can test the new \u0093Citybus 305\u0094 for the first time.
