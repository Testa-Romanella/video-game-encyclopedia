You build all your decorations by hand and want this year to be special. The local farm had some choice pumpkins, so you want to feature them front and center in your design. From there, you decide how to interact with the props and the design process.</p>\n<p>Haunted explores three yard haunts with three very different implications for what is to come. Think of it like an interactive weird fiction collection. When you finish one story,\u00a0 you'll have the opportunity to turn back time and choose one of the others yard haunts to explore. The order you choose impacts how the stories connect, so choose wisely.</p>\n<p>Developed by Robert J\u00a0Gannon</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T05:54:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf3/cf3c3a37dc58e14ecb8600dd2bae438e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sketching Details"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
