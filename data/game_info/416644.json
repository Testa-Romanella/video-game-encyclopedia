Please read the install instructions\u00a0before playing!</strong><br/><br/>This was an 8 week long project for a class in which we learned the basics of making games in Unreal.\u00a0As such, there are some limitations in the presentation and game play - I'm still learning! <br/><br/><strong>There is no start menu or pause menu \u00a0- you just load in and start playing. You can quit the game by hitting the escape key.</strong>\u00a0I'd like to polish the game further as time goes on and add these things in, so consider this a kind of prototype!<br/><br/>If you find any game breaking issues or aesthetic mistakes\u00a0(things clipping through other things, trees and plants in places they don't belong), please drop me a note/screenshot so I can fix it. I hope you have fun playing!<br/><br/>Game made in UE4 4.24.2.<br/>Background music was made by me using BoscaCeoil.<br/>All meshes were modeled by me using Maya\u00a0(save for the skull and various bones).<br/>The skull, bones, some textures,\u00a0and particle effects are from\u00a0giorgigedianidze's Low-Poly\u00a0Mesh\u00a0VFX.<br/>The ocean texture and a few others\u00a0were modified from\u00a0LXXVII's\u00a0Low Poly Water pack.<br/>Damage sound effects and NPC voices come from myself.\u00a0All other sounds come from\u00a0Soundsnap.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T04:25:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/192/1920ddf6e7cefff5ef1d23825ffad022.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["skapral"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
