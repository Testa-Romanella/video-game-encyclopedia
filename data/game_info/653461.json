Created with Rpg Maker 2003<br/></p>\r\n3 days ago, 22 year old Henrietta was getting ready for work when she received a message from her mother: \"Don't go out, the wind is changing people...\". A mysterious wind appeared out of nowhere and if someone listens to it, they start to change: some get holes and pimples all over their body, some become grotesque abominations. Henrietta became deaf after a car accident 9 years ago, so she isn't affected by the wind...but she can't stay home forever. What's going on out there? What is that wind? Is Henrietta's mother okay? \r\n<p>Guide Henrietta through very bizarre locations, avoid grotesque monsters, solve puzzles, and collect 39 memories that might determine your final choice...</p>\n<p><strong>Features:<br/></strong></p>\r\n\r\nTime Loop mode: instead of dying and getting a gameover screen, restart the day but keep the memories you've recovered\r\n\r\n3 endings\r\n\r\n\r\n39 collectibles that affect the ending\r\n\r\nEvents affected by the number of times you've died/resurrected\r\n\r\nBizarre locations, bizarre situations, bizarre plot\r\n\r\nOriginal soundtrack by Axel Vejar Dossow\r\n\r\n\r\nJumpscares everywhere\r\n\r\nTrypophobia triggers", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T07:34:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a73/a7374184ee682fe8c9a8b6b63a893ec4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AxelVejarDossow"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
