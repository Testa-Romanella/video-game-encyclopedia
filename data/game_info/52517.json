This is used to bypass the 2K limitation of available memory in the Atari 2600. Each game has 6 levels, 2 levels per load, giving an effective total of 6K for each game, which allows for better graphics and more complicated gameplay than the average 2K cartridge. A port of this game for the Atari 7800 was planned, and a prototype version of the game was created, but these plans were shelved after Starpath merged with Epyx in 1984.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1982-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a30/a303860dda19fc5fd3e24798e2fd3b45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Atari 2600"], "developers": ["Starpath"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Starpath"], "esrb_rating": null}
