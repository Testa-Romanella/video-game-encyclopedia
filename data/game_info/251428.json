It isn't until he realizes the truth that he learns true fear.</p>\n\n<p>Based on a novella with the same name,\u00a0<em>The Control Group</em>\u00a0is a story driven role-playing game. Players guide Randy through the various events in his life that molded his worldview. To solve the mysteries he encounters, Randy must overcome obstacles, solve puzzles, and face monsters hidden in plain sight.<br/></p>\n<p>Currently available only as a playable\u00a0demo, the final version of\u00a0<em>The Control Group</em> will contain the following features:</p>\n<ul><li>Three narrative-driven chapters that tell a complete story</li><li>Difficult, but forgiving gameplay</li><li>Simple, yet challenging\u00a0puzzles</li><li>Multiple endings, including several secret endings</li><li>Music that helps to fortify the game's themes</li><li>Hidden content that further expands upon the story</li></ul>\n<p>The final version of\u00a0<em>The Control Group</em> is tentatively set for release in Early 2019.</p>\n<p><strong>Note From the Game's Creator</strong></p>\n<p>My name is Matthew Walker. I am releasing\u00a0<em>The Control Group</em> under the organization Give Time Games. I'm in the process of setting up\u00a0Give Time Games as a fundraising affiliate of Give Time Charity. I've been immensely blessed in my life and have always wanted to give assistance to those in life that are unable to find help elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Give Time Charity is the culmination of that desire. Once set up and fully funded, my wife and I\u00a0hope to provide medical aid to individuals in both rural and foreign areas (we are based in the United States). As a lawyer, I plan to handle the legal and business side of things. My wife is currently preparing to enter medical school and will take charge over the medical aspects of the charity.<br/></p>\n<p>Sales from\u00a0<em>The Control Group</em> will help us to achieve our goals.\u00a0With that said, I don't want to mislead you into thinking that you are donating to a charity by purchasing this game.</p>\n<p>First and foremost, sales from <em>The Control Group</em>\u00a0will help relieve us of debt incurred by our education. We need to put on our own oxygen masks before we can begin assisting our neighbors.</p>\n<p>Second, my wife and I\u00a0need to make sure we adequately provide for our two children as she follows through with her medical training. I\u00a0will be able to work to sufficiently fund the venture, but any financial\u00a0cushion we have will be incredibly stress relieving.</p>\n<p>Third, in the unlikely event that\u00a0proceeds exceed what is listed above, I\u00a0will place the funds in either savings or investments with Give Time Charity so that we can have a strong foundation once we get our wheels on the ground.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0appreciate your interest in Give Time Games and hope you enjoy\u00a0<em>The Control Group</em>.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f9/0f94b8d2126fb50a67bda59f045a2a70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matt at Give Time Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
