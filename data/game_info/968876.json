Your head is bleeding and the car's windshield is smashed. You try to remember what happened, but your brain shoots blanks. Reality itself feels loose, almost shifted. And as night falls, a storm approaches. Perhaps the house nearby can offer a lifeline.. or perhaps it's home to a festering evil. Either way, you're going to find out, first hand...<br/><br/>Cease to Breathe is retro-inspired adventure heavily influenced by the Commodore Amiga games of the late 1980's / early 90's. It is the first game I've developed and released and I hope you have as much fun playing through it as I did creating it!<h3>Features</h3><br/><ul><li>A short, non-linear adventure through a demon infested old house.<br/></li><li>Hand-drawn pixel art that hearkens back to the golden age of gaming.<br/></li><li>Hundreds of interactive objects to either help or hinder you along the way.<br/></li><li>Intelligent puzzles that relies on your skill rather than chance or blatant moon logic.<br/></li><li>Multiple endings directly affected by the decisions you make.<br/></li><li>Explore at your own pace, take everything and try anything!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-03T21:09:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e16/e16076b94657b5c4d69284d3ceb1b249.jpg", "website": "https://www.samthul.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sam Thul"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Sam Thul"], "esrb_rating": null}
