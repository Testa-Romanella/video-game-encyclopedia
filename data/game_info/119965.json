Hell, demon", "description": "<p>When you put in contact a hot thing with a cold thing, the latter gets hotter while the former gets colder. Temperature is energy: by randomly mixing and bumping into each other, the atoms that make them up naturally even out the differences, leading to this result. Could it possibly go any other way? Well, if things weren't so random, it could. Physicist James Clerk Maxwell suggested that if an intelligent creature - a \"demon\", so to say - could decide which atoms to allow to mix and pass through a gate separating two gases, he could discriminate which atoms to allow to pass and who not, thus letting the hotter gas get even hotter - by bumping back all colder atoms and forbidding them to enter. Such a\u00a0\"Maxwell demon\" would make the impossible possible, by subverting randomness with his cunning.</p>\n<p>(disclaimer: no, Maxwell did not believe\u00a0<em>literally</em> in demons. It was just a thought experiment)</p>\n<p>Be that demon! In \"Max W. Hell, demon\", you get control over the gate separating two compartments, one with a blue background, the other with a red one, with a lot of atoms bumping around. Try to accumulate the hotter atoms in the red compartment, and see how much difference you manage to accumulate. Hotter atoms are more red and fast, while colder ones are blue and slow. Blue and red blocks in the walls respectively cool down and heat up atoms that bump into them, while the rest of the walls can conduct and disperse heat around.</p>\n<p>Press\u00a0<strong>Space</strong> to open the gate and let the atoms pass!</p>\n<p>This is just a prototype made for #godotjam. I don't know if I'll ever try making it into a full game with better balancing and proper victory condition; right now, take it more as a demo/proof of concept.</p>\n<p>To learn more about Maxwell's demon:</p>\n<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16f/16f1721fc67bdd95ab26c660f9de4ed5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Gan_HOPE326"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
