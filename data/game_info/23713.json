You'll have to dodge, shoot, cast, and upgrade your way through the dungeon's randomized floors to get it back, but don't take it easy... the dungeon's inhabitants will become more alert as you make your way downwards, causing them to attack more fiercely; clear floors quickly to keep your alert level in check!<br/><br/><strong>Controller users:</strong> you can enable controller mode by pressing the A button (and you can switch back to keyboard + mouse mode by pressing any keyboard key)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:06:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7d/b7d5418c4b3f36aee905335496e4f9d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 8, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 49, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sofuto Geimu"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sofuto Geimu"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
