{"id": 574298, "slug": "space-chase-fullbringer", "name": "Space Chase (Fullbringer)", "name_original": "Space Chase (Fullbringer)", "description": "<p><em>Space Chase</em>, is a third person puzzle-adventure hybrid game of progression. It features world-sized puzzles, which the player is encouraged to solve by exploring the given terrain. It also features low skill combat, where players are prompted to defeat enemies by simply clicking to swing their character\u2019s war axe. The game also allows for an alternative stealth playstyle at times should the player choose to avoid enemy conflict. All of these are tied together by adventure sequences, in which the player is engaged with platforming to advance to the next sequence.</p>\n<p>\tThe narrative surrounding our controlled character is as follows: A retired space veteran finds herself in a cross galactic pursuit of The Collector after the unjust abduction of her beloved companion, a rare nearly extinct alien species. Neither enemies nor challenges will stop her from defeating The Collector and reclaim her lost pet.\u00a0 Our space veteran travels across multiple planets to trail The Collector, encountering unique puzzles and enemies along her way. The goal is to rescue your pet from The Collector, while defeating The Collector's evil minions along the way.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T08:39:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c0/8c00ede7ae6e84914a59ed390db5a609.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fullbringer"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
