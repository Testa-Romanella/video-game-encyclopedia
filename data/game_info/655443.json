Though there is a restriction to it.\r\n</p>\n<p>There are 3 (long) levels you can play through each with different obstacles and\u00a0increasing difficulty.\u00a0 For you first play through, you probably need around 20-40 minutes.\r\n</p>\n<p>This is my third game done (though my first I uploaded here)\u00a0as a 26 years old game developer student from Germany. It's made with unreal, and I made everything by myself except the sounds. I didn't record them (they are from\u00a0https://www.weloveindies.com/) but I mixed them to something very distinct that fits my game more.\r\n</p>\n<p>Feedback or opinions about the game are very welcome.\r\n</p>\n<p>Have fun diving into Sea Realm Reverie!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T17:28:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef2/ef2c6b12497ce9e4f282dac1db8ea88d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 255, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cross9S"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
