In addition to my full time day job I also have a side company that I work on games with and a live stream that I have a fairly frequent schedule I try to maintain. While my current other game project is now released (check out Straylight on Steam, Playstation, AppLab and Sidequest) there's still a fair amount of work in terms of updates and prototyping out our next idea(s).</p>\n<p>TL;DR I'm working on this as much as possible so I don't have firm dates of when I'd like to be done with things but here's a rough idea that is HIGHLY subject to change:</p>\n<p>3/31/2023 - Alpha version 0.0.1 release</p>\n<p>Q4 2023 - Beta version release (most of planned features listed above)</p>\n<p>??? - Full release (planned feature list +\u00a0probably more)</p>\n<p>There's a good chance this project may move from Itch to Steam as this moves in to Beta for security reasons (to link Steam user accounts to the PUN servers), but that's still\u00a0TBD at this point.</p>\n<p><strong>Recordings</strong></p>\n<p>I have streamed a large portion of the development process on my Twitch channel and there are backups of these streams on this YouTube playlist. I can't promise that they're informative but I am very open to questions, feedback, and general programming discussion\u00a0while I'm streaming. This is\u00a0regardless of whether I'm currently streaming game development so feel free to pop in if you're looking for some realtime feedback.</p>\n<p><strong>Source Code</strong></p>\n<p>The source code for this project is publicly available on this GitHub page.
