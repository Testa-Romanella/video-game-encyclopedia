(Derived version)", "description": "<p>Hi Guys! This is the updated version of the\u00a0very first game I made\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>I learned a lot during the game jam Ludum Dare 51.\u00a0\u00a0And I decided to make a derived version of the LD51 project which I'll include more features and more stages!</p>\n<p>The goal of this game\u00a0is:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fire water balls to break boxes until they hit the target!\r\n</p>\n<p>You only have 10 seconds to break all the boxes that block your way to the target!\r\n</p>\n<p>Think fast!\r\n</p>\n<p>There are three kind of boxes in the game: the paper box, the plastic box, and the plaster box.\u00a0</p><p>Each box has a different durability (took multiple hits to break) .\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'm\u00a0adding more features in the game including random reward boxes (allow you to upgrade your weapon, freeze time, fire huge bullets to break a lot of boxes at one time, etc.), explosion boxes, moving boxes, and moving targets.\u00a0 I'll do more updates in the feature to add those things to the game and create more stages. If you like this idea, please stay tuned.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Hope you like this game!</p>\n<p>Tools: Unity for Gameplay, 1bitdragon for original BGM, Pixel Studio for original\u00a0pixel art,\u00a0Disco Diffusion for AI generated art (Open scene &amp; Winning scene), Font from Unity Asset Store -\u00a0\u00a0Thaleah.</p>\n<p>At last, Thank you so much for trying out my game. \u00a0Feedback is highly appreciated!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T09:43:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cc/9cc51072c46347c62ae7cb3dee2d5dc8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Thanks4AllTheFish"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
