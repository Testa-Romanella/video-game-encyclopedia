You will encounter many threats so be prepared.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your objective is to make it from one magical tent to another which will teleport you through the levels.</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>This game was created for a game jam with the theme \"an end is a new beginning\" I made it link to the theme by having the character coming home from an adventure and the end of his adventure was a new beginning. I was planning on adding cutscenes and other things to link it to the theme more but I didn't have the time. So hopefully this is enough.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>-Credit-</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/FoolBoyMedia/sounds/244088/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/edtijo/sounds/240376/<br/></p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Davidsraba/sounds/347174/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/FartBiscuit1700/sounds/368691/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/corpocracy/sounds/403369/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T13:49:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/562/562932675ae6dd734eaaf0dfffc59580.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["StingJay007"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
