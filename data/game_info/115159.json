The constant struggle for power waged with\u00a0fist and steel. <br/></p>\n<p>Will your tribe thrive or die at the hands of your choices?</p>\n\n<p>Barbarian Nations is an ongoing\u00a0challenge for myself. Can one solo developer create a\u00a0Real Time Strategy\u00a0game on their own?</p>\n<p>As it stands there is one playable demo level, showcasing the mechanics and overall feel to the game I wish to develop. Please note that this is an extremely early Alpha, and I am releasing this as such. So by all means let me know of all the bugs you come across.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Left click to select a unit</li><li>Right click to interact with the world (Attack, harvest Lumber, move)</li><li>Right click with a unit selected on the Woodcutters hut to build a woodcutter (the main resource in the game)</li><li>Right click on Trees to harvest with a Woodcutter.</li></ul>\n<p>All compositions and art work are original for this game.
