Most of my life has been ruled by music, it's something that has been a staple in all of my relationships and really grounded me in plenty of scenarios. According to Spotify tracking apps, I tend to rack up around 70hrs+ of listening per week (where there are 168hrs in a week). There are phases in my life where certain songs or genres were more prevalent, and this has led to my memories being heavily tied to certain songs. I can hear a song and immediately feel those feelings, I remember what I was going through so vividly. So, I tried to write about this.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, this is a draft so it is still a work in progress. I have only written and timed a few songs, but I still have more to go. Feel free to give me any feedback and stay tuned for the complete version :)</p>\n<p>I make a lot of playlists, curated for specific moods of mine, so feel free to check that out here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>:)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T02:45:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2e/a2efec68e4404f8432cbb65ffe4d010b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["katie moses"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
