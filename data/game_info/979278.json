Observe the environment carefully to detect anomalies. Some of them can be extremely dangerous. Break free of the experiment by reaching the last module.

Can't remember how you got here. Your capsule has a plate with a subject number.<br/>Looks like you are being in some kind of experiment. The gates behind you are locked, so it's nothing to do but go forward.<br/><br/>Your first space module is odd, but feels strangely.. safe. Watch carefully while going. There are two gates at the end. Both green, choose any of them. <br/><br/>The next module looks same, totally same. Creepy. There is no safe feeling anymore. Why? What's wrong here? Wait.. You saw something. Something changed.<br/>Was that.. an anomaly? You can't tell. The gates. One of them is bloody red for now. You are terrified.<br/><br/>What kind of experiment is this?<br/><br/>The only way to find out is.. moving forward.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-29T15:06:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/335/33568a8b0eb69a2b66c08ce570a19b02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mighty Maces"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mighty Maces"], "esrb_rating": null}
