The game uses both a xbox controller and a Leap Motion. twitBook is a coop shooter in which players control a human wielding bird which has set out to censor and destroy the players opposing views which are running rampant in the twitVerse. </p><p>The team had 72 hours to make the game but alas life happened and the team could only use the last day and a half. Hope everyone enjoys the game and looking forward to what people have to say.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26d/26d93a35af7205f55f6b5a29d67d6d5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CatsPajammers"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
