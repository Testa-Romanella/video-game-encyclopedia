This project was developed in less than 11 days for the MKS Unity3D Challenge, and its purpose is to show my C#-Unity3D skills and use of a variety of Design Patterns. Most assets were provided by MKS Unity3D Challenge<em>,\u00a0</em>besides the scripts, which were all developed by me during the challenge<em>.</em>\n</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Your main goal is to survive until the timer runs out. You can shoot enemies to sink them or just run away, but only the former will award you points. You can set the duration of the level (1 to 3 minutes) and the delay between enemies spawns (2 to 20 seconds) in the Configuration Menu, on the starting scree. </p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong> </p>\n<ul><li>W Key or Up Arrow - Advances the ship</li><li>A Key or Left Arrow - Turn left\r\n</li><li>D Key or Right Arrow - Turn right\r\n</li><li>Space Bar - Shoots forward</li><li>Q Key - Triple special left shoot</li><li>E Key - Triple special right shoot</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Install instructions:</strong>\u00a0\r\n    </p>\n<p>Download the Executable.zip file, extract it, and click on MKS Unity3D Challenge.exe to play!     </p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong> </p>\n<ul><li>Programming:<em>\u00a0 renanruan#3958</em>\n</li><li>\u00a0Art:<em>\u00a0 MKS Unity3D Challenge</em>, CraftPix\r\n</li><li>Music &amp; SFX:\u00a0PixaBay \u00a0\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Official Repository:\u00a0Github Repo</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks for playing!
