After roughly 5 seconds of hitting the cockroach, it will then shrink. Once the cockroach has shrunken, the player can walk over them to destroy them, but you must quickly do so or it will grow back to its normal size. I hope you enjoy this short project!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43a/43a9bca950cbe3df2fcc2ddc1a6c6644.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["torichardson"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
