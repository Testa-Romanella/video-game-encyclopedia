None of the content is made with the intent of being sensitive within the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please keep in mind i am not a modeller, animator or fontist. Therefore the game does lack in models and graphics. I DO intend on adding models and animations into the game but this game is finished in terms of game design elements. I am planning on adding extra game modes in the future too.</p>\n<p>Credit and special thank you to:</p>\n<p>\u00a0-\u00a0Zacchary Dempsey-Plante\u00a0for his font\u00a0<strong>Pixellari</strong>\u00a0\u00e0\u00a0\u20ac\u00a0 which is used within the game and was downloaded from\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/pixellari.font.<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0- Grandad for the inspiration and the drive to do well within life you taught me, thank you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T04:23:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/864/8646729b193e8f54f4d8bf151043a7cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NexGenLuke"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
