It was first released in June 1995 and later for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console in 2014. The game is the portable spin-off of the original title, Donkey Kong Country for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, which spawned its own series alongside the main series. Donkey Kong Land was enhanced for the Super Game Boy and was packaged with a \"banana yellow\" cartridge which was later used for its sequels. Many of the games backgrounds elements, character models, and sound effects were directly ported from the Super NES version onto the Game Boy, retaining the same style as the original. Despite sharing common level themes, the level design and story for each game are completely different.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1995-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-17T10:33:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8a/f8a746c4bf2388ec9f0f2ea2cd2fea7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.89, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 10, "beaten": 9, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 6, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 406, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["Game Boy", "Nintendo 3DS"], "developers": ["Nintendo", "Rare"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
