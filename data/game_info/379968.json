After months of planning your route to the portal and the items you'll need to be successful you are ready to run.</p>\n<p>First you'll need a SPRING so you can jump. The way to the portal will require it. There is one in the Red section of the base.</p>\n<p>Next you'll need to get a DUCK if you're going to get by the floating sentries. The DUCK is a device Dr Lud Umdare created that allows robots to turn into boxes which the floating sentries are programmed to ignore. It just so happens to look like a duck and of no coincidence there is one in the Yellow section. <br/>Lastly you'll need to get a weapon installed so you can defect the creature who guards the portal room. You have a spot for the weapon already you'll just need one last piece to complete it. That piece is stored in the Blue section. <br/>Each section will also require a door key of the same color to open them. You know each section keeps its own door key but you were not able to discover where that was.</p>\n<p>Besides the floating sentries and the portal guardian you'll also have to contend with the turrets that guard the base. The are indestructible so you'll just need to avoid their shots.</p>\n<p>Once you get the SPRING you can start jumping using the SPACE key/Joystick Fire 1.</p>\n<p>You use the DUCK hold the DOWN arrow key/DOWN on the joystick.</p>\n<p>To fire the weapon once you complete it press the RIGHT CONTROL button/Joystick Fire 2.</p>\n<p>If you miss the spring you can restart by pressing R to restart the level.<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n\n<p>You are little robot and this is your story...</p>\n<p>NOTE: YOU ONLY GET 1 LIFE, IF YOU LOSE IT YOU MUST START OVER. ALSO THERE ARE NO CHECKPOINTS BUT ITS NOT THAT LONG OF A GAME.</p>\n<p>BUGFIX EDIT: I can't tell you how many times I played the game as I was designing it. But while testing it after uploading it I discovered a game breaking bug that I never encountered in all of my testing. The issue was when you got to the bottom of the red section after getting the spring the player would no longer be grounded which would cause you to be unable to jump, I checked the code and saw a potential problem and removed it. After testing it again everything seemed to be working. So I continued to play to make sure there wasn't anything else. Which of course there was because the universe is out to get me. This new issue dealt with trying to go through the red door after getting the red key. This made zero sense to me as the player has a collider and a ridgidbody and the door had a collider of it's own. If I jumped while touching the door it would open. I'm not sure what the issue was so if you encounter it, try jumping at the door. The yellow and blue doors work fine and I never encountered any error with them.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T06:36:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e0/4e045e843e55f2623ffe7118093becaf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KunoNoOni"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
