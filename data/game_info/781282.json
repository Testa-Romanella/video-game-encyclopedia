Though this game is more lighthearted compared to the original game Ao Oni, you need to keep it in mind that it  contains some jumpscares and a tense atmosphere overall</strong>,\u00a0<strong>so those with a weak heart are NOT advised to play this fangame. Thank you!<br/></strong><strong>This game may also contain foul language (words such as \"f***\")!<br/></strong></p>\n\n\n<p>Piero Oni is an Ao Oni fangame created with RPG Maker MV. The game features a giant creepy clown monster as the main antagonist.</p>\n<p>You play as Simon, who got to visit his cousin one late evening, however, got himself in trouble and found himself underground. Now, there is some monster that stalks him... He need to find out what happened to his cousin... and survive.</p>\n<p>There is minimum of two endings...<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Author's commentary:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>I created this short game to try out my hand on creating Ao Oni fangames. It's my first one in that sort. I tried to ensure that the game can be completed.<br/>It's quite a short and experimental game, please, don't expect anything extraordinary out of it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T17:33:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a82/a82f9508a1ef7af767bb85527757cc55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FelixWraith"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
