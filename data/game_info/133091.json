The player can earn additional, more powerful weapons as the game progresses, which is a good thing, because the kittens only get more numerous, powerful, and hungry. Just be careful not to hurt your chickens! As a wise person once said long ago, \"as a missile explodes a kitten, so explodes a chicken.\"\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\thttp://mondegreengames.com<br/>\n</p>Instructions<p>\r\n\tDownload the .zip file, extract the files, and run Win32Launcher.exe.
