And a gamepad? Well, then come and play Xendless with them. Xendless is a 1 -4 Player co-op FPS mini-game, with the goal to survive as long as possible. There are 8 really unique charakters, 7 maps and two gamemodes which promise a lot of fun with its fast gameplay! And yeah.. thats it, no other unnecessary features, just a simple game to have fun.<br/><br/>*Friends not required but recommended<br/><br/><br/>Note: Xendless is the first game I have designed and furthermore I work completely alone (which is a lot of work), so it is definitely not perfect and far from being an AAA-title, but I appreciate any support and constructive criticism for improvement.
