A majority of indie developers choose to work with pixel art because of how quick and convenient it is, but we wanted to see what a game would look like if it was doodled by hand. Drawing sprites by hand makes it a lot more difficult to animate, so what we did was created character heads with moving parts and accessories that dance to the beat.</p>\n<p>Another way that this game goes against the grain is by having no essential goals. Instead, it is meant to be a musical sandbox for players to tinker with. This makes every user's experience with the game entirely unique despite the limited number of features. Upon launching the game the player is presented with a synthesizer on a grimy table and must discover how to make it work, there are no rules or instructions. Meat Heads is an exploration game, however, you are exploring sound rather than a visual environment.</p>\n<p>-Max</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T06:08:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a74/a7449ee473eb19ea728bc28385c23c58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["udaco"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
