I was fortunate to come across a community called\u00a0<br/>\u00a0BorIDE/ZXBasic that had been expanded upon with a Spectrum Next Library.\u00a0 \u00a0This seemed right up my street!\u00a0<br/>\u00a0It following a BASIC syntax with a more structured schema and compiled the instructions into machine code.\u00a0 It also\u00a0<br/>\u00a0allowed for inline assembly which was a much bigger draw for me.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0I spent a bit of time setting up my dev environment and am reasonably happy with it now.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0I can compile direct on PC and emulate in CSpect.\u00a0 At the same time, I have a NextSync program by Jari LKomppa running\u00a0<br/>\u00a0that waits to sync files to another host, and on my next, at boot up time, I call the sync command, and a copy of any\u00a0<br/>\u00a0changed files are copied down to the Next, over WiFi.\u00a0 \u00a0No wires, no swapping SDs, no fuss - just fast and easy to test\u00a0<br/>\u00a0on real hardware.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0So now having a setup I could work with, I wondered what I could bring to the spectrum community.\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>\u00a0I have had a Donkey Kong JR LCD Game and Watch since the early 80s and this brings back fond memories for me, of\u00a0<br/>\u00a0holidays in the sun playing this until I mastered it.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0I attempted to write a version on the spectrum back in the 80s in BASIC, called Funky Monkey, but didnt get very far.<br/>\u00a0As time moved on I developed software for the Game Boy Advance. Again I tried to re-create this game for the GBA.<br/>\u00a0To achieve this version I had dissasembled my Game &amp; Watch, scanned in the overlay and also the sprites.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0The GBA version I got to a point where junior could move around, but never did finish it.<br/>\u00a0I have luckily been holding onto these assets (real hardware, and scanned images) for years now!\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0So.... A Spectrum Next, Donkey Kong Assets in hand, and some free time of an evening conspired into me producing\u00a0<br/>\u00a0what you see today!<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0Its been a tough learning curve and there is still a lot more for me to learn.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0A large amount of thanks must go to em00k who has been tremendously supportive in getting this final release out,\u00a0<br/>\u00a0as I was hitting some snag points towards the end of the development - mainly due to my inexperience with the\u00a0<br/>\u00a0development system in use.<br/><em>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>Signing Off :-</em><br/>\u00a0Enjoy the game and if you fancy supporting my hard work, please donate during download on my itch.io page.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0Beer and coffee doesnt come cheap nowadays you know 8)</p>\n<p>\u00a0Bootlegger</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T02:36:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/606/6061ec5e9c1b87660d2ae7b28a909066.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bootlegger"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
