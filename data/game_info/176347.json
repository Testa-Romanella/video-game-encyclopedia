You play a vigilante that is on a mission to takedown the nefarious Metacorp, using the various weapons and abilities you have at your disposal.</p>\n<p>This project was developed as my final year college software project. Online resources were used in order to gain an understanding on how to implement a 3rd person character controller from scratch, as well as aiming mechanics. I then further expanded upon the project by tweaking the gunplay mechanics as well as implementing my own additional features such as a skills system and weapons customization etc.</p>\n\n<p>Cyberpunk City environment created by <strong>Manufactura 4K</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Unity Plug-ins used:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Dialogue System for Unity</li><li>RAIN AI</li><li>InControl\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc2/bc2468ee907b49f9a0bbcffbc9eb4f85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 364, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kilfeather94"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
