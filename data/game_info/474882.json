The gameplay of the entire game is very short (Test played within 5 minutes on speed run). It contains several wrong end and only one true end.</p>\n<p>It is my first ever complete project done by RPG Maker.\u00a0The purpose of this game was to help me to explore and experimenting\u00a0the techniques of creating events. I'm using mostly the default RPG Maker resources in this project. After this, I'll be considering moving on to a new project if I'm able to manage my time between university and game making.</p>\n<p>Credits to the following plugin authors</p>\n<p>Plugin used:</p>\n<ol><li>Community_Basic by RM CoreScript team\r\n  </li><li>TerraxLighting by Terrax\r\n  </li><li>ARP_TitleCommandExit by Atreyo Ray\r\n  </li><li>$MUSH_MenuOptionScreenResolution_P1 by MushroomCake28\r\n</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T07:40:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15c/15cf678c5133c0e6763684d05083caf3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HostG"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
