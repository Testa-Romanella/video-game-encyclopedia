{"id": 96377, "slug": "neiva", "name": "Neiva", "name_original": "Neiva", "description": "<p>Neiva is a side scrolling platformer featuring classical 2D gameplay with 3D graphics. Neiva strives to provide fresh platform gameplay with a projectile teleportation mechanic, while also appealing to the nostalgic platform gamer. All this is set in a vibrant world where the player has to use timing and precision to navigate through hazards. The graphics are colorful, simplistic and details; and the style of the textures will focus on a hand painted look.</p>\n<p>The game was made for a school project and was produced in 8 weeks by six students in 2016. We planned to continue the development of this game by adding new levels and develop the core mechanics but later decided to cancel the project. We are now uploading it here on itch.io for other people to enjoy.</p><p>An Xbox 360 controller is recommended but you can also use your mouse and keyboard. The controls for mouse and keyboard are as following: Run left and right with the keys A and D, jump with Spacebar, aim with the mouse, shoot and teleport to the projectile with the left mouse button. Change between different projectiles with 1, 2 and 3, and pause the game by pressing Esc.</p>\n<p>We hope you like it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afb/afbfec7a782b67319bc6f2b403aa746e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 298, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Neiva"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
