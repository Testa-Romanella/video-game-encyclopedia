Your only companion is your mine cart with its lantern. Shadow creatures lurk in the shadows and they don\u2019t like intruders, however they are afraid of the light. Feed your lantern with coal to keep it alive and it will keep you alive.<br/></p>\n<p>See if you can escape the mine before you run out of coal! And maybe even with some gold and iron!</p>\n<p><em><strong>NOTE: </strong>You start with 5 coal. Forgot the UI for that.
