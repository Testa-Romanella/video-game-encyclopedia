I saw a movie called \"Dooms of the End of the World\". The father said to his son, \"There is a flame in my heart.\" What we understand in this sentence means, \"Whenever there is strong, optimistic and hope in your heart.\" Sometimes I often think that if I am in a world, I shouldn\u2019t call the phone. You can make a choice in the desperate situation where you can eat without spicy food. . . Don't get me wrong, the above words are just the creators of the slang, and this game has no connection with \"Dooms of the End\".<br/>[game features]<br/>- Unique, exaggerated art cartoon setting role<br/>- all kinds of wonderful equipment but weapons that are said to be very useful<br/>- Fun to collect and manufacture a variety of items for cooking, tools, weapons, equipment<br/>- The unique space pace of the male protagonist who caused the legs to be less flexible because of the landing. . .<br/>- Extreme night, extreme rain, acid rain season, monsoon season, students who have no chance to experience in the Antarctic, Arctic and nuclear polluted areas can try to experience it rough<br/>- The joystick comes with the home pointing cursor (green) to save the player the inconvenience of frequently watching small maps (player: this?.....)<br/>-Automatic progress save function, caring for disabled players<br/>\u3010contact us\u3011<br/>There are still many shortcomings in our game.
