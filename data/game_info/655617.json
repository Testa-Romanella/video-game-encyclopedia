We worked around this theme by having\u00a0you equip up to 8 weapons at once, and watch Anath get chaotically propelled with each weapon's recoil, while fending off hordes of enemies in this Top Down shooter. Craft an arsenal of weapons, fight through a horde of enemies, and beat mot in the final epic battle of Chaos. Up for the challenge?
