{"id": 888678, "slug": "the-tomb-of-azathoth", "name": "The Tomb of Azathoth", "name_original": "The Tomb of Azathoth", "description": "<p>Tomb of Azathoth is a short horror RPG inspired by the likes of classic Shin Megami Tensei and other first person dungeon crawlers.</p>\n<p>As a result the game is very challenging and punishes mistakes harshly, however rewards good use of skills fruitfully. On top of this, it provides the player with several decisions that can affect how the rest of the game plays out... Will you fight for everyone? or survive on your own?\r\n</p>\n<p>-------------------\r\n</p>\n<p>Combat is turn based and uses the Press Turn Battle system.\r\n</p>\n<p>When a weakness is exploited you only use up half of an action icon, and can potentially double your actions per turn.\r\n</p>\n<p>However missing an attack or hitting an enemy with a element they null costs 2 action icons and cuts the turn short.\r\n</p>\n<p>This applies to both your party and the enemy party, so ability knowledge and affinity coverage is key.</p><p>-------------------<br/></p><p>As an addendum:\r\n</p>\n<p>This was a game I admittedly made very on the fly (got the idea and just went crazy for 2-3 weeks basically). So a lot of assets used are either open source or from other projects I've done. This was more of a experiment and trying to make a short and fun game rather then something super high effort.\r\n</p>\n<p>As a result any major bugfix reports or suggestions are welcomed, but mild fixes such as spelling and grammatical errors or rebalance tweaks will be considered fairly low priority (most likely included along bigger updates but nothing less).\r\n</p>\n<p>I just feel like I should be upfront about this now just so I don't get many questions about it later y'know :P\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T12:54:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5e/b5eabfab5e901ccdfcaca37b127254bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blu_Wraith"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
