Tarot encompasses the five elements (physical earth, emotional water, mental air, spiritual fire, and the astral - ether), describing how these five geometries weave together to depict the totality of life experiences, and the structure by which the laws of creation are set. Tarot is a language of symbology, numerology, cosmology, geometry, and art - which fuse together in an intricate web of ideas providing a means by which one\u2019s consciousness can engage, and come to know itself better with. The Tarot then becomes a guidebook through the many different aspects of life, and supports a higher understanding of one\u2019s experiences in a deeper, more meaningful way.<br/><br/>Over the ages, many different Tarot decks have been crafted. Patch Tarot is a continuation and evolution of today's most prominent Tarot decks of the past hundred years. This deck is a purposeful fusion of the most prominent symbolisms and descriptions across the most notable decks, into a singular unified Tarot deck made for you - the modern alchemical scholar. Herein you will find all of the familiarity of other great Tarot packs, such as Thoth and the Rider-Waite-Smith, along with a touch of Patchman for good measure.<br/><br/>One thing that should be noted about the Tarot and these esoteric connections is that for most people, the information is quite impenetrable. There are tens of thousands of books available in the world which seek to explore and dissect the symbolism of Tarot, and the understanding of the ancients for the modern mind; however there is so much information, that it is not easily comprehensible without a great deal of study. This brings us to where we are now, and the creation of a new deck - which seeks to make known the hidden mysteries in a simple, yet comprehensible manner: Patch Tarot.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T20:23:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d3/5d3b84b82bef50fe3a41f8f59499be8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Spirit Studios"], "genres": ["Card"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
