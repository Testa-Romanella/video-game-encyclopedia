Submission for Awful Summer Jam 2018.</p>\n<p><strong>Story:</strong></p>\n<p>Alice now has a son named Balice. He finds himself in Wonderland. But things are a little more EXPLOSIVE than when Alice had her adventures there.</p>\n<p><strong>Default controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Keyboard - z/c/cntrl/lmb to fire, x/space to jump, wasd/arrows to move</p>\n<p>360 pad - A to fire, B to jump, dpad/left stick to move</p>\n<p><strong>Scoring:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The closer you are to an enemy when you shoot them, the more coins they will drop. Collect coins to fill your combo bar. Fill the combo bar to enter a powered up state. Every enemy you defeat in the powered up state increases your score multiplier for the rest of the level.</p>\n<p><strong>State of the Game:</strong></p>\n<p>There are still a few\u00a0bugs. The worst I'm aware of is that on rare occasions falling off stage 3 will teleport the player far to the left of the map well out of view.</p>\n<p>v1.3: Post-jam update. Story mode balanced to be slightly easier, and now uses checkpoints instead of mass lives. Bosses flash when hit. Player death more obvious. UI is larger. More tutorial/hints. Player jump smaller. Fixed gravity when walking off platform. Mouse locks to window. Stage 3 slightly brighter.</p>\n<p>v1.2: Various enemies are easier, stage 2 has more enemies, various minor fixes, added quick score explanation to menu, added debug button</p>\n<p>v1.1: Many gameplay tweaks, additional sound effects, bug fixes. Added pausing. Reduced file size. Game jam was extended by 1 day so may use the extra time for another update.<br/></p>\n<p>v1.0: initial release</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26b/26b749581be515e1a35dbd0b9f8bf267.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nightrestraint"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
