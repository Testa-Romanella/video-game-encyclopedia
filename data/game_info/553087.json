Kick blocks - restore figures.<br />\nOddly enough, you are not the only one who knows how to kick in this game world, so be careful - not everyone can forgive you for such behavior.<br />\nYou will find an almost open world in which you will meet not only puzzles, but also other animals that also live their own lives and are constantly busy with something.<br />\nIf you are a little tired while solving puzzles and want to take a break from the main gameplay - there are other entertainments such as football on land, football on water... but explore the world yourself - this is the best way to get to know it better!<br />\nBecome a great kicker - a restorer of an ancient civilization!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T00:32:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b02/b029e6d1f9657a35447cd6397e861836.jpg", "website": "http://dillyframe.games/kickitbunny.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6, "toplay": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 35, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["DillyFrame"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["DillyFrame"], "esrb_rating": null}
