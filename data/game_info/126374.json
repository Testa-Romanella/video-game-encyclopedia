Your goal is not only to survival their adorable rage, but also each other. Collect and craft items to keep yourself alive. Form alliances to take down large beasts. Discover hidden parts of the island. But most importantly, survive to the end!<br/></p><p>\r\nWell, that was the general idea. Tiny Monster Isle is a game I worked on for Game Boy Jam 2016. The concept was a top down multiplayer survival game. The game isn't quite complete, but I think it gets the general idea across. You can play against others, find items, and fight cute monsters.\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["kierkle"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
