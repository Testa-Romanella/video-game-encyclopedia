After surviving an automobile accident near Chernobyl's exclusion zone in the dead of night, Frank Mosser an American radiation protection technician found himself stranded and injured.

Being familiar with Chernobyl's various sections, he made his way to the hospital, only to soon realize hes not alone.<br/></p>\n<p>As the player your objectives are to find various objects scattered around the map in order to ensure survival when trying to escape the hospital/factory. In order to win the game you need to collect all three items listed in-game and leave without being caught. There are various mutants roaming around and as the player you need to avoid being seen or noticed or else you will be chased. Mutants can detect you by either spotting visible light emitted from the flashlight or hearing the player's footsteps within a certain range. You need to avoid being caught by remaining silent, which can be achieved by not moving and remaining hidden by turning off the flashlight and avoiding direct contact.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be4/be4136ad0527ffe83137ff4690a7d471.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Leron_B"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
