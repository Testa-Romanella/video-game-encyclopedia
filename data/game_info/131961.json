The SS Gentle Richards has been afloat for many years - it has sailed the seven seas and plundered many a land. The vessel even survived 2016 - but a curiously mathematical sea is calling for the mighty vessel's demise. There's only one life raft aboard - and only one player can survive. Two best friends reside upon the boat - but after years of secret resentment and jealousy, it all comes to a head as they battle for their lives.</em></p>\n<p><em>Try and throw your best friend overboard as you battle a treacherous dynamic sea that will end one of your lives. </em></p>\n<p><em>The game uses 2D sprites and was made using Unity and Spriter Pro. All assets are our own. The game was made by Vicky Potts and Adam Whiteside from Whitepot Studios, and Richard Gillen.<br/></em></p><em>\n<p>Untested Waters requires 2 connected controllers to play<br/></p>\n<p>Controls: </p>\n<p>X - Punch</p>\n<p>B - Charge</p>\n<p>A - Jump</p>\n<p>Left Analog Stick - Movement</p>\n</em>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/494/494d91284fa2d0a1a40c6f4ab4a4b4a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Whitepot Studios", "rick0"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
