Experience the definitive taste of imagination, in this game. See the many art styles and listen to so many different composers.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDo I have much more to say...? <br/>\n<br/>\r\nNot really, Its much better to experience the game rather than just talking about it.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI could talk about the many different paths that you can go down, or all the unique characters that you will meet. But in the end we are all here for the jokes in this game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo please enjoy this new comedy.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAdieu.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c9/4c93a2f75b603c24f1f54fb6891b49c5.jpg", "website": "https://sites.google.com/view/www-wearethreestudios-com/home", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["We Are Three Studios"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["We Are Three L.L.C."], "esrb_rating": null}
