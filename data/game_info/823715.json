It seems too scary to play when some wall lights are shattered and the strange evil surrounds you. To finish the game level, you must protect and hide from evil. You must look for various items such as chairs, lockers, and so on. If a numeric number appears on any of these items, you must remember it since this number generates the escape room's password. The game sound is so frightening that you pursue it to discover the escape room.<br/><br/>Features :<br/>- The 3D graphics are fantastic.<br/>-The game's sound is too frightening.<br/>-Yellow walls with dim lighting.<br/>-The puzzle structure seems to be authentic.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T07:35:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92a/92a47eeab5932c290f005b89156365be_gbfxa6h.jpg", "website": "https://imranramzanitunes.blogspot.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Imran Ramzan"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Imran Ramzan"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
