You can control their work speed, and you'll need to if you want to reach deadlines.</p>\n<p>But this is a double edged sword, since they stress out more quickly when working at faster speeds. Be sure to manage their stress, though some workers benefit under pressure.</p>\n<p>A few things I left out: Employees were originally going to be able to come in to work sick (and they'd have a .5 efficiency multiplier tacked on), and they'd have a possibility of getting other employees sick. This also gave the player the choice to send them home, though this severely cuts down on the amount of work that'd get done that day. In the end, I left it out due to time constraints.<br/></p>\n<p>Oh, yeah. Sacrificed two whole days to make this instead of working on finals. Smart decision? Probably not. But hey, I got it done.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a9/7a9ec598e3f74f1b84f275285e9d4356.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["KingHeron"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
