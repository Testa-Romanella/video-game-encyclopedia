Maybe yo!/@**## /!\\Error 404/!\\</p>\n\n\n<p>My dear neighbor, edition 404 is a puzzle horror action game in FPS in which you are facing bugs that will threaten your player\u2019s life. Your goal will be to find a way to defeat these bugs ! You will have to stay on your guard, and open your eyes wide in order not to miss any detail because this game contains many secrets...</p>\n<p>You will also be led to make choices during the game, choices that will impact your own game ! Your destiny will be in your hands, it will be up to you to carry it out.</p>\n<p>This demo also contains 15 achievements as well as a mini game to unlock in order to extend the game experience !</p>\n<p>We wish you a pleasant gaming experience and do not forget to leave us your opinion about the game ! This will encourage us in the development of this game !</p>\n\n\n<p>HOW ?</p>\n<p>This game was made with the Unity Engine. We also use some tools such as Blender for animations and 3D modeling, Substance Painter and Designer for texturing as well as Audacity and FL Studio for the voice acting, the music production and the SFX of the game. We also used Photoshop and PhotoFiltre to create some of the game\u2019s textures. We've also used MakeHuman to create our new character : the Delta-H !</p>\n<p>WHAT ?</p>\n<p>Initially we wanted to create this game within a week, the concept being a game on which we focused more on gameplay rather than graphics. We wanted to make a game in which the player would led to make choices and end up facing bugs and glitch leaving voluntarily. Finally we pushed the idea even further by creating an antagonist for the game as well as a story, which pushed us to take more time on development.</p>\n<p>We had so many ideas that we had to pull some from the demo in order to make it less dense and keep some ideas for the full game. Since this game is an experimental game and we don\u2019t know how you, as a player, were going to see it so we preferred to make a demo to see how the game would be welcomed. This will also give us time to collect ideas to improve the game and make the full game even more dense !</p>\n<p>We still have a lot of ideas about the game like action figures to unlock (in the game as a collection), new environments that the player can explore, mini-games and easter egg, all as crazy as each other and much more ! We also collect the players ideas (mini-game idea for example) to improve the game ! If it seems interesting to us, we will integrate them by quoting the person who inspired us the mod idea in the game !</p>\n<p>We clearly don\u2019t know yet when the full game will be released but we can still update the demo if needed ! We thank you for playing our demo and don\u2019t forget to leave us your reviews about the game and smash the like button if you liked it !</p>\n<p>WHO ?</p>\n\n<p>(C) 2017-2020 DAMAN Studios</p>\n<p>My Dear Neighbor, edition 404 and all its contents are trademarks of DAMAN Studios All rights reserved.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-21T05:09:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f0/5f0e11817846d1ad016dc4d2e855ee03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 226, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["DAMAN"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
