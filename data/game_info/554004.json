The theme for the jam was \"collectable\" wich I implemented by allowing the player to move around with a metal detector to find objects out of Metal. There are Objects hidden which are made out of gold or silver, which the player needs to collect.</p>\n<ul><li>The collected items can be seen when pressing <strong>E</strong></li><li>The Menu can be opend with <strong>ESC</strong></li><li><strong>W,A,S,D</strong> to move around</li><li>Move mouse to rotate</li><li>Right click to switch tool (Detector/Spade)</li><li><strong>SHIFT </strong>to run</li><li>Staring location is where you can restore your energy</li><li>digging and running consumes energy</li></ul>\n<p>Move around and swing the detector untill you hear a bieb sound. Once an Item is located switch to the spade and spam left click to dig it up.\u00a0The Spade has a radius indicator witch shows what are will be dig up. If an item is not fully in the radius it will get damaged and not collected. A damaged item will give less points when collected. Since in real life digging up things you find and walking around can be very exchausting, I implemented an energy bar which can be refilled when going to the starting location.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T07:54:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eab/eab1f9fef23c4d9a5e658991f2cf1be6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Seskon"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
