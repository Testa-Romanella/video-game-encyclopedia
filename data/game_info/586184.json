(Or just for decoration)<br/>Craft and automate items to progress your way in the tech tree to unlock new technology and upgrades!<br/>Build fully customizable space-rockets, spaceships, and mega-spaceships! Unlock better tech for upgrades.<br/>Space travel to different planets, then unlock warping and travel to new systems!<br/>Different planets have different biomes, caves, creatures, resources, and more! All based on the system's position in the galaxy.<h3>Automation And Logic</h3>To unlock new technology you will have to build automated farms and factories!<br/><br/>Use an advanced logic and transportation system inspired by Minecraft to automate blocks, items, and creatures.<br/>Choose a hint level and the game will guide you the mechanics while letting you mess around and figure out what you want youreslf (or tell you exactly what to build if you choose, but then it won't be as efficient as if you figure it out on your own).<br/><br/>Machine example: build an automated forge to smelt ores, then automate the fire dispensing, smelted ore breaking, and collecting.<br/>Farm example: build farmland to grow crops, then automate the crops' bone mealing, harvesting, and collecting. <br/>Creatures farm example: build spawning platforms in a cave and light up caves around it to spawn creatures efficiently, then automate their moving, killing, and collecting.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T08:12:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/607/6072165f38b7c51ea443ea5ce91d243d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 11}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tbjbu2"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Freedom Games", "Tbjbu2"], "esrb_rating": null}
