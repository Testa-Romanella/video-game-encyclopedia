It is my submission to the Spooktober 3rd Annual Visual Novel Jam by DevTalk. I\u00a0was humbled by the difficulty\u00a0that comes with\u00a0combining sound, visual art and text in a way that elevates gameplay and narrative. It is definitely\u00a0something I would say I need to work on a lot more if I were to pursue the creation of future visual novels.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game begins with the sudden return of a young college student back to their hometown. For a number of reasons, they are compelled to investigate the abandoned observatory that looms over the quiet town and find out the real reason why their best friend disappeared three years ago.</p>\n<p>I am grateful to the photographers on Unsplash, whose images served as the base for my hastily-put-together Photoshopped backgrounds, because I cannot draw (well). They are attributed more specifically\u00a0in the About screen accessed through the main menu of the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Despite the Creative Commons vibe of the visual novel, I hope whoever plays this enjoys!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T09:24:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2e/d2eed2e971333f1fcba69fa95cd48937.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["kojo_jojo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
