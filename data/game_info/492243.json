Through three acts, mash uncontrollably as an onslaught of cuboid enemies threaten your existence. Intentionally awkward controls make this a rage-inducing challenge that will put you to the test.<br/><br/>90 DEGREES OF ACTION<br/><br/>One button controls the direction of the titular Circle Tank. Turn 90 degrees clockwise and wonder, \"why is this called Circle Tank if the tank can't really move in a circular motion? It's more of a rectangle-- 'Rectankle' would have been a more fitting name, don't you think?\"<br/><br/>CANNONBALL HELL<br/><br/>Dodge 'em up with different enemy types, projectiles, and a killer final boss. Randomized patterns and stage layouts make each attempt unique. A successful run will only take about 3 minutes, and the ability to toggle into a small window at any time makes this the perfect inconspicuous \"corner of your monitor\" experience.<br/><br/>CAN YOU SURVIVE?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T11:20:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc2/dc2098a3a456e67d456a51b5e1df3643.jpg", "website": "https://twitter.com/jonah_srg", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Squid Related Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Squid Related Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
