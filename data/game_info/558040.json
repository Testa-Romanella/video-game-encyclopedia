Unfortunately, once you get started, things are not so wonderful. You keep getting paired up to sell the wrong products to the wrong people, but your boss demands you stay on script. Do you keep pushing the product at the risk of losing all sense of morality and quitting in frustration, or do you sympathize with your unwilling customers and risk getting fired for inefficiency?</p>\n<p>Your goal? Make as much cash at the job as you can before either situation happens and you're out the door. Good luck!<br/></p>\n<p>To play, just click to advance the text conversation, and then make your choice to go on or off script with your customers. Keep your morale from peaking to the top or dropping to the bottom to stay in the game.\u00a0Play again for new scenarios and to beat your previous high sales commission!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Programmer: SmallBunny<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Art:\u00a0sc7pher and Lorenzo Pivotto</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Writing: williamk9949</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Design/Logic, Music/SFX: dojogrant</strong></p>\n<p>All art assets, music, and musical SFX\u00a0are original.
