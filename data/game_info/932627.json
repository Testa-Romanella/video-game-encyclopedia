Upgrade your ship throughout each mission with a random selection of a wide range of weapons and power-ups against constantly tougher enemies. Survivors-style, reverse-bullet-hell game taken back to its roots.<br/><br/>Quick missions across a variety of environments, from deep space to volcanic caves, against a hoard of ever stronger foes. Collect resources from defeated enemies to upgrade your ship temporarily inside the mission and unlock permanent global boosts afterwards.<br/><br/>Each mission will pit you against waves of bosses as well as hordes of weaker cannon fodder. Every boss is composed of several sections, each of them individually targetable and destructible. Do well enough to trigger that mission's unique final boss.<br/><br/>Four different player ships are unlockable through the core missions, each with their own unique and powerful special weapon, but more ships and secret levels can be found via hidden achievements.<br/><br/>Features a unique vector graphics style for a colourful but retro feel, and a professionally-made synthwave soundtrack.<br/><br/>Join our discord to share your ideas for weapons, ships, enemies and levels: https://discord.gg/uZdRTPwVS7", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T02:52:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f9/1f9df406db25be3fb979f59a2bcb429e.jpg", "website": "https://harlequynnegames.com/rlyke.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Harlequynne Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Harlequynne Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
