He's out and you are bored! But before he left, he said you could play his favorite game, Codebreaker, on his computer. <br/></p>\n<p>Will you be able to compute anything on that 200 year old, hard driveless beast before your patience runs out?</p>\n\n<p>Ancient beast 64KB was created for Ludum Dare 36. It's a short, humorous puzzle game about how quaint and unfamiliar computers become after a few decades. I think this concept has a lot of comedic potential, and I hope to one day develop a more fleshed out game around it!</p>\n<p>My favorite part is the crank.<br/></p>\r\nSource code", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-23T05:21:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d45/d45c2c820e7825d0b4c491fdf4679dca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Petzi"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
