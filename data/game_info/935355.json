Here you need to shoot all the cans using the tennis ball! It's so retro that it even opens in a 1024x768 window!</p>\n\n<p>Use the \"A\" and \"D\" (or left-right arrows) keys to move the target. When you think you have the right position, press \"Enter\" key to shoot the ball. Shoot all the cans to win. Remember: you have only 3 tries, or else you will lose!</p>\n<p>If you win the level by using only one ball, you get strike! If with two, you get spare! Just like in the bowling.</p>\n\n<ul><li>The Classic: 10-can tower, great for tutorial!</li><li>Skyscraper: Giant tower, relatively easy to destroy!</li><li>Twin Towers: Althrough the seem unstable, they are not easy destructable</li><li>Giant Pyramid: It's, well, a giant can pyramid!</li><li>Can Wall: It's probably impossible to win this level!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T13:30:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79e/79e7092cd77ef78ff78b9a9d878df8be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Jack Pomi Software"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
