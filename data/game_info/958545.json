Cubo was a happy-go-lucky creature who loved nothing more than exploring his world and find new areas.<br/><br/>One day, Cubo discovered that an evil robotic witch had slowly taken over his home area and was using her army of followers to torture the local inhabitants. Cubo knew he had to do something... to save everyone. ...and set out on a quest!<br/><br/>Certainly, getting the electronic monster eliminated wasn't easy. The way was blocked with checkpoints, but coins opened the doors magically. It seems even evil watchmen can be attracted by money. Supporters of Cyrce, the robotic witch, might still look after you and will crush you without mercy.<br/><br/>Can you survive and succeed your mission?<br/><br/>Credits:<br/><br/>* Code &amp; Level Design: Lemming880<br/>* Graphics: Koyot1222 &amp; Dulcahn<br/>* Music: Triace &amp; Vedder<br/>* Support: Mulle &amp; Kojote<br/><br/>Minimum Requirements:<br/><br/>* Commodore Amiga 500 PAL<br/>* Kickstart 1.3<br/>* 512 KB RAM Extension<br/><br/>Please enjoy playing this game.
