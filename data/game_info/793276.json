There were more than a few unexpected bugs in the journey to get a reliable ice block forming system that was tied with the water in the bucket. So, so many collision and spawning failures... but hey! There are playable levels and you can complete them! It's fun to look back on everything\u00a0I've learned trying to program some things that I've never had to before.\u00a0</p>\n<p>HOW THIS FITS THE THEME OF PERMANENCE:</p>\n<p>We had intended for this game to explore the permanence of water and how it changes between liquid, gas, and\u00a0solid states. Unfortunately, the only mechanic that successfully made it in was creating a solid ice block from the liquid water. There were a lot of great ideas we had to further that and other concepts involving steam and liquid water as both an indirect weapon and a platforming mechanic. They may still make their debut in a post-jam version!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T19:08:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c7/5c7e4d812b7a77b92cb66d9a8e57458d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cardboard Moon"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
