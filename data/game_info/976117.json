{"id": 976117, "slug": "empty-skull", "name": "Empty Skull", "name_original": "Empty Skull", "description": "\"Empty Skull\" is a pixelated indie puzzle game with RPG elements that revolves around a skeleton trying to recollect its life.<br/><br/><strong>Here should be a detailed description of the game that will captivate potential players. Many people embellish the truth, add GIFs, and so on, but I'll just tell it like it is. In this game, my heart and soul are poured in. It's about a little skeleton waking up in the afterlife and attempting to understand how it became a skeleton. To recall what happened before it turned into bones, the skeleton must solve intriguing puzzles and challenges while getting rid of those who mean harm along the way.</strong><br/><br/>I sincerely hope you enjoy it!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-02T08:01:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/795/795d52d4be649cc6e4459df9450e1ead.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Ironbellys Crew"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ironbellys Crew"], "esrb_rating": null}
