{"id": 581456, "slug": "neuraquarium", "name": "NeuraQuarium", "name_original": "NeuraQuarium", "description": "<p><strong>NeuraQuarium</strong> simulates a basic aquatic environment populated by AI creatures. Watch them evolve and change through chance, or take a hand in their evolution by molding the environment.</p>\r\nEvolution in Action\r\n<p>\r\nThe first creatures that spawn will have the same basic  physiology and random neural nets. Those that succeed in finding enough  food to survive and reproduce will pass down slightly different versions  of their physical traits and brain structures. Over many generations,  their offspring may come to be quite different.\r\n<br/></p>\r\nPowered by Neural Networks\r\n<p>Each creature's behaviors are entirely determined by its artificial neural network. You can watch the neurons fire in real-time, and see how brain structures are passed from parent to offspring.<br/></p>\n\r\nSave your Favorites\r\n<p>Save copies of creatures who've evolved interesting behaviors or features with the click of a button, and just as easily, spawn in a copy at any time. Create a custom-curated ecosystem by mixing in your favorite species from past simulations.</p>\n<p>Check out a few examples here.<br/></p>\r\nShape the Simulation\r\n<p>Easy-access sliders allow you to modify the parameters of the simulation, including mutation rates, the availability of food, and how costly it is to reproduce. You can modify the map with barriers to\u00a0 separate environments or make mazes, or add food dispensers so that different areas have different availability of food.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T14:24:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eff/eff326956ba74c58204d6ad990b4a1cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["urocyongames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
