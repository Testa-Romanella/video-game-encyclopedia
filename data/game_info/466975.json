The game forces its players to play a game of circular\u00a0pong while\u00a0black holes, rifts in space, and the sun try to make it increasingly more difficult. It is an action packed blast with simple, yet elegant, game mechanics. Enjoy!</p>\n<p>All sound effects and pixel art are designed in house.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T14:42:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39b/39bb783996de14b6c70e2869bbc7b07c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Terragos"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
