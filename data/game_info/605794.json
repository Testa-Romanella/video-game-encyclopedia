Sorry if you encounter some frustrating bugs, I tried my best to eliminate all the bugs and crashes. As this is my first game ever, there are a lot of technical disadvantages, for instance, ranged combat is extremely buggy so I do not recommend using \"bow\" weapons. Save often, you might also want to have multiple save files. Thank you for playing my game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T04:59:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12c/12c8b8b39f12626b296325de7a5696c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["snowtherpgmaker"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
