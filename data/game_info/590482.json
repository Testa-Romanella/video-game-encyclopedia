Every new game will be different and you can try to beat your highscore! Reach the highest stage possible with your build and your city.</p>\n<br/>Current state: Alpha-Version\r\n<p>Currently we are in the pre-alpha/alpha stage and await more feedback while I, Narsiph, programm and Elvae does the pixel art. Gaugalon creates two unique music-loops (and eventually one bonus track!) and you can go fully 'zen' while playing.</p>\r\nThe following features are already in the game:\r\n<ul><li>120 Symbols &amp; Basic Stats (Attack, Defense &amp; Tax)</li><li>Randomly generated Symbols to choose from every round</li><li>Popup Informations for Symbols</li><li>You can buy more scrolls</li><li>You can add up to 3 symbols into each slot</li><li>Cast failure system: The more scrolls you own, the higher chance of failure each scroll will have.</li><li>2 Monster Types (1 Goblin, 3 different colored Slimes) also with basic informations on how much damage they do and how much hitpoints they have (left)</li><li>Monsters grow stronger after the first few stages until they're too strong to defeat. Which stage was your demise?</li><li>Stage counter</li><li>Earn tax by defeating monsters (or through tax-symbols)</li></ul>\n\r\nProblems and/or Informations\r\n<ul><li>You can click on a 'scroll' to get informations of the shown symbol</li><li>When choosing symbols some and/or all scrolls may be blue. Thats the indicator that you can put the symbol you're holding in there (just click on a blue scroll). You can abort by pressing ESC</li><li>While choose symbol is up you can go hover over a symbol to make the popup window show informations. You have to close it (click on a free space on the game screen) before hovering above another symbol within the choose symbol window.</li><li>Choose symbols will not pop up when you have no place left to place symbols (no scrolls turn blue)</li><li>When defeated the choose symbol will pop up anyway. This is a known bug currently. Well, the game over screen is just quickly thrown together.</li><li>Currently the symbol loss is calculateable (if that's a word?) since it's not random where it happens (The most top left scroll that holds symbols) and there's no indicator that you lost a symbol.</li></ul>\n\n<p>I could now praise on how cool future features will be and what comes but thats just words and not time spent creating those features! Join the Discord and give us valuable feedback as we will listen very closely to our community!</p>\n<p>By the end of April we will release a final demo which will have all the basic features we have planned (so far) for the demo-release and then switch into early access by which the game will be available for purchase (5\u20ac) while in the early stages of developement.</p>\n<p>Now, enjoy the game for a while and don't forget to join the Discord! See you there!</p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/QAkDkRm4yU<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T09:47:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/759/759187130dbf347a33501382cbc50d91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Narsiph"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
