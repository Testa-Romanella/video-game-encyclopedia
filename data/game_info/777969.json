If your browser scrolls for some reason, I suggest switching to full-screen.</p>\n<p>A little short on time due to work and with a whole load of CMake + Raylib + Emscripten problems. Nonetheless, wanted to make a bullet hell from scratch from start to finish and I did that while working usually 0AM-3AM every second day. It is limited, but complete.\u00a0The resulting code is quite nice and I consider building something solid on it (although the CMake + Raylib + Emscripten combo really made me furious at some times, heh). At this stage it is more of a programming project than a game-dev one.<br/></p>\n<p>The only stage is around a minute long, so I hope you try it out and enjoy, cheers! Please share your score if you do!</p>\n<p>The source code will be released soon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T18:01:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a6/4a623ba9652c6ec2e8e8a3ed54e8de4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Aki"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
