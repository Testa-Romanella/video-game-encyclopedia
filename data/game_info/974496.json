It could be said that Daemon Bride is what BlazBlue is for Arcana Heart&#39;s Guilty Gear, well except that Daemon Bride replaces &#39;Arcana&#39; with &#39;Angels and Demons&#39; for helpers, and has more sausages compared to Arcana Heart&#39;s melon-fest. It sadly has yet to receive a console release nor a release outside the Japanese version.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-04T16:02:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fb/2fbcf4a5162368c4ed4fc0d459fc9c7c.jpg", "website": "http://www.examu.co.jp/dmb/head.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 239, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EXAMU"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": ["Examu"], "esrb_rating": null}
