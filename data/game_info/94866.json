{"id": 94866, "slug": "darkness-of-hope-the-pocket-watch", "name": "Darkness of Hope - The Pocket Watch", "name_original": "Darkness of Hope - The Pocket Watch", "description": "<p>Darkness of Hope: The Pocket Watch combines elements of side-scrolling action and Japanese RPG to create a fun and dynamic experience, both in storytelling and gameplay. <br/></p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>In battle, Eris has 14 techniques (commands) up her sleeve, and those techniques will be arranged randomly according to the battle\u2019s conditions. Eris might act as a striker, defender, or even healer, since each of her techniques has a unique function and effect which contribute to your battle strategy.</p>\n<p>Eris is also capable of executing combos by combining her techniques. A combo will deal massive damage, and can be learned through battles, events, or items.</p>\n<p>Players will not get random encounter in this game. There is also no leveling system like in common RPGs, so you will not need to grind. Instead, the structure of this game is more akin to a \u201cboss rush\u201d mode. However, you will still find some puzzles to solve and secret items to collect along your journey.</p>\n<p>As Eris, the player will visit various location throughout the story, each with its own unique nuance and design. Topped with great soundtracks from both our in-house composer and guest composer Ken Nakagawa (Atelier series, Ar Tonelico), this game aims to be something that is both special and memorable in your memory.<br/></p>\r\nSynopsis\r\n<p><em>An old fairy tale tells the story of The Garden of Everything, a place said to be the most beautiful garden in the world. Inside, there lives a witch who could grant any wish. Even wishes that some might deem impossible. But such wishes will not be granted for free.</em><br/><em>How much are you willing to pay for a wish?</em></p>\n<p>You play as Eris, a young agent of an organization called Prismatic. Follow her journey to unravel the secret of a legendary garden and seek a way to grant her impossible wish.</p>\r\nKey\u00a0Features\r\n<p><strong>1. Unique Battle </strong><br/></p>\n<p>SystemA story-driven battle system with a combo mechanic inspired by Legend of Legaia. How you fight decides how the story goes. Every battle is meaningful, and you will have to craft a different strategy every time.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a02. Rich Story</strong><br/>As a small indie developer, creating a game with a big scale is still beyond our capabilities. Therefore, we decided to focus on the most important thing that made us love RPGs: the story. We pay attention to small details in the script, music, and animation to serve you a story you will remember.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Dynamic Dialogue Interface</strong><br/>The dialogues in Darkness of Hope: The Pocket Watch have been meticulously handcrafted with animated interface. This is done to ensure that the storytelling--an important part of an RPG--feels a lot livelier.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Unique Environments with Several Puzzles</strong><br/>As the story progresses, Eris will travel to various locations, each with its own unique theme. From ruins to a forest, to secret facilities and underground caves, these environments will affect not only the story, but also the way you play the game!</p>\n<p><strong>5. High Quality Original Soundtrack</strong><br/>Our talented composer worked hard to create unique tracks that will enrich your playing experience. Combined with additional music from the composer of Ar Tonelico, we hope to steal a spot in your music playlist someday in the future. Enjoy music from various genres, such as rock, jazz, orchestra, and more!</p>\n<p>This is simply a broad explanation of how the gameplay is going to be. However, you are free to do whatever you see fit in your stage of progression, and explore the game at your own pace.</p>\r\nWho's Us?\r\n<p>Eggion wishes to create a game that promotes our country\u2019s culture, to bestow positive light onto Indonesia for the whole world to see.
