I\u00a0would find it hard to even call this a game as there is no real goal beside killing the two moblins in the room you are locked in via invisble walls. There are so many features and functions missing its also hard to this call this a reclaim the wild porject.\u00a0<br/>However this is why we call it a Proof of Concept. With the majority of the basic combat work complete it is now a course of itteration and small additions wich I\u00a0will be contining untill completion.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The Goal is to make a project like Platform fighter engine, a GML project anyone with the smallest idea of coding can download and start making their own Zelda like adventure game. With simply changing varibles and dragging and dropping objects into a room.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Currently in Project -\u00a0</p>\n<p>1 player - movement, spelltech template, stats(though unadjustable), attack, sprites and the being a little crab friend.\u00a0</p>\n<p>enemy template (though unable to use spell techs)<br/></p>\n<p>Though not implimented for Jam reasons, harvesting resources will soon be added</p>\n<p>To be added -\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>dialogue, quests, shopping, complex enemies, player,2,3,4, companions, feats, flying and swimming, difficult terrains, every statsus conditons, proper weapon ranking, puzzle elements, bosses etc etc\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T13:03:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/839/83921c8af8563fe16270d52a195dc37a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HopeBagel_11037"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
