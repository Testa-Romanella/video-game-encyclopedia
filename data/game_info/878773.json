You will have to manage the 5 different resources in the game in order to maintain the city and achieve the quotas. But that is not the only challenge here. Watch out! There is an enormous tree in the world that will attack your buildings if the pollution is so dangerous for him. If you want to avoid these attacks, you have to build some expensive, but worth it, water building.</p>\n<p>All the buildings and the art follow a neon Japanese esthetic.</p>\n<p>Main programmer: Germ\u00e1n Castilla L\u00f3pez\u00a0https://www.linkedin.com/in/germ\u00e1n-castilla-l\u00f3pez-6b0b9223b/</p><p>Main artist: Thomas Evans\u00a0http://spicysosij.artstation.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T10:45:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbe/fbe5698bab3af3cb484d1ca7e279d81e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gertis"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
