If you get killed though, two things may happen:</p><ul><li>You become the enemy who killed you if he is underlevel</li><li>You die if the enemy is overlevel or the same level</li></ul>Known Issues:<ul><li>The game is overall, poorly balanced</li><li>Sometimes enemies may stop spawning (Rare, may not even happen anymore)</li><li>The engineer AI is useless in 1v1 combat</li></ul>Thank you for playing! :)<p>The source comes with all art assets.
