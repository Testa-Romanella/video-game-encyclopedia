{"id": 888560, "slug": "adventurers-guild-tech-demo", "name": "Adventurer's Guild Tech Demo", "name_original": "Adventurer's Guild Tech Demo", "description": "<p>A game about running an adventurer's guild, along with some of your former adventuring party memebers. Build up your guild and hire adventurers to send out on quests. Earn prestige to expand your guild, and create a place for warriors and wizards to train, become comrades, and perhaps a lot more.</p>\n\n<p>Due to a variety of circumstances (aka having thyroid cancer), I didn't get nearly as far into this as I wanted to for the Bara Jam. Take this as an early prototype, with at least some of the core mechanics implemented. There were so many things that were\u00a0<em>almost</em> finished, but I just didn't manage to get working in time, such as the AI for the adventurers (currently they simply wander aimlessly).</p>\n<p>Unfortunately a lot of the <em>bara\u00a0</em>elements were amongst those features that didn't really make it in. In the future I hope to add more content, including quests with of a <em>spicier</em> persuasion, and adventures becoming friends and falling in love\u00a0and fucking.</p>\n\n<p>This is also my first time making a game to be published, so it's certainly been an interesting learning experience. Expect there to be a few bugs. As I was reaching the deadline, I started being a\u00a0bit\u00a0<em>sloppier</em> with my code, and I didn't get to fully test it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T11:59:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60f/60f74ca09434715217e6fd66ef1b2683.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Invidia Syren"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
