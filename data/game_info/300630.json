Perhaps play the game before reading the description.<br/><br/>Go on a day's adventure with an artist. Leaving your home, traveling to the museum, planetarium, and beach. Then after the long day, see how all of the events come together in your dreams.<br/><br/>This game is a result of the combination of my game design skills, coupled with that of an Artist. The aim of this game is to make people think about different color combinations and space differently than you normally would. All of this comes together when entering your dreams in which things come together in ways that you don't expect or think will happen. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-08T05:10:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2b/d2bc27811fd4251ac5f97a182341a684.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["SurrealGaming"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
