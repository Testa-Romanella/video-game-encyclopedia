At some points, you must join together to jump up onto high platforms, while at other times you'll have to split up to help each other by standing on various buttons.</p>\n<p><strong>Theme:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>My game interprets the theme in two slightly different ways. One is that you must literally smush together to become stronger, while the other is that the puzzles would be impossible without both characters.</p>\n<p><strong>Some extra notes:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>While the game was designed to be a single-player experience, I think it would be just as fun if you invited a friend, each person playing one of the cubes. Also, there's a timer in the bottom right corner because I thought it would be fun to speed run. Feel free to post your best time in the comments, hopefully along with some highly appreciated feedback.</p>\n<p><strong>Made in one week for the fifth Brackeys Game Jam!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T07:26:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3cc/3cc254f98db63b1fd8a0e8663d7d02fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["OpenPineapple"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
