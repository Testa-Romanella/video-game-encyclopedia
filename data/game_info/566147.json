She told me this story a while back and I asked her, \"Hey, can I use that crazy story for my game?\" (Psst~ \"Most of the stories in the app are about my friends. Feel free to submit your stories to my Email as well.\") Fast forward to now, and she said \"Yes.\" I can tell her story.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Remember, only <strong>one</strong> path is true. The other outcomes are made up by me, and\u00a0the things she wished she had done differently.\u00a0This is her naked truth, so please respect it. And of course have fun on this crazy journey.\u00a0For obvious reasons, she'd like to stay anonymous. Our story contains no real names or identities, so without further ado, let's see if you end up going down the same path as her, or if you can make better or worse decisions. Now this is your experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T08:16:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80e/80e5488a66218617d532c8d66d1ad574.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Beastcarving Studio"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
