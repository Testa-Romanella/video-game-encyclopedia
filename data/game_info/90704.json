We are trying to keep this game\u00a0(and our other games) from being forgotten or lost. The game is fully functional, even on Windows 10.</p>\n<p>However, Windows 10 users beware!\u00a0Issues can arise when you are on Windows 10 using a NVIDIA graphics card. We implemented a workaround to get the game up and running for Windows 10.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please mail for help or any issues to support@xformgames.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-15T23:38:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/756/7564a6b317fa7fc7e8cee958a1220a21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 209, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["XformGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
