The goal of the game is to complete every simulation, and you have to become the most dominant virus to do so. There are 20 tests totally to finish the game, but once you finish it, infinite random level generation is unlocked, so you can play as much as you want.</p>\n<p>Recently I remade this game with the Unity game engine. I provide both games. Cell Wars Old is the old game, made in C++ (only 15 levels, and no infinite map generation), and Cell Wars is the new one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T05:36:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af0/af0777b3307e429235c546bd17743dfd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GlitchHub"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
