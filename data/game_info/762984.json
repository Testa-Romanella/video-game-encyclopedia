An unknowable monster chases you down throughout the game with only brief respites from danger. The gameplay of Buried perfectly complements the genre, as with quick movement and few defences, the player will always be under threat of death. The ominous tone and great pixel art ensure that Buried is a game that any fan of horror will love.</p>\n\n<p>Feature List:</p>\n<p>-Traditional 2d topdown view.</p>\n<p>-Explore a creepy and unsettling mine system.</p>\n<p>-A grappling hook the player can use</p>\n<p>-A tentacle monster</p>\n<p>-A fluid movement that allows the player to escape the monster</p>\n\n<p>Promotional Trailer:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T19:34:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c3/8c398ea0a7b84844cf66e9904218ad65.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RIGG Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
