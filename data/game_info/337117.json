Click on the best scroll for a given pattern of tiles and try to use the scrolls as efficiently as you can. See the ingame help screen if you need more help on how to play. <br/></p>\n<p>This game was tested using Firefox and I can't guarantee what it will do in other browsers or on mobile devices. The interface is almost entirely mouse-based, but the keyboard is used to change the game settings and mute/unmute the background music. The game does not record scores or preferences, either online or in a cookie, so you'll have to keep track of your scores yourself if that's your thing. While the game in its current form does not have any accessibility feature for colorblind players, you can always set the number of colors to zero in the main menu (although of course this will exclude some of the available scrolls).</p>\n<p>This is my first game uploaded to ItchIO. I know it's simple and not very well balanced, it was mostly just an effort to gauge my ability to create a complete, functioning HTML5 game. If you like it, great! If you don't like it, maybe I'll make something better in the future now that I have more confidence in my abilities. In the meantime, please comment below if you find any bugs that aren't related to browser compatibility- in particular, if you're getting the wrong score from a particular kind of scroll.</p>\n<p>Everything published here is open-source and you can download, backup, share or modify the game as you please. Some of the assets are not original by me, so check the ingame legal information screen if you want to find out more about that.</p>\n<p>For anyone who has issues with ItchIO's download feature, or in case the site goes down, here's a Mega link for a ZIP of the game files: https://mega.nz/#!MbxA1AZB!ZdjjEMgtBhAvitGY4XspIhC-nhmObtxQh2lNeK9gvvY</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-28T03:30:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18b/18bc28671fb916e988d3637db56dad6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["green_meklar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
