Its objective is to reach the right end of the world. The player can move left and right, and jump. Obviously, if the player isn\u2019t supported by a platform, they fall to their death (and lose a life)! There are enemies which collide with the player resulting in the player losing a life on each collision. The player has 3 lives to lose before they lose the game. Some enemies cannot be killed, while the player can jump on others to kill them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>There are several different power-ups:</p>\n<ul><li>Life Pack. Increases the player\u2019s life by one\r\n  </li><li>Invincibility. Makes the player invincible for a set period of time\r\n  </li><li>Speed-up. Makes the player run faster for a set period of time\r\n  </li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The world is randomly-generated and willo lets the player select a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, or Hard), then starts a game with the given difficulty. At harder difficulties, the world contains more enemies and obstacles.\r\n</p>\n\n\n<p>* Willo was created as a capstone project for Coursera</p>\n<p>** Willo uses free platform game assets by Bayat Games</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-20T06:18:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbf/fbffe42b433ca944f6d74c25b1f6cf80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["suhaillala"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
