{"id": 871608, "slug": "frost-unending", "name": "Frost Unending", "name_original": "Frost Unending", "description": "<p>Art and Code - Katarne<br/></p>\n<p>Music - KaleOverlord</p>\n<p>This is a continuation of a game \"A Cold Escape\" I made for VimJam 3. The previous version of the game is on my profile if you want to compare:https://katarne.itch.io/a-cold-escape</p>\n<p>It seems switching to \"New Game\" after doing the tutorial (or vice versa) sometimes doesnt work? If that happens you can refresh the page.</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<p>(There is a tutorial but it's not very good, sorry)</p>\n<p>WASD to move,\u00a0</p>\n<p>Arrow Up/Down - Cycle equipment and consumables</p>\n<p>E - to open doors, containers , or access the truck to leave the level<br/></p>\n<p>LEFT CLICK - to attack with axe, which also can break down tables for wood (for torches)<br/></p>\n<p>Q - Craft Consumable (Torches, bombs, or medkits)</p>\n<ul><li>Torches: provide light, warmth and can be thrown(Q again) to stun enemies<ul><li>Torch warmth effects do stack</li></ul></li><li>Bombs: They go boom and do lots of damage</li><li>Medkits: Heal physical damage (blackened hearts)<ul><li>Required ingredients for each consumable can be seen above the symbol in the UI</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>F - to place equipment or pick it back up - Trap or Signal Jammer</p>\n<ul><li>Trap - Traps immobilize enemies for awhile so they cant move/attack</li><li>Signal Jammer - Makes a small area that blocks enemy vision, can be used to get to safety in an area where there is no cover.</li></ul>\n<p>SHIFT - to roll</p>\n<p>ESC - to pause</p>\n\n<p>I do have limited \u00a0controller/touch support but I did not have time to properly implement it with on screen prompts etc.</p>\r\nGAME MECHANICS\r\n<p>Search the area and collect supplies to keep you alive while you look for the exit. You win once you find the exit.</p>\n<p>You will take damage periodically from the cold, but this can be slowed, or even recovered if you find sufficient warmth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Also, your truck, or sitting next to multiple torches\u00a0 is warm enough to heal frozen damage.)\r\n</p>\n<p>Monsters roam in the city - the damage they deal will PERMANENTLY decrease your health until you use a medkit.</p>\n<p>Throwing a torch can stun them temporarily.\u00a0 A trap will stun them for longer, allowing you to safely kill them,\u00a0but you only have 1 reusable trap\u00a0( it can be picked back up).\u00a0</p>\n<p>A signal jammer is also available that blocks their vision.</p>\n<p>===============================================================\r\n</p>\r\nThoughts:\r\n<p>This project wasn't dead for very long, although this is the first time I've really worked on it since Vim Jam 3. Instead of continually making prototypes as most people do in game jams, I wanted to see what it'd be like to really take a project to the next level instead.</p>\n<p>I think the game is much better now and has a lot more features but I still was struggling to fit everything in till the last minute.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I wasted a lot of time playing with\u00a0 shaders to get better lighting but didnt end up using any shaders in the end, aside from a \"Corrupted Snow\" texture shader which you should see in the main level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope to keep working on this and actually release it as a game in the near future.</p>\n<p>Major Changes:</p>\n<ul><li>Updated menus:\u00a0\u00a0New Settings menu(sound only), Game Over Screen</li><li>Updated UI</li><li>New Sound effects</li><li>New art</li><li>Player now has a cone of vision and can see behind buildings</li><li>Updated Music with logic for changing music in combat/when health is lower</li><li>New Consumables: Medkit and Bomb</li><li>New Equipment: Signal Jammer (Blocks enemy vision)</li><li>New Crafting Materials: Alcohol, Scrap Electronics, and Cloth</li><li>New Stationary Enemy</li><li>Slightly larger level</li><li>Tutorial Level</li><li>Lots of bug fixes and bug additions</li></ul>\n\n<p>Planned (but did not get to):</p>\n<ul><li>Different melee weapons</li><li>More varied art</li><li>Objective UI</li><li>A boss level</li><li>Smoother melee combat</li><li>Minimap showing explored area and where equipment is placed</li><li>Level design was rushed at the end</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n<p>This is a Godot game. Art was made with aseprite.\u00a0I used a combination of real world sounds or playing with instruments\u00a0in a DAW (LMMS) to get the sound effects.\r\n</p>\n<p>Special thanks to KaleOverlord for providing the music!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T07:44:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f8/2f8b8656afbd420fbc5e04a4f72b0a71.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Katarne", "KaleOverlord"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
