I wanted to try crazy things with RPG Maker. This first game is barely playable. The second game in this collection plays similarly to the first, but has better menus. The third is the most enjoyable, I think. I reworked the jumping mechanic to feel slightly more natural. If you play all three of these, you can see me making a lot of progress, not just in using RPG Maker, but in my game design skills.</p>\n<p>I was feeling nostalgic one day and decided to track these games down. They've long been lost to me, but I was surprised to find them sitting in strange pockets of the internet.</p>\n<p>Oh, looks like I went by the name of \"Piggy\". I can't remember why. What an awful logo.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T04:51:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c85/c85adc82af04e06d6ebeb9b2f3921199.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Klaus tehKurios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
