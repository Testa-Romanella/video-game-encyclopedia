{"id": 323630, "slug": "untamed-dragon", "name": "Untamed Dragon", "name_original": "Untamed Dragon", "description": "<p><strong>THEME: TAME A DRAGON</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Once lived a peaceful and non-violent wild dragon who was a master of space-time magic. Adventurers came to defeat it, for no reason. The dragon didn't fight and got captured. The adventurers now want to tame the dragon, so they put it in the labyrinth, and force it to reach a goal, to train it. If the dragon doesn't reach the goal in time, it gets a beating and looses its body parts (which regenerates after a good sleep after each level). When you take too much of a beating, you die. Play as the dragon and solve the maze and reach the goal or find an escape route out of the labyrinth to your home.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS: </strong>Use arrow keys to move the dragon and numpad 2,4,6 to change gravity and numpad 5 to halt all momentum. With each passing tick in the timer, you lose one of your power.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/102/1027e44ddce60cb125e623f8d41c09ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sp4ndy"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
