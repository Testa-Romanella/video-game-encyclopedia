Of course, its less of a tower and more of an orangish square on the right side of the screen, but the idea stands.</p>\n<p>Blobs appear on the purple square on the far left edge of the map, and try to get to the yellow square on the right side of the map. Each time a Blob reaches the yellow square, you lose one life. Lose all of your lives and it's GG.</p>\n<p><strong>Update notes\u00a0 \u00a0v8\u00a0</strong><em>Quality\u00a0Update\u00a0(8.1 just swapped FontAwesome Icons)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Improved multiple things</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Added an easy mode</li><li>Greatly reduced game size\u00a0<ul><li>MTD v7 - 763kb</li><li>MTD v8 - 177kb</li></ul></li><li>Main Menu improvements\u00a0\u00a0<ul><li>Leaderboard is now apart of the menu</li></ul></li><li>Help menu has been moved to the side for easier viewing<ul><li>You can access the help menu during the game\u00a0</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57f/57fa88569c4526bbdd830e82cb5c9872.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tristan Gregory"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
