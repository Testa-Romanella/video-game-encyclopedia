Hi this is my 2nd Ludum dare and this is my game about harvesting. The gameplay is just adjusting sliders and licking buttons, and the art is not much to look at either, but there\u2019s a little bit of mystery in there that (i hope) keeps the player engaged to the end. You should try it, it only takes like 5 minutes to play :D\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T07:14:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4e/a4ee24ea2388d9eba17a29bd955b18e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["meidaniarya@yahoo.com"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
