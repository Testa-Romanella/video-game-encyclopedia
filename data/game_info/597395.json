On parle mal aussi...Anyway, let's get down to business. Our swamp was attacked by The Great and Terrible Lord Farquaad...Nah, just kidding. Just spiders and rats. No Farquaad. Maybe. Anyway, can you, please, help us? Use our weapon to shoot down those creatures (LMB). We are going to help you, just put our frogged forces wherever you like (well, not really, just on the made-up bases) (RMB). We will grab some coins from the defeated enemies for you to upgrade our soldiers (RMB). Is everything clear?
