Their leader was killed, but the organization persists. Now that Logan has escaped from prison, The Opposition is out for blood.<br/><br/>By their side, Huntborn and his crew have the chief of police protecting them while seeking to rid the police force of corruption. In return, he can offer them the freedom they always wanted.<br/><br/><strong>KEY FEATURES</strong><br/><br/><strong>VIOLENCE</strong><br/>Players can choose to take the violent route. To run and gun, stay behind cover, or even blow a hole in the wall for fast entry, that is up to you. The important part is to get the loot and get out as fast as possible, or you will need to face an aggressive police force head-on.<br/><br/><strong>STEALTH</strong><br/>The stealthy option offers you more control over the situation. Make your own entrance by cutting open a window, or dress up as a guard to fool your enemies. Disable cameras and metal detectors, and subdue anyone who hears you drilling open the vault.<br/><br/><strong>CROWD CONTROL</strong><br/>No matter how you play, controlling civilians is a vital part of a heist. Tie them up to make sure they don't call the police, or if it's too late, use them to decrease police aggression and get a human shield.<br/>You can even kill one of them to make a statement.<br/><br/><strong>MINI GAMES</strong><br/>When encountering a locked door, players have the option to pick the lock silently or to drill the door open. What option is best for you depends on the situation.<br/>Drilling open a vault door requires you to pay attention to the drill.

If they spot you, the police will arrive at the scene. When they realize you are tougher than you look, SWAT will be incoming.

These enemies appear on certain missions and usually carry more powerful weapons than the police.<br/><br/><strong>CONTROL YOUR CREW</strong><br/>You don't have to go at it alone.
