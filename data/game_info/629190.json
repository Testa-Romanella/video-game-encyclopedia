The theme was Memory Leak. We decided to make a platformer with the theme being incorporated into an obstacle.</p>\n<p>Throughout the levels you come across memory water (the leak). The memory water causes things it touches to move backwards in time (to a previously remembered state).</p>\n<p>We've made a few levels to play through. They're a bit basic so we may come back to the game and make some more complex levels in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Team:</p>\n<p>Jesse Lloyd-Dominik - Design, Programming, Sprites, Shaders</p>\n<p>Stewart Grant - Programming, Level Design</p>\n<p>Giga - Tile</p>\n<p>Russel Hodges - Music</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Character Sprites adapted with minor modifications\u00a0from\u00a0Clint Bellanger's\u00a0Platformer Animations under\u00a0CC3.0</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>[WASD] - Movement</p>\n<p>[Space] - Jump (twice)</p>\n<p>[R] - Reset Level</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T11:27:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/900/900e6824b7e87ab5ac116d776cdebb5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LlordDominik"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
