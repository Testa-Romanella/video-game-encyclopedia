{"id": 469605, "slug": "matter-of-great-import", "name": "Matter of Great Import", "name_original": "Matter of Great Import", "description": "What is <em>Matter of Great Import?</em>\n<p><em>Matter of Great Import </em>(known for the rest of the document as 'MoGI')\u00a0is a top-down farcical, sci-fi tycoon game. Rent out rooms to a rogues\u2019 gallery of wacky alien entrepreneurs, arrange your shops to maximize profit and keep vendors happy, and maintain your station\u2014all to appease your corporate overlords long enough to get home.\u00a0</p>\n<p>MoGI is set in the Nearly Seven Dimensions, a cartoonish, absurd sci-fi universe bursting with flavorful alien characters. Imagine the hapless, dangerous, scientifically questionable outer space from The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy and Sirens of Titan, but painted with the bright, cartoonish, elastically dangerous, get-outsafe-and sound-in-half-an-hour-(with-commercials) conflict of Looney Tunes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Player Character (PC), a pitifully bland earthling accountant, is snatched into\u00a0outer space by a cosmic mega-corporation called Buyers R U. Eager to exploit a tax loophole, BRU presses the PC into service managing various run-down space stations\u2014you must design each station on the fly, keeping your zany alien vendors happy and profitable. Each level of the game features a different ramshackle space station, requiring you to employ new tactics in order to keep profit in the black.</p>\r\nWhat makes\u00a0<em>Matter of Great Import</em> different?\r\n<p>MoGI isn't your typical, sit-around-and-watch-the-profits-climb-into-the-trillions kinda tycoon game.\u00a0Each level thrusts you\u00a0into a fresh disaster; your room layout isn\u2019t an aesthetic choice but a crucial tool in your\u00a0mission to direct customers and keep vendors happy. Players will have to pay\u00a0attention to each vendor\u2019s likes, dislikes, and attributes to make sure that the station\u00a0doesn\u2019t go up in flames.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s more, the characters (from lovable to loathsome) aren\u2019t just wallpaper\u2014<br/>you\u2019ll have to learn everything you can about their preferences, quirks, and<br/>personalities in order to create the perfect layout for your station.\u00a0</p>\n<p>These characters also each represent one of the three factions you need to keep happy as well. Their is the galactic Law faction, the Mafia who oppose them and BRU (your overlords).\u00a0</p>\n<p>...did I mention the space rats?</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Tycoon-esque features<ul><li>MoGI holds dear the base features of the tycoon genre - passive money generation with varying types of facilities which provide it.\u00a0</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>Below are the more unique features that MoGI has to offer:</p>\n<ul><li>Room/Faction attributes<ul><li>Each room-type the player allows into their station emits an attribute to the rooms surrounding it, more severe for rooms right next door, and less severe the farther it spreads (until nothing). These attributes can aid, or hinder, the player's progress. Certain rooms interact well with each other, and certain rooms do not.<ul><li>List of attributes:<ul><li>Foot traffic</li><li>Criminal</li><li>Professional</li><li>Noise Security</li><li>Food</li><li>Security</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Each room-type is also represented by one of the three factions. These factions also have relationships that need to be maintained by the player. A little help from the crime syndicate could be helpful for BRU, but too much without the protection of the Law is detrimental. Or maybe something else? The decision is yours</li><li>In short,\u00a0<strong>room placement matters.</strong></li></ul></li></ul>\n\n<ul><li>Space rats</li><ul><li>Space rats is a passive-threat system so the player can't\u00a0<em>find</em> a way to wait around. If the player doesn't interact with their station for long enough, then the space rats will begin to infest their station. Thought you could find a quick exploit to wait around to beat a hard level? Nope.</li><li>Space rats will infest an empty room, and then begin to spread. The rats bring a devastating loss of profit and reputation with them. Nobody wants to step out of Granville's Diner and see a space rat. Nobody.\u00a0</li></ul></ul>\r\nFill out our play-test survey!\r\n<p>The game can only continue to get better, funnier and overall more entertaining through the feedback of players like you.
