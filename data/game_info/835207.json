However, just like most wrestling leagues, you share a hidden, common goal - money.\u00a0While the robot is most likely much\u00a0better than you are at the game, you as the human can make the fight more entertaining, thus resulting in more profits for the both of you. (The audience, is mostly humans, though, so still try to win.)
