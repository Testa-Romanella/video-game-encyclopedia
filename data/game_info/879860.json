I knew it was not easy but I still come up short with time. Never the less, digital drawing was fun and I will definitely focused more on it in near future.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>How much did I manage to implement:\u00a0</strong>Well, we have a visually interesting main menu, and completely functional &amp; scalable card game play mechanics. Unfortunately, this is not enough to call this a game, maybe we can call it \"hope of a game\".\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>How do I feel about this submission:\u00a0</strong>Heck yeah I'm proud of it (i was asking my self if I was proud of this). I managed to draw artistically some what consistent assets and abled to code a working prototype. Aren't am I the cutest?\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Future of this title:</strong>\u00a0I will definitely work more with this mechanics, post some interesting part of the project code in my github profile.</p><p>Credits:</p><p>Code and art work were\u00a0done by me.</p><p>Sound effects and audio tracks, I get help from couple of awesome itch.io asset providers, and they are:<br/></p><p>Sara Garrard's Inifinity Crystal: Awakening album, two loopable songs from there used as ambient music track in game.<br/>Mayra's Daily Life Sound Effects Asset Pack, two sound effect used.<br/>Nathan Gibsons' Universal UI/Menu Soundpack,<br/>Rich McBride's demo bundle of their couple of paid sfx package.<br/><br/>Most of the translation's done by my friends, unfortunately, as humble as they are, they didn't want their names shared.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T06:15:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4d/c4d80a654ee4193843f6d61acf99c06c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Grizzly Bear"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
