It's a gem rarer and much more powerful\u00a0than a diamond. As the leader of the Black Crew, a thief organisation, it's your job to make sure that it will be swooped away this night at 11:32 PM. However, alarms go off and not everything goes as planned.<br/></p>\n<p>Make your way through 20 fast-paced and quick levels, avoiding enemies and dashing through obstacles. You have 10 seconds to complete each level, so hurry up!</p>\n<p>Made by the Green Bean company for the 3rd Geta Jam with the theme \"10 seconds\". Mildly inspired by \"Duke Dashington\" by Adventure Islands.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7eb/7eb52835a7c7b6503020c08cc8b0e508.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NNNIKKI"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
