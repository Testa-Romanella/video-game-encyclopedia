The Theme of this competiotion was to combine 2 game generes that don't fit. I chose Idle and Racing (and also retro). This game was going to be so much more, but time limits happened. To drive press SPACE and click the wheel to take on and off steering control. Pressing LEFT SHIFT uses your powerup. Buy things to make you go faster and better. See if you can beat your friends! The game should save on Google Chrome.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13b/13b605e4778f84691af7f629f191524f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ryfi"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
