With basically countless different combinations of Weapons, Implants, Imprints and Upgrades, the game you will play will never be the same twice.<br/><br/><strong>What if time stood still when you moved and only advanced when you stopped moving?</strong><br/>There are tens of Implants to use in PositronX and they can totally change the way you play the game. Time can be slowed, stopped and rewound, you can fly, wall jump or teleport; space can be traversed in an instant. You can stop bullets in mid air and send them back to attackers or call in help to fight for you. Or just jump into a Black Hole and live for eternity. These are only some of the things you can experience while playing PositronX.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>PLAY. DIE. REPEAT.</strong><br/> In PositronX you will die a lot. Based on the setup you choose to start with and the choices you make during the game, the play-through could be either easier, harder or almost impossible to beat. But don't take it personally if you die often, you are supposed to. There is an ever growing database with information that updates with each run. After a few deaths you should be getting the hang of it and you will be doing a lot better.<br/><br/> In the good Rogule-lite spirit, PositronX offers a hand-crafted randomized game experience<br/><strong>Current Features</strong><br/><ul><li> Multiple characters to start with each with their own characteristics<br/></li><li> Player progression system<br/></li><li> Tens of Implants (fully upgrade-able abilities that your character can acquire, each with their own modifiers)<br/></li><li> A dozen weapons to choose from (each having two very different firing modes, each with their own modifier)<br/></li><li> Tens of Imprints to customize your character<br/></li><li> Hundreds upgrades to improve upon both Implants and Weapons<br/></li><li> Various levels of difficulty that cater to beginner and advanced players alike<br/></li><li> Game Modifiers that change the rules of the game <br/></li><li> Two game stages to play in<br/></li><li> Game+<br/></li><li> Local Leaderboards<br/></li><li> Retro mode</li></ul>Basically everything we have done is to make sure that the player will always have a new experience; new combinations to try on and options to choose from for countless hours of play.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Early Access</strong><br/>By the end of Early Access we expect to greatly expand upon existing content while adding new features, adjusting and polishing everything that's already in.<br/><ul><li> More Characters to play with (we are aiming for 10 in the final release)<br/></li><li> More Weapons (we are aiming to have 20+ in the final release)<br/></li><li> More Implants (100+)<br/></li><li> More Imprints (100+)<br/></li><li> 3 more game stages (5 in total)<br/></li><li> 10+ new bosses and Elite units (each stage will have at least 3 bosses specifically designed for that stage)<br/></li><li> 15+ new enemy types<br/></li><li> Steam Achievements<br/></li><li> Story and world lore<br/></li><li> Improved AI, character models and animations<br/></li><li> Rich sound environment</li></ul><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T01:56:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a5/5a58544eeb4a0b9df027b9b2d856a2d0.jpg", "website": "http://www.scorpiusstudios.com/positron", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 10, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 12, "achievements_count": 40, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 586, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Scorpius Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Scorpius Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
