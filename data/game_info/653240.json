Trek across the valley in search of sanctuary to hide out from the zombies.</p>\n\n<p>This game took me 2 weeks to make :) All feedback is appreciated but keep in mind I am a small developer and I made all the player models and animations. Thank you for downloading and I hope you enjoy it :D</p>\n\n<p>Warning: Low end systems may not run the game well, I assure you, your PC didn't crash -\u00a0it's just the fact that I forgot to put in loading screens before the deadline. I recommend medium or low graphics settings for the best loading times</p><p>Enjoy\u00a0:D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T06:20:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/758/75859a552c149ecfe2f893b106b438c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gascoynejames38"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
