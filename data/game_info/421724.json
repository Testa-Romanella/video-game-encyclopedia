It\u2019s something I enjoyed in school but, now live in a part of the country where few people are familiar with the game.\u201d<br/> <br/>\u201cI love how I am able to play with my friends, and I really enjoy the user-friendly interface.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cAwesome app! So nice to have a quality euchre game on my phone!\u201d<br/> <br/>\u201cReally nice game with great layout and user face. You can play with AI or random users, friends, and even set up games.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cEasy to see the cards on the screen \u2013 that\u2019s important. Also AI plays well and is not idiotic like many Euchre AI\u2019s.\u201d", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T01:58:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30f/30f9367cc77a7fb5605cef1740d2daa3_Nro7aaB.jpg", "website": "https://www.trickstercards.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Trickster Cards"], "genres": ["Card"], "publishers": ["Trickster Cards"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
