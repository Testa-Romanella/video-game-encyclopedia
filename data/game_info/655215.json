The bonus amount is determined by how much health you have at the end of each wave</li><li>In between waves, you can go inside your ship and spend your money on various upgrades or repairs at 3 different stations</li><li>Should you die, it's game over and a fresh start</li><li>Should you beat the boss, it's game over anyway and a fresh start</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Goals of this project:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Asteroids-esque drifty/floaty ship movement</li><li>Visually unquestionable with hiques and  indicators, as it has been brought to my attention that it's hard to see what's happening in most space shooters?</li><li>A basic template, designed with scalability in mind should I decide to carry it further.</li><li>Using UE4 and primarily built with C++, using Blueprints only for gameplay extensibility</li><li>In Fable 3, you have to go to a mansion or a castle or something, instead of an actual menu for things like inventory management. I thought it was a great idea with poor execution (long hallways and you have to walk the menu too often!), so I decided to do something similar but allow viewing of the ships interior, during what would be considered in Dungeon Defenders the \"build phase\" and upgrade stuff at various stations.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>TO-DO:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>I limited myself to using a very limited amount of materials.
