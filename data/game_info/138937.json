The player is an assistant to a bumbling robot and tries his best to help the robot make its way to the end of each level. But it won't be so easy as there will be challenges along the way but through clever manipulation of blocking and selecting appropriate body shapes, the player will succeed!</p><p>This game was created to tell a story of a robot that just wants to go on adventures. However things are not that easy but with a little help, just like in reality, Ebot just might be able to make it! We wanted to bring the player along a journey that will eventually fill the player with hope when he finally completes the game! We aimed for a game that dealt with the nature of light sources, specifically blocking and reflection, and we carefully crafted the puzzles to utilize these behaviors.<br/></p><p>PS4 controller will be required.</p><p>If you can, do donate to us so that we can enhance and work on the game!</p><p>Thanks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/188/18868d97d01a42059f88ae933a3c17f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eric Teo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
