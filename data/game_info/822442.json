Zappy Time is a unique arcade game where you must destroy all the pegs to clear the level. The twist: You must keep the balls from hitting the walls or they will turn into pegs. The other twist: Turns happen at specific intervals. When a turn starts, time will freeze and you will get a chance to change the direction of a ball, create a new ball, or move a bouncer. All the pegs must be cleared by the time all the balls leave the screen and the turn counter hits zero.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The later levels get really hard so don\u2019t worry too much about completing all of the levels. Just try to get the highest score!\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T16:09:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e87/e874a95f6d27514ccd131a36fadfac05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zaleyact"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
