VPET is a welcomed throw back to a forgotten era. <br/><br/>Just like these devices you'll need to raise, care, train, clean and feed your VPET so it can grow into even stronger creatures.<br/><br/>Features:<br/>- Start out with one VPET to Evolve (In-App Purchase more)<br/>- Feed and train your VPET so it can get stronger!<br/>- Use the battle system which allows 2 VPETS to battle over Bluetooth<br/><br/>As the VPET grows it will evolve according to how the player has treated it. From this emerge even stronger, more enduring and more powerful VPETS.<br/><br/>*Note*<br/>The app was created to provide a retro simulation of the classic digital monsters gameplay but it is NOT Digimon and is NOT licensed/endorsed by Bandai. All the virtual pets appearing in VPET Gen1 Free were created by Overdose Media.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:17:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/969/969e2b106314e2b8ade3f914be059ecb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Dzianis Azarenka"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Dzianis Azarenka"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
