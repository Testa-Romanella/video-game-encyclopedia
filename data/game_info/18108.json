Each spell has an ingredient which needs to be combined with the spell to activate it. Run, jump and dodge, collect items and spells, change your form and generally have a fun time in Slightly's world.<br/><br/><ul><li>Original ZX Spectrum graphics by Chris Graham<br/></li><li>Remastered and reprogrammed by the game's original author &amp; programmer Colin Jones<br/></li><li>Remastered soundtrack by Allister Brimble<br/></li><li>Re-programmable gamepad buttons<br/></li><li>Director's commentary<br/></li><li>New secret rooms</li></ul><br/>Bigwiz the wizard has left the castle in a hurry, in order to turn the King\u2019s son Newton back into a frog.<br/>Indeed, he was in such a hurry that he forgot to pack his spare wand, forgot to lock his laboratory door, and most importantly, forgot to return his utterly stupid, idiotic, incompetent, brain-dead nephew Slightly to his parents\u2019 mud hut in the hills.<br/>Oh well, it could be worse. A sunburnt dragon could be running off with the beautiful Princess Croak as we speak. The wizard\u2019s spell cabinet might have been knocked over by a Flaming Octarian Whirlwind, scattering the spells everywhere. His kingliness the King might, in a fit of blind panic, have given Slightly the wizard\u2019s private spell book to read. It might rain.<br/>You see, it could be worse. But as it is, there\u2019s not a cloud in the sky, a breeze in the air, or a whiff of dragon\u2019s breath to be sniffed.<br/>Hang on, where\u2019s that pink fire-breathing creature going with that screaming princess? Is that a gentle wind wafting in through the door, or is it something stronger?<br/>Oh no. Get the washing in mother, and lock all doors. Cancel the papers, and shoot the cow.
