In this mode, the fights take place in real time and you can't pause during the fights. In action battle mode, good reflexes and reactions are important. Quick evasive maneuvers or a well-timed counterattack are more likely to lead to victory with some opponents than blindly acting with attacking attacks.<br/>- Secondly, there is the \"BACK TO THE RULES\" ATB turn based battle-mode. In this mode, the battles take place on a separate battle map and the actions are performed alternately. When a character's action bar is full, he may perform an attack.
