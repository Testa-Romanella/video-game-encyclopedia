Your task is simple: there is only one level, and you must make it to the end. The first time seems incredibly simple, but then time rewinds, and you are brought back to an earlier point in the level. Now you must conquer this new area as well as the areas you've already cleared! Can you beat the full level from start to finish?</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p>Move left and right with \"a\" and \"d\". Hold \"left-shift\" while moving to sprint. Jump with \"space\". Move into a wall with\u00a0\"a\" or \"d\"\u00a0while falling to slide along the wall. <strong>Jump with \"space\" while wall sliding to jump off the wall.</strong> Press \"q\" to cheat and skip to the end of the stage.</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: This is more of a demo than a full game.
