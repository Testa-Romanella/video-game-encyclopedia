You'll need to run around and encourage everyone if you want their little cardridges to ship on time.</p><p>Ludum Dare 34 had a double theme of \"two button controls\" and \"growing\". You can view my entry here. I ranked #110, which I'm happily proud of!</p><p>The inspiration for this game came from a benevolent manager I had while working at a large software company. I'm happy with the result, but I wish the gameplay was more interesting. Next time, I hope to make something that's more enjoyable for more than a minute or two.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/037/03726d5ef635b8e87828a62feaab7b06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Daniel Savage"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
