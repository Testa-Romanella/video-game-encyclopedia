You'll have to gather evidence and information by talking to witnesses and examining \"crime\" scenes in order to get to the bottom of things.</p>\n<p>I made this for NaNoRenO 2017, and it's my first time making anything in Ren'Py. It's pretty short (about half an hour long?) and pretty linear, though there is some dialogue variation. I hope you like it!</p>\n<p>Version history:</p>\n<ul><li>1.1: Now includes a Korean translation by @KyleHeren!
