If you get stuck or find yourself in an area outside the map it's probably because that section wasn't finished!</p><p>Controls:</p><p>Press Enter to pass the title screen.</p><p>Space to use sonar.</p><p>WASD to move.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/894/8948b94d82e6fd36304c5cccf38f02d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alex Telford"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
