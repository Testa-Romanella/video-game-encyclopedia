{"id": 833751, "slug": "the-house-of-whispers", "name": "The House of Whispers", "name_original": "The House of Whispers", "description": "<p><strong>The House of Whispers</strong> is an adventure created for 2-4 characters of level 1-3. This adventure \u00a0is campaign setting neutral and can easily take place in any fantasy \u00a0world. The total potential number of experience points to be awarded by \u00a0this adventure are: 650 XP P\r\n<strong>What's going on?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>An abandoned boarding house echoes with dark murmurs and faint \u00a0whispers. The last five families to own this building have all \u00a0mysteriously vanished or abandoned it in the night.\r\n</p>\n<p>Locals speak of the House of Whispers in hushed tones, seeming to \u00a0fear its influence even from afar. The few who have visited tell of \u00a0fleeting voices in the night. Most assume it is haunted by specters of \u00a0the former owners, or that the ground itself is cursed.\r\n</p>\n<p>The true cause of the disturbances is much more horrifying. Malcolm \u00a0Dowell, the eccentric architect of the building, had built himself a \u00a0secret room to use as a sacrificial chamber and place of worship to the \u00a0Immutable One, the Singing Darkness, the Shapeless Transmuter; it is an \u00a0ancient evil that lingers on the edge of existence.\r\n</p>\n<p>During one of Malcolm\u2019s profane services, he managed to call forth an \u00a0aberration, a Gibbering Mouther, which he began to feed. Unfortunate \u00a0boarders who are now merged with their host, their unsettling voices \u00a0murmuring along with the Mouther of chaos and evils past. Eventually, \u00a0Malcolm was overcome with madness by the incessant gibbering and fell \u00a0victim to the monstrosity, his own voice joining with the scores of \u00a0others.\r\n</p>\n<p>That was twenty years ago, and since then the boarding house has been \u00a0left mostly abandoned. Investors, adventurers, and large families have \u00a0all moved in over the years, trying to make something of a seemingly \u00a0cheap investment, and none have lasted longer than a few months.\r\n</p>\n<p>The aberration is too large to escape from the room it has called \u00a0home, but its chaotic whisperings can be heard through the vents and \u00a0pipes when the house falls quiet, often at night, and the inhabitants \u00a0are slowly driven insane or flee.\r\n</p>\n<p>DM Note: This adventure relies on atmosphere and ratcheting terror. \u00a0There is a single monster to be slain but moving throughout the home \u00a0should feel like the house itself is against them. Warning: A Gibbering \u00a0Mouther can outright kill a 1st level character in a single hit.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>What's included?</strong>\n<strong>Maps.</strong> Two areas mapped and ready for your VTT of choice.\r\nGrid, No Grid, and Notated options of all maps.\r\n<strong>Monsters.</strong> The Voice, a trap-like effect used by the Gibbering Mouther throughout \u00a0the House. As well as the stat block for the Gibbering Mouther.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Adventure.</strong> Easy to follow Adventure that works as a one-shot or fits nicely into an ongoing campaign.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T07:58:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f73/f73e4597cbed2c391c9392fa3530d3b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dungeon Rogues"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
