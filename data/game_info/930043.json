[MOVEMENT DEMO]\r\n<p>Current Movement Demo for VICULUS.</p>\n<p>Full Game and PROPER demo with actual levels\u00a0available on Steam soon.</p>\n\n<p>- Wallrun by jumping onto a wall and holding forward + directional key if wanted.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Slide by holding left control.</p>\n<p>- Dash with left shift.</p>\n<p>- Change Sensitivity at the [MACHINE] with A and D. (Mouse currently does not work.)</p>\n\r\nBUGS: OF COURSE A LOT. (DONT TELL US THESE)\r\n<p>-Animations for the guns are wonky and sometimes not timed correctly.</p>\n<p>-Switching guns on the go while still shooting might have gun behaviour on different gun model.</p>\n<p>-No, any kind of \"Super Jump Glitch\" is not a bug. Any movement related things that are -POSSIBLE- are intended for use. (This does not include boundry breaking movement bugs. Report those.)</p>\n<p>-UI may be out of place dependent on your resolution. (1920x1080 is the default.)</p>\n<p>-No, the animated model at the top of the starting building does not do anything. Just for testing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Do NOT shoot the bleeding test ball with the card equipped. This breaks all guns. (Health script is not applied to player in this build.)</p>\n<p>-Settings dont save. Will be implemented on proper demo.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T14:56:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9df/9df85d8f85f9789e78ca3b866a6e2c35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["YaBoyCJ"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
