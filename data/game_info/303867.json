Well, it's officially known as Planet 564, but we all refer to it as Senopia, as named by the scientists who first discovered it. Most of us still miss Earth, but as we all know, there was nothing left for us there. It was an empty husk when we left. I try to remember it like it was in the documentaries of old, but I mostly just remember the toxic air and barren land.<br/>Today is a day of celebration, but it's one of the busiest days of the year for us. The Codex Realm gets extra traffic on this day as people love to throw crazy parties that are not physically possible in the real world. My job is to make sure that everyone is safe and there are no misdemeanours, in both the real and digital worlds.<br/>Ever since my demotion, my job has been a lot more challenging. There are some weird things happening in the Realm, but no one wants to hear about it. I keep on being told that it\u2019s being worked on, but nothing ever changes. My job has always been to see to the safety of the South African inhabitants and I'm not about to let glitches and a demotion get in the way of that.<br/>I should check with Thato. He understands the Codex Realm better than anyone so he may know what\u2019s going on. Also, he owes me.<br/>Recorded by JM at 08:25:14\r\n<p>You're a Codex Knight, an officer charged with protecting both the real world and the Codex Realm. The Codex Realm, created by the tech billionaire Thato Dlamini, is a miracle of science and artificial intelligence. It uses highly advanced algorithms to generate virtual worlds based on the vast library of human literature accumulated over many years. The inhabitants of the colony are given access to this Codex Realm via a VR headset and advanced neural connection hardware. Inhabitants use the Codex Realm to learn, discover and play. However, like all digital spaces, rules and regulations need to be enforced. Your duty is to enforce the law and to protect the inhabitants from the dangers of both the real and digital worlds.</p>\r\nCharacters:\r\n<ul><li>Jiara Maverick:<ul><li>A Codex Knight working on SA Colony 1-5.
