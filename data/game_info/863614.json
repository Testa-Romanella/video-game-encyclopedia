Blobbbert is exploring the Temporal Temple of Traversal but the mysterious labyrinth is causing him to freeze for 10 seconds to plan out his moves...when he then moves all at once!<br/>Give him orders to reach the goal!<br/>Right now only 3 levels are in the game, but this will most likely be expanded on.</p>\n<p>This is my FIRST 'complete' game I have finished from start to end and it is very special to me. It may not be the best, but for 48 hours I\u00a0am super proud of it &lt;3</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T22:32:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b27/b27c3c1aeb62689699b0ffb50f0290ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["xorelly"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
