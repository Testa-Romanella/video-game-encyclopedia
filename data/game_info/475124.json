It contains seven gamemodes, four singleplayer (Classic, Alternate, Endurance and Lightup) and the rest two-player (Endurance Duel, Lightup Co-op and Freefall). Player skins are available for the singleplayer modes.</p><p>Also available is an early prototype of Flap Flap: Cyberflight Supreme, known as Flap Flap Alpha 4, dating back to the 20th of December, 2014. Please note that the multiplayer mode in this alpha may cause the game to crash.<br/></p>\r\nGo for the high score\r\n<ul><li>In Classic and Alternate, your goal is to 'ascend' after passing 50 pipes. Classic records where you are in the level, but also your number of attempts, and that in turn affects your final score. Alternate switches this out for collectables and super speed, available by pressing Shift.</li><li>In Endurance modes, time gets faster with each pipe passed. Last for as long as you can.</li><li>In Lightup modes, there are 80 unlit tiles and it's your job to light them all to get a best time.</li><li>In Freefall, you and your companion are racing to get to the bottom of a random gauntlet and try to get a best time.</li></ul>\n<p>Flap Flap: Cyberflight Supreme was created by me, Jack5, with additional artwork provided by TAT3XD, mb16art and nayth1999.
