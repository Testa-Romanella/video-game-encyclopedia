Experience multiple levels and game modes to bring peace or chaos, in (up to) 24 player online battles.<br/><br/>Choose Warriors destined to decide the future of Japan: The Kenshi (Swordsman), Naginatashi (Pikeman), Ninja (Assassin) or Ite (Archer). All featuring their own style of combat, movement and weaponry.<br/><br/>Master Combat through discovery of different attacks, abilities and combos. Our combat system features multiple offensive stances driven by your movement, defensive techniques (such as the grappling hook) and abilities (ranging from acrobatic combos to multi-enemy sweeps to fire arrows).<br/><br/><br/><strong>What kind of gameplay is this game offering? </strong><br/>We plan to offer a multiplayer experience with several modes of gameplay taking familiar elements and expanding them to fit the game's backstory and to introduce fun and engaging new experiences. Combat is based on your movement direction and supplemented by abilities ranging from strong stunning dashes, to multi-hit combos and Master level abilities.<br/><br/><strong>Any customization for the different character classes? </strong><br/>We are planning on adding some customization to the characters &amp; weapons. Like all things this will be determined by effort needed/budget. We will likely add weapon skins before characters since our content team is limited.<br/><br/><strong>Will the game have any single-player gameplay?</strong> <br/>No this version won\u2019t have any single player gameplay going on. That does not mean we don\u2019t have plans for any just not for this title. The tutorial is single-player and you can play any map with/against AI.<br/><br/><strong>Are you planning on bringing the game to other platforms? </strong><br/>Other systems is something we would like to strive for. If we can do it, what other systems we would go onto are still \"up in the air\" questions. Our first and foremost goal is making this game the best it can be for Steam. <br/><br/><strong>What languages will this game be in? </strong><br/>Well English first and foremost but we plan to do at least 3-4 others. In fact we put out a survey to collect answers from you as to what language do you play your games in which you can fill out at language.hanakogame.com <br/><strong>Where can I get more information about the game? </strong><br/>We always welcome feedback/questions. If you post them, we will answer as promptly as possible.
