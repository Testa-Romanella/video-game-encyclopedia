The theme was \"Rules Mean Nothing\" and the game was supposed to about breaking the rules inside a void owned by an omnipresent being in order to get out of the void with power ups each time a rule was broken. Needless to say, not everything came to be in 48 hours (including levels I've designed), but I hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T07:26:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/674/6749d2c925929b69ba03228d34b0209a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ethan Cossio"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
