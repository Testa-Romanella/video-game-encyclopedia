Be careful not to get hit, you've only got four lives!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Doggy might also try switching up their music and dances, so watch out! Don't worry though, Doggy can only dance for so long before they tire themselves out. Try to outlast them!</p>\n<p>If you're feeling extra skilled you can get close to Doggy's head for bonus points. This will tire out Doggy quicker,\u00a0 also make Doggy dance faster!</p>\n<p>----------------<br/></p>\n<p>CONTROLS:<br/></p>\n<p>W &amp; D\u00a0 / Arrow\u00a0Keys - Move</p>\n<p>A / Space - Jump</p>\n<p>----------------</p>\n<p>This project was originally made as an individual school programming assignment, however I continued working on it afterwards in order to make it a more complete experience.\u00a0I hope you enjoy :D<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T08:48:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b94/b94e6a472e2db43bff97cc1872177c0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["joel_b_dev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
