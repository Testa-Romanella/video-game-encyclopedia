A game where you fight never ending evil, and defend your town! There is a tutorial level in the game, so no reason to explain controls here. You can also change the controls in the options, to your liking. What you do in this game, is you run around, and kill the never ending slew of monsters that are trying to eat you. You can buy weapons and ammo from shops, so you can easily defeat more monsters! More and more is being added to the game, so keep an eye out! There is no real goal of the game. The only goal... Get to level 100, screenshot it, and put it somewhere people can see it. Send me an email at gandalf1209@techpandainc.com if you achieve this goal! Feel free to donate for the game! It would help a lot!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d4/4d482a77faeb86dadbe835de73e8691c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gandalf1209"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
