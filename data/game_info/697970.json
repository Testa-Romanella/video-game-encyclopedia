Some of them are friends, are rivals, and everyone wants an adorable beautiful place to call their home. Gather crafting items as you explore the forest.\u00a0Personalize the homes you craft\u00a0by listening your faerie friends!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Hygge Homes is intended to be low-visibility/blind accessible. While our audio team admits there are still things to be designed to be fully accessible, we did the best we could with the time we had. Please follow our dev log as we continue this journey, and thank you for any and all feedback.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The game is played entirely with a mouse. Click on characters to speak with them, and click on objects to collect them. Use move and rotate buttons in the crafting menu to assemble items and create furniture for characters.</strong></p>\n\r\nRay Soyama\u00a0\u274b\u00a0Systems Programmer, Tech\u00a0Art\u00a0\u274b @RaySoyama\r\nBoaz Havron\u00a0\u274b Game Designer \u274b @HavronBoaz\r\nMilo Moore\u00a0\u274b Art lead \u274b\u00a0@extyrannomon\r\nNick Fewkes \u274b 3D Environment Art \u274b NoodelyClam\r\nTravis F\u00a0\u274b Rigging, Animating \u274b @travispfisk\r\nMegan Frazier \u274b Audio Lead \u274b @OnAccidentSound\r\nMichael Fewkes\u00a0\u274b Audio Programmer \u274b\u00a0@mdfewkes\r\nDan Christian\u00a0\u274b Sound Designer \u274b @SoundFontPlus\r\nPatrick Allred\u00a0\u274b Sound Designer\u00a0\u274b\u00a0@pantzmcgee\r\nNicole Yazmin\u00a0\u274b Composer \u274b nicoleyazmin.com", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T05:38:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8a/e8afd3a5e633be471c898e178a1c80f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LazerBlimp", "mdfewkes", "exty", "CodexNinja"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
