He enjoys grazing on the fresh greens in his backyard, spits when he gets upset and\u00a0<em>hates</em> when people confuse him for a llama.</p>\n<p>But Cino isn't just any ordinary alpaca. With a natural knack for acting, he set out to Hollywood Hills to make his fortune as a renowned movie star. As alpacas aren't exactly well respected among the human acting community though, Cino devised a plan that would allow him to infiltrate the big screen. He created the alias of Al Pacino, a scruffy Italian bad boy, and his act was so convincing that it wasn't long before he took the world by storm.</p>\n<p>Now he spends his days relaxing in his lawn chair, occasionally rising to the occasion of a new block buster, and crossing his hooves that the FBI don't find out about his woolly secret.</p>\n<p>###########################################################</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS - THE TEAM</strong></p>\n<p>Leith Ben Abdessalem --\u00a0Code, Visual Effects.</p>\n<p>https://leithba.itch.io/\u00a0or\u00a0leith.benabdessalem@ue-germany.de</p>\n<p>Carlo di Paolo --\u00a0Animation, Art.</p>\n<p>https://carlo-di-paolo.itch.io\u00a0or\u00a0carlo.dipaolo@ue-germany.de</p>\n<p>Naomi Seeling --\u00a0Code, Dialogue, Level Design.</p>\n<p>https://naomihcm.itch.io/\u00a0or\u00a0naomi.seeling@ue-germany.de</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS - UNIVERSITY OF APPLIED SCIENCES EUROPE</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This game was created at the\u00a0Game Design // UE\u00a0Department of the\u00a0University of Applied Sciences Europe.</p>\n<p>Supervised by: Prof. Sebastian Stamm.</p>\n<p>The \"Super H\u00fcmor Show\" (WinterSemester2018/2019).</p>\n\n<p><strong>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</strong><br/></p>\n<p>All Rights Reserved.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8db/8db79ad951cf3030cc7d8afa743e871a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["naomi", "LeithBA"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
