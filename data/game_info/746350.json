But there's a catch. You don't know how many keys you need to win and if you finish the game with not enough keys you will loose. The difficult part is to find the keys because they are hidden in a way that you need to do certain actions to unlock the keys.<br/></p>\n<p>Programmer: @denesterek<br/></p>\n<p>3D-Artist: @leomartin.zh</p>\n<p>Music made with Bandlab</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T06:31:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b67/b677cc114c8a1513554f1088481d9b33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["denesterek", "leomartin.zh"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Fighting", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
