A man must make all of his deliveries through the deer filled dark local woods on time or get fired. With his car in the shop, he must make all his deliveries in his boss\u2019 car and better not leave a scratch on it. All this stress combined with sleep loss causes deer themed horror elements to appear all throughout the town, or maybe those visuals are real? With no time to spare, he must complete his deliveries and get home for some much needed sleep as soon as possible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T12:08:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54d/54d31550ca480692141566434fb53970.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["halmual1"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
