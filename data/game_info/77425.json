This is not a game. You are controlling flying RC models that reacts like real flying models. It takes some time to learn, and again, do not expect \"arcade\" style controls. <br/>2. The onscreen control sticks are just indicators! They are made small so they do not obscure the screen. <br/><br/>*** You do not need to keep your fingers on them *** <br/><br/>Sliding your finger anywhere on the right screen half affects the right control stick , the same for the left screen part - sliding finger there moves the left control stick. <br/><br/>We suggest selecting beginner settings at first few days before you can comfortably progress further.<br/>3. iPad 1 users should not purchase extra landscapes, due to lack of memory. Getting extra planes is OK.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T05:46:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/049/049a89bc58e689381f5e2d2f587144cf.jpg", "website": "http://happybytesapps.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Happy Bytes"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Happy Bytes"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
