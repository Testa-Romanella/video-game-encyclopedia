{"id": 419488, "slug": "test-of-time", "name": "Test of Time", "name_original": "Test of Time", "description": "<p>This is a multiplayer strategy game (2-4 players) that is inspired by games like Civ 5. The mechanics work quite differently if you've played that game but you will see the similarities. This was developed by one person\u00a0and took a few months to make. I would like to thank Alex Shep for providing me with the tileset for this game, I think he did an amazing job. Thanks also to\u00a0http://toppocketmedia.com/\u00a0for designing the logo.</p>\n<p>HOW TO JOIN/HOST A GAME:</p>\n<p>This game requires either a LAN connection or you can use some 3rd party software like hamachi to play. There are some bugs with multiplayer, mainly occasional desyncs with more than 2 people, but it should be stable enough to play. After a host has started the game THEY MUST NOT PRESS NEXT TURN. Turn 1 is officially the start of the game and players cannot join after that point.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If the host loses all of his cities\u00a0in game then the game cannot continue for anyone. Sorry.</p>\n<p>Clients may leave the game after it has begun but the host must not close</p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY:</p>\n<p>Select hex: LMB</p>\n<p>Move units: Press and hold RMB</p>\n<p>Pan map: WASD or\u00a0drag MMB</p>\n<p>Science tree: o</p>\n<p>Trade menu: t</p>\n<p>Tile yields: y</p>\n<p>Attack: Move onto an enemy unit or city</p>\n<p>Worker hotkeys: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5</p>\n<p>You start with a settler and a scout.\u00a0The settler can settle a city (middle bottom box). You can enter the city to produce buildings and units that you research.\u00a0 Every turn resources from the terrain are added to your stockpile. Connect two or more cities with roads to connect their stockpiles, so both cities have access to the same resources.</p>\n<p>Workers improve tiles by making farms, trading posts or\u00a0quarries. The latter can only be made on hills and the others only on flat ground.\u00a0They all take 3 turns to build, you have to press the button each turn to progress it a stage.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is advisable to settle on gold tiles to get a good start to the game, and have at least one city on science tiles for the middle game.</p>\n<p>There are 2 ways to officially win: Get the last tech first or build the \"Wonder\". You can also eliminate players from the game by taking their cities but that does not by itself win you the game.</p>\n<p>Cheat codes (F1 in main menu):</p>\n<p>threshold frequency - all techs</p>\n<p>fly you fools - 100 movement</p>\n<p>bang and the dirt is gone - free nuke in city</p>\n<p>gimme gimme gimme - 100 of each discovered resource</p>\n<p>i'm walking on sunshine\u00a0- 999 morale</p>\n<p>in the kingdom of the blind the one eyed man is king - reveal map<br/></p>\n<p>i grow my own vegetables - pop up in all cities</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-16T02:36:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ace/acef88f3d98256445b9acc5aff64c7fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["scunter"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
