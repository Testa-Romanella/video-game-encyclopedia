The purpose of the exercise was to build a game with 3 levels of increasing difficulty, where the player controls an object using physics forces to get past obstacles. With this game, I wanted to frustrate the player using the physics-based controls and somewhat difficult obstacles. Once you learn the controls and movement though, it's relatively alright difficulty-wise. The obstacles being bouncy balls being shot at the player and the paths required to jump around from platform to platform. One of the main mechanics is to jump on bounce pads, which have differing strengths but will aid the player in completing the level if jumped on correctly and at the right angle.\u00a0 I also wanted to learn more about Unity while making this relatively simple project, so I learned how to do VFX and use the visual effects graph.</p>\n<p><strong>Story:<br/></strong>After the events of\u00a0The Journey, RB couldn't bear to kill his clone RB2, so he left him, and went to hone and control his powers. One year passes. RB2 has become incredibly strong and tyrannically rules over the Fizikz dimension. It's up to RB to save the dimension and finally put an end to RB2. It won't be easy, as the Dominoes don't want to get knocked down anymore and so they become stronger and attain their new form, Domin-O's. This form allows them to compress and turn into a ball that can knock down anyone else. The journey for RB isn't devoid of hope however. The orange jump pads have come to aid RB to getting past and defeating his enemies. Good luck to RB!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T16:23:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f60/f60a6249db3a87b9a753b5102850fa25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Taneim"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
