It is more accessible and user friendly. Give it a try and let us know what you think.</p>\n<p>Hokan: Monster Slayer is a\u00a0 first person shooter (FPS) monster arena with elements of action and stealth, currently in Alpha. The goal in this demo is to survive and help a small town from rampaging monsters. Buy elixirs, find weapons, and exercise your monster slaying.</p>\n<p>You will need to use your stealth skills to create distractions, perform critical damage, and remain undetected for when the situation gets out of hand. The monsters are strong, fast, and very perceptive. You can buy elixirs to increment your skills but at the end, it will be your wits that keep you alive. Our hero's patience and observation will be put to the test.</p>\n<p>And some monsters increase their strength at night, so watch out.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>F1 - Ingame controls menu</li><li>WASD - Movement, double tap for dodge once unlocked</li><li>Mouse - Look around</li><li>E - Pickup items</li><li>V - Drop weapon (only secondary weapons)</li><li>X - Change arrow type</li><li>Q - Mines</li><li>Mouse Right Click - Fire</li><li>Mouse Left Click - Zoom</li><li>Shift - Sprint</li><li>Space - Jump</li><li>Mouse Wheel - Change weapons</li><li>1 - 5 - Select weapons</li><li>TAB - Last weapon switch</li><li>C - Crouch</li></ul>\n<p><strong>How to Play<br/></strong></p>\n<p>In the current demo mode (Alpha V2), we have an arcade style gameplay where the objective is to kill all the monsters in the level, if you get to reach the end or not, you will get your score based on monsters killed, accuracy, and critical hits performed.<br/></p>\n<p>Be always alert and plan your moves, monsters are though and very perceptive on higher difficulties.</p>\n<p>There's a tutorial on the first level that is enabled by default. It will explain the basics and give you hints. Enjoy.</p>\n<p><strong>Hints<br/></strong>This is based on feedback obtained from some players. We will do our best to flesh out these ideas within the game with time.</p>\n<p>- Monster can detect flying arrows in their LineOfSight, so if they are able to detect it, be sure to move to another position.</p>\n<p>- Monster will come to investigate where they were shot from, so it is safer to have a place to hide.</p>\n<p>- Houses have spots to hide, but they are not\u00a0 a 100% sure thing, if the monster is too close to you, they will see you. The same is when hiding in  bushes.</p>\n<p>- If you get surrounded and want to move, be sure to check all around you, a monster might see you and alert others.<br/></p>\n<p>- There is nothing wrong with playing this game slowly. It is actually safer.</p>\n<p><strong>Development RoadMap<br/></strong></p>\n<p>- More to come...<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Feedback<br/></strong>Continued development will use feedback obtained by gamers. So please let us know what you think.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32c/32ccfdc4b8048cad85e7fbfde25e13fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 276, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HokanMonsterSlayer"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
