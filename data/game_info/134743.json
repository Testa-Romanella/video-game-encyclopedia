Needs keyboard and a mouse.\u00a0Arrow keys to move and strafe, mouse to aim and shoot. Keys 1 to 8 to select a different weapon. 0 to hide it. SPACEBAR to jump. SHIFT to run.\u00a0C to crouch. ESC to open game menu.\u00a0Weapon 1 is an unlimited blaster. Some weapons such as sniper rifle and small machine gun have a secondary mode if you right click.</p>\n<p>Installation: Open the ZIP file and drag the galactic123 folder to your desktop or place of choice (don't place it too deep into folders and subfolders, might experience a files not found type of bug). Double click galactic123 app file.</p>\n<p>Game was created with FPS Creator, a very outdated engine. Any bugs present in the game are probably the same type of bugs present in other FPS Creator games. There is a game manual file included, both explaining how to play and any troubleshooting help.\u00a0Did my best to optimize as much as I could. This is an old project that I never released, but now I'm sharing it with the world totally free. Requires DirectX 9 (details in manual) even if you have a newer version (both can coexist at the same time, though).</p>\n<p>Tips: Save often while playing. During game press ESC to do it. Some pickups that look like pads will also autosave for you.</p>\n<p>Credits: A.P., the FPSC Team, and OpenGameArt.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3e/d3ea75028ac55926cbdb45d578cfd175.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["galactic123"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
