The notoriously cursed woods. The first evening was fun, you and your friends hung around drinking until everyone went to sleep in their sleeping bags.<br/><br/>It\u2019s 4 AM, and you wake up to the screams of one of your friends. The camping place has been ravaged by something. Traces of the monster are ever present in the form of destruction, intimidating howls.<br/>You try to look around to see where your friends are, but it\u2019s too dark to see properly. <em><br/><br/>You </em><em>are going to have to rely on your other senses if you want to get out of these woods alive.</em><br/>But you\u2019re not the only one. While you rely on your limited vision and hearing, the monster relies on its own senses. Your body movements will attract the attention of the monster if they get too loud. <br/><br/>You can explore, but you can\u2019t hide. Figure out what is happening in the woods before it\u2019s too late to get out\u2026<br/><br/><br/>This experience was created for the Fashion, Research &amp; Technology department of the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (AUAS).<br/><br/>Created by team <em>Under Pressure</em> from the Virtual Reality minor semester 1 2022, which ran from September 1, 2022 to January 26th 2023.<br/>Under Pressure consists of Daan, Fira, Noa, Kevin, Lawrence &amp; Tamira.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T12:47:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba4/ba48af9eb431e009bc386055ba10cf8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Under Pressure"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
