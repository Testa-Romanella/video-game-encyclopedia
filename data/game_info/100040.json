You are responsible for the diminishing space, but there\u2019s a risk/reward factor: as the surface becomes more barren, survival becomes more difficult.</p>\n<p>The game will save your score across planets until you fail, so try to make it as long as you can! Each planet will be a bit more difficult than the last, and your score is determined by how quickly you destroy them.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m really looking forward to playing everyone else\u2019s games and to getting some feedback on Emissary. Thank you for checking it out.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07f/07f545be02563e85f5f98e32f212dda6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Handle"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
