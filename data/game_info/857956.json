Randomly chosen targets will activate and deactivate after a short time. Shoot them to score! Make sure to reload often, as you only get 8 bullets per magazine. Hitting a target will earn you one bullet back in reserve. More targets will pop out for a shorter period of time as the minute progresses.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T07:56:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a0/5a0dd6c9f634620f544fe12f3b0829ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dizzi68"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
