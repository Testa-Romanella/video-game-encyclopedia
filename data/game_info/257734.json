{"id": 257734, "slug": "war-dice", "name": "War Dice", "name_original": "War Dice", "description": "War Dice simulates the rolling of multiple dice. It is particularly focused on Warhammer and throwing a lot of dice. The app shows the number of ones, twos, threes etc that were rolled. However, it can also be used for games with only a few dice such as Yahtzee.<br/><br/>Any number of dice can be rolled, for example 2, 27, 130, 1000.<br/><br/>The six dice appear to roll while the results are calculated. <br/><br/>Tap any of the dice to 'keep' that and all higher-numbered dice. War Dice then shows the number of dice that fail and the number of dice that succeed.<br/>Tapping the success or fail value copies it into the number of dice field ready for the next roll.<br/><br/>Each player could use the app on their own iPhone or iPod Touch or they could share one iDevice. Using a dice roller ensures there's no skill in rolling.<br/><br/>There is a configurable minimum delay between rolls. The default is 5 seconds but this can be changed to anywhere between one and ten seconds.<br/><br/>Tested on iOS7 - iOS9.<br/><br/><br/>5 stars- It works well, keeps it simple and doesn't try to add extra fluff. Nice app!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:56:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7b/c7b32f47b034f178916de691f3ab5acf.jpg", "website": "http://members.optusnet.com.au/godfreysoft/WarDice", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Godfrey Raftesath"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Godfrey Raftesath"], "esrb_rating": null}
