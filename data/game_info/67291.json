I first started off with Clash Of Clans and wondered if there was anything as similar to this and found Game Of War. It&#39;s easy to get started with and addictive.\u201d<br />\n5/5 \u201cThis is the best MMO and game ever. I have played other MMO games but this is the best one yet! You can battle other players and collect resources and build really cool buildings. If I had to rate this game it would be 10 stars. But, there is no 10 star rating.\u201d<br />\n5/5 \u201cBest real-time Strategy game I have ever played!\u201d<br />\n5/5 \u201cIf you like games like Boom Beach, Clash of Clans or Mario I think you&#39;ll like this one!\u201d<br />\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.gameofwarapp.com/privacy-policy?lang=en<br />\nTerms of Service: https://www.gameofwarapp.com/terms-of-use<br />\nGame Page: http://www.gameofwarapp.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-09T02:31:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d7/9d7edab7a638a08296495586fe4cc21c_hrCmnLp.jpg", "website": "http://www.gameofwarapp.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 257, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Machine Zone"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Addmired"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
