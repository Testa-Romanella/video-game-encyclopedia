{"id": 724527, "slug": "project-forge", "name": "Project Forge", "name_original": "Project Forge", "description": "<p><strong>Project Forge</strong>\u00a0is a board-builder roguelike that combines the mechanics of a card game and a board game. In a deck, every card has a direction it will take you towards, so you\u00a0must arrange these cards to create interconnected pathways that will deal damage to your enemies.<br/></p>\n<p>The objective of the game is to descend to the bottom level of the dungeon and defeat the final boss. You may do so by any means necessary, such as skipping every stage\u00a0or using the game's logic to destroy all who stand\u00a0in your path. <strong>The dungeon is your oyster!</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nPrototype\r\n<p>This prototype is a quick mockup made for testing the concept of a game out. I will go into full development a couple of months from now using the feedback gotten from this, so make sure to comment with any criticism/ideas that\u00a0you have!</p>\n<p>I might release small updates from time to time to test different things out, so make sure to\u00a0check out my Twitter page for development news!</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>The game uses\u00a0<strong>Arrow Keys</strong>, <strong>Z</strong>, <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Shift</strong> in various ways depending on the current screen, so what each button does is labeled in-game.</p>\n<p><strong>Control</strong> will speed up the game while <strong>R</strong> will reset it. These are debug controls left in the game\u00a0for ease of use.</p>\n<p>Screen-wise, you can use <strong>S</strong> to alternate between two screen sizes and <strong>F</strong> to switch fullscreen on or off.</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>SFX are from 8-Bit SFX Pack by Beep Yeah!\u00a0Everything else was made by me. If you're still reading this, thank you! Did you know you can use Spacebar to switch between color palettes in-game?</p>\n<p>If you want to stream the OST, you can do so through my Soundcloud!</p>\r\n\u00a0\r\nGlossary (<em>Skip this for now</em>)\r\n\r\n<p>Since I made this prototype\u00a0as a way to test an idea rather than to be able to stand on its own, there are a lot of unexplained variables within the game, so I'll proceed to explain some of them\u00a0here. I'd recommend playing the game first and then come back here if you have any questions.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\nDirections\r\n<strong>Single</strong>Moves the actor one space in the direction it is pointing towards.<strong>Double</strong>Moves the actor two spaces in the direction it is pointing towards.<strong>Choice</strong>Any symbol with more than one arrow will allow the actor to choose between the directions shown.<strong>Repeat</strong>Repeats the last movement the actor performed.<strong>Return</strong>Returns the actor to the previous card they were at.<strong>Stop</strong>Does not move the actor. Think about it like skipping in place.<strong>Random</strong>Only appears in choice cards. Any card bearing this symbol will pick one of the directions at random.\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nEffects\r\n\n<br/><strong>Damage</strong>Subtracts health from the enemy.<br/><strong>Health</strong>Recover/lose health oneself.<br/><strong>Burn</strong>When using a card, it exhausts all of its uses, destroying it.<br/><strong>Freeze</strong>It prevents a card from being destroyed, leaving it with 1 use.\u00a0<br/><strong>Venom</strong>Actor loses 1 HP every time they use\u00a0a card.<br/><strong>Shield</strong>Subtracts this value from every attack an actor receives. Does not block traps or venom.<br/><strong>Trap</strong>Traps 1 card per row from the bottom upwards. Using a trapped card will lose the actor 2 HP.<br/><strong>Parry</strong>When attacked, returns all damage back to the sender. Parried attacks cannot be parried*. Does not block traps or venom.<br/><em>* I'll fix this eventually I promise</em><em>.</em><br/><strong>Weak</strong>Every attack an actor makes will have this value subtracted from it. Then, it will decrease by 1.<br/><strong>Strength</strong>Every attack an actor makes will have this value added to it. Then, it will decrease by 1.<br/><strong>Shock</strong>Going out of bounds* will lose the actor\u00a02 additional HP.\u00a0 This can only happen\u00a0once per turn.<br/><em>* Due to limitations, only the sides display rays. However, this effect is applied to all sides.</em>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nInnate Moves\r\n\r\n<p>Going out of bounds will take the actor back to the board and\u00a0lose them 1 HP.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nAreas and Enemies\r\n<strong>Backstage Colosseum</strong>Flyhead<br/>Woman<br/>Cataract<strong>Yorkshire Mills</strong>Allen<br/>Ballerina<br/>Toasty<br/>Knack<br/>Sophie<strong>Los\u00a0Santos Chapel</strong>Lillie<br/>Venus<br/>Queen<br/>Hedgey<br/>Syndicate<strong>Downtown Abismos</strong>Samson<br/>Lactus<br/>Zozo<br/>Child<br/>Skully<strong>The Throne</strong>Corey\r\n<p>Without counting The Throne and Backstage Colosseum, you will encounter only two of these rooms at a time. It's worth replaying the game at least once to see the area and enemies that you have missed!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nMeta-Info\r\n<ul><li>Forges crop up on the <strong>2nd</strong>, <strong>4th</strong>, and <strong>7th</strong> floor. It's worth skipping enemies if it means making it to the next forge.</li><li>The <strong>Offset</strong> button on the inventory screen will shift your board downwards. You can use this to simulate how your board will look like in battles.</li><li>While on the map, enemies will start chasing if you get too close to them. Every turn, they alternate between prioritizing horizontal and vertical movement.</li><li>I left a debug super-weapon at the bottom of the inventory just in case you want to give the game an overall view without worrying about losing!</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nKnown Bugs\r\n<p>Right now the only bug I know of\u00a0is that if you walk from a crate on top of a half-platform onto a crate that's on a full platform below the player will float half a block above the ground. Since it's non-intrusive I made the choice to release the game with it. If you have any bugs you'd like to report post it in the comments or DM over on Twitter,\u00a0ideas and banter are fine also!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T07:14:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/535/535e9741cd00ad5783127e4f248a43fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ThanielPIN"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
