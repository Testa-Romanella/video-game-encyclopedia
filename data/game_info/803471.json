Not everything is at it appears, and only you can seek out the truth in this story-centric RPG! <br/></p>\n\n<p>This game technically started back in RPGM-2000. All I really had back then was a nebulous idea about having characters learn skills by visiting various people in the game. Kinda like the master system in <em>Breath of Fire 3 </em>or <em>Breath of Fire 4</em>. I tried to implement it, but I didn't have that integral piece of RPG's called \"a story\".</p>\n<p>I started getting ideas for this game again after my first play-through of <em>Shin Megami Tensai - Persona 4</em>. I even had a completed project that I was mostly happy with. However, I started visiting this site, and thought that the project could use an overhaul. Not a complete start-from-scratch overhaul, but an overhaul all the same. <br/>This game is the end result of that overhaul.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T16:00:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/56e/56e1082896209ead4d749a904d697db4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MarrendReikan"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
