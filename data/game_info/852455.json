Welcome to the page of my game. This is a small indie game I've worked on in my free time. The gameplay is simple. You destroy enemies and get points while collecting cool PowerUps! How much can you get? Is there anything special that will happen once you reach a specific number? Oh, and do not forget to invite your friends over! You can play this game together with them! You will have the option in the MainMenu. If you have already chosen SinglePlayer, do not fear, the \"P\" is here! Get your snacks and drinks and let's begin!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T20:35:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26d/26d3a071a32e3934b8a09fa871442112.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Potatoanechips"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
