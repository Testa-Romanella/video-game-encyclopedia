Gather souls &amp; build a strong enough defense to clear all 6 graveyards to win.  haunTD was designed with new and experienced Tower Defense fans in mind.  Clearing a successful run takes approximately 25 minutes with about 8-12 hours of total gameplay.  haunTD is currently single-player, but with framework and plans in place for 4-8 cooperative multiplayer in the works.<br/><br/><strong>Gameplay Mechanics:</strong><br/>haunTD is a Tower Defense game at heart with physics and fast-paced roguelite progression elements.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Visit 6 graveyards and defend them</strong> from 7 waves of enemies and bosses to progress through the run. Graveyards appear in a random order, with different (procedurally generated) layouts of obstacles and artifacts available each time calling for different tactics to emerge victorious.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Physics-enhanced Combat</strong>:  A departure from the typical stun-and-damage em' TD formulas of old, you can defeat enemies in the usual way or by knocking them far up into the sky or water/acid/void below.  As enemies accumulate more damage, they are easier to home-run.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>30+ unique unlockable items</strong>: Combine different artfacts you find to create powerful contraptions with unique, synergized effects.  Defeating enemies and using Dark Altars gives you more souls &amp; allows you to unlock more powerful towers and artifacts.  Collecting dozens of artifacts with unique effects will help your defenses withstand the increasingly difficult waves.<br/><br/><br/>Achieve victory through <strong>supernatural </strong>tower defense tactics and a bit of luck!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T03:56:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e4/1e4553a5761fe4a84f5a865de4e99612.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 267, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BOOMERANG", "GhostLevelGames"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["GhostLevelGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
