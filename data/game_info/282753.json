Buddy runs off after telling Jamie to meet him in the VIP area later.</p>\n<p>The problem is, he forgot to tell them the password to get in!<br/>Thus, Jamie must overcome their fears and talk to other people.</p>\n<p>Try to hold (somewhat) normal conversations by using phrases you hear others say in your quest for VIP access.<br/></p>\n<p>This was our last student project at FutureGames in Stockholm. It took five weeks to complete and we were 10 people in the team.</p>\n<p>The game is played with a mouse. Click to walk or interact.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d96/d96d1527eb74772a0dbf18bc1820b80c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daniel Sandin", "Aksel Englund", "Linus Thorelli", "LucasV", "Lawrie", "Franzaine"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
