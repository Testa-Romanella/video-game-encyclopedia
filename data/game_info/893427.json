{"id": 893427, "slug": "quantattack", "name": "QuantAttack", "name_original": "QuantAttack", "description": "<p>QuantAttack is a match-2 type action puzzle game. Blocks are cleared by lining up two blocks of the same type vertically. While the basic rules are this simple, QuantAttack introduces a fresh twist on block-clearing puzzlers. Some blocks are unique, and players must discover hidden patterns to clear them. There are more than 40 patterns of such block combinations, and finding and mastering them is the fastest way to improve.</p>\n<p>These secret patterns are based on the rules of quantum mechanics:\u00a0each block is a quantum computer instruction (quantum logic gate), which works exactly like an actual quantum computer instruction. In other words, manipulating blocks in this game is equivalent to quantum computer programming! This article on Wikipedia might help you get a better handle on the blocks.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T07:19:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eea/eea7f7540f2689e29d1b28bf6add7c72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ytakamiya"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
