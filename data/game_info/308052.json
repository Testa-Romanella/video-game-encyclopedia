If your plant's output and the city's power demand are not equal than you run a risk of your plant overheating and causing a nuclear\u00a0tragedy upon the city.\u00a0<br/><br/>You are given brain teaser questions that will raise or lower the power output of your plant (visualized by the horizontal yellow line on the graph). <br/><br/>Once the game begins\u00a0the city's power demands will start rolling in (visualized by the blue dots moving across the graph), if your plant's power output isn't in sync with the city's demand\u00a0when it\u00a0crosses the power transfer point (visualized by the\u00a0vertical yellow line) the core's heat will raise. If the power output and power demand is in\u00a0sync then your core will cool down. If your core gets too hot a meltdown happen and the game is over. <br/><br/>See how long you can last in this brain teaser tense situation!<br/><br/>Feel free to post your timings or thought in the comment section below and thanks for playing!<br/><br/><br/>This game was made in less than a week for Week 90 of the Weekly Game Jam!<br/></p>\n<p>LashGhost Itch<br/></p>\n<p>Art: @LashGhost</p>\n<p>Code:\u00a0@DevinWeidinger</p>\n<p>Audio: Brent\u00a0Miller</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-08T06:41:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e11/e11cdaeccb8ef503d7ac5bb09afbaec5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Devin Weidinger"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
