Follow the button prompts on screen to try and complete the exercise. Press the buttons on your keyboard that correspond to what you see on screen. Be warned, if you make a mistake the demon will allow the gym to take its toll on you, ageing you terribly.</p>\n<p>It's a little sparse, there are no difficulty levels and no tutorial yet. If I were to continue this project I would consider having the demon react pained when you do well (de-aging yourself slightly) and perhaps make facial expressions for the workouts. Originally I had planned on making a body that reacted the correct stimulus but it didn't happen.<br/></p>\n<p>I was aiming for a sort of rhythm style game.</p>\n<p>Have noticed sometimes the prompts go out of sync. Not sure why, didn't have time to fix.</p>\n<p>The game can sometimes generate hard prompts or very long prompts, sorry about that. I didn't get a proper chance to balance it.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Mac and Linux versions are untested.</strong></p>\r\nChange Log<p>General (2022-04-06)\u00a0- Updated page to include link to the Ludum Dare submission page<br/></p>\n<p><strong>v0.0.3c </strong>- Made it so that lunge difficulty can be set any time during the tutorial to save problems during replays where tutorial may be skipped.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>V0.0.3b</strong> - Made it so that missed steps actually age you faster, increased ageing on miss to make it more threatening.</p>\n<p><strong>V0.0.3</strong> - Fixed bug with de-ageing on successful steps.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T20:08:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ccf/ccf2d3ea12f922883de694743b365a6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Drentsoft Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
