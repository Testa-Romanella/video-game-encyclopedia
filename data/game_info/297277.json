Defeat your opponents before the world collapses under your empire in this epic Battle Royale - Board Game Like - RTS ! <br/><br/>In WotA you will show your management, strategic and quick thinking skills.<br/><br/><br/>Build up your economy During centuries of peace, military strength wasn't a concern to your people, it is now. You have little time and enormous needs so act as fast as you can.Research technologies The intellect of your people seems limited only by the amount of resources you're willing to throw at them. Could it be the key to your success ?Develop an army You are no longer safe, you will need troops ASAP to send throughout the world to explore, expand and wage war.Explore the world Find where the ocean and your opponents are to choose where to expand and settle.Expand your territory World is crumbling, expand fast or let your people be doomed by the ocean.Defeat your opponents It is their fault the world is dying for overusing its resources, put an end to their madness to try and save what remains.Survive the ocean Respect nature, and nature shall not crumble the land under your feet too fast (maybe)<br/><br/><br/>Short games Love strategy/4X games but don't have 20 hours ahead for a game ? Got you covered here. Thanks to the battle royale mode, games never last more than 25 minutes* (*duration is up for discussion !)Offline/Online play Love board games but dont have 3 friends (and hours) at home ? Give WotA a shot !Strategy over Tactic Deterministic macro management battles give most power to your strategic thinking rather than the speed at which you moves your fingers.Strategy over Luck Little impact luck has on the game can be countered by means of strategy.Impactful economic choices Will you build in the outskirts closer to the ocean to be safer against players but on a more narrow lifespan or the other way around ? Will you create as many cities as possible to increase your production or will you save forests to defend you from the ocean ?Varied technological choices All techs are calibrated to have a significant effect on the game, and you cannot get them all. Each mix offers a different array of response to specific situations. As of the current state there are already over 1000 different combinations !Non cheating AI Because you deserve better. AI does not get free units or resources under the hood, and has the same visibility rules as human players, no radar or such unfairly obtained information, it needs to travel and explore just like you do.<br/><br/><br/>A tidal wave is putting an end to this continent, will you make it through ?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:48:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c22/c22155e57532cdac61faa714df2e3029.jpg", "website": "https://www.WavesOfTheAtlantide.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 343, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Metaphore Games SAS"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Metaphore Games SAS"], "esrb_rating": null}
