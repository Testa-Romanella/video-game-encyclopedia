This version has brand new character and CG art, and an additional short playable epilogue with 4 endings, shedding a little light on the overarching story as a whole, as a stinger towards a future game. </p>\n<p>Feel free to think of this extension as a 'tip-jar' of sorts for everyone who has enjoyed the free games I have made so far. All proceeds will partly go to the lovely @baka-baru and to the development of Mica: Apoptosis. Everyone who has donated to Dear Mariko before Crimson's release will get a complimentary copy - just shoot me an email at coren.baili@gmail.com. Please do send all bug reports to that email as well. Thank you all once again for your support!</p>\n<p><strong>The Free version includes: </strong><br/>* The full main story<br/>* 3 endings<br/>* 3 CGs<br/><strong><br/>The Crimson version ($1.50 or more) includes:</strong><br/>* Brand new character and CG art<br/>* An additional epilogue<br/>* Double the gameplay<br/>* 7 endings</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a80/a80663772ae3bc0bc0c872fd92a3796e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Coren Baili"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
