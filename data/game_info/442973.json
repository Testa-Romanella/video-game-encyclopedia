Hold down the <strong>Left Shift key</strong> while clicking around the screen to have Satoshi jump around the cryptocurrency.<br/></p>\n<p>You start the game with 21,000,000 Cryptos, but you will start losing them whenever a banker makes it inside the cryptocurrency logo in the center of the screen. When you've lost all your cryptos, you lose the game!<br/><br/>But if you can hold off the evil central bankers from taking all the Cryptos for 90 seconds, then you can advance to the next level.</p>\n<p>Try to survive all 3 levels: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and LiteCoin. If you can defend all 3 cryptocurrencies from the Bankers, you win the game!</p>\n<p><em>Tip: It's much easier to play the game when you expand to the full screen!<br/>Tip: If you jump perfectly onto a Central Banker without touching their arms or legs, you can take them out of the game. There are 11 Central Bankers floating around each level, if you can take a few of them out it makes your job much easier!</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T02:41:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7bf/7bfe2fce02b0cb96c12c80df4e3a47cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SatoshiNinjamoto"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
