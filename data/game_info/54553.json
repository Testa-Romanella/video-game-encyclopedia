It was released in 1998. The game features no true \"completion\" in the form of a goal or a score, so one could theoretically play an endless number of matches. When a piece is captured, a short animated cutscene plays back depicting the battle, as in 1988's Battle Chess.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1998-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:36:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b8/4b8f7cf3aed819a3cf485ae445ef40f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo 64"], "developers": ["Titus Software"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Titus Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
