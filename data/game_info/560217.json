Turns out, it's just multitasking galore. If you enjoy that kind of thing, or are up for a challenge, then OCTE could entertain you for a while.<br/></p>\n<p>The development process is documented in this video<br/></p>\r\nHow to play?\r\n<p>After selecting your game settings, you get to place paddles on your side. After they've all been placed, you can select the keys you would like to control them with. When you're ready, press play, and enjoy putting your arrangement into motion.</p>\n<p><strong>Player 1 controls (left): </strong>W/S for back paddle; W\u00a0\u00a0E\u00a0 R\u00a0 T as custom binds</p>\n<p><strong>Player 2 controls (right):</strong> Up/Down arrows for back paddle; Up\u00a0 N\u00a0 M\u00a0 , (comma) for custom binds\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>If you're asking why it's possible to bind paddles to W and the Up arrow... Well, I'm not sure to be honest. Maybe you'll find\u00a0some cool strategy...</em></p>\r\nPaddles\r\n<p>There are four types of paddles, not counting the normal back one. Each has a unique function it executes when you tap it's key.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Triple\u00a0-\u00a0</strong>Moves up a 'zone' (cycles to the bottom when it's at the top)</li><li><strong>Rotating -\u00a0</strong>Rotates an eighth of a turn</li><li><strong>Bounce -\u00a0</strong>Creates a wave which bounces projectiles away</li><li><strong>Wall -</strong> Segments are destroyed when hit, tapping it's key will regenerate them</li></ul>\r\nProjectiles\r\n<p>Once again, there's four different types of projectiles, not counting normal ones.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Exploding -\u00a0</strong>Explodes into 6 normal projectiles after a period of time</li><li><strong>Square </strong>- Spawns normal projectiles out of it's sides every now and then</li><li><strong>Invisible -\u00a0</strong>Turns invisible sometimes</li><li><strong>Triangle -\u00a0</strong>Randomly changes it's speed</li></ul>\r\nMost importantly, why?\r\n<p>Originally this was just a small side project. However, the development\u00a0eventually ended up spanning multiple months (on and off obviously), and I just felt like publishing it somewhere because why not. <em>I\u00a0wouldn't consider this a game per se</em>, it's more of an experiment that I\u00a0found interesting.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><em>PS: If you're the player on the right, you may find it more comfortable to play with your hands crossed. Originally, the custom keys were 4 5 6 on the numpad, but not everyone has a numpad, which is why they were switched to N M ,</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T09:20:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc1/cc1697319faae1f786e865eb18d44fbd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ZeSardine"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
