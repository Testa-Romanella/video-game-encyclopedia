D6 takes that VERY literally and incorporates Dice roll RNG into a lot of its mechanics as well as featuring Mutated D6's as the enemies you'll meet inside the dungeon.</p>\n<p>We had an amazing time working on this game jam and are looking at improving the project further in the future by adding in more enemy types, levels, weapons and other features that we decided to cut for the Jam submission to ensure we kept a reasonable scope. \u00a0We hope you enjoy !
