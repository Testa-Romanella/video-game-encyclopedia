The first Level - Swamps, not finished, but playable. There will be updates of this game in the future, so stay tuned.</p>\n\n<p>This game doesn't have and probably won't have a crosshair for a regular shooting. I HATE crosshairs, especially in Third Person Shooters. It looks unnaturally.  No worries, you will get accustomed to that quickly and the game looks more real.</p>\n\n<p>Be careful of armored vehicles, helicopters, mines, special agents, and ... we will see what will be in this level and in the whole game. For sure, there will be zombie soldiers, killing machines who got out of control of army. Ah, these secret military experiments :). <br/></p>\n\n<p>I hope I will finish this level soon.</p>\n\n<p>Movie about playing the game:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/536/5362e6e8f5ed659efcf13c88dcd8d816.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tomza"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
