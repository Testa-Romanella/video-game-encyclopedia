You will start with 4\u00a0 nicely spread military bases. 10 farms will surround your bases.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*** Emus\u00a0***</p>\n<p>The emus are controlled by a AI (yes, an AI to control birds behaviour, this is really advanced software.) They will try to eat, drink and mate to survive. They move in groups\u00a0(mobs). If a mob gets too big, they will split up, and each go their own way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The outback provides a limited food source to keep them at bay at the start of the game, but they will soon come to enjoy the feast in your farms (that is, if our AI works)</p>\n<p>*** Units ***\u00a0</p>\n<p>Units have a limited movement range per turn, and can attack once per turn.</p>\n<p>They all consume rations over time, so you need to keep them supplied in rations, or else they might desert in the desert. They also have a limited amount of ammunition. For motorised units, you also have to keep an eye\u00a0on their fuel reserves, or they will not be able to move.\u00a0</p>\n<ol><li>Infantry: The most common and cheapest unit, you start with 1 per military base. They are slow, but quite accurate, and don't need petrol to move</li><li>Jeep:\u00a0A Lewis machine gun on a jeep. It is fast, but not very accurate</li><li>Tank:\u00a0Ok. They did not really use tanks during that war. But if it had dragged on, maybe they would have considered it. Relatively fast, powerful and accurate. And if you complain about its 3D model being ugly, have a look at the original Bob Semple, the New-Zealand\u00a0tank on which we based our model.</li></ol>\n\n\r\nA tank on a tractor frame. The perfect weapon to defend farms\r\n\n\n<p>*** Buildings\u00a0***</p>\n\n<ul><li>Bases: where you can spawn your units. By right-clicking on it with a selected nearby unit, you can also replenish your unit's consumables (rations, ammunition and fuel)</li><li>Farms: Your main source of income, you get public funding as long as you defend them well. You can also resupply your units there, but it will cost a little more. If emus start to eat on their adjacent fields, your funding will decrease. If a farm takes too much damage, it will close. After 3 strikes, you're out.</li></ul>\n<p>We hope you enjoy E.M.U., and tell us if you manage to beat the game, we never did it ourselves!</p>\n<p>Made in pretty much 2 weeks\u00a0by Alexis Jalbert and Nicolas Anctil</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T07:51:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41c/41c0455d23ec2cc84ee5deabb21b9785.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AlexisJa"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
