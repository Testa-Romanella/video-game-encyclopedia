At the end of the first generation, the best number is chosen and mutated for ten more numbers.</p>\n<p>The goal is to eat as much food and get as close to the next food as possible. Fitness is awarded for eating food and subtracted for distance from the next food. Food is generated in a straight line to the right.</p>\n<p>Brains use a 12 digit number, each number is broken down into four segments that are three digits; each segment is an action, with the first digit giving a direction, second a speed, and third a duration (in frames).</p>\n<p>Theoretically the best creature that can evolve is \"05X05X05X05X\", given that it will just plow full speed at the food.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this little app.</p>\n<p>More to come later?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>/!\\ Updated 6/22/2017 /!\\</p>\n<p>I've added the ability to pause the simulation, as well as fixed a couple of bugs. I also changed the fonts so that they might display better on some phones.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-04T20:17:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/107/107ccbdd99a4aaf6806685a2d82f24a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 11, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["NatFaust"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
