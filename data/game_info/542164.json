{"id": 542164, "slug": "a-relaxing-typing-game", "name": "A Relaxing Typing Game", "name_original": "A Relaxing Typing Game", "description": "<p>\"A Relaxing Typing Game\" is a chill typing game for people who like typing for the sake of typing.</p>\n<p>Drawing from public domain stories and poetry such as Edgar Allan Poe, Edward Lear and William Shakespeare, this game allows you to type out classic literature and keep track of your WPM, accuracy and mistakes.</p>\n<p>I \"finally finished\" this for Finally Finish Something Jam. It's been hanging on in a near-finished state for a long time because it was taking too long and 95% of the game was UI programming (which nearly everybody hates, including me).</p>\n<p>Consequently I haven't really done as much to this game as I planned - I was going to add more literature and things in the shop like UI packs. If you like it, let me know and I might update it a little in future.</p>\n<p>(P.S. I'm trying to sort out a Linux build but my VM doesn't have enough space on it and I am having a hard time allocating more space to it because I don't know how computers work)</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Backgrounds - Ansimuz</li><li>Graphics - kenney</li><li>One pixel font - Gooseninja</li><li>Music - DOS-88</li><li>APPX Script - Tommy van Son</li></ul>\n<p>Some of the backgrounds are licenced under CC 3.0:\u00a0https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\r\nLinks to resources used\r\n<p>Pixel art backgrounds:</p>\n<ul><li>https://opengameart.org/content/forest-background</li><li>https://opengameart.org/content/mountain-at-dusk-background</li><li>https://opengameart.org/content/bulkhead-walls-hangar</li><li>https://opengameart.org/content/horror-tile-set</li><li>https://opengameart.org/content/underwater-fantasy</li><li>https://opengameart.org/content/cyberpunk-street-environment</li></ul>\n<p>UI Graphics (and bonus sounds):</p>\n<ul><li>https://kenney.nl/assets/ui-pack</li></ul>\n<p>One Pixel Font:</p>\n<ul><li>https://gooseninja.itch.io/one-by-one-pixel-font</li></ul>\n<p>Music:</p>\n<ul><li>https://dos88.itch.io/dos-88-music-library</li></ul>\n<p>Public domain literature sources:</p>\n<ul><li>www.public-domain-poetry.com</li><li>www.gutenberg.org</li></ul>\n<p>Tommy for all your APPX programming needs:</p>\n<ul><li>https://twitter.com/TommyVanSon</li></ul>\n<p>The paper background I used on this page:</p>\n<ul><li>https://www.textures.com/download/paperdecorative0062/25148</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T06:13:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d55/d55680822b6a8a8d59dd144f9d9ae753.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Edward Atkin"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
