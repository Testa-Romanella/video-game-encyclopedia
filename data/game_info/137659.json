Though this game is highly experimental, I does convey\u2026 something\u2026 just before touching down on the world. The merge of music and platforming was pretty interesting in retrospect.</p><p>There is no apparent story to the game, and no detailed objective. All the game gives you is, \"Follow the music\"\u2026 initially you must traverse the world presented and collect the square chips by following the sound of music that will be playing and changing as you progress from song to song.</p><p>This game is not for everyone, and is a very casual and slow progressing game.</p><p>so with that\u2026 hopefully you enjoy the game\u2026 :3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b65/b654a0f8c0c0d7f516d642ffffde58b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Michael T Moreno"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
