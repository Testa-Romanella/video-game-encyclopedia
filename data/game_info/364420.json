The theme was \"Unlikely Combinations\" and I planned to use an unlikely combination of assets throughout the game. However I think the combinations could have been made more unlikely.\r\n\n<p>The goal of the game is to complete each level collecting objects, runes and animals . The objects have no function, just something to collect. Each Rune collected will enable a powerup that can be used to help in higher levels. There is a limit to how many times a powerup can be used in each level and costs coins to use..\u00a0</p>\n<p>Currently the animals can be viewed in the collections menu but cannot be collected or unlocked.\u00a0 In future versions these will be able to be used as playable characters. They will be able to be found in levels or unlocked by using coins.</p>\n<p><strong>Menu:</strong></p>\n<p>If a robot appears in the menu click on it and it will give extra coins. Once run out of coins it will leave the menu screen.<br/></p>\r\nLevels - Each level can be paused/unpaused by pressing P.\r\n<p><strong>Level 1</strong><br/>3 lives, destroy all bricks to complete the level. Certain bricks may drop a random object or rune. If found it automatically unlocks but if you can collect it with the paddle it gives bonus coins.</p>\n<p><strong>Level 2</strong><br/>Collect 20 coins to complete the level. Avoid being hit or colliding with the other boat. After 30 seconds the boat will start firing rockets at your boat.\u00a0 Push spacebar to fire rockets at the enemy boat. Note: It takes 5 seconds for the rocket to reload. Keep hitting the enemy boat with rockets and it will be destroyed. You onlu have 2 lives in this level.</p>\n<p><strong>Level 3</strong><br/>3 lives, destroy all bricks to complete the level. Certain bricks may drop a random object or rune. If found it automatically unlocks but if you can collect it with the paddle it gives bonus coins.<br/>Rune: You can use the rune unlocked in Level 1 in this level. Click and drag the rune onto a brick and it will remove the brick. It costs 25 coins and can only be used once.</p>\n<p><strong>Level 4</strong><br/>The goal of this level is to destory the enemy tank using your car. To start with you can fire pens at the tank and this will deal 1 damage per hit. You can also collect rockets and fire these at the tank. This will deal a random amount of damage between 8-25 per hit. Also collect the coins, objects and runes.</p>\n<p><strong>All assets used in this game are by Kenney Vleugels (www.kenney.nl)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Asset packs used include:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Casino Audio, UI Audio, Kenney Fonts, Background Elements Redux, Racing Pack, Puzzle Pack, Rune Pack, Animal Pack Redux, Tanks (2d), Generic Itmems, RPG Base Pack and other packs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-12T06:12:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6b/d6b62d8cfbc6fd7733926ed0e821fbd9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BeHAYMAN"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
