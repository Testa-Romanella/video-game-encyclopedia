What\u2019s better than playing on classic Battlefield 3 maps? Playing those maps updated with the power of the Frostbite 3 engine!</p>\n<p>\u2022 Operation Metro 2014: Fight both enemy opponents and claustrophobia in subterranean Paris. Bring the sky down on your opponents with destructible ceilings, and trap them in the flooded subway tunnels.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Caspian Border 2014: The central communications tower is now a hammer, ready to fall on your enemies. Take advantage of the confusion by fortifying your teammates in the new vantage points along the walls.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Gulf of Oman 2014: Everything feels normal on this map until the sandstorm whips through, destroying visibility and reducing the efficacy of your combat vehicles.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Operation Firestorm 2014: Create Hell on Earth as you breach the refinery pipelines and send gouts of flame to roast your opponents.</p>\n<p>Deploy five new weapons and execute on 10 new assignments, each with their own unlocks.
