{"id": 663659, "slug": "after-triumph", "name": "After Triumph", "name_original": "After Triumph", "description": "<p><strong>After Triumph</strong> is a walk across an uncanny landscape. A text-based tarot-reading walking simulator. The walk is long, but the game is short. (approximately five minutes to get through to an ending.)</p>\n<p>The game plays as a journey and also a reading of the major arcana. Each half sort of divines the other. Warning: While there isn\u2019t any overt adult content in the story, it\u2019s pretty bleak throughout.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>After Triumph works on computer and mobile!</strong>\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Notes: </strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Chrome overrides some of my CSS - links that have been visited (if you immediately play through the game a second time) have a different hover colour. Why is this? I do not know. If anyone has an idea, please tell me! \r\n</li><li>I made the images using the amazing Strike tool by Amorphous.</li><li>The CSS was done using Daniel Talsky\u2019s CSS Template, which is an essential resource if you\u2019re using Twine and struggle with CSS formatting as I do.</li><li>The soundtrack is by me and more of my musical stuff can be found here.\r\n</li></ul>\n\n<p><em>This game was an attempt to just finish something during this weird traumatic time. (If you\u2019re reading from the future, we had a global pandemic through 2020-21 which messed a lot of us up for a while, but we\u2019re getting better now. Do you have flying cars yet? Have any billionaires been lost to the vacuum of space?) After Triumph is a small thing, like most of my games, and so will probably always be free to play. If you enjoyed it, please consider supporting my work with the button above.</em>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T08:44:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42d/42d9ab04953b2b50144c7ac4bf7dc74b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nick Murray"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
