Your goal is to complete the level by advancing onto another one through doors.\u00a0Unfortunately, me and my friends were only able to make two levels(one of them is tutorial), but I hope you at least like the idea. This is our first bigger project and we are proud of what we have achieved.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game jam gave us a lot of experience and we hope, that this is only the start of our journey.\u00a0Feel free to give us any feedback about our game and most importantly have fun! :)</p>\n<p>Game Design / Logic - Martin Kuczy\u0144ski/ Micha\u0142 Ba\u0142asz</p>\n<p>Pixel Art / Graphics - Mateusz Skop</p>\n<p>Sounds / Graphics - Micha\u0142 Ba\u0142asz</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T07:26:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e4/6e493b62ad257e5cffa70290a08bbafd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mkuczynski11", "Majkelevsky", "Skopek"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
