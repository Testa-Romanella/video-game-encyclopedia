In this game there are many levels with various tasks, for their implementation you need ingenuity and dexterity, and sometimes even a strategy.<br/>  To hit all the enemies, it\u2019s worth practicing on the targets, as the control is unusual, but quite understandable.<br/>You will have to strain both hemispheres of the brain, since you need to control each hand separately, aiming and getting clearly at the target, because the cartridges are limited, but this can be fixed by going to the store and pumping up weapons as you earn coins.<br/>  Everything is done in voxel graphics with unobtrusive musical accompaniment, which is suitable for any age.<br/>  For greater interest, we added exclusive stars and achievements, try to collect all of them;) And most importantly - defeat all the cowboys and become the best shooter in the wild west!  Good luck in the game :) [/ i]</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T03:34:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c3/7c3274837903610d7f3b21a680961ffb.jpg", "website": "https://vk.com/pieceofvoxel", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 22, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Piece Of Voxel"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Piece Of Voxel"], "esrb_rating": null}
