{"id": 2798, "slug": "pixel-piracy", "name": "Pixel Piracy", "name_original": "Pixel Piracy", "description": "<p>Pixel Piracy offers the player a role of a pirate captain. The game is designed in a very simplistic pixel-art style. Pixel Piracy plays with all sorts of jokes and comical stereotypes about pirates.</p>\n<h3>Setup</h3>\n<p>Before the game starts, the player has to choose the difficulty level and other options by answering questions about the game&#39;s world and its main character. Initially, the player only controls a single pirate, the would-be captain. The protagonist is partially customizable: the player can choose the character&#39;s look from several presets. As the game begins, the character has to build a ship and recruit a crew before they can set off to the sea. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The goal is to lead your crew to fame by defeating enemy pirates. Other than that, the player is free to explore the map, fight enemies to gain prestige points and upgrade the ship and the crew with new equipment. The pirates belong to various classes. A crew needs fighters to attack enemies, sailors to control the ship, a carpenter to fix it, and a cook to make food. </p>\n<h3>Genre</h3>\n<p>While Pixel Piracy is more of a strategy, there are some features of the roguelike genre. The world is procedurally generated, and the crew will randomly encounter feral beasts and hostile pirates from other gangs. The player has to keep track of the ship&#39;s resources, otherwise, the crew might die of starvation or lose its morale. As in the most roguelike games, the death of the main character is permanent, and he will not respawn if killed.</p>", "metacritic": 52, "released": "2013-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-14T03:22:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fa/4fa488b87616202e9c335b78c12b3aeb.jpg", "website": "http://www.quadrodelta.com", "rating": 2.84, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 50, "owned": 1380, "beaten": 16, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 79}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 79, "ratings_count": 128, "suggestions_count": 222, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 128, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["505 Games", "Vitali Kirpu", "Quadro Delta"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["505 Games", "Re-Logic", "Quadro Delta"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
