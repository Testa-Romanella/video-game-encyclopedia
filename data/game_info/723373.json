The demo also tries to establish a style in which 2Dx would be comfortable to present, since this has been an issue since its humble beginnings in the Legend of Lubi. The indoor space fixes some of these issues, as well as confining the playable area to a more understandable space for 2Dx to take place in.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T05:58:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da3/da3c40472558c73853c6a674b418418e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CaseyDeCoder"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
