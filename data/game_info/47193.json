You will need to use arrow keys to move the knight towards the exit of each level. At the exit of a level there is a door that will open and where the knight hopes that the princess that he is waiting for a long time, is there.<br/>\r\nThe path towards exit is not easy. Some levels are quite big. There will be spikes that obviously will kill you. Expect to find also moving blades that follow a predefined pattern. Also the castles you explore are not inhabited by humans so bats will be there. For a strange reason the knight is afraid of bats. However you have a sword that you can use to kill them.<br/>\r\nBut don't worry there will be moving platform that you need to use to reach some places. <br/>\r\nSometimes you will find diamonds inside the castle. I think you need to collect them. Your princess will surely like diamonds.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb6/fb6f18cb40cb639d3e642aa9fe35332e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Mihai Morosanu"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mihai Morosanu"], "esrb_rating": null}
