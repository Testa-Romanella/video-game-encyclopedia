Connect to a water source by attaching a root to it. Players can move very quickly on their own roots. Building roots is slow, and is even slower when building on rocks or enemy roots. Water sources are finite and will begin to deplete when attached to a root system. You can build roots through opponents' water sources to steal them or cut them off. If a root system is not attached to an active water source, it will be destroyed. If a player is standing on a root system when it is destroyed, that player will be defeated. Be the last bug standing to win.</p></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T13:02:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e2/2e2c58c28c8a888b01a38525682ba90a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FlizFlaz"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
