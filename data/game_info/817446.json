In this game, you have to move the ship with your mouse pointer and manually ship one out of the infinitely-generating cargo boxes to the dock.</p>\n<p>(There's some twists)</p>\n<p>This is the first game I ever made, and also, it is the first game I ever submitted to a game jam. I know it is not that good and polished, (deal with it) but as they say:</p>\n<p><em>\"<strong>Every game developer's first game is trash</strong>\" -they, 2022</em></p>\n<p>Made (and coded) using: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript,\u00a0Visual Studio Code, Replit's Kaboom.js framework</p>\n<p>All code, art, and music is made by me.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This project may have bugs. If it has, then please inform me in the comments section of the page. You may also inform me about how changes can be made for the betterment of the game.</p>\n<p>Q.
