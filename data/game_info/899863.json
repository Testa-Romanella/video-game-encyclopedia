Defines a grid</p>\n<p>2. Places rooms in the grid randomly</p>\n<p>3. Performs Delaunay Tetrahedralization to get a streamlined map that connects the rooms</p>\n<p>4. Calculates the minimum spanning tree of the undirected graph of the edges from tetrahedralization</p>\n<p>5. Adds random hallways back</p>\n<p>6. Determines hall pathways using A*</p>\n<p>7. and finally places rooms, pillars, walls, and other assets.</p>\n\n<p>There is an orbital camera that allows you to right-click and drag to\u00a0view the entire dungeon and zoom in and out with the scroll wheel.\u00a0 By pressing Enter, you can switch to a first person perspective that uses WASD.\u00a0 The player camera can be frozen in place using F (and unfrozen in the same way).</p>\n\n<p>Working on this project was really rewarding.\u00a0 I learned a lot about several different algorithms like A* and Delaunay Triangulation/Tetrahedralization.\u00a0 I\u00a0learned what can be achieved by combining multiple algorithms into a single feature.\u00a0 I hope to continue working on this project to make it into an actual game.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the link to the repository on Github:\u00a0https://github.com/dillondrum70/GPR340-Dungeon_Generation</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T16:56:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd5/bd5c6d2804e97012345f83b1b33019d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dillster"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
