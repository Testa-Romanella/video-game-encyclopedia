It is a Sci-Fi game where you explore a lab inhabited with beans. You can learn a little bit about the beans while you're there and can explore the decent-sized facility. It was a pretty rushed game, made in about 19 hours with a lot of ideas not able to be finished in time. I really like the idea and hope it works well. Thanks, Brackeys for all the tutorials and getting me into game dev. Have a good one yall - Astra.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T07:34:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/398/3980d204fb007a5ecc1ac785cbe57dbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["AstraStudios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
