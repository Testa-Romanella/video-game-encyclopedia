They do not know the world, and they do not know themselves. Unfortunately for the world, they're quick learners!<br/></p>\n<p><em>Star-spawned</em> is a GMless, oneshot-oriented tabletop RPG in which you don't know what your own traits do when play begins. The names of each group's stats are randomly generated using morpheme chaining, and characters are created while having absolutely no idea what they mean; figuring that out forms the greater part of play.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Written and edited by David J Prokopetz. <br/></p>\n<p>\r\nGraphic design by Kaki.</p>\n<p>Beta reading by Jan Caltrop.</p>\n<p>Playtesting by aesmael, counterclockworkminds, Frogger, Jacqueline Squid Onassis and kaminiwa.<br/></p>\r\nLicense\r\n<p> The text of <em>Star-spawned</em> is licensed under CC BY 4.0  <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T10:12:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a60/a60398a678a8c308431db250687e90aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Penguin King Games", "David J Prokopetz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
