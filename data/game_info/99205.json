Inspired by Devil Daggers, Downwell and INK.<br/><br/><strong>Game Jam Theme:\u00a0Downwell's Dual Purpose Design</strong><br/>Here's how the game follows the theme:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>The shooting mechanic is also how you navigate the main menu.</li><li>Holding Left Mouse Button shoots bullets, but also heals you.</li><li>Releasing Left Mouse Button attracts Gems that Enemies drop when they die, but makes enemies behave differently.</li><li>When you're shooting, Pink Enemies move faster, but when not shooting, Blue Enemies move faster.</li><li>Your Ammo bar is also the screen border. Depleting your Ammo \u00a0lets you see more of the screen. There's also a bonus enemy that would be obscured if your Ammo is too high.</li><li>Gems give Score and also replenish Ammo. Since Ammo has a Max Cap, and Score will multiply, you need to juggle your pick-up rate.</li><li>Your Health Bar is the Screen Resolution. Taking Damage makes the screen pixelated. Shooting heals you and returns this to normal.</li><li>Enemies splatter into paint. Later in the game, there's an enemy that's white, and can only be seen when on top of paint splatters.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>How to play:<br/></strong>The game has a tutorial, but if you're confused:</p>\n<ol><li>Hold Left Mouse Button to shoot.</li><li>Shooting depletes Ammo, which is indicated by the Green Bars on the sides of the screen.</li><li>Shoot all coloured dots.</li><li>Release Left Mouse Button to stop shooting and collect Gems. Gems give score and also replenish Ammo.</li><li>Collect as many Gems as you can at once, as they Multiply and give even more score.</li><li>Enemies behave differently depending on wheather you are shooting or not.</li><li>Have fun (this is the most important part)</li></ol>\n\n<p>Made using Game Maker: Sudio and SFXR</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f6/3f66b2a80a6665645bf2e7c263052970.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Oscar Brittain"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
