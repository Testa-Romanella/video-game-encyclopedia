The game follows the main theme of duality in that it is a symbolization of the Abject, a feeling incurred by treading on a plane between two conceptual borders. For this reason the game occurs in an abandoned hospital maze with repetitive rooms/paths that are never quite the same and involve a character who caries a flashlight in a well lit room while chanting Latin prayers to electric switches.<br/></p>\n<p>[How to play]\r\n</p>\n<p>Use the keys WSDA to move, use the key E to interact with the levers to burn the enemy.\r\n</p>\n<p>[Objective]\r\n</p>\n<p>Burn the enemy 8 times, by triggering the levers, before it catches you.\r\n</p>\n<p>[Feedback]\r\n</p>\n<p>If you pass it, please comment this page.
