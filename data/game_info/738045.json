{"id": 738045, "slug": "mitadake-high", "name": "Mitadake High", "name_original": "Mitadake High", "description": "<p>Web-based multiplayer light-role-playing murder-mystery game that runs through the BYOND client. The game is similar to standard drama fare &quot;Knives In The Dark&quot;: one player is the Killer (hereafter referred to in male terms) and must attempt to bury the unfortunates trapped with him before dawn. Alternative game modes include Death Note mode, in which one character (&#39;Kira&#39;) spawns with a Death Note and another has the Shinigami Eyes, forcing the two to work together in order to kill everyone else; and Nanaya Mode, an out-and-out free-for-all. The reason for it being Mitadake &quot;High&quot; is because the default map takes place in a high school; an external map editor allows hosts to create additional maps to play on.</p>\n<p>MH is heavily influenced by Higurashi: When They Cry, Death Note, and Tsukihime, with many shout outs to other anime in the bargain.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-12T16:30:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d18/d1888ef4f0e699286d604659ae51f3fe.jpg", "website": "https://www.byond.com/games/DevourerOfSouls/MitadakeHigh", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
