Collect all clarinets to win!<br/></p>\n<p>Are you tired of living with an\u00a0endless internal void? Look no further! In \"I can be all\", you can now experience an endless <strong>external </strong>void! Explore a lovingly crafted world of nothing, where no place looks like the other... but really does not look any different, either.<em> \"I have not been here yet, have I? Oh NO, not AGAIN!\"<br/></em></p>\n<p>But how did you get here? Presume that while running away, you got locked into a time machine, which transported you out of time and space. Finally, a place where you can be aaalll alllooone! After thorough practice, you decide it is time to leave, but naturally, you can not do that without your clarinets. We do not know why you have 7 of them, or how you managed to spread them all across the interdimensional void, but it is none of our business, either. So go find them!<br/></p>\n<p>FEATURES<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Nothingness, stretching for several kilometers, modelled in a level of detail never seen before. And not seen here, because it turned out \"nothing\" is pretty difficult to see.</li><li>Experience a place where you can be all alone with your clarinet.</li><li>A color palette featuring up to two completely separate colors!</li><li>Fog conditions reminiscient of the beautiful city of Passau in late autumn.</li><li>Beautifully composed soundtrack produced using the clarinet of a talented clarinet player. (We just borrowed it from them, though)</li></ul>\n<p>CREDITS<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Music and SFX: Dominik</li><li>Graphics: Katharina</li><li>Programming: Lucas</li></ul>\n<p>ADDITIONAL ASSETS<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Easy Character Movement 2</li><li>FEEL</li><li>TextAnimator</li><li>ClipArt and various other Assets from the Public Domain.
