{"id": 766523, "slug": "craft-or-die", "name": "Craft... or Die!", "name_original": "Craft... or Die!", "description": "Presentation\r\nWhat it is\r\n<p><strong>Crafting games</strong> are typically relaxed, allowing you to take your time and plan carefully what you have to do. However, when you throw the crafting activity in the middle of an <strong>hectic shooter</strong>, there\u2019s less place for error.</p>\n<p>Full disclaimer: As it\u2019s the case with most jams (we suppose, it\u2019s our first), the realization is not half what we meant it to be. As such, the words \"crafting\" and \"hectic\" are used very freely in the above definition.</p>\r\nHow it\u2019s been done\r\n<p>Two (blood) <strong>brothers</strong>, with a lot of coffee and/or beer (depending on the hour), and certainly not enough sleep.</p>\n<p>We used the following <strong>tools</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unity, as the main editor and engine.</li>\n<li>Hexels for most of our graphics, which turned out pretty good-ish considering our (lack of) artistic talent, with minor touch-ups done in Paint.net.</li>\n<li>BFXR for the sound effects.</li>\n<li>The incredibly surprising Autotracker-C for the <em>automagic</em> music generation.</li>\n</ul>\r\nInstructions\r\nDownload\r\n<p>For <strong>Windows</strong>, download the zip file listed below, then uncompress it in a folder. Simply run CraftOrDie.exe; no installation needed.</p>\r\nHints\r\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gamepad</strong> is supported and recommended (hotkeys are displayed for XInput-type gamepads), but keyboard also works.</li>\n<li>If you don\u2019t mind being spoiled, you can see the <strong>list of recipes</strong> here. We recommend you experiment a bit first though.</li>\n<li>A <strong>bug</strong> discovered at the very last minute makes it so that enemies, which are scaled harder (more health, damage, etc.) as the game progresses, are not reset when the game is over. As such, each game starts harder and harder (but you won\u2019t have the firepower to deal with it). Sorry! In the meantime, please restart the exec completely to reset the difficulty.</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T17:01:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce6/ce6aa9f4c4e644b392b18a756721696b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["xmoby", "chozoid"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
