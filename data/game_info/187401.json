The world is suffering by overpopulation. To fix it, a gas virus was spread all over the globe. To avoid it, you try to escape to hell (inferno) by throwing yourself in an endless ditch full of obstacles that you have to avoid. <br/></p><p><strong>HOW TO PLAY </strong><br/></p><ul><li>Avoid the obstacles as you fall. </li><li>Use A and D or LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to move. </li><li>You cannot move vertically. </li><li>ProTip\u2122: There is a certain spot you can stay where you will never get hit. Find it and you will fall forever (what a dream come true, right?) </li></ul><p><strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</strong></p><p>  I would like to thank Bia Gasc\u00f3n, my girlfriend, for being my main source of inspiration for the piece. <br/></p><p>(Ps. I swear, it is not her fault that it came out the way it did, she just helped with the story laughing)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d7/5d790b854f1e4cf354b676cd52bc3eb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["\u308a\uff91\u5200"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
