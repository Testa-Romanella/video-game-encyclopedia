Providing our information digitally makes it so nobody has a reason to not be informed. \u00a0Giving learners an opportunity to think through scenarios in advance should help them be better prepared for active shooter situations.  Enabling learners to successfully \u201cplay\u201d through various scenarios in diverse campus settings provides guidance as to how to handle situations when a shooter is nearby as well as when a shooter is at a distance. \u00a0Navigating those scenarios is intended to teach learners how to make rapid assessments and crucial decisions that will affect their and others\u2019 survival. \u00a0This game should provide professors, students and other campus personnel with the information they need to reduce the risk of panic and bad decision-making in crisis situations.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T07:00:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/777/777daaaae84cd378f026f3589da081f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["AlexWeitzner"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
