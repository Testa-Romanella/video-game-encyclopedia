If you get a red exclamation point during fishing, it means that a fish took your bait...

More fish to come.\u00a0Also, later updates will allow you to play personal music from your files. Wasting time never sounded so good...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T14:20:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/522/5221fbc2512043ace37bf479eb7e73fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Field of Games Studios"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
