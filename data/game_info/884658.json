There is no way to stop, only slow down slightly. Navigate the winding tracks, while avoiding hazards and collecting precious gems.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But you only have a few minutes; when the clock hits zero it's game over! So optimize your route, exploit the looping levels, and shoot for that high score!</p>\n\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A - Jump<br/>B - Slow Down<br/>Up/Down - Hold to Switch Tracks<br/>Start - Pause</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>Minekart Madness</strong> was created over a few weeks in the fall of 2022 for the annual nesdev competition.<br/></p>\n<p>Design &amp; Coding by <strong>Matt Hughson</strong> (https://twitter.com/matthughson)</p>\n<p>Music and Sound by <strong>Tu\u00ef</strong> (https://twitter.com/Tui2A03)</p>\n<p>Art by <strong>Zolionline</strong></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Stay up to date with this game, as well as future games I am making!\r\n</p>\r\nJoin the Discord", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T17:25:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a9/3a9493a183803fc90bfde177e716b298.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matt Hughson"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
