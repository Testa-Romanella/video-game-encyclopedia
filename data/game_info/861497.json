This game highlights patterns of violence that go unpunished, redrawing borders, the human cost of war, and the events we are collectively conditioned to pay attention to. \r\nArmenians have learned that no one cares about our plight. The left isn\u2019t concerned; white christians aren\u2019t concerned; Europe, because it needs oil from Azerbaijan instead of Russia, isn\u2019t concerned. And we\u2019ve learned that the world <em>does</em> have this capacity to care\u2013just not for us.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This is a feminist issue. This is an anti-racist issue. This is an anti-colonial issue. This is an anti-imperialist issue. This is an environmental issue. And we are at risk of extinction.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I will not get into the context of this war, the indigenity of Armenians, or the extent to the terror that they have recently and repeatedly have endured while living between two dictorial giants that want to exterminate them. Instead, I hope this short game motivates you to dig more on your own, with a few links provided.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like resources on places you can donate to, here is a carrd.co link with a list of organizations you can donate to, actions you can take, and resources to read to learn more on the conflict. If you can't donate, raise awareness (we don't even have a #PrayForArmenia hashtag circulating\u00a0to criticize it). Caring about Armenia as a non-Armenian is sexy, feminist, anti-racist,\u00a0anti-colonial, and\u00a0anti-genocide\u00a0as fuck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I recommend donating to The Armenian Wounded Hero Fund, which gives all proceeds to providing direct aid and rehabilitation services to Armenians wounded in battle, and Koorigs, which provides immediate aid to families that have been displaced by war and colonialism.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In addition to the carrd.co link, here are some recent articles that are worth exploring:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>The treatment of Armenian Prisoners of War</li><li>\u201cI wrote the book on ISIS, but I couldn't stand to see what Azeri soldiers did to [Anush] Apetyan\" (Translate page to English)</li><li>[Azerbaijan's] War Strategy: Torture and Rape</li><li>Lemkin Institute: Azerbaijan is committing slow genocide against Armenians with Turkish support\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>I\u00a0composed the music and used\u00a0samples from Manifold, Tsoren, and this video.\u00a0\u00a0</li><li>One of the quotes was with permission by GI.\u00a0</li><li>The poem at the end was from this video.\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T07:16:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a0/1a0594f491a5d19ff29e1c7a01ad5ea2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["suzukian"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
