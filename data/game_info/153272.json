{"id": 153272, "slug": "intellectual-dark-web", "name": "INTELLECTUAL DARK WEB", "name_original": "INTELLECTUAL DARK WEB", "description": "<p>For years I've followed Sam Harris and Joe Rogan, not least because they provide content at length for my commute\u00a0- Sam's at close to 2 hours, Joe regularly hits\u00a03 hours.</p>\n<p>But during the past year I also started to get familiar with some other characters in their orbit, a diverse bunch unified by\u00a0a willingness to discuss difficult issues at length with people across the political spectrum. They also seemed to be brought together in solidarity around\u00a0victims of censorship. Many; Bret Weinstein, Charles Murray, Jordan Peterson, James Damore, Ben Shapiro had faced censorship\u00a0due to public outrage about the topics on which they chose to focus.</p>\n<p>In May\u00a0a term coined by Eric Weinstein during an interview became the title for the\u00a0NY Times article\u00a0Intellectual Dark Web\u00a0. There I discovered this group, so derisive of identity politics, had found its identity. The article is an adequate primer so I won't seek to elaborate on what the IDW is. Rather I will explain in short the simulation and give one concern I have for the future of this misfit group of hashtags.</p>\n<p>I thought this was great material to try a data-vis project: A self-organising 3D nodal web for visualising relationships.<br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>Control the rotation and zoom with the arrow keys<br/></em></strong><strong><em>and rotate other axes with the W,\u00a0A, S and D keys.</em></strong></p>\n<p>The methodology was simple; a simple google image search of each pair of public intellectuals would provide\u00a0me the number of photos taken of each pair\u00a0at public events (duplicate photos at the same event were not counted). That number then dictated the pull between those name nodes in the map. I've chosen to focus on players I'm familiar with, and also some outliers like Alex Jones to put the movement in perspective.</p>\n<p>Part of my reason for visualising this data was to flesh out a feeling I had about the proximity of Libertarianism to the IDK.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As for conclusions that come from this (admittedly un-scientific) experiment, my fears have not been allayed that the group and its following of millions, are not being politicised towards Libertarianism.</p>\n\n<p>What we see in the group is the combination of non-political classical liberal thinkers like Sam Harris, Bret Weinstein, Steven Pinker, and the incredibly open-minded Joe Rogan, with politically-motivated\u00a0libertarians such as Ben Shapiro, Dave Rubin, Douglas Murray,\u00a0Jordan Peterson and Claire Lehmann.</p>\n<p>Libertarians have liberal social values, and preference liberties in general over rights (\"liberties\" being your freedom to act rather than your \"rights\" to be protected from other people's free actions).<br/><br/>So, listening to a Jordan Peterson at length, you can find yourself agreeing with the much of what he says.<br/></p>\n<p>Then couple this with\u00a0someone from the left\u00a0like Sam Harris - a fellow victim of the\u00a0\"Regressive Left\", having faced similar public censorship to his ideas,\u00a0and you find allegiance in a\u00a0common enemy. And there is nothing wrong with criticising the left for silencing opposing views, it is anti-liberal, not to mention against the constitution.</p>\n<p>Enter politics.\u00a0Now the\u00a0perjorative of the\u00a0\"Regressive Left\"\u00a0(a term coined\u00a0by Sam's friend and collaborator Maajid Nawaz)\u00a0emboldens the\u00a0right-wing inclinations of libertarians who\u00a0hope to extend liberal principles to areas unrelated to freedom of speech;\u00a0free-market economics, lax regulation and lower\u00a0taxes - small government.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You can see below\u00a0Dave Rubin's attempt to solidify this pathway from liberal-intellectual to libertarian.</p>\n<p>THE PARTICULAR FLAWED LOGIC OF LIBERTARIANISM IN THIS CASE</p>\n<p>This group has bandied around people who have faced \"censorship\" in the form of institutions\u00a0bowing to pressure from small public groups. But this censorship has not come from big government, quite the opposite, this is the free market allowing lobby groups to pressure institutions to protect themselves from public disapproval. Google weren't protecting themselves against big government when they fired James Damore, they were signaling principles consistent with a market that values a particular view of diversity.<br/><br/>Now, while Rubin is shoe-horning liberal economics in with liberal social policy, Shapiro and Peterson seem to have only discovered socially\u00a0liberal views at the moment\u00a0when middle-aged white men are having their rights to criticise historically marginalised groups challenged.</p>\n<p>There is some push back, for instance Joe Rogan's response to\u00a0Dave Rubin's Laissez-faire building regulation position is 10 minutes of brilliant argument.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I came to this group because they provided what I was craving; long form discussion of modern philosophical and political ideas. Shows like Rubin's and Rogan's do something for public debate the mainstream couldn't hope to achieve.<br/><br/>But I do feel as though the libertarian wedge is a real issue and it\u00a0hasn't really been illuminated for what it is. I would hate to see my fellow liberal armchair intellectuals lead over the fence by a group of middle-aged\u00a0white men essentially lamenting the privileged status of racial minorities and gender diversity.<br/><br/>Bret Weinstein's tweet quoted in the NY Times piece sums up my concern pretty aptly\u00a0\u201cSmart, skeptical people are often surprisingly susceptible to being conned if a ruse is tailored to their prejudices.\u201d</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a82/a828ce90e9d6dca3cd635b45d7fe01ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nonzerosum"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
