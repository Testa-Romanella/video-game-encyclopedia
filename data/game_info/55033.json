It is heavily based on the 1985 arcade game Penguin Wars. In Amiga Power's first All Time Top One Hundred in the inaugural 'Issue 0', it was declared to be the 100th best Amiga game of all time. It never reappeared in the top 100 and its initial inclusion was said to be due to the insistence of a single writer. In March 2017 the source code of the game became available via the Internet Archive.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1989-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:49:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1b/e1b941fa80d710d596f963976e27384e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 3, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 268, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Commodore / Amiga", "Atari ST"], "developers": ["Golden Goblins"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Rainbow Arts"], "esrb_rating": null}
