I honestly wasn't thrilled about the theme because I don't like to make settings that have any basis in reality. After a lot of thinking I thought of making a conjurer who lives in an early 80s setting and then she somehow became a vampire somewhere along the way too.</p>\n<p>Since the game has a high volume of dialogue in its short run\u00a0I thought to add voice. But I don't have good recording equipment or a good voice so I turned to TTS (Text to Speech). I used this tool to make the dialogue:\u00a0https://ttstool.com/</p>\n<p>But I\u00a0don't really like the way that the robot voice sounds so I made it optional.</p><p>Music came from here:\u00a0https://www.bensound.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T05:55:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad7/ad75136a22ed8999269fc845a048fa55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fava Beans"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
