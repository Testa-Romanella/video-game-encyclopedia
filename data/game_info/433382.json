{"id": 433382, "slug": "trial-of-balance", "name": "Trial of Balance", "name_original": "Trial of Balance", "description": "<p>This was made on the weekend of LudumDare46 - the theme was 'Keep it alive' <em>(Made in 12 hours)</em></p>\n<p><strong>A Little Backstory</strong></p>\n<p>In this prototype, you play as an adventurer who is exploring a dungeon in search of riches, when you suddenly drop your torch and find what you think is a replacement, which is actually a fire spirit trapped in the artifact you just picked up. They say that if you get them out of the dungeon alive, they will grant you you wildest wishes.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Main mechanic</strong></p>\n<p>The main mechanic is the bar at the bottom of the screen which shows the current state your new little friend is in. The aim is to keep the flame in the center of the bar, as making the flame go too close to being blue/red will kill the flame. Each time you enter a room(though there is only one in this prototype) will be either blue or red, to show which side the flame on the bar will\u00a0\u00a0move towards. Collect Gems of the correct colour to move the bar closer to the middle\u00a0(red gems will move the flame to the right, blue will move it to the left.) Survive in the room keeping the flame alive until the timer on the door runs out and reveals your escape.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\r\nMoveWASDJumpSpace (Hold to jump higher)\r\n<p><strong>Some Notes</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I wanted to have a creative break from my uni work so this weekend I made a small prototype as part of LudumDare46. As I wasn't going to hard on the game jam\u00a0(I only spent 4 hours a day on it because I still had some uni work I had to do)\u00a0 I didn't get it to the stage I felt comfortable uploading it for the Jam, but I still want to keep a record of it for the future, as I really enjoyed making this mechanic.</p>\n<p>I'd like to get back to this when my uni workload calms down a bit, refine the game spawning system, add some more obstacles like traps and of course more levels and a bit more polish - but I hope this little prototype gets the idea across :)</p>\n<p><strong>Credit</strong></p>\n<p>Credit for the little wizard sprite goes to 0x72 from their <em>16x16 Dungeon Tileset Pack II</em></p>\n<p>The rest of the art and code was done by me :)</p>\n<p>Sfx made in Bfxr</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T05:07:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a0/9a011ef319e2058dda1572cc7a28e556.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JacazzaJade"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
