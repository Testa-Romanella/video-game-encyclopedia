A civilization evolved into a galaxy near the Milky Way. They were beings\u00a0small and very smart, however, their small planet no longer supported so many inhabitants and\u00a0they decided to use their knowledge to find a bigger and more prosperous planet, where could survive.</p>\n<p>So, they traveled to a neighboring planet, lifeless, but which had almost entirely\u00a0mineral resources for the manufacture of ships and robots that would help them in their search.\r\n</p>\n<p>In order to create these giant ships and robots, since they were very small beings, they had to work hard to build a great machine\u00a0\u00a0that has taken over the entire planet. The machine alone removed the raw material from the soil and autonomously manufactured\u00a0robots and large ships\u00a0enough to travel through space in search of a habitable planet to colonize.\r\n</p>\n<p>The problem is that the machine has become too self-sufficient and a programming error has the machine went into its own battle mode, it then mercilessly attacked the little planet neighbor where they lived, decimating all civilization and destroying everything.\r\n</p>\n<p>Now, the machine is dedicated to fulfilling its program, constituting ships and robots and sending space to attack and destroy\u00a0planets and all the life you find. We humans feel the powerof this machine when we were colonizing a planet close to our galaxy and we were surprised\u00a0by the destructive ships. A great battle took place and everyone who was there died.\r\n</p>\n<p>Now the robot ships have our coordinates and are coming towards Earth. We have to avoid at all costs that they arrive. We need to stop the machine.\r\n</p>\n<p>You have been selected for this adventure. Your mission is to get to the machine and destroy it at any cost. Saving not only\u00a0humanity but all the planets that are in its line of destruction.\r\n</p>\n<p>As the machine builds it creates bigger and more powerful ships and also structures that\u00a0they serve as new factories. In this first episode you will face enemies that are already approaching the land. Destroy all. Do not\u00a0let any of them approach our planet.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>contact: gatexthedeathmachine@gmail.com\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T23:57:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ec/0ec5c93ce1da71f0a7d9776fec47eed0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["williamft"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
