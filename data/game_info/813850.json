Collect valuable upgrades that will mean the difference when you and another player are going for the same egg.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Each move in the game takes considerable real-life time (configurable from 3 seconds\u00a0to 1 hour),\u00a0but the game will continue to run while you're away. Make a plan, queue up your moves, and come back later to play again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is meant to be played over the course of several days, just checking in a few times each day to queue up your moves. However, you can select a smaller move timer if you're wanting something to finish within a few minutes.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T07:36:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ed/6ed7a7dd98e0ba240f85b326dced76ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ha1fBit"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
