Proper way is marked by square roots of numbers showed at current player position. Relax, start crunching numbers and you'll reach the destination in no time.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>To win you have to properly choose a square root of a number given in each node. After 5 correct answers you'll reach your destination. But beware the game won't tell you if you made a mistake. Instead, you'll progress further down the tree, but when you finally give a correct answer, you'll reach the wrong leaf and will be bounced back to the place where the mistake was made. Correcting this mistake will be the only way to get back on the right track.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Left, down and right arrow keys - move down the left, down and right path respectively.<br/>Esc - open in-game menu<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Development team:</strong></p>\n<p>Daniel Lewi\u0144ski (Dante)</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game was made during Global Game Jam 2023. <br/>Theme of the event was \"Roots\".</p>\n<p><strong>Attributions:</strong></p>\n<p>Music by Ashot-Da\r\nnielyan-Composer from Pixabay<br/>\r\nImage by Sketchepedia on Freepik<br/>\r\nImage by Freepik<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T16:09:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ed/9ed446db38f15ae126eeeca254c2897d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Dante"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
