I did not get a storage device with my computer, so I had to type in a game if I wanted to play it.</p>\n<p>The code is for a Hungarian computer, the Videoton TV Computer. Emulator download link for Windows: <a \"=\"\" href=\"&lt;a href=\" http:=\"\" tvc.homeserver.hu=\"\">http://tvc.homeserver.hu/</a>bin/emu/tvc220.zip\" class=\"redactor-linkify-object\"&gt;http://tvc.homeserver.hu/bin/emu/tvc220.zip (http://tvc.homeserver.hu/ is foll of Hungarian resources for the TVC)</p>\n\n<p>Game instructions:</p>\n<p>SPACE - drop a bomb</p>\n<p>You will get 10 points each time it hits the O. The speed of O is random and the drop height is random too.</p>\n<p>Code in text:</p>\r\n\r\n10 RANDOMIZE:GRAPHICS 2:P=0\r\n20 BYO=RND(15):BY=BYO:SP=RND(10)+2:BS=0\r\n30 FOR I=0 TO 63:A$=INKEY$:IF A$=\" \" THEN BS=1\r\n40 BY=BY+BS:PRINT AT 1,50:\"Score:\",P\r\n50 PRINT AT 23, I:\"O\";:PRINT AT BY,32:\"X\";\r\n60 SOUND VOLUME 0, DURATION SP:SOUND ;VOLUME 0\r\n70 PRINT AT 23, I:\" \";:PRINT AT BY,32:\" \";\r\n80 IF BY = 23 AND I = 32 THEN P = P + 10:GOTO 20\r\n90 IF BY = 23 THEN BY = BYO: BS = 0\r\n100 NEXT:GOTO 30\r\n<p>This is a very simple game. A few TVC specific instructions:</p>\n<p>INKEY$ reads the keyboard without blocking.</p>\n<p>SOUND makes a sound, used for delay here. It does not block, but the second SOUND instruction with the semicolon will wait for the first one to finish (without the semicolon it interrupts previous SOUND). The unit if DURATION is 1/50s.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T23:53:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0d/e0df5f50b61fce95d74e2dbb12d5c671.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BASIC 10Liner"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
