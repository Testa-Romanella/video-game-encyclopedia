Survive as long as you can! and try to kill as many enemy as possible! That's it!</p>\n<p>This game was more of a leaning curve on developing a game, rather than focuing on refining the gameplay. So don't expect too much out of the gameplay experience....... Yet. BUT! Feel free to drop a comment down below if you want to see it improved!</p>\n\r\nMotivation behind this\r\n<p>This project was born from the ashes of my school assignment. Then it become the place where I test my skills and develop my understanding around Unity Engine.\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>\"<em>Why ashes? </em>\" if you wondering. It was supposed to be a 3D shoot-em-up game, but turns out I can't art.</p>\n\n\n<p><em>If case you wondering about the art part, Heli was from Asset store</em></p>\n<p>The decision on art style and 2D top-down\u00a0you seeing there was inspired by Sugar Warrior from Brackey. (it's an awesome place to learn about Unity, anyone interested in Unity Development should definitely check it out!)<br/></p><p>Honestly speaking, it's pretty scary to publish a somewhat \"finished\" game to the public, I have absolutely no idea what would come out of this. But hey! first time for everything I guess?</p>\n<p>What I'm hoping to get in return was pretty much any sort of feedback, experience what it is like to publish game on itch.io, seeing how silent this might become. and.... I think that's it?</p>\n\r\nWhat might happen to it next?\r\n<p>I think with Unity shifting to DOTS, I will probably try to convert this project to that and see how much better it perform on mobile (Yes, there was an android build). But this project is currently not the priority, the days are not numbered. <br/></p>\nThanks for getting in here!
