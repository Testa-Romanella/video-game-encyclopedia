Also, each character has their own combo techniques, but in order to use them, you need to score a certain number of points in a fight.<br/>\r\nCurrently, two game modes are available - against the PC and playing with a friend on the same PC (controller is required for local multiplayer).<br/>\r\nA dynamic setting, a fun atmosphere, and vivid emotions are what Dizzy Fight will give you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-26T07:59:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/654/654717adb49d5045c32f1ae01b607290.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 255, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SoerGameStudio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SoerGameStudio"], "esrb_rating": null}
