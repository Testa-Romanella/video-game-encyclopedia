{"id": 46830, "slug": "pass-the-time", "name": "Pass The Time", "name_original": "Pass The Time", "description": "Pass The Time is a nice little puzzle game with a simple goal - to pass the time from one clock to another one until there are no clocks left.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe main part of the game is a ball of seconds that is getting passed from one clock to the other one. You can do that by firing the ball that is then going to be shot in the direction in which the clock pointer is pointing. You will want to fire it into the other clock and so on. There are also some special blocks like the The Turtle block which slows down the clock rotations, and The Rabbit Block which speeds them up. Solve all 30 levels and be as fast as you can to earn stars. Careful not to run out of time.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f3/9f399c6ed21f5dcb169a1147b2c8283a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pixberry Studios"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Silicon Echo"], "esrb_rating": null}
