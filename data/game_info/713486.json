Build turrets and dig trenches to make your defenses impenetrable! But watch out, your opponents will not mindlessly assault but relentlessly exploit any weaknesses...</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>A FRESH TAKE ON TOWER DEFENSE. While retaining the genre's straightforwardness and casual approachable character, Drone Defense is spiced up with a smart AI opponent: enemy units fight back and respond dynamically to the player's defenses, resulting in intense, pitched, and open-ended battles. The fast-paced gameplay is presented in a distinctive retro-inspired arcade-like style. <br/></p>\n<p>DIVERSE SCENARIOS. Defend galactic outposts as well as key strategic points on your home world. While a typical scenario just takes 10 to 15 minutes, the responsive A.I. opponent promises many hours of gaming and high replay value. <br/></p>\n<p>ALL TYPES OF DEVICES. The game supports the full range of input devices.\r\n     You can play it equally well on your touch-oriented smartphone or tablet, on     your PC with mouse or keyboard, and even on your Smart TV using     its remote control or a gamepad. The controls and rules will feel familiar     within minutes, but finding resilient defense lines may be a whole different challenge...</p>\n<p>KEY FEATURES <br/></p>\n<ul><li>straightforward tower defense spiced up with a smart AI opponent</li><li>intense action-rich battles</li><li>12 diverse scenarios (4 playable for free)</li><li>distinctive retro-inspired style</li><li>runs in all modern browsers, both mobile and desktop</li><li>offline installation as Progressive Web App (PWA)</li><li>supports touch, keyboard, mouse, and game controller input (full version only)</li><li>full version contains downloadable stand-alone binaries for Windows and Linux PCs (x86)\u00a0</li><li>all features of the full version can also be unlocked in the browser/web app via a personal key obtainable when buying the full version</li><li>also available on Fire Tablets</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T09:40:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b31/b31f2febd509a59e7df1dcbf4df4b13d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 289, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["eludi"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
