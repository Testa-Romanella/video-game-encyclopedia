{"id": 785138, "slug": "an-easy-game", "name": "~An Easy Game~", "name_original": "~An Easy Game~", "description": "<p>~An Easy Game~ is a 2D third person adventure game in which players can walk, jump and interact with various NPCs and objects. There are currently 4 levels in total and the goal of each level is to find the transportation portal to move on to the next level. An Easy Game, at a first glance, seems extremely easy as the name suggests. But in reality, the game is full of traps and requires players\u2019 thinking out of the box to complete. Worry not, there are signs to guide the player on the road. And the traps are never tedious or cliche but funny and creative.</p>\n<p>The visual style is similar to that of the 90s 2D classics such as the Mario Series, but the color is darker and is of more contrast. There are no stories or plots in An Easy Game, and each level is currently independent other than the player\u2019s increased awareness of possible traps == However, the signs may contain allegories that reflect the theme and hint on the correct way.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T16:14:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/708/708503b0c1f770cf5a159b1df7ba1da4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["juszhan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
