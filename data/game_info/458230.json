So it became a very relaxing mosaic creator. Just for fun I added physics so you can see it fall apart.</p>\n<p><strong>What you can do</strong></p>\n<p>Subdivide the figures as much as you want by <strong>clicking on it</strong>. You can also\u00a0<strong>click on the black box at the bottom </strong>to see the structure fall apart.</p>\n<p>Every try will\u00a0be different! Use the <strong>Restart </strong>button as many times as you want.</p>\n<p><strong>How is it done</strong></p>\n<p>This is all done using Splines and polygon colliders. Every time a figure is divided a new vertice (sometimes 2) is created and the points passed to a method that assigns these to both Components.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Half of what happens is on players choices (where they click). The other half (color, subdivision sides in certain cases) is randomized.</p>\n<p><strong>If you liked it</strong></p>\n<p>Relax, enjoy and if you like it, leave a comment, a dollar or a\u00a0\"hi!\" at @ossetegames.
