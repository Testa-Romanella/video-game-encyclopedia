Therefore, in order to create a better and simpler game in the allotted three days, we used simple 3D game concepts. If you see any errors or have any input, please let us know in the comments so that we may fix them and make future 3D game development even better.</p>\r\nNote\r\n<p>In the PC version, a smoke puff will appear when the player moves, however in the webGL version, it won't. So, for a better gaming experience, use the PC version! Just a suggestion, you can also choose to play either one !</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ol><li>Parven - Programming , Designing</li><li>\u00a0DeadPool - 3D modelling ,\u00a0 Artist</li></ol>\r\nHonourable Mentions\r\n<p>Music -\u00a0https://soundimage.org/looping-music</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T08:16:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e6/3e6cfb5dd0e971505b31083ebb23dc32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Parven", "Deadpool64"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
