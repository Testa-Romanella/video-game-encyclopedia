{"id": 470039, "slug": "head-to-the-exit", "name": "Head to the Exit", "name_original": "Head to the Exit", "description": "<p>Welcome to your\r\nlocal carnival dark ride.\u00a0</p><p>It's a family-run business, so don't be surprised if\r\nit breaks down. Just stay in your vehicle. Whatever you do, don't get out and\r\nlook for an exit.<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0This game is\r\ninspired by my irrational fear of having to walk out of a haunted house or ride\r\nduring a breakdown. I love dark rides, but I've always been scared of those\r\nsmaller establishments in the middle of nowhere. Imagine if you decided to\r\nvisit one on a whim without telling anyone where you went\u2026 no one would know\r\nwhere to look for you\u2026\u00a0</p>\n<p>At least this ride has multiple exits...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>\n<ul> <li>Move mouse to look around     when ride breaks down</li> <li>Press [Space] to start, leave     cart, or walk</li> <li>[C] for captions</li> <li>[Q] to quit</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Accessibility Notes:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul> <li><strong>Audio: </strong>Press [C] to toggle     captions on or off. Sound effects, music and dialogue are all displayed     visually.</li> <li><strong>Motor: </strong>The game only uses the     space key and mouse movement. There are no quick time events or hold     events.</li> <li><strong>Visual: </strong>All events in the     game have voice over, sound effects and music. However there are no text     to speech descriptions of the different sections of the ride. I hope to     build this feature for future games, sorry it didn't make it into this     one.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Credits list:</p>\n<ul> <li>All 3D models, design and development by prettysmart games</li><li>Circus Waltz by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link:\u00a0https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3509-circus-waltz<br/>License:\u00a0http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</li><li>\"horror stress tension\" by brainclaim</li><li>\"water swirl small\" by inspector j</li> <li>Fonts: Amatic SC and     Permanent Marker</li><li>Made for the Two-Minute\u00a0Horror Jam.\u00a0Awesome idea for an event!\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/two-minute-horror-jam</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T06:55:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28c/28c588041d2192702709a23fa90dbe20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["prettysmart"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
