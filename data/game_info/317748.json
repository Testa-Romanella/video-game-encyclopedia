Destroy the galactic forces of evil and collect power ups along the way.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>I made this game waaay back just for fun and want\u00a0to try game development. This was the first time that I used a game engine. Back then I would just write the code for the simple games I made like\u00a0tic-tac-toe or 2048\u00a0and then run it on the command prompt.</p>\n<p>Growing up, I can only\u00a0play games on nokia 3310 (those old bulky phones that are as hard as rock and would take years to fully drain the battery) because we don't have any game console. There were a handful of games\u00a0and one of those is Space impact. I love how simple the gameplay and visual are and thought that this would be easy to make. But since it's my first time, it did not go smoothly.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the countless tutorials and stock sprites, I made a game in Unity. It was really nice and fulfilling to make a game that I want and that I am proud of. Showing it off to my friends, made them play it, and ask for feedback is great. Hoping that you guys would also play and write any comment, suggestions, or violent reaction to this. :D\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/846/8465a0e69567547ac2bd06e9682ca13c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CPOrt"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
