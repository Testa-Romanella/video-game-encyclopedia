On that PC, you'll be able to play some mini-games (classify files, fix bugs, calculus...). All these activities will make you earn happiness points.</p>\r\nFun\r\n<p>You are bored to work? No problem, you can enjoy many things to do in the office. You can buy a soda or a snack, eat a burger or make a coffee and it is recomended to do it often or you're gonna have problems.\u00a0You can also have a walk outside to play basketball or smoke a cigarette if you're a smoker (we encourage you no to smoke and find other ways to be happy).</p>\n\r\nCoffee\r\n<p>A good developper drinks a lot of coffee.

You will find the toilets down the hall. Try to keep your workspace clean.
