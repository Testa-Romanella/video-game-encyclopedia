No drive-able helos are planned atm<br/>- the sun's position is incorrect on purpose<br/>- vehicle's type (brdm-1) in not period-correct<br/>- the turbines are totally out of place (I'm looking for better data)<br/>- currently project uses static/baked shadows<br/>- known bug: ladders could be glitchy sometimes<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T07:35:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0c/b0c7857abc79832a6aaa9f1222180223.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["exo7341"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
