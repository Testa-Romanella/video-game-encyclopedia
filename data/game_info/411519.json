The following mod requires an official copy of Undertale! This CANNOT be played without owning the game!</strong>\n<p>______________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>Welcome to Unaltered, the MMO-RPG where nobody has to die! This fan-made modification for the hit indie title \"Undertale\" adds online multiplayer interactions, so you can experience the game with your friends! It uses an extension known as\u00a0<em>GameMaker Server,</em>\u00a0which other fan-made products such as\u00a0<strong>Undertale: Don't Forge</strong>t use, so if you made an account for those games, the very same account will work on this game.</p>\n<p>This is a project I've been working on for quite a long time, so I really hope you all enjoy what it has to offer! Installing &amp; getting the game to run is a bit complicated, so instructions are further in the description.</p>\n<p>______________________________________________________________________</p>\n\n<ul><li>The full Undertale experience! Defeat enemies the way you want to!</li><li>Custom sessions so you can play with a friend, or publicly!</li><li>Showing each other's SOUL in battle for confusing yet amusing brawls!</li><li>Toggleable nametags, so you can experience the game classic with friends without any big text in your face! (Press the \"O\" key to do this!)</li><li>Many,\u00a0<em>very many</em>\u00a0dogs.</li></ul>\n<p>______________________________________________________________________</p>\n\n<p>1.) Open Steam, go to Undertale, right click on the game and press \"properties.\"</p>\n<p>2.) Go to \"Local Files\" and then click \"Browse Local Files\".</p>\n<p>3.) Locate the \"data.win\" file. I HIGHLY recommend renaming to something like \"data - undertale\" so you can play the normal game at a later date, and so it's not overwritten by the new \"data.win\" file.</p>\n<p>4.) Drag in all contents of the \".zip\" file that is listed on this page, into the UNDERTALE folder.</p>\n<p>5.) Launch \"Unaltered.exe\".</p>\n<p>6.) Once in the game, either register or log-in if you already own an account.</p>\n<p>7.) On the main UNALTERED menu, press \"create save file.\" It will give you a prompt letting you know it successfully created. (If you don't do this, the game will crash when you try to press \"begin game\"!)</p>\n<p>8.) Join/create a custom session of your choosing!</p>\n<p>9.) Once on the regular Undertale menu, press RESET. Pressing CONTINUE will cause the game to bring you to the dog debug screen.</p>\n<p>10.) Enjoy your online Undertale experience!</p>\n<p>______________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>This project was months in the making, and I even put out a video of me and friends beta testing the game a few months ago, which you can check out\u00a0here!</p>\n<p>If you have any questions or would like to support me, join my\u00a0Discord Server!</p>\n<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>\n<p>______________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>#multiplayer\u00a0#mod\u00a0#undertale\u00a0#online</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-10T04:28:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6eb/6eb34b093fe856a2ef57adc94fd48853.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheLandimizer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
