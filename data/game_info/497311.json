The goal of the player is to have their minions reach the other side of the arena and blow out their opponents candles, the first player to blow out 3 candles wins.<br/></p>\n<p>Conjurer's Clash was made by a group of students for a small college game jam, the theme being \"Magic\". <br/></p>\n<p>Many features are still missing and bugs need to be squashed. We plan to update the game to fix these issues as well as improve it if and when we can.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Charles Farrelly - Art\u00a0</p>\n<p>Connor Shaw - Music &amp; Writing<br/></p>\n<p>Lewis Bonner - Programing<br/></p>\n<p>Morgan Fitch -\u00a0Art<br/></p>\n<p>Richard Ross - Sound<br/></p>\n<p>Thomas Williams\u00a0-\u00a0Programing</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T05:22:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99e/99e79503488ad1b552aeb4ee6de9d45a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Thomas Williams"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
