I decided to base the game as a tribute to one of my favorite anime of all, Cowboy Bebop. It's easy to play, just use your mouse to control the position of the ship (The Swordfish) and shoot down as many enemies as possible! Thank you for taking the time to check this out!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e43/e4322b043784dbfd6ce811b35c35c8c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gear_Fourth"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
