I was stuck in a creative rut this week. I ran out of design ideas, but I came out with an arcade inspired game that has a lot of potential. I made a game about serving coffee to revive the sleep deprived / coffee dependent commuters. Instead of making a compelling mechanic about the act of serving (which I should have done) I focused on the system of making the coffee (which I shouldn\u2019t have done). I wanted to integrate the level design into how the player made and served the coffee, but it was too confusing. I had multiple iterations, but I went with the most experimental of the designs which had the ingredients in the center of the coffee shop. I went through many design iterations, but I believe at this point in the weeks I was a bit burnt out. If I were to continue working on this, I would fix the level design and add a combo and coffee stacking mechanic allowing players to plan out their path through the crowd of sleepy, coffee starved commuters. They say the best way to get out of a creative rut is to make something, and they were right, whoever \u201cthey\u201d are.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-22T04:03:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b16/b16ee13e5ae54d08dbcdd3a7d98d99ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["John Wanamaker"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
