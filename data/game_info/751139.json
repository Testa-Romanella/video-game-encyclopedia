You can also give up for the day and restart with \"R\", or give up the title with escape.<br/>How many you captured is instinctively known to you at the end, but also how many you missed. Oh well, at least the next day will bring different clouds with different birds...<br/>Made for the 358th One Hour Game Jam</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T06:45:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/055/05582772262100ae3709a295941b6102.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FlamingFossa"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
