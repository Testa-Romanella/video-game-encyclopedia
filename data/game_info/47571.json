Between rounds you can upgrade your abilities to have a better chance of surviving the next round. Different level effects will also come into the mix with events like blowing winds that will push the boxes around or a blackout that will prevent your vision for a time. Collect powerups to do things like slowing down time or shrink your box to have a better chance of survival.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68f/68f7eedef9041a7cd999dd802afa2711.jpg", "website": "http://www.varagtp.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 29}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 35, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VaragtP"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["VaragtP"], "esrb_rating": null}
