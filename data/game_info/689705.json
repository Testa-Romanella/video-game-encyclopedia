It is suggested that the game is played in fullscreen as well.</p>\n<p>This is a game featuring a wizard, you're goal is to get the trophy as quickly as you can making your way up the tower. The basic idea is, you can turn left or right.. Which you can use to affect your potion throw, oh yeah about that.. Potion throws are what allows you to move, Wizards tend to get old and lazy walking is for smucks.. Hold space to build up a throw and on relaese you will throw your potion and land where it hits.\u00a0Stay aware of the turret, as\u00a0 they can affect your throwing range. Best of luck and enjoy.</p>\n<p>VideoClip link:VideoClip Link here</p>\n<p>Desktop Builds;</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Windows</strong>:\u00a0Windows Build of the game (.exe)</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Credits *more detailed breakdown in game</strong>;</p>\n<ul><li>Programming: Kelvin</li><li>Art: Tom, Rory, Sevon, Billy, Kelvin</li><li>Design: Tom, Rory, Sevon, Link, Kelvin</li><li>Music: Kelvin</li><li>Write up and video: Kelvin.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Sources used</strong>;</p>\n<ul><li>Scene Mangagers:\u00a0https://docs.unity3d.com/530/Documentation/ScriptReference/SceneManagement.Scene...</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Angles in Unity:\u00a0https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Quaternion.Euler.html</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Static Variables in C#:\u00a0https://answers.unity.com/questions/419145/how-to-acess-static-variable-in-other...</li><li>Particle systems in unity:\u00a0https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/introduction-to-particle-systems#</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Mathf unity library:\u00a0https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mathf.html</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Programs used</strong>;</p>\n<ul><li>Blender:https://www.blender.org/</li></ul>\n<ol><li>UV Mapping</li><li>Model Clean Up</li><li>Testing Textures</li></ol>\n<ul><li>3DS Max:https://www.autodesk.co.uk/products/3ds-max/overview</li></ul>\n<ol><li>3D Models</li></ol>\n<ul><li>Unity:\u00a0https://unity.com/</li></ul>\n<ol><li>Game Engine</li><li>Game Building</li></ol>\n<ul><li>LMMS:\u00a0https://lmms.io/</li></ul>\n<ol><li>Game Music</li><li>Game Sound Effects</li></ol>\n<ul><li>Krita:\u00a0https://krita.org/en/</li></ul>\n<ol><li>Textures</li><li>Concept Art</li></ol>\n<ul><li>Aseprite:\u00a0https://www.aseprite.org/</li></ul>\n<ol><li>Textures</li><li>Sprites</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T08:37:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/893/893f70e3996d0b0505f12e5b5e71d760.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kelvin T", "Tom Laughlin", "Link_Hudson", "Rory"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
