It works on my laptop, but probably nowhere else. Everything is sort of tied to the central loop, but not well. <br/></p>\n<p> Also unfortunately, the way the sound code worked, I couldn\u2019t easily change the speed of the game or the number of loops is did while playing the music \u2013 in a bizarre situation which I can\u2019t ever recall understanding, the game synced itself to the music being played and was locked at that speed. Meaning on slower machines it went all weird \u2013 if you drop the cycles, you suddenly gain a double jump because the timing has gone off. You can double jump by clipping the edge of the platform, and to win you need to jump and double back on yourself at one point (which is technically impossible in the real world once you have momentum, but if Mario can do it!), then jump over a snake hidden on one platform, reach the upper right and jump over the end of the screen to land near the gold mask. There\u2019s some cool scaling effects when you grab it, based on increasing the length of the DRAW command.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T03:56:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65c/65c55f9551728c9c42a736e2595295c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SZCZ GAMES"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
