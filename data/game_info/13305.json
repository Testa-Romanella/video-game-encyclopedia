It is the 3rd person action adventure with an accent on exploring and hunting<br />\nDuring the new installment, the player is set to make way through the American Revolution, while being on both side of a conflict \u2014 our hero has English father and Mohawk mother, which tears him apart. Such conflicts serve as the leitmotif through the entirety of a game \u2014 not only we are choosing sides to fight on in the Civil War, but also we are facing the decisions of choosing Assassins&#39; or Templar&#39;s side.<br />\nAs it is common in the Assasin&#39;s Creed games, the gameplay concentrates profoundly around fighting the multiple enemies all at once, parkouring off walls and micro-management: selling resources, exchanging ships and so on. The Assassin&#39;s Creed III, however, highlights the hunting and simultaneous use of two weapons as the new in-game features.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2012-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-21T19:51:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/275/2759da6fcaa8f81f21800926168c85f6.jpg", "website": "http://assassinscreed.ubi.com/ac3/", "rating": 3.74, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 272, "owned": 3644, "beaten": 2491, "toplay": 157, "dropped": 467, "playing": 51}, "playtime": 22, "achievements_count": 122, "ratings_count": 2058, "suggestions_count": 453, "game_series_count": 19, "reviews_count": 2078, "platforms": ["Wii U", "Xbox 360", "PlayStation 3", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["Ubisoft Montreal"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Ubisoft Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
