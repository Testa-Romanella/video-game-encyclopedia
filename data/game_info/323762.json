You must survive a practice wave, to make it into the fun part: ENDLESS! You must survive an endless wave of robotic hordes, that will have random delays in spawning. The West is rough, there are no healing items or ammo crates, and as such, you get your ammo maxed out every now and then during the infinite wave.</p>\n<p>This game will be updated for quite a while, and these updates may include:</p>\n<ul><li>Turrets</li><li>Ability to play as a robot</li><li>Changes to the robots, and their AI</li><li>Kill streaks</li><li>Multiplayer</li><li>Achievements</li><li>Leaderboards</li><li>Tutorial Levels</li><li>More weapons</li></ul>\n<p>Make sure to stay tuned for these updates!
