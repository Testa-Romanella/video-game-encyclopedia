{"id": 331, "slug": "militia", "name": "Militia", "name_original": "Militia", "description": "<p>Militia is a bite-sized turn-based strategy game that brings the thrill of victory to single-player. It&#39;s simple to pick up, and from the moment you start, you&#39;ll be learning and improving -- building your skills, learning new strategies, and ranking up on the single player ladder. And as you do, the game evolves with you, providing a worthy challenge every time. Militia also features procedurally generated levels so the challenge stays fresh.<br />\nIn Militia, you are the leader of a small troop of warriors, mages and cavalry and attempt to rout the local marauding banditry by dispatching their captains. Gameplay is turn based; on your turn you can issue one command to each of your units, and then the enemies each move on their turn according to strict and transparent movement rules.<br />\nNOTE: Includes Dark World expansion content for free (The Dark World is a separate and advanced game mode with its own heroes, enemies and ladder).<br />\n&quot;[Militia] might be the best single player strategy game I&#39;ve played this year.&quot; -Keith Burgun (Lead designer of Auro, Dinofarm Games)<br />\n&quot;Militia is potentially a true star for strategy gamers.&quot; - PlayPlayFun<br />\n&quot;Really digging this so far. It&#39;s like a party-based Hoplite.&quot; - IndieGameHunt (Game Jolt editor)<br />\n&quot;It&#39;s like chess. Except much better.&quot; - Game Jolt review</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-15T21:31:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c44/c44f37b8dfd321715d68515399a37c0f.jpeg", "website": "http://www.braingoodgames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 77, "beaten": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 14, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "iOS", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["BrainGoodGames", "Brett Lowey"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["BrainGoodGames", "Brett Lowey"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
