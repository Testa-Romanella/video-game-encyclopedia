Free of any form of language, all interactions involve visual and auditory symbols. From there, viewers are encouraged to create their own interpretations.</p>\n<p>Visual aesthetics and pleasant, meditative ambient music are emphasized to create a sense of harmony. The environmental design and architecture also reflects the dreamlike quality of existing fantasy worlds found in digital games. The lighting is exaggerated to make the environment feel more dynamic, and also gives the viewer a hint as to where to proceed to the next area. Glowing interactive artifacts and portals fill the screen with light and transport the viewer upon interaction.</p>\n<p>Originally created with Erika D. and Ziyi W.<br/> I later on improved much of this project by myself, re-creating new art, visual effects, and adding new music.</p>\n<p>The music was created by Self-Healing Collective.<br/></p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Keyboard (WASD) and Mouse to walk and look around.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T13:20:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a69/a69cabeef106227266b7f36f6da01122.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 425, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["alienfae"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
