{"id": 102397, "slug": "kinesis", "name": "Kinesis (itch)", "name_original": "Kinesis (itch)", "description": "<p>\r\n\tEver wanted to choke a teddy bear with one hand, while wreaking death and destruction with the other?\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tWell...now you can anyway.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tYou're inside a virtual reality simulation. Enemies will spawn from the glowing areas on the ground. Get them all before they get you! There are 4 levels which increase the number of enemies spawned - the difficulty ramps up fairly quickly.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAn experiment with the Oculus Rift DK2 and Leap Motion. This was a solo project; please excuse the programmer art.<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tHere's a video of the first level:\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>Powers<p>\n<strong>Push</strong>: pushes enemies outwards within a cone up to one square away. Has a short cooldown per hand.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tGesture: hold hand up, open palm facing outwards, and push it forwards quickly. For enemies right up close, you'll have to aim slightly downwards.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Pull</strong>: pulls enemies in within a cone up to one square and a half away. Has a short cooldown per hand.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tGesture:\r\n\t hold hand up, open palm facing inwards, and pull it towards you quickly.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Lift</strong>: lifts the target enemy and others in a small radius into the air\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tGesture:\r\n\t target an enemy by looking at them, then bring your hand up quickly, palm facing up.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Grab</strong>: grabs the enemy by the throat. Medium damage. You can also move the target around and smash it into other enemies.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tGesture:\r\n\t target an enemy, then make a fist quickly. Release the fist, or move the hand out of sensor range to release the grab. Note that additional targeting is disabled while a grab is active.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Lightning</strong>: Zaps enemies you point it at within a short range. High damage. The lightning duration depends on the amount of charge you have stored, which you regain over time. You need at least half charge to be able to trigger it.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tGesture:\r\n\t hold hand up relaxed (not totally open or closed), then open your hand/splay your fingers quickly.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe wristband on your left hand is a replacement for the traditional HUD\r\n\t. It shows your health (red), lightning charge (blue), and the kills required to finish the level (green). Also beeps on low health. Currently it can't be moved to the right hand or the size changed, but it's a feature I'd like to add later.<br/>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>Interference tips<br/>\n<p>\r\n\tThere are a few sources of interference which may cause the Leap Motion to behave weird, such as hands moving or spawning into weird positions. Some common ones are:\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><ul>\n<li>the reflection off your monitor</li>\n<li>the corners of your monitor<br/>\n</li>\n<li>the walls of the room, if you're too close<br/>\n</li>\n<li>anything made of glass</li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tTry to avoid facing these if you can. Note that levels 3 and 4 spawn enemies in a 270- and 360-degree arc, so make sure you also give yourself enough room to spin around.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>Credits<p>\r\n\tModels from Mixamo and the Unity Asset store.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSounds from \r\n\twww.freesound.org and www.freesfx.co.uk.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tVoice audio was created using YAKiToMe.com.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tMusic is 'Investigation' by Eric Matyas of \r\n\twww.soundimage.org, and 'BlinkWorld' and 'Electrode' by DST of www.nosoapradio.us.<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3e/c3e2fc9da7a29b9acb0c86b653cce690.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["messingaround"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
