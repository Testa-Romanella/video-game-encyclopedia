Press \ud83c\udd7e\ufe0f/\u274e to select an item, then press the direction you want the item to swap with and press \ud83c\udd7e\ufe0f/\u274e\u00a0again. If you wish to deselect the tile, press \ud83c\udd7e\ufe0f/\u274e on the original tile again. The current tile and\u00a0the selected tile are separated by an orange plate and a pink plate respectively.\u00a0<strong>You can move items even if the moved item won't match with anything.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is a usual Match-3 or Candy Crush Soda Saga\u00a0game. You have to satisfy an amount of orders to play. Whenever you match a line of three goods\u00a0horizontally or vertically, 1 order gets satisfied.</p>\n\n<p>Whenever you match a line of four goods horizontally or vertically, you will trigger its ability while satisfying 2 orders at once. Any one than four goods horizontally or vertically in a line satisfies 3 orders! If you are able to satisfy all the orders after you use up all your moves, you win, else, you loose the game.</p>\n\n<p>Every time you match a line of four goods (or more) horizontally or vertically, you gain a \u2b50. You only collect all the \u2b50s if you are able to satisfy the orders. If you have a certain amount of \u2b50s, you unlock more goods with more abilities!</p>\n<p><strong>\u266a Can you collect all the sets of goods?\u00a0\u266a</strong></p>\r\nCredits &amp; Motivation\r\n<p>The game was made by, me D3V?, of course, using Pico-8\u00a0under 2-3 weeks. The music was made by Gruber Music, it came from his Pico Tunes Vol.1 Pack, using the 'Villager' tune. Credit to\u00a0Cmrn.io for \"letting\" me use their game,\u00a0Match-3 as a template, my little brain could not have made one myself.</p>\n\n<p>I had thought of making some kind of match game (with a cat of course, as cats are the main theme of my non-jam games till now)during my vacation, and threw out some ideas from my head to my notebook. There some more ideas I created,\u00a0both for the abilities and the goods, which I wanted to implement,\u00a0but I was running out of code and sprite space in Pico-8, (and motivation) to do it. However, in my opinion, the product is alright.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\u2665 Also, thanks to you for playing my game!\u00a0\u2665</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T11:08:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5f/c5fe9e4568d6d6270db692ab5cc2c31c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["D3V?"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
