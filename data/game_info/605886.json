As Blume, a nervous geologist, you will alternate between environnemental puzzles and low-gravity jumps to transform your fear and stress into awe and happiness. Pharell will be your back-up in your adventures, but don't count too much on him ... You will have to get out by yourself !</p>\n\n<p>This game has been realized within the framework of the Master  \"Immaterial Project\" of the National Superior School of Architecture of  Versailles.\r\n </p>\n<p>Students work in groups of 3 and have two months to produce their  game. They have never worked on UE4. They don't know how to program.  This is their first experience as developers.\r\n </p>\n<p>They used the design workflow of the architecture industry to make it.\r\n </p>\n<p>You may encounter some bugs. Thank you for your understanding and have fun.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T05:22:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fda/fda1908aa8599a675a107c7afa346635.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ENSA-Versailles Studios", "Patrocle Petitbeurre"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
