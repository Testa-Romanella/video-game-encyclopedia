The town's people love her for her outgoing, relaxing, and helpful personality, but it seems she was born with bad luck sometimes! She <strong>always</strong> seems to find herself in the middle of less than ideal situations. <em>This story tells of how Maria accidentally became a bullfighter and how she will eventually become one of Mexico's greatest of all time.</em> <br/><br/>In this short <strong>5-8 minute demo</strong>, use positioning and well-timed dodges to steer robotic bulls into breakable terrain for damage. Designed to be easy yet hard to master, players must dodge and collect special food to get a <strong>higher rating score</strong> than the competition! <em>As you progress through the game, they will experience the game\u2019s identity of Mexican culture as its heart and core.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T10:18:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f0/0f0693a5407a7c73106e01437c682765.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gameheads"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
