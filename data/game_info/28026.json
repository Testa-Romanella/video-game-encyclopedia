{"id": 28026, "slug": "super-mario-odyssey", "name": "Super Mario Odyssey", "name_original": "Super Mario Odyssey", "description": "<p>Super Mario Odyssey is a 3D platform game, a part of Nintendo\u2019s Super Mario series. </p>\n<h3>Story</h3>\n<p>The game follows Mario on his quest to save Princess Peach from her forced marriage with Bowser. The game starts with Mario fighting Bowser on its aircraft. Bowers knock Mario off the ship and shreds his cap into pieces. Mario awakens in the Cap Kingdom inhabited with hat-like spirits and befriends one of them named Cappy. It turns out, Bowser also kidnapped Cappy\u2019s sister Tiara, and now the heroes must chase Bowser through several kingdoms to save Peach and Tiara. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gameplay of Super Mario Odyssey draws inspiration from Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine. The game consists 17 levels (named as \u201ckingdoms\u201d). In most of them, your goal is to collect a certain amount of Power Moons. Collecting enough of them allows the player to progress to the next kingdom. Some moons can be found in different parts of the level or acquired as a reward for completing certain tasks or challenges. The Mario\u2019s moveset mostly resembles that of Super Mario 64 and includes wall jumps, triple jumps, somersaults, long jumps, rolling on the ground. The main new gameplay feature is that Mario can throw his hat to create temporary platforms, grab objects, attack enemies, or possess them. Possessing enemies gives you new moves and sometimes is necessary to reach certain parts of the level.</p>", "metacritic": 97, "released": "2017-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-18T21:20:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/267/267bd0dbc496f52692487d07d014c061.jpg", "website": "https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/super-mario-odyssey-switch", "rating": 4.44, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 190, "owned": 717, "beaten": 1796, "toplay": 455, "dropped": 204, "playing": 262}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1820, "suggestions_count": 459, "game_series_count": 17, "reviews_count": 1851, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Nintendo"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
