Whenever you turn it on you cannot move, while some enemies may still move.</p>\n<p>It was a great project and actually my first platformer in ages! I had a 3 week old daughter at home that was only sleeping at my lap, so I did most of the game single handed (literally) and while sleep deprived. Upside is that I had a lot of \"free\" hours to work on it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-27T03:54:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88f/88f32d494b5c98584bdc6f7ae93eb48b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TinyGamesLab"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
