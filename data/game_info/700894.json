Regardless of the game's very extensive shortcomings, we still had a blast. The NESness of the game is pretty okay, graphically speaking our palettes colors are spot on. We may have a color or two more than the NES could handle. Maybe it would need the later chipsets that could palette swap mid batch. I\u00a0think our sprite draw calls would have been the standard\u00a0\u00a08x8 groups of 4. Didn't get around to putting in any flickers.</p>\n<p><strong>Background of the Cartridge</strong></p>\n\n<p>I want to know if anyone else has seen a copy of this cartridge before.\u00a0Fair warning, my knowledge of this cartridge is second hand, not even that reliable when told to me, and I don't even remember all I was told.\u00a0</p><p>I do intend to bore you with how I came to have it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>One summer\u00a0when I was eleven, my family drove up to Prince Edward's island for a vacation. They wanted to go whale watching, or atleast that's all I was told about beforehand. I barely remember any of it. What little I do remember of whale watching\u00a0mostly consists of\u00a0cold salt water splashing directly into\u00a0my eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>At the risk of sounding like, well, the nerd I\u00a0am, what I\u00a0remember most was that there was a bunch of souvenirs\u00a0with a particular anime on it.\u00a0\u00a0An anime I didn't recognize, at all, which turned out to be\u00a0based on Anne of Green Gables. Anne of Gables is a famous novel which was written by a native of the island,\u00a0L. M. Montgomery, and takes upon the island\u00a0as well.\u00a0Apparently the novel was incredibly popular in Japan and many of the knicknacks sported the resulting anime. I didn't see any Japanese people actually there, but perhaps Japanese tourism there is seasonal. Anyway,\u00a0I\u00a0bought a Anne of Green Gables\u00a0double-shot glass, to my parent's consternation, all in Japanese,\u00a0which I\u00a0imagine can only be marketed to a very special kind of salaryman. But that was all I really expected out of it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A day previously, however, I had started spending every free moment at the campground's arcade. It was a pretty big campground, with some cabins to rent as well, so the rec building was pretty well decked out. There were 5-6 standing cabinets, one enclosed rail shooter.\u00a0Anyway, the lady who ran the place\u00a0and I sorta became friends. She was very nice but chatty, and frankly I've always been unable to extridate myself from long conversations, even more so at that age. But it paid off in an unexpected way; the Carrot Girl cartridge.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After a few days of talking with her, I brought up how much I liked Japanese games, anime,\u00a0etc., (there's only so much conversation I have in me\u00a0that doesn't revolve around that). And ofcourse I mentioned the Anne of Green Gables anime paraphernalia I\u00a0had seen the day before.\u00a0At which point she told me that she wanted to give me something and left. She returned with this cartridge. She said that back in the early 90's,\u00a0a group of Japanese men had rented a cabin. There was one American from Seatle with them, he was a chaperone of sorts. She didn't remember the company, but the American told her they\u00a0were developing a game based on Anne of Green Gables. He was from the American office, they were the developers from Nagano(Nagoya? I forget what she said now, but definitely not Tokyo\u00a0or Kyoto). Basically the Montgomery estate was only going to let them make the game after seeing it. The American said the trip was more about telling the estate they were taking the book seriously, rather than really changing any of the gameplay. He seemed very skeptical they would get the license.</p>\n<p>The woman said the men brought a lot of electronics with them, and they were up really late in the night, playing video games she thought. Their stay ended after 5 days, and while she was cleaning the room, she saw this cartridge peaking out from under the television cabinet. It must have been missed while they were packing.\u00a0She tried returning it but the American (he booked the cabin) never returned her calls. Eventually he did answer and replied\u00a0he had left the company. The Montgomery estate had completely rejected the game, and the project was cancelled. No one noticed the missing cartridge and she could keep it. But she didn't want it, either. Her kids couldn't even figure out what console it was. I knew the Japanese Nintendo\u00a0was very different from the American, so while I had never even seen a famicom cartridge,\u00a0I\u00a0said it was probably that. She said it seems like I\u00a0should have it, then.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I've had it for more than twenty years now, and\u00a0I sorta always assumed it wouldn't work.\u00a0\u00a0But having finally bought both a nice crt and a famicom, I am surprised to confirm it still does. The cartridge condition is not just poor, it's strange.\u00a0It's missing a bunch of screws on the back. I\u00a0haven't opened it up. No idea on the chipset, etc. The label looks nice in the picture but it's not glossy like a production label would be. There's a lot of Japanese script written in permanent marker on the other side.\u00a0No idea why they called it \"You can do it,\u00a0Carrot Girl.\" That's the translate google gives me.\u00a0I've never read the Green Gable books so I\u00a0can't speak to anything like that. Will keep folks posted.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T04:24:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/982/9822e22fe1e3ac4767e0bcb638d8be54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SuperFlounder"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
