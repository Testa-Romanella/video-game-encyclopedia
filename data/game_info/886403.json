A week ago it was overrun by a parasite that turned everyone into zombies. The military was called in to cover up the disaster. Your goal is to leave the town. Before you can leave, you need to collect important supplies throughout the town. You will need to avoid the zombies. You have no weapons, but you do have your trusty candle.
