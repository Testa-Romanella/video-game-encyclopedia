It works a lot like Rock Paper Scissors, with added layers of complexity.</strong> <strong><em>Read the \"How To Play\" section below to find out more.</em></strong><br/></p><p>====Controls====<br/>Mouse/Touch Screen -- Interact with menu<br/><br/>==Player 1 (Left Side)==<br/>1 - Attack with Fire/Defend against Fire (Hold)<br/>2 - Attack with Ice/Defend against Ice (Hold)<br/>3 - Attack with Lightning/Defend against Lightning (Hold)<br/>4 - Feint (Hold)<br/></p>\n<p>==Player 2 (Right Side)==<br/>7 - Attack with Fire/Defend against Fire (Hold)<br/>8 - Attack with Ice/Defend against Ice (Hold)<br/>9 - Attack with Lightning/Defend against Lightning (Hold)<br/>0 - Feint (Hold)</p>\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>==Attacking==<br/></strong>When you see the\u00a0 Icon, press 1/2/3 (Left Side) or 7/8/9 (Right Side) to choose an Attack Element.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Attack   Element</strong>\n</p> <p>Beats\r\n      </p> <p>Button\r\n   (Left Side)\r\n      </p> <p>Button\r\n   (Right Side)\r\n     </p> <p><strong>Fire</strong>\n</p> <p>Ice\r\n      </p> <p>1\r\n      </p> <p>7\r\n     </p> <p><strong>Ice</strong>\n</p> <p>Lightning\r\n      </p> <p>2\r\n      </p> <p>8\r\n     </p> <p><strong>Lightning</strong>\n</p> <p>Fire\r\n      </p> <p>3\r\n      </p> <p>9\r\n     </p>\n<p>\r\n Once both players have chosen their Attack Element, the round begins. <strong>The player whose nameplate is flashing will cast their Element first.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Every time you land a hit, your Hitstreak (represented by the orange bar below your health bar) increases, meaning you deal more damage. If you \u201cmiss\u201d (a.k.a. your opponent\u2019s element beats yours), your Hitstreak is reset to 0. <strong>If both players cast the same Element, both players take damage.</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Hitstreak</strong>\n</p> <p>Damage Output\r\n     </p> <p><strong>0</strong>\n</p> <p>10\r\n     </p> <p><strong>1</strong>\n</p> <p>20\r\n     </p> <p><strong>2</strong>\n</p> <p>30\r\n     </p> <p><strong>3+</strong>\n</p> <p>40\r\n     </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>==Defending==<br/></strong>When you see the\u00a0 Icon, hold down the key corresponding to the Element you think your opponent will cast to defend against it. <strong>If you press it too early, your defense will fail.</strong> You must hold down the key through the moment your avatar is hit in order for the defense to register. If you\u2019ve guessed correctly, your defense is successful and you take half damage!\r\n  </p>\n<p>REMINDER: In any combination of Elements, there are always two which will cause you to take damage. You can change which Element you are defending against right up until you are hit. Keep in mind that if you are holding two or more defense keys down the moment you\u2019re hit, your Defense will fail.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>==Feinting==<br/></strong>If you are holding the 4 key (Left Side) or 0 key (Right Side) <strong>before</strong> your Attack Element is cast, you will feint, delaying your cast slightly. Use this to disrupt the pacing of the game and catch your opponent off guard, causing them to potentially attempt their defense too early.\r\n  </p>\n<p>TIP: If you are intending to Feint in the current round, begin holding your Feint key as soon as you select your Attack Element. That way, no matter if you cast first or second, you are guaranteed to Feint. <br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Pantheon a work in progress. Have a suggestion?
