It's only a prototype of an idea I had some time ago. It started as a study project using some assets from Mixamo and some assets and materials from some packages given by Epic Games, so my intent isn't selling this as a full game, just sharing some of my abilities.\u00a0It's not yet finished and it's not yet polished as well.</p>\n<p>It's my first time making a project all by myself (while trying to learn new things) and it has been a fun experience! I intend to make more levels (currently it has only one) with some platforming challenges to it as well.</p>\n<p>It was made with Unreal Engine 4, using some assets I got for free and some of them I made myself, using Blender.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Like I said, it's more like a project intended for studying and sharing some of my abilities, but you are free to donate if you want to incentivize an upcoming indie developer to continue developing.</p>\n<p>Thanks if you are downloading this to try out, sorry if it isn't what you expected and if you wanna give me feedback, my twitter is @JackBarboza4, you can DM me there and I'll be happy to answer!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T11:12:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b14/b1464b11a556e692f90f02c58f767f1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SamuraiJack1k99"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
