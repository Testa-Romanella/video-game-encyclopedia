Enjoy a fun challenging game that stimulates the mind with 25 levels!</p>\n\n<p>Split Shrink is an IOS Application created in XCode using Swift Storyboards out of a desire to put a game out using my skills.\u00a0 Once my Apple Developer License expired, I decided to convert the game to a desktop appliation using Godot 4.0.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The concept of the puzzle game is quite simple, as the goal is to reach 1.0 from the starting number using division, addition, and subtraction without ever going into decimal digits in the process. There are 25 levels, and each level gives 1 to 3 stars depending on the number of turns used.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game can be quite challenging, and also improves one\u2019s mental mathematical speed drastically. The game is free and contains no ads to play, so it is a great experience for all to enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Update Log:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>v1.0.0 (4/7/23): \"Split Shrink Official Release\"<ul><li>Launched game on Itch.io</li></ul></li><li>v2.0.0 (4/9/23): The \"Saving The Day\" Update<ul><li>Added level progress autosaving (upon level clear)</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T12:45:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd9/fd9052f2155a4bcb692a5c6d292d9b3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AdventureKO"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
