The windowing system and basic tile system was re-used from another game. All the gameplay, monsters, and items, and maps (except one)\u00a0were created during 7DRL.</p>\n<p>Originally I wanted to make the game more 'roguelike', but due to time constraints it ended up being more of a 'roguelite' with perk-based progression and static maps. However, I think it ended up being a decently fun game. I plan to continue working on an improved version\u00a0in the future. Thanks for playing!</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Game \u00a9 Kawaii Solutions.
