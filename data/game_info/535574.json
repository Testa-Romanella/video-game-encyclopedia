Through ignorance and gross incompetence, the pandemic became politicized, and what resulted became known as the greatest tragedy in human history\u2026<br/>=============================================================================================================================<br/>Play as a C.A.N. inhabitant who has just been released from cryogenic stasis 200 years after the atomic annihilation of the United States.<br/><br/>Your directives are clear: procure materials for the faction known as the Peace Keepers, aiding them in their mission to rebuild the surface world.<br/><br/>Craft, enhance tools/equipment, and establish your character's sense of S.E.L.F. within the post-apocalyptic caverns of the United States.<br/>=============================================================================================================================<br/>Craft electrical components, gunpowder, power cells, torches, repair kits, weapon upgrade parts, tool upgrade parts, high-tech components, scavenger robots, and mining robots. <br/><br/>Allocate points to S.trength to enhance your character's carry weight.<br/>Allocate points to E.ndurance to enhance your character's HP regeneration.<br/>Allocate points to L.ongevity to enhance your character's SP regeneration.<br/>Allocate points to F.ortune to enhance your character's mystery ore bag drop rates.<br/><br/>S.E.L.F. tabs also have a chance to drop from enemies, and can be found in troves throughout the caverns. These tabs permanently enhance your character's S.E.L.F. upon acquisition. <br/>=============================================================================================================================<br/>Progression in Amborettio is near-limitless, meaning that you can endlessly level-up, allocate S.E.L.F. points, and enhance your weapon and turret. Tool enhancement remains capped at level 100, but will provide more than enough resources at this level.<br/><br/>While in-game guides exist, Amborettio is nonlinear. There are many different ways you can achieve your goals and there is plenty of variety available for your character's S.E.L.F. build. Additionally, the in-game particle relay allows players to endlessly teleport to new and unexplored caverns, granting infinite mining ability and troves to explore. <br/><br/>By donating materials to the Peace Keepers, you unveil letters to three puzzles. Solving all three puzzles will uncover the truth about what happened on the day of the bombings, and will grant a special reward...<br/>=============================================================================================================================", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T02:40:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c1/6c1680cf5c53e835d8c51d0eed527d56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wanech"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Wanech"], "esrb_rating": null}
