All programming and art /3d assets was made by me. <br/>SFX generated in jfxr.frozenfractal.com<br/>Music licensed by Waterflame (https://waterflame.newgrounds.com/)\u00a0</p>\r\nDevelopment Notes\r\n<p>My second game jam ever, third-ish full/decent looking\u00a0game developed. I'm a lot more experienced than my first jam, but still in the beginner-intermediate transition. I already had an idea for a bullet hell shoot 'em up game but never took the time to start making it, and this jam was the perfect moment. Couldn't think of anything with the 10 Seconds, but I could at least\u00a0make a demo of my original idea. And the results are better than expected! Really fun working with shoot 'em up mechanics, specially bullet hell patterns. <br/>There's a lot more that I wanted to do and will do sometime, but for a 7-day game jam, this first level ended up really nice. This ain't going to be the last of Sky Overflow for sure!</p>\r\nKnown bugs\r\n<ul><li>FPS counter may or may not be right. Don't know for sure.</li><li>Bullet Counter was a testing feature, but I really liked so it ended up on the final game. But apparently it doesn't work properly, so\u00a0it can be totally wrong sometimes, lol</li><li>In the 6th wave, there's a lonely enemy. He's supposed to have 4 patterns and leave, but the first doesn't activate, so that's why he keeps static while doing nothing for a few seconds</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T05:16:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/548/548db5496f98e502c5bfdbfb78ae7eb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pedroaurelio_n"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
