Turned out to be super fun.</p>\n<p>Single Player</p>\n<ul><li>Count to 10. Find out where your dog is hiding. When you find him, the level will reload after 3 seconds.</li></ul>\n<p>Multi-Player:</p>\n<ul><li>Only one room will be allowed</li><li>Max players is 4</li><li>If anyone leaves mid game, might cause it to break</li><li>If you have any issues, everyone should quit and rejoin one at a time</li><li>When you start the match, 'seeker's' screen will go black for 10 seconds while all the other players go hide.</li><li>Players try to stay hidden for 180 seconds. After 180 seconds (+- 5 seconds), the base/safe will be displayed for the 'hiders' to run to before the 'seeker' can tag them.</li><li>First player that gets tagged, or the last player to get to base will be the 'seeker' in the next round</li></ul>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Move with WASD (or arrow keys to)</li><li>Use mouse to look around</li><li>Press SPACE to shrink down in size (makes it easier to hide)</li><li>You'll move slower when you are shrunk down</li><li>When shrunk, you move by flying, and you can only move forward in the direction you are looking.</li><li>If you are the seeker, get close enough to tag someone, make sure your white dot reticle is on them, then click your left mouse button to tag them.</li></ul><p>Assets Used:</p><ul><li>None of the art is mine. Everything except the dog is by Synty Studios. The Dog is by PolyPerfect.</li><li>Music by Eric Matyas\u00a0www.soundimage.org</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T04:24:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3a/a3acb436f165e13fae0143af9a1bf901.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mrphilipjoel"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
