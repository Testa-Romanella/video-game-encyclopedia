I really enjoyed the experience!</p>\n<p>My game is about a baby viking that loves killing monsters.<br/>When you kill a monster, it drops \"Monster essence\". Monsters feel atracted by Monster essence, so, the more you kill, more monsters spawn.<br/>You have to beat 4 bosses in order to win this game.
