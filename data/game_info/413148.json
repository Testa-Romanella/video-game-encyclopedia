Spin around as you try to keep up even though she'll definitely be running circles around you!\r\n</p>\n<p>Control the game by <strong>spinning around</strong> to follow the character, lively <strong>titling your head</strong> to the left to jump and tilting it to the right to fall down faster. Navigate through the menus with your gaze. The rest is up to you - and your balance! Just don't forget to whirl. Or swirl. Or, alternatively, twirl.</p>\n<p>This evergreen endless runner fun with a VR twist is compatible with all mobile virtual reality headsets based on the Google Cardboard platform, including 3rd party goggles - so just make sure you're in a safe environment (preferably with someone to assist you) and get down to spinning!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T02:14:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f36/f362409d2f9d4dc680ac6cefa380c9a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Katspybara"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
