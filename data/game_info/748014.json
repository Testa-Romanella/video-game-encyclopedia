{"id": 748014, "slug": "just-one-year-with-her", "name": "Just One Year With Her", "name_original": "Just One Year With Her", "description": "<p>In this game, you play as a man depressed after the worst year of his life, doomed to repeat it again if he can\u2019t tell the girl of his dreams how he feels on the one day he\u2019ll see her then, January 1st.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the\u00a0GDDC\u00a02022\u00a0Winter Game Jam. However, I was too busy over the weekend to finish it in time, so I'm releasing it now.<br/></p>\n<p>This game is best played with a writing supplement. I recommend making a copy of this\u00a0Google Sheet.<br/>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CwehIv-bhCoSFLAhCoHAQakfNrFeXTBQq8r_q7SeRxE/edit?usp=sharing</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you could make your own IRL. If you'd like,\u00a0on a large whiteboard, paper, drawing software, or other, draw the following. Make sure the boxes are large enough to be written in. It doesn\u2019t have to be exact, read further to get an idea of how to use this. The three sections can be separated if need be.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>To read through dialogue, press \u2018Enter\u2019. When an option comes up, type your choice and press \u2018Enter\u2019. When a character says out loud a certain keyword, write in the box connected to that word the scenario that lead to it being said. Once you feel you have enough information, connect the word to a certain emotion to ascertain what emotion they may be feeling when they say it subconsciously.\r\n</p>\n<p>\tTo clarify, \u2018Suspicious\u2019 means that person is suspicious <em>of</em> you, not suspicious <em>to</em> you. Each option for any given time should only connect to one keyword (Though notice there may be a difference depending on <em>when</em> you do something), except just one option that will depend on a specific circumstance.\r\n</p>\n<p>\tAfter a day, you\u2019ll be prompted to enter your current guesses into the game. Once you\u2019re finished, press \u2018Enter\u2019, and a random guess that was right will be marked permanently as correct. Press \u2018Enter\u2019 again to begin the next day. If all your answers are correct, a dialogue option might appear that day.\r\n</p>\n<p>\tPress \u2018Escape\u2019 to exit the game at any time. Your progress will NOT be saved.</p>\n<p>\tGood luck.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T14:36:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72f/72fb0c8e972ad957067c9146cc3c95d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SimanGuyman"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
