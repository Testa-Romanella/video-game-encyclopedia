So make sure you download Blender 2.79 from blender.org, whether its a Windows, Mac or Linux computer.(You could also try UPBGE, but I didn't test it with it) Also\u00a0I didn't build a binary only version(Sorry:(</p>\n\n<p>If you have any questions about this game or project, let me know. Right now I'm using it as a stepping stone for bigger, better projects and to maybe create some cool models to swap in for the basic primitives(or prefabs). \u00a0So far basic platforming mechanics are in this including pickups, \u00a0moving, jumping and simple animations along with audio(music too). Thing missing, score board, timers, and other objectives, \u00a0but I intend to add those in the future.\u00a0I hope you guys get something out of this project or even enjoy it.
