These are perfectly normal favors that any scout would ask of you. This game was made for VimJam 3 and was made using GB Studio, meaning that this game can run on a Game Boy! I'd like to thank Isaac Christopherson for the music and Eleanor Berg for the concept art. Everything else was made by me.  I hope you enjoy the game and any feedback is appreciated, thank you!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T12:23:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa2/aa20a34cf969a7ea8feff9e6f19722f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Curious Fox"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
