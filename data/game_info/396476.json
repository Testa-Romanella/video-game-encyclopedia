Bound is an autobiographical artifact\u00a0that exists to create an impactful experience for its players and encourage them to consider the\u00a0physical limitations that wearing a binder may impose on the transmasculine community. It\u00a0does this by recreating the mental and physical stress associated with running in a chest binder\u00a0through its exploration and rhythm game mechanics.</p>\n<p>Bound\u2019s narrative features an adult transgender man who returns home to go running on his middle school\u2019s public track. He has ignored the health and safety warnings on the packaging of his binder and decided to go on that run with it on. Eventually, he has trouble breathing and passes out on the track. This event is situated as a memory that the protagonist is recounting to a healthcare professional.</p>\n<p>Developer's blog</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T03:45:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0f/e0f8ab46e6b19a27a8030672c74edd3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Leo Bunyea"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
