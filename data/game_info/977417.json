It is a local multiplayer shared screen game which needs at least 2 players locally to play. Players control different Pirates and compete to win! How do you win? Nice and easy, just push your enemies of the arena or figure out what do with your Pirate powers. Enjoy the rush and excitement while you discover things really fast.<br/><br/><strong>Game Modes and Gameplay:</strong><br/>Jolly Rogers: Pirates Rumble has multiple game modes. You can start off with either a FFA Deathmatch (personal favorite) or team up with one of your buddies and play against your other buddies. There are multiple ways to kill your enemies in Jolly Rogers: Pirates Rumble, from pushing them off the map to bumping into them and damaging them or using the different ultimate powers. Watch out for map specific traps and obstacles too! Each Pirate has their own set hit points and rage points. Filling up the rage meter helps you unleash your ultimate power which for certain is to make your friends flee. Each mode has a different map with different fruit power ups (mentioned below) and sometimes traps spawning randomly.<br/><br/>We currently have 5 modes (more in development)<br/>Free For All \u2013 Every Pirate to himself! Your friendship will definitely be tested in this mode!<br/>King of the Map \u2013 There can be only one true King even among the Pirates!

Find out with your friends!<br/><br/><strong>Fruits and Power ups</strong> :<br/>Pick up fruits to get special power-ups, these powers are temporary and will make your Pirate powerful in special ways. They need to be activated precisely and fade away after a short while but fret not, these fruits spawn randomly until the session ends. <br/><br/>Use Y button (Xbox One controller) to activate a fruit after picking up. Some of the fruits are passive as well.<br/><br/>Listing couple of fruits below<br/><br/>Ice Fruit : On activating this fruit (next to them) your opponents are frozen for a short while.
