I didn't know what to do with it, so I uploaded it to the public.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>So to the game! Fight enemies in a arena, and try to survive as long as you can, and get the most kills you can! Customize your fighter, mostly with shirts, because there's only one hat. Have fun fighting.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>P.S. The game probarly won't get updated, but I would\u00a0appreciate that, if you would leave some feedback. So my game dev future would become better. Have fun!</strong></p><p><strong>Use WASD to move around and the Spacebar to swing the sword.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-28T03:02:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99f/99f7262c1acc20ec6961e597acbcb737.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Creeper Games"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
