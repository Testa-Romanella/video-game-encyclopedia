Not THAT Northpole, the proper Northpole, the home of Santa and all his magical Elves. Now Northpole the village is situated in a small magical valley, roughly somewhere in north Norway. Don't worry though normal humans can't find it, or see it, because, well Christmas magic of course.\u00a0<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>There's a situation, a kerfuffle if you will. See, as the Reindeer where being saddled up to the sleigh they suddenly took off. Like\u00a0 a scolded cat! Well it was actually only six of them. Santa sent Rudolph to round them up and bring them back, hopefully without a scratch on the sleigh. When they returned there was a problem. They'd lost some presents from the sleigh!</em></p>\n<p><em>An investigation by the Chief Elf of the Watch found that a deer had been struck by a rather sharp piece of coal. This is where you come in. . . . .\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>You suddenly feel a lot of eyes are looking at you. As you look up you see all the elves staring angrily. Santa too is staring at you, he seems furious as well. Then it dawns on you, you have a piece of coal in your hand, just rolling it around absently mindedly. \"Erm, oh, er, no, no it wasn't me, honest!\", you desperately say, trying to clear your name. It's not enough, Santa orders you to find the missing Presents or don't bother returning. You are marched to the border of the village and you walk off into the night to find some Presents. Good luck young Elf. May the magic of Christmas be with you.<br/><br/></em><strong>How to play</strong></p>\n<p>This is a text adventure with graphics.
