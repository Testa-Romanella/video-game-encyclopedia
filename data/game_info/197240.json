A\u00a0player can charge this and launch the ball; it's often possible to chip the ball over the trails of jam allowing it to quickly travel along the pitch.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb5/cb5882159cc09b3de7677cea334713c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kristiandixon"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
