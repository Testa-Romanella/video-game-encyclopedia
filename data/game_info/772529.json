Use R to run. Use X to pick yourself up. Use C to crouch. Use V to switch cameras.\u00a0Use spacebar to jump and progress dialogue.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Description:\u00a0</strong><em>Ever Strong </em>is a personal, touching experience that anybody can connect with, whether they struggle with ADHD or not. Concepts such as attention deficiency, frustration, hopelessness, and self-hatred are explored. The game empowers players by engendering perseverance, self-love, and togetherness.</p>\n<p><strong>Inspiration:\u00a0</strong>The lack of an authentic depiction of what people with ADHD and mental health challenges experience and the precipitous decline in mental health due to the pandemic inspired me to make the game. The theme is especially important to me because ADHD is something that I struggle with. </p><p><strong>Conveying the theme:\u00a0</strong>The theme is directly conveyed to the player through linear dialogue. Indirectly, the theme is conveyed through abstract level design, narrative cyclicity, and repetition in the game\u2019s original soundtrack. All of these design choices were made to further strengthen the game\u2019s message: Ever Strong.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T14:03:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5b/a5b9615b05bd3f6265f9790f97dfeb4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["arjun_sh"], "genres": ["Educational", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
