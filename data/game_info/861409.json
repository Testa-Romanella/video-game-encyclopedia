{"id": 861409, "slug": "breakers-world", "name": "Breakers World", "name_original": "Breakers World", "description": "Breakers World is a 3rd person sci-fi action-adventure RPG with team and base-building elements. On a barren planet, an oppressed class of people called \"Breakers\" are enslaved by a corporation, toiling long hours to salvage valuable scrap from decommissioned starships in exchange for food. When a young man named Jax finds a MindCore, an AI with the ability to build a new ship from scrap, he embarks on a dangerous adventure to escape the planet.<br/><br/>Players who enjoy exploring, fighting, and developing their own unique character archetype will enjoy Breakers world, as those elements are presented in a new and interesting way. The player follows the journey of a Core Hunter, an adventurer class with the ability to grow and develop in any way they choose, adding specialties and advanced skills from any of 10 skill trees.<br/><br/>Each skill tree is associated with the subsystems of a spaceship, such as engineering, weapons, sensors, and navigation, closely coupling beloved components of RPG games with the hard science of how a highly complex ship functions. The player finds additional \"System Cores\" in each wreck they explore, adding them to their power armor to further advance their skillset and abilities. Other core hunters, NPCs, are also after the valuable cores, and the player will confront them in each level, choosing whether to fight them and claim the cores they possess or recruit them to the player's crew.<br/><br/>To become more powerful, the player just needs to add cores and abilities to their character, but to win the game, they need to also use 5 cores to finish building each of the subsystems of their ship. They also need to recruit 5 core-enhanced crew members, one to operate each of their ship's completed subsystems.<br/><br/>Once the player's ship is completely built and staffed with a crew, they can escape the planet and win the game. However, they are racing against an invisible but ever-present threat, which is the planet's oppressive Management. The corporation that controls the breakers cannot allow their slave labor to achieve space-faring capability and actively hunts the player. The player must keep a low profile any way they can, killing core hunters who are loyal to management, being careful who they recruit to their own crew, and taking care to not betray information to the planet's curious and desperate citizenry.<br/><br/>The game is rendered with beautiful 3D environments and mocap animation, with fully cinematic dialog and state-of-the-art digital humans bringing the unique story world to life in rich detail.<br/><br/>The open-ended character customization and branching dialog choices provide meaningful choices and high replayability, as every single playthrough will be very different and there are many paths to both victory and defeat.<br/><br/>*****<br/><br/>The game is currently pre-alpha, with a team of more than 20 talented and passionate game makers bringing it to life. Check back often for updates, and message the team if you would like to be a playtester.<br/><br/>After release we will keep updating the game to fix any bugs for the next month.<br/>End of developmet is planned for October 31st, 2022.<br/><br/>*****<br/><br/>For more information and to keep up with development, follow the team on Discord.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T06:04:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4a/c4a00ff2526d14c7bf3d183b3f3627c3.jpg", "website": "https://www.cmdrpublishing.com/breakersworld", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 581, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zygobot Studios", "Double Thought Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CMDR Publishing"], "esrb_rating": null}
