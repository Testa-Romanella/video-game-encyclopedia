Your job is to protect the Dam from being eaten by the \u201cNibblers\u201d that move across the screen as well as preventing invasion of the city by either the \u201cZoomers\u201d or the \u201cDroppers\u201d</p>\n<p>UFO\u2019s move across the screen and are indestructible. They will spawn \u201cDroppers\u201d as they move from left to right and then will later come back for another pass over the city.</p>\n<p>Zoomers also appear randomly and will traverse the screen left to right as quick as they can move down to try and invade the planet.</p>\n<p>Additionally you should watch out for the clouds and their acid rain that can spill in light or heavy showers. Usually it\u2019s worth sacrificing your own shield to save the city but definitely shoot them out of the sky as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Periodically you will also see a \u201cGrabber\u201d who will announce his presence and try to lift you off the screen so that the city is defenceless.</p>\n<p>I blogged a lot during the development of this - and other games I\u2019ve been working on.
