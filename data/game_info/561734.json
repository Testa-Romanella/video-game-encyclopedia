I had a lot of fun and learned a good bit making the game. I'm not satisfied with many aspects of the final result, but I did what I could. The concept for the game is actually something I've been mulling over for a while now and this was the motivation I needed to get started. I'll most likely continue developing this into a full fledged game, so be\u00a0 sure to follow if you're interested.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You play as a genetic experiment that can split into and absorb copies of itself. Each copy can be controlled independently.\u00a0 Absorbing your copes multiplies your strength and mass. You must get through the series of tests being conducted by the facility that seems to have created you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>BIG NOTES:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>You can click on individuals to switch to controlling them.\u00a0</li><li>You can go into free cam mode by clicking 'R'.</li><li>There's an issue with newly split individuals not working with switches right away. Just walking away from the switch and back to it should fix this.\u00a0</li><li>If you can't pick something up or activate a button, you're probably too small.</li></ul>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>P - Pause menu (Has controls there as well)</p>\n<p>E - Interact/Pickup/Absorb</p>\n<p>F - Split</p>\n<p>Left Mouse - Control Individual/ Advance dialogue</p>\n<p>R - Free Cam</p>\n<p>WASD - Move player/ Camera when in free cam</p>\n<p>Right Mouse Button - Pan Camera when in free cam</p>\n\n<p>Link to git Repo:\u00a0https://github.com/Jarellh94/JarellBrackeysJam2021.git</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T07:33:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ee/1ee613046abb93a86e882011e024c2c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jarellh94"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
