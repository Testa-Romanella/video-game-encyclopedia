{"id": 429205, "slug": "endless-runner-evgenfuji", "name": "Endless Runner (evgeNfuji)", "name_original": "Endless Runner (evgeNfuji)", "description": "<p><strong><em>Endless Runner</em></strong> - game which is filled with retrowave style. In this magnificent game you will listen to music in the style of synthwave and run straight to a distant city in the cyber desert. The image will have a VHS effect and a resolution of 4:3. The game also has some Easter eggs. This is my first unity game project and I was very much inspired by the theme of retrowave.</p>\n<p>You will have to overcome obstacles on your way and collect coins. The game has no end, and roads with traps and objects are randomly generated. Collected coins can be spent in the store to unlock skins. The difficulty of the game is to control the character using the mouse to move. You can read tutorial in the game menu.</p>\n<p>Game may have many bags, and bad optimization. For a better gaming experience, play at 4:3 resolution with black bars or use windowed mode. I would prefer full-screen mode, but it has some problems. If you set a resolution with a height greater than your standard resolution, the image may be cropped. Also sometimes the image spreads to the entire screen, so you have to restart the game.</p>\n<p>I created an installer for the game. You can add a shortcut to your desktop. Uninstaller is located in the root directory.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T08:43:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b95/b95cd3170dae1e83a135f27cc061fc3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["evgeNfuji"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
