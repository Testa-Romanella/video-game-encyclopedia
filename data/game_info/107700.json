I hope you enjoy the demo! :)</p><p>\n<strong>DEVELOPMENT</strong></p><p>\r\n I am planning to set it up to be around 12 -15 ish levels. This is my 3rd time making a point and click game but this is the first time I'll be coding everything using AS3.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tHere are my two previous games - it was done using my client's engine but all art and level design is done by me.\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\t\tI am still constantly learning in this process!  If this goes well, I'll be looking a way to port it to android or iOS. I am new with this but eager to learn so any tips are much appreciated. Your support or donation is definitely appreciated!\r\n\t</p><p>\n<strong>Game Content:</strong>\n</p><ul>\n<li>10+ levels (still tentative as I go through making the levels)</li>\n<li>Achievements </li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02e/02e80e25bcc3555e867df8ddb309b652.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Enciel"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
