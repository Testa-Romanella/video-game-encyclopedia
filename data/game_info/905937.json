For instance spiders subjected to caffeine will make a more sparse web with a more irregular shape (for more info see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_of_psychoactive_drugs_on_animals). However, spiders on Meth are not concerned with creating webs. Instead they only have one goal: to acquire more Meth. They typically do this by swinging to the Meth finish line.<br/></p>\n<p>In this game you control the titular Spyder on Meth in its quest for more Meth. You can swing from web to web using the SPACE bar. You can only swing when you are in the vicinity of a web (made by another spider, of course (because the spyder is too concerned with Meth)). Because *wink* THERE IS NO GROUND *wink* you will fall into the void if you miss the web. Falling into the void is bad when you are on Meth, so if you do this you should probably restart by pressing R.</p>\n<p>The game was made in the Unity 3-dimensional videogame creation engine (by me (The game, not the engine itself)).</p>\n<p>The art was made in Procreate (by me) and DiffusionBee (by AI) and GIMP (by me fixing the AI's mistakes)<br/></p>\n<p>The music and sound effects were made in Logic Pro X (by me).</p>\n\n<p>Don't do meth.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T06:36:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c41/c419169b108ff093fcde68c18a845260.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DennisMagnusson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
