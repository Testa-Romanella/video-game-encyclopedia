Not the usual type of puppy however, but one of mighty stature and power! Although he wasn't always that way. He needs your help to train for a dangerous power that awakens! Make use of training, adventure mode, combat and \"rebirth\" to make him as strong as he can be before day 10!</p>\r\nInstead of patching\r\n<p>I'd like to keep all versions while I finish polishing up the end result.\u00a0I've provided multiple zip file, one with the patches fixed. This way, if you want to try the version with the bug fixes, you still can and I wont get DQ'd from the IGMC &lt;3</p>PUNCHING BAG\r\n<p>Train with a punching bag and gain ATK power! Whack the bag as fast as you can and try not to miss to earn mroe score, which will increase how much your stat gain is!</p>FAST FEETS<p>Get jiggy with it! Help Skyth dance by training with this Rythm based minigame! Get a combo of 3 to get a \"Fever\" which increases your score!</p>HOWL AT THE MOON<p>Oh noes, It's raining moons! D: Howl at them to bounce them back up! Burst one of them to obtain massive points!</p>MEDITATE<p>Keep those bad thoughts away! Click them as they approach to help Skyth gain more MP!</p>BATTLE MONSTERS!<p>Battle intense, strong foes! use the Influence commands to try to tell Skyth what to do, though sometimes he may ignore you!\u00a0Use your\u00a0MP to heal up when in need!</p>\r\nTIPS&amp;TRICKS\r\n<ol><li>Fast Stats<br/>I recommend buying cookies with your starting money, that way you can train a whole lot without having to waste 8 hours resting!\u00a0<strong>Use your first day</strong> to do nothing but training!</li><li>Boss Enemies during\u00a0Adventures<br/>Boss enemies are an incredible way to gain stats, as when you kill them you'll get 1/500th of their stats, but beware! They're super tough, so I recommend training with the bag &amp; fast feets strictly on day 1.</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T13:23:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26e/26e27f0aac31a1ec888e3ad14e37f5eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheUnproPro"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
