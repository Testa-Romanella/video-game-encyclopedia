You WILL experience bugs and performance issues. <em>(Check developer notes below)</em><br/><br/><strong>Game Description:</strong><br/>You have been kidnapped and find yourself inside your local high school!\u00a0<br/><br/>Explore and find different keys to try and unlock the school entrance doors in order to escape. There are multiple keys, each with a different purpose. Finding the right one will not be an easy task. Especially with the kidnapper patrolling the area!<br/><br/><strong>Game Mechanics:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Find any key and attempt to open the main entrance doors. Collect as many keys as you want but only 1 will work. The player can only take up to 3 hits before dying!</p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>Mouse - Camera</p>\n<p>E - Pickup key</p>\n<p>E - Unlock door with Key</p>\n\n<p><strong>Developer Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>This game was made for the Brackeys Game Jam on August 2022 with the theme \"You're Not Alone\". Despite cutting down numerous features that we wanted to add, it was still too big to develop within a week.\u00a0 The game is playable from start to end but there are some bugs and performance issues that I wish could've been fixed before submission. Overall, it was a fun experience to fully code and develop a horror game from scratch with only our perspective of what a horror game should be as the guide.</p>\n<p>Huge shoutout to Patorikkun on Github for joining me in this Game Jam. Game wouldn't even make it to the deadline without his contributions!</p>\n<p>--jamemes95 (Github) or RetroJames (itch.io)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T11:25:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c25/c25bf978a1512a1b09c985685a6f131a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RetroJames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
