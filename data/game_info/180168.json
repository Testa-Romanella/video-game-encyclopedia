Have up to 4 players plug in a controller and take control of the fireballs and harass the turkey player to death.</p><p>Description: This game was made in 24 hours by one person and won 2nd place (1st place had 5 people) at the 2014 South Utah Code Camp in St. George Utah. The idea behind it, besides being Thanksgiving themed, was to showcase the feasability of instilling multiplayer into a regular game by allowing bystanders to play as the AI. It originally was Windows desktop only and didn't have any sound assets. This year (2015) I decided to polish it up and distribute it to all the platforms I had available in time for thanksgiving!</p><p>This is a no-ad, free game. If you enjoyed the roasting of goofy turkeys at all, please consider donating by clicking the \"support this game\" button above. Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/412/412a2cf4602184e1ee32432158d85d98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jarommadsen"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
