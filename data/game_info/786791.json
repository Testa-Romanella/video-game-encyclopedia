You were completely alone in the middle of space for sixteen whole years. There was nothing to do but float adrift and rethink your poor life choices. Until suddenly, Fredbear, who is apparently a powerful space-god for some reason, returns and invites you aboard his stolen spaceship known as the \"Sixth Commandment\". With no other options, you accept his offer.  Little do you know of what you have gotten yourself into.\r\n</p>\n<p>Only through playing the crappy creations of TIlded~Games with Fredbear can you learn what he truly is, and stop his plans for intergalactic conquest.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Instead of the traditional sit-and-survive formula, Never Enough 2 is a compilation of eight different minigames and a secret NINTH minigame that you can unlock which connects all of them. Drink a bunch of milk, hide from killer hamburgers, fight aliens and asteroids, maybe draw a pretty picture! All kinds of things are possible when you completely give up on immersion and embrace the absurd!</p>\n<p>DISCLAIMER:\r\n</p>\n<p>Never Enough 2 is a joke game and is not meant to be taken seriously by any means. Five Nights at Freddy's belongs to Scott Cawthon. This is merely a fangame using characters and locations from the FNaF series and is not associated with the story of the original games.\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T12:24:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67a/67a7186542fe5d1f03a0eaffc7962739.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frigid_Mouse"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
