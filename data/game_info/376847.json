You're sleeping in your bedroom and a loud knock wakes you up at midnight. \u00a0You check the cameras to see who is knocking the door and find out that a guy with a battle axe is trying to open your door. You have to make sure he doesn't get in, or you'll be dead meat. Call 911 from your phone, hide in the closet, check the cameras, shoot your weapon and do whatever else it takes to stay alive from an axe wielding maniac.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/>WASD / Arrow Keys - Character Movement<br/>RMB (Right Mouse Button) - Toggle Phone<br/>TAB - Objectives<br/>E - Interact<br/>F - Flashlight</p>\n<p><strong>Note - Headphones are recommended.</strong><br/>- If you want to buy the source code or run into a bug contact me on twitter - @ShadowBeas7<br/>- Android version\u00a0 coming soon<br/>Join the official discord server and get early access to my games -Link<br/>Donate Here - Link</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-23T06:36:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38a/38a484d6bdc3f5a2122b44226d92392a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["FreezeStudios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
