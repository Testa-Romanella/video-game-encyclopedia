It's a total of about 9 hours of actual work over the 3 days. This was my first game jam and first game made using godot. I did this to finally make a game, and to learn a bit more about Godot's workflow, and godot 4 in general.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This project was made with Godot 4 Beta 10</p>\n<p>Things I liked about this project</p>\n<p>- Double dash feels super nice, I would love to add more less-simple abilities like this.</p>\n<p>- I learned a lot about making a game in a short amount of time, and about Godot 4</p>\n<p>Things I wish I had time for the project</p>\n<p>- Making the upgrades more modular, the idea was to make this a bit like upgrades in hades but time didn't allow for that.</p>\n<p>- More time to do up / down movement. Controls are probably what I like least about what I made.</p>\n<p>- Time to fix enemies spawning outside of the map, and launching off when outside the navigation area.</p>\n<p>Things I would have done different next time</p>\n<p>- Not spend time on a not-needed save system (I did this for personal learning though which has it's merit, but for game jam purposes it wasn't needed)</p>\n<p>- Put more time into sound effects / music / particles. Lack of feedback was another issue with the game.</p>\n<p>- Spend more time of the game jam to work on it, 9 hours total was definitely not enough time to come out with something super polished.</p>\n<p>Controls\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>WASD\r\n</li><li>Space to attack &amp; dash\r\n</li><li>Click the music icon to toggle music\r\n</li><li>Tab - Buys an upgrade with your souls\r\n</li><li>Num 1 - Save Game\r\n</li><li>Num 9 - Reset Game\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Upgrades\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>15 Souls - Speed\r\n</li><li>25 Souls - Health\r\n</li><li>50 Souls - Damage\r\n</li><li>100 Souls - Scythe radius\r\n</li><li>125 Souls - Damage (1 hit spectres)\r\n</li><li>150 Souls - Regeneration - upgrades to 5 health instead of 2\r\n</li><li>250 Souls - Double Dash - Get two charges for dashing\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Credits\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Heroic Demise Soundtrack - matthewpablo -\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/heroic-demise-updated-version\r\n</li><li>Melee Sound - remaxim -\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/3-melee-sounds\r\n</li><li>Spectre Enemy - 7SoulDesign -\u00a0http://7soul1.deviantart.com/\r\n</li><li>Programming - xaviarrob123\r\n</li><li>Art - mezzbeans\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T16:00:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76b/76b2a4df5f718ae5f609292364194231.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Rob"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
