Also, the difficulty now increases as the game progresses.</strong></p>\n<p>In space, everybody can hear you drum.</p>\n<p>Beat Nebula is a game for QaziJam8, which had no theme, so I restricted myself to a game that had a limited color palette (based on recently announced Pok\u00e9mon Cosmog) and to make the game playable on the Donkey Konga bongo controller (which I later expanded to the Taiko Drum Master controller too). You can also play with a keyboard, but it's a lot more fun with a controller you can hit really hard.</p>\n<p>Hit the drums to destroy the comets and dodge lasers. Get hit three times or fall off of your platform, and the universe will end. No pressure.</p>\n<p><em>Code and art by TJ Cordes (me), and music by Tim Schrock. I might continue work on this game later on - I didn't have as much time as I would've liked to work on it this week, and I wanted to add a whole bunch of stuff, such as new enemies, particle effects, and an actual reason for you to do mid-air stomps.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c58/c584e00736db87d8d1d64607f4588ea2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Kyatt/Impostor Cat Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
