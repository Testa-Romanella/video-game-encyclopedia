Just your standard infinite runner kind of game.</p>\n\n<p>It is compatible with the gamepad's left analog stick, but\u00a0you'll have to\u00a0click with the mouse\u00a0on the buttons if need to navigate through the menus. This wasn't intended to work for the browser.\u00a0This was originally\u00a0mobile game, so some things might be weird.</p>\n\n<p>This is the first completed\u00a0game I've ever made. Well,\u00a0my first game is actually\u00a0Very Plane (got removed for not having a privacy policy)\u00a0, but it was fairly...<em>plane\u00a0</em>and didn't have much to it, so this is a redone, reworked and <strong>remastered\u00a0</strong>version of it. This was finished in the beginning\u00a0 2017, so\u00a0I won't be adding stuff to it because I don't really want to work on it anymore. If I figure out some database things, I might make a leaderboard for the browser version.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the mobile version for Android :\u00a0Very Very Plane.\u00a0That one has accomplishments and a leaderboard if you're into that stuff. It is also free and will never contain ads or in-app purchases!\u00a0It works on really old phones like the Samsung S4 because that's what it was made for.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>Game Programming, Music, 3D models were constructed by me.</p>\n<p>Have fun and thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-12T04:40:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c4/6c4b49998c365369bc49be34878a6282.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["therealdrew"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
