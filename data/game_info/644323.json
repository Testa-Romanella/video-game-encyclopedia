You play as a ball that's trying to knock other balls off of a platform (yes, this is the entire canonical lore). Knock balls off the platform, get abilities, fight stronger balls with harder abilities, and even maybe battle a\u00a0square or perhaps some regular polyhedra? No, just balls.</p>\n<p>This game was primarily made as a learning experience, so any feedback is appreciated!</p>\n<p>Thanks to my playtesters:<br/></p>\n<p>Artifice42<br/></p>\n<p>Wembler</p>\n<p>rsflicker</p>\n<p>redline2466</p>\n<p>TinyBoulder</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T07:36:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/921/9215417e409f5669d0d1ee11403bd753.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZachDT"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
