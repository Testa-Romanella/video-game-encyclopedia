Also a tribute to the late Digital\u00a0Chocolate's\u00a0Brick Breaker Revolution\u2122.</p>\n<p>Ever thought how it'd be if Pac-Man\u00a0CE and Arkanoid had a crossover? This is kinda my interactive fanfic (game. NOT FANGAME) on the topic, hope you enjoy.</p>\n\n<p>Section Where I Put Cool People That Have Donated Big Through itch.io For This Game's And\u00a0My Wellbeing</p>\r\n&lt;nobody so far. be the first!&gt;\r\n&lt;make sure to let me know if you don't want to be listed!\r\nuse Twitter or email me at glitchy (at) glitchypsi.xyz&gt;\r\n\n\r\nNOTICE: <em>BBSPRINT </em>IS CURRENTLY IN NANO MILESTONE STATUS\r\n<p>That means that the game is in an \"infra-demo\" stage. Functional, but limited in content, and yes there are lots of things planned. I may actually reveal which things in the future as things progress and people get interested.</p>\n<p>The NANO and LITE stages of the game's development represent a milestone that requires me to develop up to and see how people react to it. If enough happy faces and money is raised for the NANO stage, LITE will follow with even more content.<br/>Just the same way, if LITE also has good reception and raises enough funds, DX will follow on Steam.<br/><br/>To me, being in Nano stage does not mean\u00a0I can't start going hard on the visual presentation of everything.</p>\n\n<p>Some useful information for you:</p>\r\nWhat do you control the game with?Mouse only and ONE key\u00a0(Nano)<br/>Mouse and Keyboard, maybe controller (Lite)<br/><br/>MOUSE: M1 to use Active Powerup (right now only Railgun),\u00a0M2 to release balls and use Alt Powerup (right now only Magnet)<br/>the ONE key: ESC (Pause the game)What does each powerup do?consider checking the powerup help button in the game because that's a lot of info. no tutorial yetMusic credits?RVL2 - Me (\"Remix\" of track from\u00a0Brick\u00a0Breaker Revolution)<br/>INF-PWR KaizoSlumber (form. Acetantina)<br/>Binary\u00a0Stars - MONINWhat's the difference between Sprint and Circuit?Named unintuitively so and <em>because I like it that way</em>, <strong>Sprint mode (Sprint gamemode)\u00a0</strong>stages allow you to go through several laps of the same stage after you finish its progression, also giving you a score bonus whenever you complete a lap. <strong>Circuit mode (Sprint gamemode)\u00a0</strong>stages just... stop when you reach the end.What do I do if I find something that seems like a bug?Good! The first thing you should do is smile because you are about to help me improve the game!<br/>The next thing you should do is fill this form or go meet me and talk about it in my general Discord server<br/><br/>If you don't do the second thing please respectfully lower your smile.I have a suggestion!refer to the above<br/><br/>though i may be more (hopefully understandably) defensive because i have some design decisionsFavorite fruit?\ud83c\udf4a\r\n<p>Wonder what's in store if we reach the next development milestone\u00a0(Lite)?\u00a0Here's a helpful bullet list (making use of all the formatting buttons by now.)</p>\n<ul><li>Explosive Objects<ul><li>While we're at it, new powerup: Bomb\u00a0Ball</li><li>WHILE WE'RE AT IT, Powerup Blender (different outcome of powerups that use different keys)</li></ul></li><li>More objects (teleporters, rails)</li><li>BOSSES !?!?!?!?!?!?
