Ancient primordial beasts scoured the chaos, seeking any living or dead that would give them strength. They devoured each other, their planets, Sun and Moon. Some even devoured themselves. But nothing could stop their thirst. The world was about to end when it just started. Not all hope was lost, since if it did, there would be no story.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After many battles of apocalyptic proportions, only few of the most powerful beings were left. Gone were the green lands, the thundering waterfalls, the rainbow clouds, and the majestic seas. They saw what the world was coming to. A wasteland with no more resources, no beauty and no life. They did the unthinkable, something that never existed at the time, they spoke, and order came to be.</p>\n<p>Viole, a Soul mercenary from Earth, was tasked to scout a Soulwave anomaly from an undiscovered planet.
