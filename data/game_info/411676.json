That will include, working rides, shops, games stalls, ancillary/service buildings, and all theming elements. Even the trees will be accurate to their correct species, placement, and last recorded height!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-14T02:20:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e9/7e9534d1b8de575a87e08ad2e4954726.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Immortal Media Studios"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
