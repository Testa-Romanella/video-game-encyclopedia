THIS GAME HAS BEEN MADE IN 48 HOURS FOR THE /R/WEBGAMES GAME JAM!</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n</p><p>Caveclan is a resource management game, where you're the commander of a ragtag bunch of cavemen. Send out your cavemen on missions to hunt mammoths, steal the wings off of a pterodactyl, or raid nearby caveclans and steal their supplies!<br/></p><p>\n<strong>TIPS:</strong><br/>\r\n\tThere are a couple of modifiers for a mission's success chance\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Weapons</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tAgainst buzzards, bows are better. Against boars, spears are better, and against mammoths slings are better.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Armor</strong><br/>\r\n\tAgainst buzzards, leather is better. Against boars, bronze is better. And against mammoths, fur is better.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAlso it's better to wear fur in the winter, and cloth in the summer.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Food</strong><br/>\r\n\tFood is only connected to the season. In the winter it's better to supply your men with mammoth meat, and in the summer it's better to use buzzard bits. Boar core is the neutral option.</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/006/0069dc12e7f75c39560a5b290277c136.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Asgardr"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
