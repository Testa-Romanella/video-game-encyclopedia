Stay on your toes or this galaxy will devour you.</strong><br/><br/>Retrobooster is an exceptionally difficult 2.5D shooter, focused on skill-based flying and enemy blasting. Pilot your nimble thrust ship through bizarre worlds littered with vicious enemies. Each new level takes you farther from home and, ultimately, into the deadliest reaches of the galaxy. Retrobooster also has speed-flying challenges, puzzles, juicy monsters, a warped sense of humor, and a healthy dose of bullet hell action. Survive to the end if you can, and use your new flying skills to replay for high scores.Features<br/><ul><li>Master classic thrust ship controls, plus reverse thrust<br/></li><li>Enjoy detailed physics (with plenty of death by crushing)<br/></li><li>Navigate 30+ increasingly diabolical levels<br/></li><li>Unlocked levels can be replayed any time<br/></li><li>Unleash 10 fierce weapons on a galaxy of enemies<br/></li><li>Challenge yourself with 4 difficulty levels<br/></li><li>Customizable controls, because Retrobooster is all about daring flying and unbridled shooting<br/><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Keyboard<br/></li><li>Mouse and keyboard<br/></li><li>Game controller (Some popular controllers are recognized automatically)</li></ul></li><li>Split-screen multiplayer for up to 4 players (no online multiplayer)<br/></li><li>Cooperative and deathmatch multiplayer modes<br/></li><li>Electronic soundtrack by Subatomicglue frontman, Kevin Meinert</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:08:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05d/05d5b058e7ec0f0c5e498995d40a8126.jpg", "website": "http://reallyslick.com/retrobooster/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 9}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 504, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Really Slick"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Really Slick"], "esrb_rating": null}
