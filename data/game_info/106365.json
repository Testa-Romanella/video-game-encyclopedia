Any feedback is very appreciated.</p>\r\n\r\nControls:\r\n\r\n<p>\n<strong>WASD + mouse</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>right click</strong> to spawn a policeman\r\n\t\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>left click</strong> to spawn a protester\r\n\t\r\n</p>\n<p>left click on to let it happen<br/></p>\n<p>\r\n\tAlso you can change or mute the music by clicking on the speaker.
