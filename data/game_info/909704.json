These crystals are only found in highly dangerous asteroid belts, but the Federation-mandated warp gates allow for slightly-less-deadly transportation between the sectors. Not to mention the ever-present space pirates that seek to destroy and salvage harvester ships. Regardless of the dangers, as an Ether Harvester Unit, it is your sole responsibility to collect and transport these invaluable gems! Have a safe trip!</p>\n<p>Collect Ether Crystals and avoid deadly space pirates. Enter a Warp Gate and prestige to obtain powerful upgrades (from a pool of 17 unique upgrades) to harvest more and more crystals! Every time you warp, pirates lock on to your location easier and arrive in larger masses. Perhaps eventually you will be able to purchase the most prized contraption in our day and age: the <em>FTL OVERDRIVER</em>.
