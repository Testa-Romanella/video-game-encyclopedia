Created a script that would start a cutscene</p>\n<p>2. Created some form of movement for the camera in the cutscene</p>\n<p>3. Added an enemy AI script that would allow it to patrol and chase the player. I have not decided on what it will do once captured so the attack for now is empty.</p>\n<p>Created by: Karlo\u00a0Kalis</p>\n<p>Thank you. I hope you enjoy this very basic version of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T09:33:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/147/1473c91969a54b07e191c90f457c4c99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["EyeCancer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
