That\u2019s when the Air Bubble Rescue squad swings into action!</em>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Tap the fish on the side to navigate the fish in the middle so that she swims over the oxygen bubbles. Don\u2019t let her run out of oxygen. </strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Play 100 colourful and challenging levels.\r\n  </li><li>Swim over every single oxygen bubble to get gold.\r\n  </li><li>Avoid swimming over the obstacles.\r\n  </li><li>For an extra challenge play expert mode which is faster.\u00a0 \r\n  </li><li>You can switch between expert and casual mode and continue the game from where you left off.\r\n  </li><li>You can restart a level as often as you like.\r\n  </li><li>At the end of every level you are awarded a green (casual mode), pink (expert mode), silver or gold fish. \u00a0Tap this fish to replay any level.\r\n  </li></ul>\n<p><strong>Difficulty:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Passing the levels is not very difficult and you should be able to do that in one or two tries.\r\n  </li><li>It is, however, very challenging to get gold and this will take some practice.\r\n  </li><li>You\u2019ll need to work out a sequence of which fish to tap and when to tap them so that the fish in the middle is always in line for the next bubble.\r\n  </li></ul>\n<p><strong>Duration:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>To complete a level takes between 1 and 2 minutes. To get gold takes practice and that can easily take 5 - 10 minutes a level.\u00a0 There are 100 levels.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Strategy:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>The aim is to swim over every bubble and doing that requires a lot of strategy in determining which fish to tap and when to tap that fish.\r\n  </li><li>At the top is a health bar that indicates the health of the fish in the middle.\r\n  <ul><li>The fish gradually loses health which is replenished by the bubbles.\r\n  </li><li>Obstacles will deduct a lot of health in one go but each level is different.\r\n  </li><li>Bonus objects will add a lot of health. \r\n  </li><li>The fish bonus object will reset her health to what it was at the start of the level, this may or may not be desirable.\r\n  </li></ul></li><li>The size of the fish determines the size of the spray that is created.\r\n  </li><li>While the fish in the middle is touching the spray she will be moved left or right. \r\n  </li><li>Always keep the next bubble in mind, if you move her too far she might not make it back in time to connect with the next bubble.\r\n  </li><li>Watch her health, if she has a lot of health you might want to swim over the obstacle so that she\u2019s in line for the next bubble.\r\n  </li><li>But be warned on some levels the obstacles will destroy all her health.\r\n  </li><li>The level ends when she reaches the top.\r\n  </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/684/684329324a79beb967b9018d408fd7cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Evolutionary Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
