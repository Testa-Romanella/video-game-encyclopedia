Through the main themes of the narrative- family, the visual arts and the complexity of relationships- we aim to bring you a story that both visual novel newcomers and veterans can enjoy!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHaving been successfully funded on Kickstarter, we hope to receive your support so that we can share Kokorogawari with a wider audience!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u272a Download our demo now! \u272a<br/>\n<br/>\r\n====================================================================<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605 A heartfelt story... \u2605\u2605\u2605<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMatsubayashi Asami is a fourth-year university student who, having seen her mother's hardships during the divorce thirteen years ago, bears a cynical attitude towards relationships and marriage. Harbouring wounds from the past that may never heal, Asami's insecurities and fears are laid bare as you dive further into the story. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nHowever, as Asami's relationships with her cheeky classmate Shinichi, her polite colleague Yuuya or her self-assured art teacher Guillam deepens, she finds that her negative world view frequently gets challenged.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHow will she cope with these new feelings...?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe two main themes of Kokorogawari are \"the visual arts\" and \"family\". The visual arts play an integral role in the way many of Kokorogawari's characters express themselves, while their families heavily influence the decisions that they've made in the past and will make. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nRather than just focusing on romantic emotions alone, Kokorogawari's characters explore the difficulties of social obligations and pressures that many of us have been through. This sets us apart from many otome (GxB) visual novels as \"family\" is a theme that is rarely explored at depth, even though for most of us, our families are a significant element of our lives.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n=================================================================<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605 FEATURES \u2605\u2605\u2605<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2605Gorgeous, high quality artwork<br/>\r\n\u2605Beautiful original soundtrack and theme song<br/>\r\n\u2605217,000 words!
