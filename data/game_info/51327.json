It is designed n the vein of classic 16-bit 2D platformers.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>Long ago, Dr. Wily, a would-be mad scientist, created a device called the Double Gear System that could increase the powers of robots by pushing them to the limit. The device was banned for being too dangerous for robots. This time, however, Dr. Wily decided to complete his creation and test it on the eight robots he stole from his former colleague, the wise Dr. Light. Using Double Gear, Dr. Wily creates Robot Masters of the stolen robots to help him to conquer the whole world. Mega Man, a good robot and the protagonist of the series, cannot defeat the stronger and faster Robot Masters. To help him win, Dr. Light temporarily installs him a variation of the Double Gear System.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls Mega Man in a 2D environment, as he runs through the levels and defeats evil robots. There are eight unique Robot Masters that serve as the game&#39;s bosses.</p>\n<p>The Double Gear System not only sets up the game&#39;s plot but also works as a game mechanic. Using it, Mega Man can access two additional skills. The first is \u201cSpeed Gear\u201d that allows him to slow the time down as if he moves and reacts incredibly fast. The other is \u201cPower Gear\u201d that allows Mega Man to make attacks that deal more damage. In accordance with the game&#39;s plot, however, the use of the Double Gear System is not safe and can overheat Mega Man.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2018-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-04T16:07:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/f75/f751a9a43abb507bf95f9b96cc79feac.jpg", "website": "http://megaman.capcom.com/mm11.html", "rating": 3.73, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 45, "owned": 478, "beaten": 63, "toplay": 84, "dropped": 26, "playing": 14}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 139, "ratings_count": 89, "suggestions_count": 469, "game_series_count": 10, "reviews_count": 90, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC", "Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Capcom", "Capcom U.S.A"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Capcom"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
