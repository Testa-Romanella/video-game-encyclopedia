Thus were they cast out to other lands, sealed away where they would be safe.</p>\n<p>Now with the infection gone and Hallownest's sole saviors gone or missing, rumors of the masks being found have begun to surface. New warriors must rise up, wielding Mask Shards bearing the powers of the kingdom's greatest heroes, and protect the other lands from these terrible artifacts.</p>\n<p><em>Will you destroy the Masks of Fate, or wield their unfathomable power and risk them destroying\u00a0<strong>you</strong></em>?<br/></p>\n\n<p>Hollow Knight:\u00a0Masks of Fate is built in the RUNE System (Beta) designed by DeltaFlashback.
