And honestly it's a pet project I have been waiting for so long to get started.<br/><br/>(Please note that this is a work in progress and some placeholders were in place or some assets may be missing.)<br/><br/>This is Bitter Sweet Memories, a game about a group of friends reunited after 6 years of separation. Life has indeed changed them but was it for the better or worse?</p>\n<p>You play as Azure, a wolf that is more often than not misunderstood due to his face usually showing someone who's always in a foul mood. Despite this, he is a capable worker with a dream... a dream that cannot be fulfilled that easily.</p>\n<p>But one day, when he least expected it, his life turned a bit brighter. Perhaps a lot more when he found himself reunited with his friends.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But is it a stroke of luck or fate bringing them together again?<br/><br/>P.S.
