It is controlled by the arrow keys, z,x. Z is select and x is back.<br/></p><p>Please read the Lesson on algorithms, test your knowledge in the simulator. Do as much as you can/want to.</p><p>Instruction Explanation</p><ul><li>MOVF Moves the robot Forward the number of pixels selected</li><li>MOVB Moves the robot Backward the number of pixels selected</li><li>TURN Turns the robot by the specified number of degrees</li><li>RSTDIR Resets the direction of the robot so it is pointing down.</li><li>LOOP/END When loop is selected you then choose how many times you want the instructions you are about to input to be repeated. For example selecting LOOP then 3 then MOVF then 5 then END will move the turtle forward 5 pixels 3 times. You can use different instruction types in a loop.</li><li>PENUP/PENDOWN Instantly changes if the pen is up or down. If the pen is down the robot will leave a line behind it as it moves.</li><li>To reset the canvas press enter and select reset</li></ul><p><strong>Lesson on Algorithms</strong></p><p>An algorithm is a process you can follow to solve a known problem. For example the algorithm to draw a square is as follows:</p><ul><li>Do 4 times:</li><li> Move pen forwards</li><li> Turn 90 degrees</li></ul><p>Try using this to draw a square in the simulator.</p><p>Can you think of an algorithm to draw a circle? Try experimenting and see if you can.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a59/a593e8798ef8380428b724968fde041a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Capnmarcy"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
