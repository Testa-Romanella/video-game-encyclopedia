The world has changed, and the internet and bandwidth are in an even more important role in our lives, and everyone is even more connected to each other. Our streets are filled with crab-like robots, both to work the jobs us humans can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to do as well as to keep order and hold the connection stable. This world wide connection is called 50G, and is able to connect us to each other on an unparalleled level. Unluckily, that means that if someone were to hack the 50G, it would affect <em>everyone</em>.</p>\n\r\nCrab Robot Concept Art\r\n\n<p>A hacker called Corod Vidna has created a virus \u201c19\u201d, spreading it with the use of robots. This has created a global panic and causes accidents and system failures around the world. Luckily the Mayor of Tampere has managed to isolate the part of the virus affecting Tampere, creating a bubble surrounding the city. However, she is unable to destroy the virus herself, and thus has put out a notice to all the people in the city:\r\n</p>\n<p><em>\"All hackers!</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>Corod Vidna is threatening our lives and our city. We need all available people to help us defeat this new threat. Hackers, mercenaries, freedom fighters, heroes, whoever you are, join us in our fight against this virus \u201c19\u201d. If you are the one to defeat Vidna, and to claim back our 50G, you will forever be remembered as a hero!\"</em></p>\n<p><strong>Join the fight to save the city and claim your place on the Scoreboard!</strong></p>\n\r\nTitle Screen\r\nControls:\r\n<p><strong>Movement &amp; Shooting:\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li> <em>Press \u2190\u2191\u2192\u2193 or WASD to move around the city</em>\n</li></ul>\n<ul><li> <em>Aim with the Mouse, and use the Mouse Button to shoot</em></li></ul>\r\nExtra:\r\nCharacters\r\n<p><strong>Player -\u00a0</strong><em>A hacker or a freedom fighter, maybe even a hero. YOU are one of the people who have decided to answer the mayor\u2019s call to arms, and you are here to do your part and defeat Corod Vidna and his virus \u201c19\u201d!</em></p>\n<p><strong>Mayor -\u00a0</strong><em>A stressed out lady with the lives of thousands on her shoulders. While she was able to separate Tampere from the rest of the 50G network due to sheer determination and quick thinking, she was always meant to lead the people, not to fight against cyber-villains. She is also not afraid to use outside help, and is fully committed to rewarding whoever defeats Corod Vidna.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Corod Vidna -\u00a0</strong><em>A hacker of mysterious origins. He has not come forth with a motive for his sudden attack, and people don\u2019t know his real name. No one knows whether he has a grudge against the world, or whether he is simply bored. Either way, he needs to be stopped!</em></p>\n<p><strong>Robots -\u00a0</strong><em>The first prototypes of the robots were created after the 2020 global pandemic, when the governments around the world realised how important it was to always have a way to bring food and resources to people, whether there was sickness to consider or not. It did not take long for robots to become a familiar and every-day sight for people, and the robots of today handle all such tasks as cleaning, delivering, construction, etc. Their presence also upholds the network, which ensures a system of almost unlimited potential, but also one with a glaring flaw. IF you manage to hack into the system, you control it.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Why crabs?</strong> In addition to self-protection and defense, crabs symbolize emotions, trust, and the cyclical nature of life. At some point in their lives, crabs dump one shell in exchange for another, symbolizing a point of rebirth in their life cycle. From the era after 2020, the world decided to reinvent itself, and we created a trusted companion and a protective shell against future disasters. <strong>Hence, crab.</strong></em>\n</p>\r\nFor the Future?\r\n<p>Taking the game into the future, the story could take the player from one city to the next, moving around in different environments, meeting different kinds of enemies. It could even turn from a top down shooter into a 3D game and/or a conditional open world and/or with RPG elements.<br/></p>\n<ul><li>In online multiplayer mode you could choose the city/server that you want, or even go onto the main server (the whole world).\u00a0\r\n</li></ul>\n<ul><li>In single player story mode you could start from Tampere, taking back the 50G one city and one country at a time, moving up into more and more difficult arenas. Apart from different kinds of enemies, you would also meet different human NPCs and do sidequests from them. At the end of the game you would meet Corod Vidna himself and fight against him.</li></ul>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p><strong>Game Developer/Graphics</strong> - <em>Olli Uikkanen</em><br/></p>\n<p> <strong>Game Developer</strong> - <em>Murilo Pileggi</em>\n</p>\n<p> <strong>Game Developer/Graphics</strong> - <em>Hai Ha</em>\n</p>\n<p> <strong>Game Developer</strong> - <em>Jyri Puputti\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><strong>Narrative Designer/Graphics\u00a0</strong>- <em>Veera Wikstr\u00f6m</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T05:39:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea2/ea204dba96026ce776c5ee3883ffdf5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["MuzaoDaMassa", "trihai264", "Obazu", "Puputskov", "Jintastic"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
