Higher difficulties lead to more notes and higher note-frequencies to hit but generate higher scores as well.</p>\n<p>Basically for anyone who knows VOS (Virtual Orchestra Studio - which doesn't work well on modern systems anymore) or fans of music games in general.</p>\n<p>The Android version is still experimental. There are different column layouts depending whether you play on tablet or mobile devices to ensure it is playable.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/330/3303e0c89170727ca5ed522a69211bb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Max Gooroo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
