Each level was one screen and split down the middle, and the switches on end side only affected things on the other.</p>\n<p>Here, Wisp is controlled by the keyboard, while\u00a0Mist is controlled with the mouse. \u00a0Mist can fly anywhere on screen; Wisp can pick things up (small stones for throwing at enemies and large rocks for holding down switches) as well as push logs and go through portals. The two can only interact with buttons and switches of their own color.</p>\n<p>There are a few keys that aren't told to you in-game:\u00a0Escape pauses the game. R restarts the game from the beginning. Ctrl takes a screenshot.</p>\n<ul><li>Patch 1 fixes a few places that prevent progression and also fixes some sounds.</li></ul>\n<p>Apologies that there isn't any music. I was very pressed for time and just couldn't fit it in.</p>\n<p>If you like it and would like to support my future projects, please consider paying or checking out my patreon!
