In this game you need to click away colored tiles as fast as possible.<br/>\r\n\t\tBut beware! The black tiles will cause your game to end, so try to avoid those at all cost!<br/>\r\n\t\tThe white tiles are 'empty'. Clicking these will remove 1 point from your score.<br/>\r\n\t\tWhenever you've clicked a colored tile, it becomes purple and should not be clicked again, or you'll lose the gained points again!<br/>\r\n\t\tGood luck and send me your hiscores!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:<br/></strong>It is possible there are some minor bugs, but I ran out of time to fix all of them. Please let me know if you found any though!<br/></p>\n<p>There should be background music, but because of security reasons the browser won't always play it. Running the index.html without a localhost will most definitely not play it, but the game is still playable.\u00a0<br/>When you download the project it is advised to run it under a localhost (i.e. with WAMP). If the music then still doesn't play, try to start a game and then press F5.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T02:25:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b8/3b8c6ac20261b9f5643ea79bdfd8c872.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zaggo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
