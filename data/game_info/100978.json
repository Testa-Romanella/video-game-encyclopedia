You don't really talk to anyone. You can't focus on work. You barely have any appetite to speak of, literally and figuratively. Even casually reading Twitter makes you anxious.</p>\n<p>Somehow, you thought moving to a new city would help you meet people you actually like. That you'd find fun activities to do and better opportunities all around. You used to be pretty good at faking your way around being a social butterfly. People actually seemed to like you, and the stuff you made and performed. But now? You can't even remember being that person.</p>\n<p>Maybe you should go outside. Maybe it will help.</p>\n<p><em>CONTENT WARNING:\u00a0\u00a0This is a game based on my experience having a major depressive episode.\u00a0</em><em>Please do whatever you need to do to be able to engage safely with this subject matter.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-12T23:29:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/703/7037987311d59ca0a9cbc7705c9af87b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Squinky"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
