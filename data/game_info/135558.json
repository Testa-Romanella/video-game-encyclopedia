{"id": 135558, "slug": "tetrahedron-twister", "name": "Tetrahedron Twister", "name_original": "Tetrahedron Twister", "description": "<p>Game one of a series of puzzle games. A tetrahedron is a four-sided pyramid, with three sides on top and one on the bottom. I first came across tetrahedrons when I was introduced to Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition (AD&amp;D2e). The tetrahedron was used as a four-sided die, known as a d4.</p><p>This game is about matching colored triangles on the sides of the tetrahedron, so that each side has the same color. Your avatar moves about the triangles and swaps color with whatever triangle they are on. Your only hindrance is that you cannot enter a triangle that is the same color as your avatar. So move quickly and solve the puzzle in time! Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/805/805a55ad42d60d0c2647e833f37cf2d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pangoria Fallstar"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
