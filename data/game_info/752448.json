(GamesPlusJam2022)", "description": "<p>This game was made in 48 hours for the <em>GamesPlusJam2022</em> game jam, as my first ever game jam game<br/></p>\n<p>I tried to stay within the theme of \"Mix it up\", but i overscoped and the idea ended up not working. I tried switching it to where you have 3 puzzles about aligning books, codes, and mixing a bowl to uncover a key. Sadly i was only able to complete 1 of the 3 puzzles and so i had to scratch that idea too. I'm totally fine if i get disqualified for this.<br/><br/>I didn't want to submit nothing so i finished the game anyway.<strong><em>Controls:</em></strong></p>\n<ol><li>move: <em>WASD</em> or <em>arrow keys</em>; </li><li>move objects: <em>hold left-mouse button</em>;</li></ol><p><strong><em>Mentions:<br/></em></strong></p><ul><li>Art made by me during the jam</li><li>SoundEffects made with SFXR (https://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html)</li><br/></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T07:04:14", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gimbrint"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
