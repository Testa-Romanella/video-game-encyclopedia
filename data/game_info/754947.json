{"id": 754947, "slug": "dungeons-of-dreadrock", "name": "Dungeons of Dreadrock", "name_original": "Dungeons of Dreadrock", "description": "<p>Dungeons of Dreadrock is an adventure game that includes action, exploration and fighting but mainly focuses on puzzles.<br />\n&quot;Every year, a young boy is chosen to defeat the King of the Mountain.&quot; - only this time, it&#39;s your brother. After accompanying him to the Dead King&#39;s Gate and letting him enter on his own as advised... Well let&#39;s just say things go different from there than the Village Elders expected.<br />\nIn order to reach the Dead King&#39;s crypt to save your brother from being sacrificed you&#39;ll need to solve puzzles, evade traps and fight a bunch of enemies. There are scrolls to decipher, levers to pull, floor plates to step on, fireballs to evade, doors to smash or to unlock, and a whole lot of enemies to kill. But while Zombies or Dread Beetles are easy prey, a lot of other creatures from Ogres to Dark Elves, Minotaurs and Dragons will require more than just brute force to be overcome.<br />\nDungeons of Dreadrock basically takes the idea of oldschool first-person grid-based real-time Dungeon Crawlers (like Dungeon Master, Eye of the Beholder or Legend of Grimrock) and shifts the perspective to top-down. But what seems like a little twist results in a whole new (yet somewhat familiar) experience that was designed to be accessible for oldschool gamers and casual gamers alike.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-18T18:14:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efa/efa54dd8d3e1a8efebfd7dcb4c77e0eb.jpg", "website": "https://dungeons-of-dreadrock.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 42, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["iOS", "PC", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Prof. Dr. Christoph Minnameier", "Christoph Minnameier"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Prof. Dr. Christoph Minnameier", "Christoph Minnameier"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
