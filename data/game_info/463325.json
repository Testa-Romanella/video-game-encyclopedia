But besides the boxes that you need to move, there are also monsters you can escape from or\u00a0destroy with a fireball or by\u00a0throwing them into the water. There are three types of slimes in the game: the green ones just stand still, they cannot be destroyed with a fireball, but they can be pushed into the water. Blue slimes chase the main character and they can be destroyed with a fireball and\u00a0thrown into the water just like the green ones. Red slimes chase you and they can only be pushed in the water.</p>\n<p>Fireballs can also move blocks. If blocks fall into the water they destroy both the water and themselves. Some slimes do the same, others just get drowned. Fireball magic bottles and keys can sink as well.<br/>The game has 30 levels.</p>\n<p>Movings - arrows, WASD, screen buttons<br/>Idle - space, idle button.</p>\n<p>Shoot - click/tap.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-10T04:34:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65e/65e536c86067aa9fc714e8fe1517b919.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["adgard"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
