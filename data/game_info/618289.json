You get a power multiplier that increases your score but also makes it more difficult to knock the boxes out as the opening gets narrower as the multiplier increases. <br/></p>\n\n<p>If you get hurt, your multiplier decreases, but the opening gets wider making it easier to knock the boxes out of the level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The goal was to create a system that can help struggling players, while rewarding players that do well with more points. <br/></p>\n<p>Game Instructions</p>\n<p>1.
