In this game, you\u2019re just trying to go home, but some annoying neighborhood kids snatched them when you weren\u2019t looking and hid them as a joke. Now your patience is running thin. Can you make it home before you absolutely lose it?</p>\n<p>The goal of the game in \u2018Beach Hunter\u2019 is to find your keys before time runs and your character loses it. Losing your patience and hitting children wouldn\u2019t look good for you and your career, so it\u2019s important that you succeed. Collecting coins increases the amount of time that you have (because who can get impatient when you\u2019re getting free money). Be careful though, tripping on rocks might be a good way to injure/frustrate yourself.</p>\n<p>The player searches for their key while avoiding any rocks they might come across. The player also collects coins to increase their time limit. The player finds the key and gets to go home without beating up any little kids.\u00a0They also need to move fast or else the timer will cause them to lose.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-13T02:24:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/515/515bc83b997bf0cf687dfb7701e3f727.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kevin Benavides", "CooperFryar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
