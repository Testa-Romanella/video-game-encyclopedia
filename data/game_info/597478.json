Your mission is to explore the new plants found on the newly discovered planet, Terra II.\u00a0 Get hands on with the different plants and explore which plants have different features. These are the features that define the 4 main categories of plants (Gymnosperms, Angiosperms, Ferns, Mosses):\u00a0veins (or no veins), seeds, and flowers. Seeds can be found in both pinecones and fruit, with different types of fruit as well. The categories are deliberately not covered in the experience. Students are meant to discover the features, draw their own conclusions for patterns/connections between features and plant type, and use that information to later define their own categorizations of plant types.</p>\n<p>Target Audience: 7th - 11th grade science students</p>\n<p>This educational simulation is meant as the hands on component to a larger lesson plan on plant biology; it does little as a standalone experience.\u00a0 The expectation is that students enter having learned about different plant features (veins, seeds, and flowers). The experience exists as a method to explore plants in a hands on way.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T04:10:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f63/f635afc70e6effd2cf9b96997c1369c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mat_cook"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
