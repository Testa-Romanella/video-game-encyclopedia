It was a relatively simple project leveraging a simplified form of fuzzy logic to control the boss' behaviour. Unity's animation rigging system was used to control the boss' hand and arm positions thanks to Inverse Kinematics.</p>\n<p>Being my first proper attempt at creating a complex AI system in Unity, throughout this project I had the opportunity to discover what ready-made toolkits were available in this popular commercial game engine. I also took the time to properly explore the main concepts of fuzzy logic in AI.     </p>\n<p>The game is a 3d platformer where a floating sphere-shaped boss is levitating in the middle of 8 platforms. The player can run and jump around the boss to avoid its hand attacks and can time bomb drops accordingly. The boss will lift its hands and attack platforms close to the player following the beat of the background music and will make random effects happen based on custom animation curves. Fuzzy logic is present as the boss' hp is taken as an input crisp value that is used by each effect's curve to determine the likelihood of it happening. IK is used to control and place the boss' hands on platforms.\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p>Build files to try out the game are available on this page, source files are available on github at the following link: https://github.com/GameDevChris/AI-Boss-Fight<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T07:14:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59a/59aeea50d13c3e75294ff70a116b6d38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bodsworthcm"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
