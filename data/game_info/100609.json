Arachne now dwells far below the earth in the caverns of the underworld, ruling over a kingdom of monsters and sending out her children to spy on the world above. Bitten by one such spider, you find yourself succumbing to the same curse, slowly transforming into a terrifying half-spider monstrosity.</p><p>Cast out from your village, you have but one hope to undo what has been done; to travel deep into Arachne's domain and slay her before the transformation is complete. No mere human could possibly hope to navigate the web-filled caverns, but your new form has granted you powers that mean you may just stand a chance...</p><p>Arachne is a roguelike created in seven days for the 7DRL Challenge 2016, the obligatory twist on the standard formula being that rather than a standard grid, the game takes place on a dynamically deforming spiderweb that you can build and destroy while you play.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fe/2fe1e4b99b31d059768aeb430af44048.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["PNJeffries"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
