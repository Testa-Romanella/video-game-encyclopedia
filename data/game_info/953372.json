A group of computer enthusiasts set out to create a game that would test the limits of code-breaking and puzzle-solving.\r\n</p>\n<p>They worked tirelessly for months, creating cryptic puzzles and intricate algorithms to keep players engaged and challenged. Finally, they were ready to release their creation to the world.\r\n</p>\n<p>But something went wrong\u2026\r\n</p>\n<p>The game\u2019s website was plagued with errors, and players found it nearly impossible to access the puzzles. The team worked tirelessly to fix the issues, but they seemed to be getting worse, not better.\r\n</p>\n<p>One day, while trying to debug the website, one of the team members accidentally entered a 404 error code into the codebase. To their surprise, the website suddenly sprang to life, and a cryptic message appeared on the screen.\r\n</p>\n<p>It was a message unlike any they had seen before, filled with complex codes and symbols that seemed to have no meaning. But the team was determined to crack the puzzle, and they spent countless hours deciphering the message and trying to understand its purpose.\r\n</p>\n<p>Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. The team members barely slept or ate, so focused were they on cracking the code. And then, just when they thought they had made a breakthrough, something incredible happened.\r\n</p>\n<p>As they worked through the final layers of the code, they noticed something strange happening. The numbers and symbols they had been working with seemed to take on a life of their own, forming patterns and shapes that defied explanation.\r\n</p>\n<p>Suddenly, it dawned on them \u2014 they had not just been deciphering a message, but had stumbled upon a fundamental language of the universe itself, a language based entirely on math.\r\n</p>\n<p>They were stunned, exhilarated, and humbled all at once. Enigmatica had become much more than just a game. It had become a gateway into the universe, one built upon the principles of math and information theory\u2026\r\n</p>\n<p>And the team were hurry to share their discovery with the world\u2026\r\n</p>\n<p>Despite their excitement to share their findings with the world, something went terribly wrong. The team\u2019s computers suddenly crashed, and all of their data was lost. They had made backups, but those too were corrupted beyond repair.\r\n</p>\n<p>The team was devastated, and they disbanded soon after. All that was left were a few scraps of information, snippets of code, and cryptic messages that seemed to hint at something much larger.\r\n</p>\n<p>In the years that followed, strange messages began to appear across the internet, attributed to the enigmatic team. And sightings of mysterious figures known as \u201cenigmatics\u201d started to crop up all around the world.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T14:34:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/500/500d7d9e4cd76ec8c161980b24ca2f23.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["enigmatica404"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
