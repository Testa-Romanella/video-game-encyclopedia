The first of which is that I try not to take life too seriously. Having fun is of utmost priority especially in this day and age. Just beyond that though, is the desire to try and be useful in some manner. Finally, aesthetically, this game uses vibrant colors, playful themes, various levels of design intricacy and digital elements that represent physical things\u00a0close to my heart.</p>\n<p>Here we have a world with a few upside down ideas... one of which is that our main character, Tom the Cat, does not like mice, contrary to many cats in the real world. He does however, like cheese (also out of the ordinary). He can move and bounce around with silly sounds and engaging controls, but Tom must avoid the mice, lest he shriek!\u00a0If he can successfully reach his beloved cheese slices before the mice rightfully claim them as their own, his (un)fortunate intolerance to lactose will kick in and he will be forced to leave a poop behind for the mice... which really flips them out!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I like to intertwine meaning with absurdity. The absurdity is what you just read above. But the meaning is embedded within the plot: a cat who behaves not as one may expect or hope for, is a living being which\u00a0still needs love. Humans, like some animals, are unique and should dance to the beat of their own drum.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>You may get a sense of conceptually how I think as an artist and also what I produce here with this game. I wanted to make a game that uses animals since I think relationship between humans and animals is essential (I have a tuxedo cat named Zorro). The art must also be interesting to look at, and use juxtaposition and balance in detail and execution. Also, having a digital world that can be explored was important to me as well, so Tom had to be able to move up and down and across the screen as well as experience gravity when jumping at any given point.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Inspirations:</p>\n<p>Looney Tunes/Tom &amp; Jerry, my incredibly cute cat Zorro who lives up to the term 'scaredy-cat' and also tends to poop at inopportune times, and my own life where I have not always done what was *expected* of me (and my own sensitivity to lactose)...</p>\n<p>I hope you have fun playing this game and that it leaves you with a lasting impression!</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T08:39:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/174/174fd60fb1ff542843e55a7d11812c3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nachopapa"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
