{"id": 16351, "slug": "realm-of-the-mad-god", "name": "Realm of the Mad God", "name_original": "Realm of the Mad God", "description": "<p>Realm of the Mad God is a multiplayer-only cooperative game in which teams of players hunt for monsters. The game uses a minimalistic retro-pixelated visual style with very simple animations. </p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>According to the game&#39;s backstory, the mad god Oryx kidnapped the protagonists and transported them to his dark dimension. He is going to use them as food for his hordes of monsters. However, the protagonists have weapons, and they will fight back.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Most of the gameplay consists of slaying monsters with a fantasy version of firearms. The game uses the top-down third-person view. The player controls his or her character with the use of a keyboard (for movement) and a mouse (for aiming). </p>\n<p>The central part of each server is Nexus, a safe zone in which the players can trade. From Nexus they teleport to various realms where they receive quests that involve killing monsters. When they kill enough monsters, they may encounter a boss, and eventually Oryx himself.</p>\n<h3>Characters</h3>\n<p>There are fifteen character classes, but the new player has to start with only Wizard class available. Other classes that include Ninja, Samurai, Paladin, and Assassin, among others, will be eventually unlocked when the player gains more experience. </p>\n<p>An unusual feature of the Realm of the Mad God is the permanent death. When the player&#39;s character is killed, he or she will not respawn. All equipment of the dead character is also lost.</p>", "metacritic": 82, "released": "2012-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-07T09:17:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c20/c201f665fc1d461719833ec1320935d6.jpg", "website": "http://www.realmofthemadgod.com/", "rating": 3.12, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 61, "owned": 2178, "beaten": 38, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 172, "playing": 7}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 31, "ratings_count": 232, "suggestions_count": 365, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 234, "platforms": ["macOS", "Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Wild Shadow Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Deca Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
