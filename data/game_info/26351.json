This was the early 80s, and this was when video gamers<br />\nnationwide were wowed by the cutting edge graphics and sound effects of<br />\nthe first three-dimensional-like intergalactic arcade shooter: Zaxxon.<br />\nTouted as the first game to put video display in perspective, Zaxxon<br />\nfeatured \u201clooks\u201d and \u201csounds\u201d like actual aircraft flight, allowing the<br />\nplayer to command his ship just like a real fighter pilot. Dive, bank,<br />\nfly left and right, and up and down\u2014Zaxxon had it all. Fly through<br />\nheavily armored space fortresses, strafing fuel tanks, dodging walls,<br />\nand blowing up enemy missiles and gunnery. This game is littered with<br />\nexplosions. Then take the fight to the enemy fighter fleet and destroy<br />\nthe aggressor ships with extreme prejudice. Blasting pixels has never<br />\nbeen so fun.<br />\nThis classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
