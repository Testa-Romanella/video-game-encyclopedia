The theme was Free-for-all.<br/>Note: The game starts automatically as soon as you press play!\u00a0Reading below is recommended!</p>\n<p>===Controls===</p>\n<ul><li>WASD/Arrow Keys to move around</li><li>Spacebar to place down a fence</li><li>Right mouse button to get rid of a police officer</li></ul>\n<p>===How to Play===</p>\n<p>You start off with $100, see how much you can end up with within a minute!</p>\n<p>You are always trying to sell an area made up of 4 fences. Press spacebar to place a fence down. The further from each fence you walk away, the more you have to spend on building materials. Once 4 fences are placed you will get a payout depending on how much area you sold. Be careful to not run out of money!</p>\n<p>Each time you place a fence there's a chance a police officer will see what you're up to and try to steal your fence. You will hear a whistle for each officer that comes your way.\u00a0Prevent them stealing your fence at all costs! You can swat officers away when you're touching them by using the right mouse button.</p>\n<p>With each 4-fence area completed you will get a random bonus, and the chance of police officers spawning will increase!</p>\n<p>How much money can YOU produce off of<br/>FREE REAL ESTATE?</p>\n<p>===Notes &amp; Credits===</p>\n<p>The game sometimes bugs out when a police officer tries to steal your fence at the same time you completed a 4 fence area. I wanted to stay within the three hour limit so if this happens to you, press \"R\" to restart. Usually though, even if the game bugs out somewhat you can still play...!</p>\n<p>There's a lot I'd like to add with more time;</p>\n<ul><li>proper graphics</li><li>upgrade shop</li><li>construction zones</li></ul>\n<p>But I'm happy with what I achieved in 3 hours.</p>\n<p>Software used:</p>\n<ul><li>Unity 2020.3.38f1</li><li>Audacity</li><li>Photopea</li></ul>\n<p>Audio:</p>\n<ul><li>Fun &amp; Quirky Jazz by Music for Videos</li><li>It's Free Real Estate from the Tim &amp; Eric Awesome\u00a0Show, Great Job!</li><li>Cash Register Open Money Cha Ching Sound Effect by SoundEffectsFactory</li><li>All other sound effects from freesfx</li></ul>\n<p>Thanks for checking this out, leave your highscores/feedback in the comments :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T10:06:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d5/9d561268e015d548dfdadf8222ed0536.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PapaPolski"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
