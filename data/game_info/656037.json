In this game (prototype), you play as The Babysitter and parents drop off their babies into your house. Why? Not sure. These babies are rascals, some would say Chaotic; they'll run, cry, and try to escape. Make sure that doesn't happen or the parents won't be happy. You also have your handy laptop to go online and purchase new toys to play distractions and diversions on the babies. One more thing, a baby can have nightmares and they are just\u00a0as real, so if you see one... whack away!</p><br/>Whats even more chaotic is that the design, art, and programming were done in half a weeks time.
