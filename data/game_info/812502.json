{"id": 812502, "slug": "smash-n-roll", "name": "Smash n' Roll!", "name_original": "Smash n' Roll!", "description": "<p>Smash n' Roll is a hypercasual runner game, about people who bump into each other and jumble together to form a giant human ball.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is based on a common trend in the hypercasual market, where players are presented with two choices, with one being obviously better than the other. \"Smash n' Roll!\" is my attempt at creating a variation of this trend. In this game, the player must choose between A) bumping into more people to increase the size of their ball, or B) smashing into a wall, losing people, and making their ball smaller.</p>\n<p>The goal is to form the largest ball possible, to roll all the way to the end of each level.</p>\r\nProject Roles\r\n<p>Marcus Seeger- Project manager and game designer</p>\n<p>Josh\u00a0Finkel- Art director and game designer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T11:19:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94c/94c84ffed228145f63355401b5b6b283.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Josh Finkel"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
