We decided to create a game about going deeper and deeper into the self through meditation. This interactive experience will have you flow into various states of consciousness.</p>\n<p><strong>How To Play:</strong></p>\n<p>Watch your breathing circle.\u00a0Press the space bar when the circle is growing to take a deep breath. Release the space bar as the circle shrinks to exhale. Try breathing along with the pulse, it helps with the game and with real world stress!</p>\n<p>Move the left and right arrow keys to aim your breath. On exhale, a puff of air will travel and dissolve your distractions as your concentration grows.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Victor Lalo\u00a0(me) - 3D Modeling, Animation, Scripting, Audio, Transitions</p>\n<p>Fede\u00a0Rozenberg -\u00a0Systems Programming, Mechanics, Writing, Transitions</p>\n\n<p><strong>Source Code:\u00a0</strong>https://github.com/victorlalo/Ludum-Dare-48<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Assets Used:</strong></p>\n<p>Music: https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/relaxing</p>\n<p>House Model: https://syntystore.com/collections/simple-series/products/simple-house-interiors...</p>\n<p>Skybox: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/spaceskies-free-...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T18:17:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/619/6192712023163e97c9edb72783e71b9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["MadMystic"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
