{"id": 769350, "slug": "a-shady-game", "name": "A Shady Game", "name_original": "A Shady Game", "description": "<p>A Shady Game is a short platformer with a single level, where Balloon Guy has to pass through various sections of a forest and defeat enemies to get to the end.</p>\n<p><strong>Important note:</strong><br/>This game was made specifically for the birthday of a friend (namely Shady Cicada) and as such it was designed with him as the target audience in mind. This unfortunately means that the game, due to time constraints and development priorities, is not terribly well-designed or accessible. Please be understanding of this fact.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong>Move left and right: A, D/Xbox left stick<br/>Jump: Spacebar/Xbox A<br/>Attack: Left Click/Xbox X<br/>Pause/Continue: Escape/Xbox Start</p>\n<p><strong>Known issues<br/></strong>The game sometimes starts at a significantly reduced framerate and disables mouse input. This lasts until you do a full restart of the game. Note that this may be linked to system resources, so it is entirely possible that it may just not be playable on slower systems.<br/>The audio may pop loudly when a new track is switched to.<br/>Menu navigation does not support mouse inputs. This was done due to strange overlaps with how Godot handles mouse and button inputs separately in regards to ui elements.<br/>The player may not immediately die upon falling into spikes, due to them being invulnerable for a short time after being hit by an enemy.</p>\n<p><strong>Extras<br/></strong>The game contains two unlockable secrets - finding these will enable you to listen to the 'lost soundtrack'. These are tracks that I originally made with the intention of being used in the game, but that ended up not fitting. Highly recommended, they are bangers.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T13:16:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ae/2aee94f6905db332e221e36659299a44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nevercis"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
