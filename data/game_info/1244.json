Before every expedition, the player has to choose several heroes from the suggested roster and lead them through procedurally generated dungeons collecting treasures and killing various monsters.</p>\n<p>The main objective is to save the lives and mental health of the heroes. Mental health declines every time when the player&#39;s comrades suffer damage, walk into traps or fall back from the battlefield. If the hero suffers a breakdown, they start to behave unexpectedly. During the expedition, the characters obtain their own traits - permanent behavior patterns, which can be both negative, such as alcoholism and kleptomania or positive like bravery.</p>", "metacritic": 84, "released": "2016-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-21T00:50:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/fd9/fd92f105dcd6491bc5d61135033d1f19.jpg", "website": "http://www.darkestdungeon.com", "rating": 4.18, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 382, "owned": 4632, "beaten": 310, "toplay": 173, "dropped": 842, "playing": 215}, "playtime": 8, "achievements_count": 564, "ratings_count": 1297, "suggestions_count": 523, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 1304, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Nintendo Switch", "Linux", "PS Vita", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Red Hook Studios"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Red Hook Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
