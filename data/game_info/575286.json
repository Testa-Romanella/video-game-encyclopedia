Many of the options were focused on making the game more accessible and appeal to different target demographics. <br/></p>\n<p>It is a bit rough, the art is all drawn in game maker with a mouse, and there is no real sound balancing. You can, however, put on a neat hat. There are most likely bugs and other issues I didn't notice or get around to.<br/></p>\n<p>I wanted to make a game sort of like a combination of Wario Ware and Cooking Mama. I did really enjoy how it turned out which is why I decided to upload it. I did some fiddling to remove any barriers previously there and take away any personal information, however please let me know if you ended up finding any issues.</p>\n<p>Only for Windows, I don't know how to export a mac file with Game Maker if you can.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T05:10:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/caa/caa5e550abf3602149202400ea7fffdb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["etheweirdokid"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
