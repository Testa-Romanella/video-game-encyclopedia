Grab some love and dodge the haters. Catch some\u00a0hearts and grab that fire for big points, but dodge everything else. If you get\u00a010-points of social shaming, your game is over.\u00a0 Rack up as many likes as you can before that happens.\u00a0The game will auto-restart so you\u00a0can try to beat your previous score.</p>\n<p>Dance, Bro!\u00a0is fairly easy at first but gets more difficult once you've gained 10\u00a0likes. Make it to 20 likes, and the difficulty will ramp up again.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Up and down - Walk up and down</p>\n<p>Left and right - Moonwalk</p>\n<p>Button A - Do a split</p>\n<p>Button B - Spin</p>\n<p>Option1 - Disco Mode!
