Our project ended up being essentially very simple hack-and-slash-kill-everyone sort of a game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Our team consisted of three artists and one programmer (yours truly). During the first four projects we concluded that simplistic 2D pixel was the best art style for all of us to work with. As a team consisting mostly of artist, we decided to invest in the visual side more than say, mechanics and gameplay. Now that the deadline and presentations are over with, I am officially free to work on the mechanics as much as I like, which I intend to do.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Jeopardy Heroes!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Project management and lead developer:\u00a0Saara Korhonen</p>\n<p>Character artist and UI designer:\u00a0Teemu Anttila</p>\n<p>Environment artist:\u00a0Heikki Kettunen</p>\n<p>Supporting artist: Jenni Jaakkola</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28c/28c30fe8ae4629b1acc4da4543b0cf1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Saara Korhonen"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
