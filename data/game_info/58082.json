{"id": 58082, "slug": "pathways-into-darkness", "name": "Pathways into Darkness", "name_original": "Pathways into Darkness", "description": "<p>Pathways into Darkness is a first-person shooter adventure video game developed and published by Bungie in 1993, for Apple Macintosh personal computers. Players assume the role of a Special Forces soldier who must stop a powerful, godlike being from awakening and destroying the world. Players solve puzzles and defeat enemies to unlock parts of a pyramid where the god sleeps; the game&#39;s ending changes depending on player actions.</p>\n<p>Pathways began as a sequel to Bungie&#39;s Minotaur: The Labyrinths of Crete, before the developers created an original story. Jason Jones programmed the game, while his friend Colin Brent developed the environments and creatures. The game features three-dimensional texture mapped graphics and stereo sound on supported Macintosh models. Pathways was critically acclaimed and won a host of awards; it was also Bungie&#39;s first major commercial success and enabled the two-man team of Jason Jones and Alex Seropian to move into a Chicago office and begin paying staff.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>from Wikipedia.
