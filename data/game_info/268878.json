A fight older than time itself.<br/><br/>Darkness is a chaotic force that seeks to throw all of the existence into mindless destruction. Light represents the will of those who wish to live in peace and harmony.<br/><br/>Darkness, mother of demons, made evil grow within the human heart. The union of her children with human beings created monsters, nowadays considered myths: living dead, vampires, witches, fairies, and, particularly, lycanthropes.<br/><br/>Light, creator of angels, granted hope and kindness unto the human soul. The children of angels and humans were the first heroes of old, also known as \u201cGuardians\u201d, people who can repel the attacks of monsters.<br/><br/>For reasons unknown, angels and demons drew back and allowed their descendants to continue the battle.<br/><br/>After thousands of years of war, the monsters defeated the Guardians.<br/><br/>When it seemed that humanity was lost, humans themselves found a way to salvation. A group of warriors, who called themselves the Order, invented the most powerful weapon of all: The Hunter.<br/><br/>There is only one Hunter each generation. The exact details of his forthcoming are unknown. Even though the Hunter has a human shape and fights for Light, he is truly the most powerful of monsters.<br/><br/>His power is unmeasurable, like the one of angels and demons who no longer prowl this earth. If he dies, like a phoenix, he is reborn.<br/><br/>With his unbeatable strength, he forced the creatures of Darkness to withdraw in defeat. However, the monsters remained, stalking from the shadows, waiting for a chance to defeat the Hunter, and once again rule over humanity.<br/><br/>Ten years ago, the lycanthropes were the first to attack. Somehow, they discovered that the Hunter had been reborn into a human child, no older than six. With brutal violence, they ravaged the child\u2019s home, eliminating everyone who got in their way.<br/><br/>The lycanthropes destroyed your home, and murdered your parents.<br/><br/>Because you are the Hunter, and this is your story.<br/><br/>You managed to escape the first encounter with the Darkness. You survived, but you lost all your loved ones.<br/><br/>Why are you still alive?<br/><br/>Is it because you wish to find your own happiness, even if it means facing all the demons from Hell?<br/><br/>Is it revenge that pushes you to exterminate all lycanthropes?<br/><br/>Is it a sense of duty, of responsibility to defenseless creatures?<br/><br/>Your first choice is about the feeling that will guide your actions from now on:<br/><br/>CHOICE 1 \u2013 Friendship <br/>Description: \u201cI want to find my own wellbeing, though I don\u2019t know what will make me happy in the future.
