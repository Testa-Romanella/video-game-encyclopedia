Additional timed mode doubles playtime overall.\u00a0Player can use both keyboard and mouse as well as a gamepad. The player cannot control the characters position backwards or forwards, but initiates attack animations using two to five keys or gamepad control presses. The objective is to time these attacks to strike an opponents unguarded head when it has moved within range. Precise anticipation is needed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-30T03:51:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c25/c25c0809af3cd8946949fe8372c80797.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Unearthly"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
