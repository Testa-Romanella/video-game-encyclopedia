I went through many lists of cliches and at last I came across \"QUIT HORSING AROUND\" which gave me a great idea, which also\u00a0perfectly fits the other criterium.</p>\r\n20 SECONDS\r\n<p> You see, the game has to last 20 seconds, no more, no less. Thats why, the term \"Quit horsing around!\" fits it very well. The game does repeat and, as a result, it does last longer than 20 seconds (unlike the game developer), each \"round\" is still 20 seconds long.\u00a0<br/><br/><br/><strong>ATTENTION:\u00a0</strong>Please note, that this game was made for game jams in a limited time period, so it might need some quality updates, bug fixes and other kinds of cleaning up. If you do find a bug, please notify me as soon as possible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T09:30:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f0/4f022d5c02eebf06cbda3f3421d308ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["topu"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
