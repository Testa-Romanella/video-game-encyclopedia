The game is set in an anarcho-capitalist future where corrupt mega corporations rule. Infrastrucutre is based entirely around high-speed, magnetic monorail systems suspended in the sky. Enter the Railrazer: a lone cyborg pirate that makes her fortune by raiding the cargo of these all powerful mega corporations. Armed with only a plasma pistol, a shock saber and a pair of experimental magboots, our heroine sets out to plunder riches and sabotage the work of the evil mega corporations.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The game-play is basic endless runner fare with sliding and gunning mechanics to spice things up. You can dash once in the air. If you destroy an object with a mid-air dash you can execute a double dash for extra air. Bombs can be destroyed by your gunfire and your dash. The objective of the game is to collect coins, destroy drones and gun turrets and break your past highscores.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 There's not much to it. This was mainly meant as a learning experience for me, but the current state of the game has entertained me enough through play testing for me to want to share. The game's only available on Windows and the controls can't be remapped - they are as follows.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Z =\u00a0fire</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0X = dash</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0C = crouch</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Spacebar = jump</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Escape = pause menu</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Enter = Start</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Up and down arrow keys to scroll through menus</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Please report any bugs you find.
