He have a lot of money, and he doesn't even want the fish, he just want them dead. But beware, it won't be a walk on the park. After all, this lake have a name to hold<br/></p>\n<p>Inspired by ridiculous fishing, throw your fishing as deep as you can, catch as many fish as you can, and shoot\u00a0as much\u00a0fish\u00a0as\u00a0you can\u00a0with your\u00a0danmaku! But beware of the seahorses, they can manage jellyfish like true masters<br/></p>\n<p>The game was originally made for mobile. But the game is still fully playable on computer.</p>\n<p>R - Drill<br/></p>\n<p>The game was meant to be made in 3 days. I had a small idea, but not something that i would code for hundreds of hours, so way not trying to program it like in a game jam? \u00a0It's a cool challenge, i will probably learn something, and it can make some ad for my futur game witch wrath. Yeah, it actually took 10 days, if we count the days that i procrastinated. Was it possible in 3 days? If i had worked more, probably. But well, at least it's not stuck on developping since a year like witch wrath.</p>\n<p>Join my discord to follow my others games! https://discord.gg/xCgzGwCNSM<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T10:42:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b22/b22237aaf69c3c600e1cef60f99fd03f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["serzak51"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
