{"id": 729770, "slug": "are-view-hear", "name": "Are View Hear", "name_original": "Are View Hear", "description": "<p>Are View Hear? is a game created by a team of 8 French students from 27/01/22 to 30/01/22 for the Global Game Jam 2022 with the theme \"Duality\". You play as a wanderer who unfortunately meets an evil warlock. Just because he\u2019s met you, the warlock curses you. From now on, you can either see or hear but not both at the same time. Your goal is thus to find the warlock hidden at the top of his tower. That tower is comprised of levels, themselves divided into rooms. To move forward, you must solve puzzles and avoid monsters, using this main mechanic of image and sound. When the light is down, you hear surrounding sounds. The first level is a tutorial for the player to learn the main mechanics. In this level, the lights are up for 10 seconds, but only when they switch down, can the player move. He therefore has to find his way using only sound. When reaching level 3, he is granted the ability to manually switch between sound and image. For instance, if the lights\u2019 room are down when arriving, he can use this power to light it up for 5 seconds.  However, he\u2019ll always need the sound to detect invisible obstacles. Adding to the duality of sound/image, there is another duality : cute/dark. Rooms and monsters visually appear cute but their sound effects are way scarier.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T05:02:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/661/66165a176357fcaad1d5ce90e4ce9714.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Flegmatik_surf", "PrometheeT", "Erawa", "Jonhfing", "So1080", "Ayris2", "linegann"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
