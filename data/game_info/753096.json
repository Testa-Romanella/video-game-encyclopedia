Just left click and shoot. Right click for your shield. There's no high score to worry about, or really anything stress inducing at all. This game is just meant to let you relax and vibe to it's chill music all in order to help protect your mental state while you protect the GFD. Go full screen and enjoy the protection it offers.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T10:00:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b0/0b05258e85f584eea26fc106de89af22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ghostcursor"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
