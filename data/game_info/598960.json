You control a blue snake that needs to collect all coins and treasures to proceed through 137 tricky levels. As it is usually the case in a snake game, the snake will grow for each collected coin, but there is a twist: You cannot control the snake while it is moving, but it will just stop (instead of dying) when it hits an obstacle (including the snake itself). Instead of avoiding colliding with yourself, you have to use your length to your advantage in order to reach places that were inaccessible otherwise \u2013 but don\u2019t trap yourself!<br/>Various elements such as crates, switches, keys, and doors make sure that there is always something new to discover while advancing through 8 detailed designed areas.<br/><br/><ul><li>Unique, innovative but intuitive puzzle mechanics inspired by Snake and Sokoban<br/></li><li>Visit 8 areas during the snake\u2019s adventure, including desert, forest and jungle, which do not only differ visually, but also have their own puzzle style<br/></li><li>More than 130 levels: After an easy start to get familiar with the mechanics, A Snake in a Maze offers real challenges even for seasoned puzzle fans!<br/></li><li>Various gameplay elements (such as crates, switches, water, keys and doors) ensure that the game never becomes monotonous<br/></li><li>Learning by doing: Instead of introducing each mechanic via tutorials with lots of text, brief illustrations and self-explanatory levels help you to learn how elements work by playing<br/></li><li>Oldschool puzzle-feeling: Challenging levels that require to plan ahead<br/></li><li>Playful and detailed visual design<br/></li><li>Catchy and atmospheric music<br/></li><li>Achievements</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T03:35:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/981/981e6c8136c94c2dc41708b1e77818bd.jpg", "website": "https://dovii-games.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dovii Games"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Dovii Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
