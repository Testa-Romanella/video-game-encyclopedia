And with that said, this game would be a bit boring if you don't have the patience to explore the lore of the story. But if you are here for something different and is filled with curiosity while still tolerating\u00a0a slow paced game, then From will be a good one. Though this game wouldn't take that much time to complete, there are two endings, and it took at least half an hour to finish one.
