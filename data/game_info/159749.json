In the future there are areas like. Laboratory, Mountain, City and Antarctica, in that order. In each level the difficulty will be increased progressively and the character will acquire the ability to go faster.<br/>During the tours we will have the possibility of collecting \"propellers\" (white planes) that increase the speed.<br/>We can also change between first person and third person view.<br/>The project is in whiteBox so there is no art or swim of production right now we are in the pre-production phase.</p>\n<p>Synopsis of the story and atmosphere:<br/>In the (distant) future some scientists are experimenting to modify a human and make it incredibly resistant to everything. But their superiors do not give them enough money for the tests, so as they could not build large machines that would throw the specimen or apply great forces on it they decided to throw it through the highest and most dangerous places in the world. Our character (who can not Do nothing and you do not know why it is there and you must survive all of them to become a superman and escape from the lab.<br/>The ambience of the scenarios has to be futuristic / technological, and the art must focus on photorealism, in case in the future we can implement VR systems that increase the experience.</p>\n<p>1\u00baLevel: Laboratory</p>\n<p>2\u00ba\u00a0Level: Cave</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc2/cc24344445c94d3c82d5a87f24b85c95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alvaro Travesedo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
