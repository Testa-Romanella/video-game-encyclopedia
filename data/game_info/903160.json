A downloadable version with performance improvements and bugfixes will be coming soon.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Combomancy: Surprise Attack is a renewed version of a previous fighting game of mine, simply called Combomancy (you can find it here). The idea at the base is the same, make combos using the different movesets of the weapons at your disposal, but the gameplay is improved in many ways. The focus has been shifted to be a party game\u00a0instead of a beat-em-up, with support to up to 4 players on the same keyboard and a larger variety of weapons.</p>\r\nControls\r\nAttacks<br/>Move L/RJumpPlayer 1<br/>WASDA/D<br/>WPlayer 2<br/>IJKLJ/LIPlayer 3<br/>Arrow KeysLeft/Right<br/>Up<br/>Player 4<br/>Numpad 8/4/6/2Numpad 4/6Numpad 8", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T05:20:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/830/830e958c71d7aa40809e4f020a649c1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Essojadojef"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
