{"id": 95383, "slug": "eyeboss", "name": "Eyeboss", "name_original": "Eyeboss", "description": "<p>Eyeboss is designed to be a short, yet well-polished, tough-as-nails bullet hell boss shooter designed with Pico-8. It features 2 play modes, Survive and Destroy, each of which can be played on Normal or Hard difficulty, and 10 levels to clear. The music and background will become progressively more intense as you proceed through the levels.<br/><br/>In Hard mode, enemies will bungee back and forth while firing their patterns faster than on Normal mode. In Destroy mode, you can fire back at enemies, and have 3 lives to complete the game. In Survive mode, you have one life, and surviving for 15 seconds clears the level.<br/><br/>Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17d/17d5936c162c694f4a6f9ec3cf1a4bff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BlueCandleGames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
