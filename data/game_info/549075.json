With your superhero strength you can get out, but the alarm system triggers a countdown which sends you back in time. Only solution is to stop the timer somehow before the time runs out. Game progresses through knowledge gained through exploration.</p>\n<p>Hints start appearing on game overs (by time limit) after 5 resets. <br/></p>\n<p>Any feedback is greatly appreciated!
