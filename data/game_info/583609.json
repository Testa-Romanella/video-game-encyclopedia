{"id": 583609, "slug": "rune-guy", "name": "Rune Guy", "name_original": "Rune Guy", "description": "<p>Rune Guy is a game about drawing runes to cast spells and aid in your quest to find 3 magic hourglasses. These spells can be powered by yourself, your surroundings, or sometimes even your adversaries. Step into the shoes of a confused mage lost in a dungeon as you explore the Blunder Engine's first product.</p>\n<p>This game is the invention of Evan Dixon and Patrick Redmond, who have come together for this production under the name Groovacious Games.</p>\n\n\n<p>[NOTE] While there are of course several small bugs in this game's current state, due to its quick development cycle, the most distracting we have found in the currently released version is a music glitch that occurs the third song transition into the main gameplay loop. This does not break the game but it effectively kills the audio until the game is saved and restarted. We have already fixed this bug but can not upload the updated version until after the 2021 Dungeon Crawler Game Jam voting is in. We look forward to updating the game page in 6 days with a new version of Rune Guy![/NOTE]<br/></p>\n\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<p>Programming - Evan Dixon\u00a0</p>\n<p>Level Design - Patrick Redmond</p>\n<p>Game Design - Evan Dixon &amp; Patrick Redmond</p>\n<p>2d Assets:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0-Epic Character Generator</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0-Daz Studio</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0-Mindtex</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0-Cethiel, \"Tileable Bricks Groun Textures - Set 1\"</p>\n<p>Sound FX:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0-Appgamekit Sound Pack</p>\n<p>Music:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0-RandomMind, \"Lament For a Warrior's Soul\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0-Circlerun, \"Toes and Water\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0-Joseph Gilbert/Kistol, \"Crystal Cavern\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T23:50:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f6/5f6924e7cf672a04744366e802598c8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["groovacious_claims", "Rimbozendi"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
