Beware the village's defenses!</p>\n<p>\u00a0~~ CONTROLS ~~</p>\n<p>Use the arrow keys to move around, and make sure to keep your RAGE charged by crushing tiny villagers.</p>\n<p>I had a lot of fun making this! It was my first game jam, and I learned so much. I\u00a0didn't get all the features in that I\u00a0wanted to, but I would like to continue to add to it. To give you an idea, imagine an opening animation, difficulty settings, endless mode, and even a jump mechanic! There are two end conditions, but I worked far longer than I\u00a0should have to balance the game so that it was not too easy and not too challenging, and the end result is slightly too hard!!<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you for playing!</p>\n<p>- Hawkin</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T03:01:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ed/8edb6a2979a6fb9a1e434789b03a4577.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hawkinberry"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
