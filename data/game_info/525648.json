But I believe that even when compared with these famous games, this game will be \"out of the ordinary\" one.<br/><br/>You might say that it looks very similar to \"Fez\". Yes, \"Fez\" is an important source of inspiration for this game. It uses the same <strong>\"lens rotation mechanism\"</strong> as \"Fez\" to switch perspectives.<br/><br/>But what is significantly different from \"Fez\" is that it adds <strong>\"WATCH\"</strong>.<br/><br/><strong>\"WATCH\"</strong> is the heart and soul of this game, and<strong> \"WATCH\"</strong> is also the heart and soul of our eyes. With it, our eyes have the feeling of \"different distances and highs\". For example, a building in the distance is as high as a teacup nearby. , A Boeing 747 can be dragged with one hand, and it can cross distant mountains with a single jump, and so on.<br/><br/><strong>\"WATCH\"</strong> is universal but magical. It makes our lives more colorful.<br/>To <br/>In the game, you will use <strong>\"WATCH\" </strong>to overcome various difficulties, such as,<br/><br/><br/><br/>You also need to avoid seemingly inevitable obstacles, avoid lasers that are really touchable, step on huge and dangerous robots, and let light pass from here to there, or sometimes you are the light yourself.<br/><br/><strong>In the game, you will also encounter various props. These props can better assist you in using the \"WATCH\" principle to overcome difficulties,</strong> for example,<br/><br/><br/>There are two others I didn't say. As for how to use them, you have to rely on your ingenuity.<br/><br/>In addition to the obvious items,<strong> you may also need to use other items, such as the most common box or something similar in the game, you have to push it or get it to the right place.</strong><br/><br/><br/>Wooden boxes are just the most common ones. You will encounter stranger boxes, green buckets that can be picked up and filled with water, and fans that can let you fly into the sky. Remember the robot mentioned earlier? It is also a good combination to have it with the box.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Do you want to fill a bucket with a drop of water? Or let the sun light a cigarette? This requires you to discover in the game.<br/><br/>What if perspective and mirror are combined?</strong><br/><br/><br/>Mirrors don\u2019t have to be flat, special shapes can bring more interesting things, for example,<br/><br/><br/>There are also cylindrical shapes or quadrangular pyramid shapes, which we call \"Anamorphosis\" art.<br/><br/>In all this, when you solve these puzzles, you will find that \"perspective\" not only exists in our real lives, but also hides in our whimsical ideas.<br/>To<br/>Some puzzles are very hard-core and may be puzzled, but what about the 101st thought? Please don't underestimate yourself, you can definitely pass the tests and finally come to the cabin at the beginning of the game to understand the whole story.<br/><br/>The story of the game itself is also a puzzle. It will be confusing at first glance, but if you are not so in a hurry, please don\u2019t miss it easily, just like don\u2019t give up the \"perspective\" puzzle in the game easily. Maybe, You can find us or yourself from this story.<br/><br/>I wanted to put more GIFs, but I put too many GIFs, maybe the store page can't be opened, and you can't see this description. So, if you want to know more, please take a look at the 6 videos above, I hope you like this game, thank you.<br/><br/><strong>(Friendly reminder, please don\u2019t ignore the dialogue in the game, sometimes it may be the key to solving puzzles)</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T03:14:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/966/9660fa33e751d78e5b3a0ede9bcbf08a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 369, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["7OfUs"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u7535\u94ae\u7ec4"], "esrb_rating": null}
