It differs from the original Project 3 game I made with the following modifications<br/></p>\n<ol><li>\u00a0Levels 5-8 Added, all featuring unique puzzles</li><li>A new power-up was added that changes the current amount of jumps the player has at that time</li><li>A new boss enemy was added, similar to the current one but using smart-AI</li><li>Multiple scripts were reworked to allow for new features like:<ol><li>A secret ending from a second end crystal</li><li>A way to allow for a door to open with the right score current on the player</li><li>The new jump power-up was coded from scratch as well</li></ol></li></ol>\n<p>To get the secret ending, the game must be played through and all of the score crystal must be collected by the end, and the player must find the hidden door on the 8th level. It is a nice little reward for anyone who masters each level (some of the crystals are quite difficult to get) and gets all the score crystals. I hope you enjoy my honors project!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T09:22:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e8/4e8bc5f5fe6b09678967c49eca902174.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["meyerti3"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
