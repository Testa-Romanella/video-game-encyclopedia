{"id": 865152, "slug": "untitled-rpg-combat-prototype", "name": "Untitled RPG Combat Prototype", "name_original": "Untitled RPG Combat Prototype", "description": "<p>I'm a huge fan of\u00a0the old-school Final Fantasy games, but I've always found the combat to be lacking in tactics and decision making. You mostly just focus down each enemy one by one\u00a0with strong attacks,\u00a0and heal your HP whenever it gets low.</p>\n<p>I prototyped a combat system that's just complex enough to make you think about what you're doing during a battle, and\u00a0slapped together a\u00a0crude-looking dungeon to see how it would play.</p>\n<p>Use WASD to move, E to confirm selections, and Q to cancel selections. Unfortunately, no controller support at the moment, even though it would be awesome.</p><p>Here's how combat works. Enemies have HP, and they die when it reaches 0. They also have orange dots, called Focus, which they randomly gain every turn. The more Focus they have, the harder they hit. Some of your attacks will reduce their Focus. The idea is to manage every enemy's Focus as you're attacking them.</p>\n<p>Enemies also have a Charge meter at the bottom. Once it's full, on their next turn they will begin a charge-up attack. The target party member is shown next to the enemy, and the enemy becomes more vulnerable to damage. The attack is also vulnerable to being cancelled by some of your party members' attacks, which you likely want to do because these attacks hit really hard.</p>\n<p>Each party member has unique attacks and mechanics.</p>\n<p>Locke can Strike for good damage and build up his Focus meter, Sever to damage enemy Focus, and spend his Focus to Backstab an enemy for big damage and interrupt their charge-up attack.</p>\n<p>Edgar has a crossbow that can hold two bolts. Steel bolts deal good damage and also damage enemy Focus. Barbed bolts deal less damage than Steel, but can interrupt enemy charge-up attacks. Explosive bolts deal high damage. He has to Load bolts two at a time before he can fire them on subsequent turns.</p>\n<p>Sabin has different attacks depending on his Focus meter, with most of his attacks increasing his Focus by one. At 0 he can use weak attacks, and at 1 he can use a strong Hook attack as well as spend his Focus to Sweep and interrupt an enemy charge-up attack.\u00a0 At 2, he can spend that Focus to use the powerful Haymaker attack.</p>\n<p>Cyan deals more damage the more Focus he has. Sheathe will bring his Focus up to 2, although he will lose one on each subsequent turn. Slash deals high damage, Skewer deals lower damage while also damaging enemy Focus, and Parry, which is only available at two Focus, will interrupt an enemy charge-up attack.</p>\n<p>Your party heals in between battles. This dungeon is pretty easy\u00a0to get through without any thought, but in a real version of this, you wouldn't heal between battles and would actually care about taking damage. There would be a healing mechanic of some kind, although it would be limited so that you can't just spam heal through everything.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T07:09:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/572/5727fc6728635ef01abe5544feb39a86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ris"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
