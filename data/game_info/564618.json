You have to go as far as you can. You have to jump over obstacles. The game will speed up every 15 points. It will be in your best interest to take the coins you see. And sometimes instead of money, the clock comes, you better not buy the red clock because the game speeds up and if you collect the green clocks the time will slow down a little. Good luck, good games ...</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 For communication:\u00a0 strawberyydevv@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T09:52:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b76/b76ebbe6c1dd020cc41af583a19b54a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["StrawberryDev"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
