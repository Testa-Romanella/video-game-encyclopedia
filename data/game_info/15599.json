{"id": 15599, "slug": "freedom-fall", "name": "Freedom Fall", "name_original": "Freedom Fall", "description": "Freedom Fall is a diabolical down-scrolling platformer set in a prison tower so tall it touches the clouds. Presented with hand painted art, its old school vibe mixes with fast-paced free falling action and a story with both dark wit and heart. With the promise of freedom for those who escape, find your way through the traps and mechanical monstrosities set up by a twisted princess who you'll wish was in another castle. As your bid for freedom continues you start to see that things aren't quite as they seem. In the end you'll determine who is guilty and who is innocent \u2026 but until then there are lots of deathtraps to avoid, killer balloons to bounce off, jetboards to ride and even a dragon to fight!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-29T23:26:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbb/fbb7a2fbf93832736540ba6d33ac5733.jpg", "website": "http://www.freedomfall.com", "rating": 3.45, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 204, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 23, "ratings_count": 11, "suggestions_count": 277, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 11, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Stirfire Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Stirfire Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
