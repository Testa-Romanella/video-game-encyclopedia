You've returned to the collapsing underground city of Minerva to find out what happened to your mom, who you abandoned while fleeing the city.  If you want to find the answers you're looking for, you'll have to navigate a labyrinth of sewers and rooftops, piece together your history from whatever clues you can scrap together, and contend with the lingering spirits of those who weren't lucky enough to die during the city's collapse.<h3>Explore Minerva, the abandoned underground city halted by time.</h3> <br/><br/><br/>The character must navigate and discover their way through the city of Minerva, a technological metropolis where the dead dream and memories cling to life.  Sewers, rooftops, asylums, hospitals, and schools all remain, buried in place, untouched since the day of collapse.  With the help of your Ferryman guide, you must find what clues you can while surviving the lingering threats that the city still harbors.<h3>Unravel a rich narrative wrapped in pain, guilt, and loss.</h3><br/><br/><br/>How can we live in an unjust world?  What cruel entity forced us to be conscious in a universe with such suffering?  Why is a hideous stuffed cat talking to me, and why can no one else hear them?<br/><br/>Sons of Saturn explores the depths of both the underground city Minerva and the protagonists' psyches.   Investigate both the cause of your pain and the warts that have grown up around it in your brain.<h3>Brought to life with photos of real abandoned locations.</h3><br/>Unedited photo of an abandoned location:<br/><br/><br/><br/>The asset used in the game:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Nearly all of the assets used in Sons of Saturn were derived from real photos, taken by the developers, of breathtaking abandoned locations found all over the world.  We hope exploring the world of Minerva recaptures the magical aura these spaces exude.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-01T09:26:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/753/753a4acf04f3f60af769e1f7304011e4.jpg", "website": "https://sonsofsaturngame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["The Saturn Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["The Saturn Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
