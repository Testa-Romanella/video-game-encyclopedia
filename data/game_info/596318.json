This is the first game I've ever completed and\u00a0my first time participating in a Ludum Dare Jam!\u00a0This was a solo project and I've only been working with Unity for a week. I am also not a programmer. So this was a very difficult, but eventually satisfying experience.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is called To Descend. The player will have to help Jess as she tries to find her way out of a disturbing situation, and a smelly one at that. Use W,A,S,D to move and space to fight. Please do not skip the dialogue!</p>\n\n<p>Sound: Motion Array, Fesliyan Studios</p><p>Web Version:\u00a0https://simmer.io/@ToeKnee/to-descend</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T17:54:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a69/a69d9247496b02e191c8c8a12174469f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Tonio-tech"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
