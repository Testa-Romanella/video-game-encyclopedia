The goal is to survive to the end of a 20 second track while destroying as many other cars as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>Your gas pedal is stuck down so your\u00a0car moves forward automatically.</p>\n<p>Press Left / Right arrows or A / D to change lanes to the left or right.</p>\n<p>Press R to restart</p>\n<p>Sideswipe other cars to make them crash.</p><p>Credits:</p><p>All graphics, art assets, and font by Kenney.
