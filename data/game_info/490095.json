You are \"Spy\" and you have to save the world's pizza. Yes it's that absurd.</p>\n<p>Spy was the first adventure game I ever wrote. I was inspired to write my own after I got the Second Rainbow Book of Adventures and the accompanying cassette. It was written while I was a high school freshman, and it's a snapshot of my young self. The game is presented here with a few bug fixes and minor changes.<br/></p>\n<p>It uses a pretty standard verb noun parser. I didn't bother creating a save and load\u00a0 feature. The puzzles are unfair and don't make a lot of sense. There are instant death moves. Pretty standard stuff for the era. I created a hint file to help you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T05:38:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ace/aceaa0a2d63d252fcb2b97fcb8721de4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Can Ken Make It"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
