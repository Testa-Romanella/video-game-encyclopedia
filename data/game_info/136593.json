He wanted to focus on his own RTS game. Until I am able to find a new partner to help with the heavy project this is, the game will stop getting updates. However, I will continue development on my other projects such as Project Ice and Maze Kid. </em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6c/d6c8df9d1f1eb87425b765b1f195511d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brodie Mongon"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
