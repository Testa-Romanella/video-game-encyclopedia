It was an Itch.io 72-hours Game Jam ; the theme was \"Adventure\" and the restriction was \"Death as a core mechanic\".<br/></p>\n<p>The game is inspired by hack'n'slash games.\u00a0You play a little creature summoned by the Grim Reaper in a way to kill all the adventurers you'll find on your way. Each enemy killed give you souls that you can use to improve your character.</p>\n<p>As the game is only a prototype, you only can buy some \"lives\". In fact, the character never really dies but he goes back to \"hell\" when he's too weak. The player must have to \"die\" to buy some upgrades and then become stronger. That's my approach of the restriction, because death is mandatory to play and success.</p>\n<p>All the code and the assets are made by me, but you're free to reuse them if you want.</p>\n<p>Here you can find the sources of the project, available on github :\u00a0https://github.com/TheoBertet/The-Reaper-Mission</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T10:16:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/552/552534d380b87d90fccfa236380be300.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Th\u00e9o Bertet"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
