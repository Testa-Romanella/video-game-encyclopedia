{"id": 164957, "slug": "zombie-mess", "name": "Zombie Mess", "name_original": "Zombie Mess", "description": "<p>Zombie Mess implements the classic 'barricaded' game mechanics (think early Nazi Zombies). One difference is that zombies don't simply follow the player. Instead, they cooperate and try to corner him. Another major difference is the persistent game world and character. This is the MMORPG side of Zombie Mess. An engaged player would choose a profession (mechanic, doctor or thief), customize and develop his character, make trades with other players, protect his neighbors.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/131/13115bc886898aa13aa0b4d674f6b62b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["n_dot_l"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
