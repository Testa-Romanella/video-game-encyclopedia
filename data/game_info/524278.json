You play as a wizard, doused by shrinking potion who has to fight through his garden to return to his tower and revert back to his original size. With controls inspired by rocket jumping from old school first person shooter games, this is not your typical platformer.</p>\n<p>The demo is currently available! Move with WASD or controller left stick, aim with mouse or controller right stick.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Join our discord: https://discord.gg/JCsypwaS<br/></p><p>FAQ:</p><p><strong>Why can't I jump?</strong></p><p>You need to unlock the <em>Blastwave</em> spell. Keep moving to the right, pick up the potion liquid, and then move to the shrine on the left and hold down E / X on controller.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T08:23:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/47b/47bf6abd093b4e8fe7113afa7fb0d992.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Bad Rooster Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
