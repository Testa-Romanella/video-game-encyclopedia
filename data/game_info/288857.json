{"id": 288857, "slug": "to-the-heights", "name": "To The Heights!", "name_original": "To The Heights!", "description": "To The Heights is a simple yet challenging jumping game based on the soon-to-be Catholic Saint named Pier Giorgio Frassati and his love for mountain climbing. This game is packed with themes that make it all the more enjoyable for Catholics, but don't take away from the experience for non-Catholics. Jump from platform to platform collecting rosary beads as you go, unlocking various outfits and Saints to play with. Watch out for spikes, falling rocks, and icy platforms!<br/><br/>To The Heights has two game modes: Classic mode and Freeplay mode. Classic mode starts with Pier Giorgio outside of a church as he attempts to reach the top of the mountain. Freeplay mode is an endless stage where players can try to beat their high scores.<br/><br/>God bless!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:33:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3a/c3a3df8f6c25a9028834a8f5f71f6184.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Jimmy Reynolds"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Jimmy Reynolds"], "esrb_rating": null}
