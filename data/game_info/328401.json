In the game, the player takes on the role of an embedded photojournalist covering US involvement in the Vietnam War. Ride along with American soldiers as they carry out a mission, and document what you see with your camera; you may see soldiers performing acts of heroism, or perhaps refugees fleeing their homes. The images you capture portray sentiments ranging from pro-war to anti-war, and are graded on their artistic composition. At the field office, interview several soldiers with different questions that can also be used to express different attitudes towards the ongoing war. When it\u2019s time to report back to your editor, choose which photos to submit for publication, and decide which narrative of the war you wish to depict.<br/></p>\n<p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0What kind of article will you publish? What will the tone of the article be? What kind of publication will it be published in? The answers to these questions are all based on your work in the game: your interviews, and the subject and technical quality of your photos.</p>\n<p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Embedded gives you the power to change how the narrative of war is presented in the American media. It expresses the moral quandary of generating news, addressing biases in reporting, and making choices that ultimately decide how the public will feel: is the war a necessary, patriotic action, or a haphazard and cruel one?</p>\n\r\nKey Features\r\n<ul><li>Take photographs in VR</li><li>Photo analysis that judges your images based on sentiment and composition</li><li>Interview soldiers, ask different questions, get different responses</li><li>Many different conclusions!</li></ul>\n\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Embedded requires a high end PC and a SteamVR compatible VR headset and controllers.
