This game chronicles the story of a prisoner of war sold into slavery, male African named Nyeusi Ngurumo and female African named Tulipe Pulpeuse in early 19th century America as they attempt to acquire their freedom. As a slave, you have witnessed the abrupt death of your partner at the hands of slave traders. After your escape, you will run, hide, and fight your way to freedom. Players will have a variety of approaches to choose from to complete each level. You will acquire several different tools such as, pistols, rope, rocks, bottles, and everyday items in order to overcome obstacles you will face. The decisions you make will affect the sanity and credibility of your character. Your credibility can be positively affected by actions, such as sparing an enemy, and negatively affected by other actions, such as failing to save a slave or killing unnecessarily. Depending on the credibility of your character, slaves may decide to join you or run away in fear. Your sanity will degrade if you needlessly kill and murder and be strengthened or repaired through honorable actions. Both systems have a direct impact on gameplay and your character. In this isometric stealth-adventure game, live in the shoes of an African slave seeking freedom for yourself and your enslaved brethren 19th century America</em></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Credits</em></strong>:</p>\n<p>Lead Programmer - John Costa\u00a0https://mr-feesh.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Project Manager - Gillian Buckelew https://gillianbuckelew.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Lead Level Designer - Diego Ochoa\u00a0https://diego-ochoa.itch.io/</p><p>Level Designer - Camron Miles\u00a0https://camronm.itch.io/</p><p>Sound Designer/Composer - Mica Alexander\u00a0https://mica-alexander.itch.io/</p><p>3D Artist/Animation - Manuel Sheller\u00a0\u00a0https://www.linkedin.com/in/manuel-scheller-669b15148/\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-24T07:21:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3a/f3a2c52d803f4faa434716efa2c4b424.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 287, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bryson Harston"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
