Feels good to break my streak of giving up on projects half way through! With that out of the way, I have created a\u00a0couch party style game where you, the Grim Reaper, need to kill as many people as possible with landmines within a minute, while your friend does their best to keep everyone alive. While you can technically play this game yourself, it's recommended to do it with a friend.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Grim Reaper - WASD to move and Space to place landmines</p>\n<p>Other Player - Left Mouse Button to pick up people</p>\n\n<p>Background art and particles created with assets from\u00a0https://kenney.nl/</p>\n\n<p>PS. I didn't get the chance to try playing with another person, so if you do, let me know if you had fun</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T11:53:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63c/63cf3c359236618676480f753661246d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ender Duck"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
