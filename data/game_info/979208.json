The comical universe of the game and its cute characters are what made it so popular back then.<br/>Another reason for its popularity is its action maze-like design. The player must explore every corner of the map to find their way in this surreal universe. The soundtrack is also to be mentioned: in contrast to the surreal world depicted, the music is more down-to-earth and straight to the point.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-29T12:20:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/178/178f69926694a924a48635a0d58e698b.jpg", "website": "https://city-connection.co.jp/hebereke/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CITY CONNECTION"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["CITY CONNECTION"], "esrb_rating": null}
