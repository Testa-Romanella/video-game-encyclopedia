You use the arrow keys to move around, and the sound of your footsteps tell you how close you are to the edge of the platform you're walking on. You can't hear other platforms though. The three discs you have to pick up do play music, but I only had time to write two songs, so the third one just beats a drum over and over.</p>\n<p>To view the credits, press escape. I didn't have time to read them aloud and record them.</p>\n<p>I made this game for the VimJam, and decided I wanted to make it playable without looking at the screen. In practice, it's pretty hard to play with just audio.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T05:54:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9de/9decd6ca633d53b4bffc9acaf47a4f7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["SeaLiteral"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
