As the newest member of London's elite \"Noble Gases\" social club, you'll win glory, renown, and much-needed money through various cunning schemes that will seem like good ideas at the time.<br/><br/>Jolly Good: Cakes and Ale is a 1.2 million\u2014million!\u2014word interactive comedy of manners by Kreg Segall. It's a standalone sequel to Tally Ho inspired by P.G. Wodehouse, where your choices control the story. It's entirely text-based\u2014without graphics or sound effects\u2014and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.<br/><br/>As the close relation of an earl, you've managed to join the once-rather-elite Noble Gases just as you find yourself embroiled in dreadful scandal. But surely your clever new servant ought to be able to solve this knotty problem with both elegance and unruffled grace!*<br/><br/>*Elegance and unruffled grace not guaranteed. Allow four to six weeks for full servant acclimation. While supplies last. Additional restrictions may apply.<br/><br/>Lead your new social club through a world of pranks, debts, close shaves, passions, rivalries, and untold heights of splendor and absurdity amongst the cream of society. Will you lean into your shocking reputation, fight hard to redeem yourself in the eyes of the fickle public, or just relax with a cocktail by the fire? What is most important to you: your own comfort, loyalty to your friends, or the expectations of your family? Navigate the joys and troubles of membership in your new club: planning parties, gaining new members, taking down rivals\u2026or winning them over as friends.<br/><br/>But it's not all shenanigans and hijinks\u2014there's also hanky-panky. Find love with a dreamy artist, a former neighbor with a taste for rebellion, a dashing clubmate with a flair for the dramatic (and for golden trousers), or even your own servant! And, of course, spend time with some old friends from Tally Ho.<br/><br/>Perhaps\u2013just perhaps\u2013with the tireless aid of your cunning servant, your rollicking social club, and your merry new friends, you can weather the storm unscathed and manage it all before everything comes crashing down!
