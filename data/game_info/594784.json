Don't read this if you want to find stuff out on your own: -----------------------------------------------------</strong></p>\n<p>- The deeper you go, the more valuable the ore gets. While ore at near surface level is only worth 1 credit, one ore from the depth can be worth thousands of credits.</p>\n<p>- Always watch your oxygen and depth meter. If you ignore one of them or both death will come very quick. Also watch out for the fish. They are not your friends.</p>\n<p>- Buying equipment that increases your depth always means that new ore types are now accessible, making the ore types you found so far obsolete. Be brave and try diving near your maximum depth limit. Great risks bring great rewards.</p>\n<p>- Always remember in which direction you headed. Always try to remember your way back to the ladder.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0If you have to grind for a long time for your next piece of equipment you're probably doing something wrong.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T10:56:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4df/4dfb83d1da97d2a30afc95327d714b42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 254, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Warkus"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
