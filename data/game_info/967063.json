They find themselves in Queen's Isle, a small isolated island country governed by President Danielle Ashcroft. Ashcroft and her all-female government have transformed the country into a matriarchal society where men are considered second-rate citizens.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a player, you assume the role of the husband in the couple. Together with your wife, Kalie, you must navigate and adapt to your new roles within this unfamiliar environment. While Kalie feels appreciated and valued by President Ashcroft, you, as the male hero, only encounter disdain and humiliation.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, you will encounter a diverse cast of characters inhabiting Queen's Isle. These characters range from attractive, high-powered dominant women to oppressed individuals who oppose the regime. The choices you make will have consequences and influence the outcome of the story.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Will the main hero overcome his initial reluctance and find satisfaction in his new subservient role? Alternatively, will he actively work to undermine Ashcroft's rule? What challenges will arise for him and Kalie, and how will their marriage withstand the unique circumstances they face?<br/><br/>By making choices throughout the game, both seemingly insignificant and pivotal, you will shape the destiny of the characters and determine the course of their story.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-29T05:43:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc5/fc5ba99cebba89bec478816bef5fbb17.jpg", "website": "https://gynocracy.brecleas.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Brecleas Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Brecleas Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
