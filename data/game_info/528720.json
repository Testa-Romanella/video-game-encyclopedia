In order to perpetuate your name in history, you need to defeat the dragon and on the way you will meet many other enemies. Enemies have different characteristics, so you need to act quickly by collecting combinations of 3 or more identical tiles to attack the enemy. As you progress, your character becomes stronger and learns new magic spells: you can turn the enemy into a stone, or make a hoof strike, make a big combo and deal a lot of damage to the enemy!<br/><br/><strong>Game Features:</strong><br/><ul><li>- 3 locations<br/></li><li>- Dozens of enemies<br/></li><li>- Nice graphics<br/></li><li>- Steam Achievements support<br/></li><li>- Interesting casual gameplay</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T02:57:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bce/bce9fd9c96084473139d9cd50eec488b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Garage Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Garage Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
