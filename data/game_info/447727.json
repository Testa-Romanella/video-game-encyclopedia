Level Packs that have boss levels are going to normally locked behind a difficulty (Impossible) that's the only way to play the boss levels. (<em>FOR PACKS WITH HIDDEN BOSS LEVELS:</em>\u00a010 levels = 5 normal levels and 5 boss levels. IF YOU DON'T PLAY ON IMPOSSIBLE YOU ONLY CAN PLAY 5 LEVELS!) There's only going to be a total of 9 level packs that can be active at once and 3 of those are taken up and always active (NOT ALL OF THEM ARE COMPLETE) this means future packs can be turned of in favor of mods!
