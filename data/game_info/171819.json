{"id": 171819, "slug": "the-norse-coast", "name": "The Norse Coast", "name_original": "The Norse Coast", "description": "<p>There was a vicious mortal conflict between The Sharks and The Puffers on a nearby coral reef. Many creatures were killed. Much of the reef was destroyed. But, life finds a way. The salt flat in which you live is now being showered with fresh resources. The bad news is that you aren't the only creature that lives on the flat. Use your newfound wealth to recruit teammates and battle for complete control of your homeland. The game is won when there are no enemy creatures on the map (mini fish and anglers excluded, giant squid included).</p>\n<p>The Norse Coast is a single-player action strategy game set under the sea. There is an elemental damage system which plays a significant role in victory or defeat.\u00a0 Consider what special units are in play and what those special units can and cannot do to win.</p>\n<p>Hitting a mini fish with any type of shot will add time to your speed boost bar. Defeating an angler before it takes a bite out of you will increase your max unit count. Defeating the giant squid gives your current and future teammates health regeneration (they have none by default) and doubles your health regeneration speed. The squid is tough and will be difficult to defeat with less than ten units. Have fun and dominate the coast!</p>\n\n<p>Music by Alex Cap. alexcapmusic.com.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a91/a91ca63752eaf3aac08193102e839e80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tyrone Black"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
