It was released in Japan on October 21, 1992, in North America on November 2, 1992, and in Europe on January 28, 1993. Super Mario Land 2 was created by director Hiroji Kiyotake rather than Mario series creator Shigeru Miyamoto.</p>\n<p>In Super Mario Land 2, the player assumes the role of the protagonist Mario, whose main objective is to reclaim his castle, stolen by the antagonist Wario who is the evil doppelganger of Mario. However, the magical seal that Wario placed on the castle entrance can only be undone by collecting the six Golden Coins, which are guarded by Wario's henchmen in various locales of Mario Land. Mario's quest revolves around retrieving each of the golden coins in order to regain access to his castle and defeat Wario. Super Mario Land 2 is notable for its debut of Wario, who later became the protagonist of the spin-off Wario series starting with the game's sequel, Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-09T18:51:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c5/0c5568ff89d3b90c74660df1a748275a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.24, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 15, "owned": 49, "beaten": 107, "toplay": 25, "dropped": 16}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 84, "suggestions_count": 269, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 88, "platforms": ["Game Boy", "Nintendo 3DS"], "developers": ["Nintendo"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
