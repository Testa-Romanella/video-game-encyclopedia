{"id": 725046, "slug": "command-economy", "name": "Command Economy", "name_original": "Command Economy", "description": "Prove Marx Right!\r\n<p>Capitalist economies are run as free markets where the business-people selling goods decide how much to produce and how much to sell for. The biggest competing idea is the so-called \"command economy\" where the government decides what to produce and what to charge for it. If executed well (that's a big if!), command economies promise to be far more efficient and equitable than market economies.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you lead your economy into the future? Or will your unsatisfied citizens depose you?</strong></p>\n<p>As the leader of your economy, you will:</p>\n<ul><li>Assign laborers to production of commodities (like bread, clothes, etc)</li><li>Set laborer's wages</li><li>Set the price of goods</li></ul>\n<p>And then on each day of the simulation (2 days per second of real time), the following will occur for each commodity:<br/></p>\n<ol><li>Pay the laborers based on their wages\u00a0</li><li>Laborers produce inventory based on number of laborers divided by\u00a0labor required per unit</li><li>Citizens purchase that commodity based on its demand (demand is function of population size and price) and the inventory of that commodity available to buy.</li></ol>\n<p>If at any step in the above there is a deficit (ie there isn't enough capital to pay workers, or there isn't enough inventory to meet demand, or labor doesn't have enough savings to afford their demand), then unrest will rise. After a time of economic stability, unrest will start to fall again.\u00a0If unrest hits 100% then the population will rise up and overthrow you.\u00a0<br/><br/>Unlock additional commodities at fixed intervals as your economy matures. This game is winnable (a play-through takes 10-20 minutes), but I'll leave the win condition as a surprise.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T09:18:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eff/eff7eef037565f060959dcf2beae90bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ben Eskildsen"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
