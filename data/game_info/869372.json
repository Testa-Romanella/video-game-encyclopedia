This game is based on the principles of Quest 64, Holy Magic Century or Eltale Monsters ( \u30a8\u30eb\u30c6\u30a4\u30eb \u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba ). We have tried to create a spiritual successor that would keep a good part of the original game mechanics while bringing new elements in terms of game-play. As this game is made using SGB we wasn't able to bring back the original combat system. One new mechanic is the Capture/Summon mechanic. This new game-play element enable the player to capture monsters they encounter to summon them in battle as an ally.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We strongly recommend to play the game with a controller</strong> but It is entirely possible to play with the keyboard due to the fact that the camera automatically follow you when using the run button.</p>\n\n<p>The game has been made entirely with the Smile Game Builder engine and as not been exported to Unity to customize it in any way! So this game is an example of what you can do with the SGB engine without any knowledge of programming whatsoever!
