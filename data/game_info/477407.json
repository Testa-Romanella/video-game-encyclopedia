You can only defeat the boss with your friends!</p>\n<p>Make friends and take on bosses!</p>\n<p>My game is related to my synthesis in that in order to progress in the game, players must work together to overcome challenges and as they do, form bonds and communities. The best way to meet players is through overcoming the challenges together, or by helping them when they need it. This is shown through the \"call for help\" button.</p>\n\n<p>Font:\u00a0Wojciech Kalinowski</p>\n<p>Art/Programmer: andrewoid</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T02:52:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f5/2f56166ed749bf8590a4e065c69e5984.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["andrewoid"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
