You are quarantined in your dorm room and have to do everything from here.Finish the project within the 7 days to pass. But don't run out of energy! You can also buy upgrades to your room online by using money from your online job to help make your project easier.</p>\n<p>This game is another really fun game that has a silly feel to it.
