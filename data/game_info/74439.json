Mad Monkey steals all of your precious items, and then tosses them down at you trying to ruin your day! Chase him in the forest, the circus, a science lab (after an experiment gone wrong) and then face him as a ninja monkey! Catch everything he throws down at you in each level, and watch him get mad. He then throws faster and moves faster trying to splat everything!<br/><br/>You can now poke the monkey and annoy him some when he makes you mad!<br/><br/>Be on the look out for the hidden monkey, he only pops out for a second and you have to tap him to unlock a secret bonus level that will boost your score much higher.<br/><br/>Fun, addictive, arcade style gameplay.<br/>Easy to pick up and play.<br/>Ninja Monkeys. (Definitely worth buying for this one feature alone!)<br/>Precise touch control.<br/>Great music and sound effects.<br/>Retina Display support (Icon and Game Graphics)<br/>Universal App (pay once and get it for iPhone,iPod, and iPad)<br/><br/>More levels, hidden secrets, and crazy monkeys are all coming soon!<br/><br/>Intro Mad Monkey voice over by David Bottoms.<br/><br/>============<br/>Want more info and a video?
