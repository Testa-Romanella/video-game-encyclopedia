Since there was a\u00a0game jam going on for the Charge SRD (a system I had already been wanting to play with), I decided this was the perfect chance to finally put all my ideas to paper.</p>\n<p>It's very much an ode to the magical girl and sentai shows of my youth, namely Sailor Moon and Saint Seiya. If you enjoy getting to be a \"fated magical hero\" in a team with matching themes and beating up bad guys, I think you're going to like this one.</p>\n<p>Charge has very simple and versatile mechanics, and I hope I've done them justice in this silly little project of mine.</p>\n<p>\u25c6 \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \u2774\u272a\u2775 \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \u25c6<br/></p>\r\nFiles\r\n<p>I'm happy to announce that the fully fancified PDF version of the game is now available!\u00a0So you now have THREE file options to suit your needs\u2014 a plaintext file that's friendly to screenreaders, a file straight from the word processor that's also plaintext but with some pretty colors, and the full-color, full-decor PDF.</p>\n<p>\u25c6 \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \u2774\u272a\u2775 \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \u25c6<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-09T02:06:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35d/35d60bfe81e80a527925ca59ef043699.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pyreflies"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
