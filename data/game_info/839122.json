Plunder Struck features a wide variety of quests that include assassinating targets, guarding areas, collecting certain numbers of goods and weapons, and exploring new locations. The economy is also complex and their are many ways to make money. However, the most  valuable items for completing quests and turning a huge profit is obviously shiny, glittery, eye catching  Silver coins, Gold Bars, Ancient Artifacts and Rare Gems. Few feelings are more satisfying that successfully extracting the map with a Crimson Gem that only has a 0.01 percent chance of spawning or an Ornate Cross Necklace that allows the player to regenerate health and only has a 3 percent chance of spawning. The constant search for Legendary Treasure is just as exciting as finally finding a piece of it, and the feeling of successfully escaping with it and joyfully holding it in the safety of your hideout is priceless.<h3>Record Breaking Graphics</h3>Plunder Struck features a day and night cycle and a dynamic weather system.
