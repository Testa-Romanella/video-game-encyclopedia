Every unit has certain number of turns, after which his direction of movement can be changed.</p><p>It's tower defence element is, of course, in the fact that you are defending your tower from incoming enemies. Enemies will spawn around the borders of the map and try to advance towards your tower. When you lose all HP, you lose.</p><p>It's \"short-term memory\" element is in fact that you can not always see your enemies. Collectables will stay visible even in the fog of war, but enemies will not (at least they should not :)\u00a0) You have to remember the direction of attack and try to deflect it with your defender units.</p><p>Energy drink element\u00a0 is mushrooms :) The expand your vision for a number of turns.</p><p>It is playable for 10 minutes, but you will get bored sooner :)</p><p>I am looking forward to bonus points for meeting criteria, but I am well aware of the fact that it is not a fun game (yet). It was made in less that 24 hours of 96, and I barely managed to assemble this prototype into working state. A lot of values should be tweaked to improve the fun element, but it's 5 a.m. already, and I already posted it 13 minutes later than the deadline, so I would prefer not to touch anything for now :)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-11T03:26:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/915/915063d2f0fb694cb9fafcdb089a4b3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dimonasdf"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
