You have to protect the refugee forces till the evacuation timer expires on the top right of the screen. The game ends when the timer expires or you lose all the turret health. The time freeze greatly slows down the enemies and gives you the ability to shoot through enemy bullets. This depletes energy bar so use wisely!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ee/1eece15bc46e472b59fd0d6107889f73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zoromoth"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
