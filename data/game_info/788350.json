Artists used Maya and Substance Painter to model and texture props, terrain, and animals. Programmers refined the kart\u2019s physics and coded interactions with patrolling animals and other obstacles. The player can adjust velocity using drift controls and golden speed boosters around the track. In the cloud area, low-gravity settings enable the kart to bounce across clouds and reach the finish line.</p>\r\nTeam\r\n<p>Artists: Vivian Yeh, Gregory Claver</p>\n<p>Programmers: Faith Madeoy Gault, Keara Cogan</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Smoke Sprite Sheet Transparent, VHV.RS. https://www.vhv.rs/viewpic/hRxhxR_smoke-sprite-sheet-transparent-hd-png-download/\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Stylized Tree Bark with Moss, 3dex. https://3dex.gumroad.com/l/MossyBark\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Stylized Wood Bark, 3dex. https://3dex.gumroad.com/l/DesignerBark\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wall Stone 023, 3D Textures. https://3dtextures.me/2022/04/03/wall-stone-023/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T14:33:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24e/24eba18a920b7de5d77498c52e426a3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["castledrift"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
