I learned a lot and I think it was a fun experience. The game that i made is very simple. It's about two robots and you can control them by clicking on the screen. If you press the spacebar, you can control the other robot. The goal is that both robots don't hit the missiles. Please let me know what you think.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T14:36:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55b/55b2906cff8670586f00f2a931169a21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KeanoMoris"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
