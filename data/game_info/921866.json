{"id": 921866, "slug": "bitmech-demo", "name": "BitMech Demo", "name_original": "BitMech Demo", "description": "<p>Bitmech is a game that allows the player to design their own transforming mech, which they will eventually use to fight hordes of enemies and advance across a massive battlefield. For now\u00a0this demo only contains the loading of custom assets, as well as some basic terrain, weapons, and enemies (that don't even have AI currently).\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"redcar.zip\" can be un-zipped and placed into the file directory \"%appdata%/local/BitMech_proper \". The Demo currently looks for a folder named \"redcar\", and upon finding it will load the contained assets. To be clear, you design the mech's visuals\u00a0by editing the files contained within \"redcar\". In-game, you can customize a weapon loadout. I look forwards to seeing where this whole thing goes!</p>\n<p>================================</p>\n<p> Basic Controls</p>\n<p>Vehicle mode:</p>\n<p> WASD - Move</p>\n<p> space - Boost</p>\n<p> t - transform to mech</p>\n<p>Mech mode:</p>\n<p> WASD - move</p>\n<p> space - Jump</p>\n<p> t - transform to land vehicle</p>\n<p> N - fire right hand weapon</p>\n<p> M - fire left hand weapon</p>\n<p>Developer Controls (will be removed in actual game)</p>\n<p>Left shift + 1 - swap left hand weapon to repeater</p>\n<p>Left shift + 2 - swap left hand weapon to Chainsaw</p>\n<p>Left shift + Q - Create Enemy Mech on cursor</p>\n<p>Left shift + E - Toggle control of enemy Mech nearest to cursor</p>\n<p>Right shift + 1 - swap Right hand weapon to repeater</p>\n<p>Right shift + 2 - swap Right hand weapon to Chainsaw</p>\n<p>Right shift + Q - Decrease player jump height</p>\n<p>Right shift + E - Increase player jump height (can land on buildings)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T01:59:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2bc/2bc646676af8d969e62d6daf3989802c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TBatlas"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
