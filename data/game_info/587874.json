Pickup gems to upgrade the gun speed, projectile speed  and projectile size and pickup the star to finish. Every time you die  or collect the star, a new unique world is generated. Also the main menu  is a joke placeholder.\r\n    </p>\n<p>Developed solo in Godot using assets by Kenney.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\n<strong>Controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>A and D to move\r\n</li><li>Space to jump\r\n</li><li>Mouse to aim and Left Click to shoot\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T03:56:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d4/7d4d33f957bac42542e675b16879f026.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Alternatic"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
