Your character will attack automatically!\r\n </p>\r\nRules\r\n<p>The goal is to enter the coffee shop as quickly as possible. But, you will be unable to enter the coffee shop until you have zero health.\r\n </p>\n<p>Let the baddies hit you until you lose all your health.\r\n </p>\n<p>Each time you kill a baddie, the flow of time will accelerate slightly (until a certain maximum).\r\n </p>\n<p>Occasionally, your father will appear from the window of the coffee shop and drop a coffee power up. The power up will greatly reduce the speed of the baddies, making them easier to bump into. However, it will also make your auto attack trigger randomly, so it is risky to use the power up.\r\n </p>\r\nBehind the Scenes\r\n<p>This game was made for Global Game Jam 2023, where the theme was \u201croots\u201d.\r\n </p>\n<p>I interpreted \u201croots\u201d in the sense of someone returning to where they came from. So I imagined a cliched video game hero, in the form of a knight, who has to give up their life of battle to return to their aging parent\u2019s home to take over the family business, which happens to be a coffee shop.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T01:22:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/466/466cf1b4c918f2b443acdfc763f80742.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["radicalslice"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
