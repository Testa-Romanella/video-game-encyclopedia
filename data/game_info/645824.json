Its got a kinda mid 90s pc retro aesthetic stemming from my tastes in video games, and my current skill of low level programming.\r\n</p>\n<p>Most things like controls are covered in the README.TXT of the game, so I won't go over them here. But besides a few quirks the game is pretty easy to just pick up and play.\r\n</p>\n<p>Its really just a game made for fun, its not meant to be great but I've had a lot of fun playing and making it so I hope other would too!\r\n</p><p>Also check out the cool community Discord server too!\u00a0https://discord.gg/k7qUrwjNC</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T08:31:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/898/898f87c889946befe7650bb25c02b8c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Napoleon"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
