Players select a number of classes to travel with them into the depths of a dungeon, unlocking new classes and areas. Winning top-down style battles will reward you with gold, which can be used to increase the effectiveness of each class in the case of your untimely demise. There are many unique items found throughout the dungeon that can help or hinder your attempts to reach the bottom, and a number of bosses will appear and block your path.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:53:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07e/07ec313b50ec6791e31eea86d6e10a51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 252, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joseph Griggs"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Joseph Griggs"], "esrb_rating": null}
