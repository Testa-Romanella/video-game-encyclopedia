Mines are either positive or negative, and have a value of 1, 2, or 3.\u00a0Numbers denote how many mines surround a tile, and the border color of a tile denotes whether the sum of the mines is positive (Green), negative (Red), or zero (Yellow). When a mine is flipped, your score and time are changed, with positive mines incrementing your time and score, and negative mines decrementing them. Boards are cleared once only negative mines remain unflipped.\u00a0For every board you clear, the value of each space will be increased, and a bonus will be awarded upon a boards completion depending on your remaining time. The game ends when you run out of points or time. How far can you go?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T13:03:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a0/7a0c9dff17537960b5d4c7de6e206a4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DAwesme"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
