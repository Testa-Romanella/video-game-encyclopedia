Also expect the kid to smash the controller into floor at times of intense exploration of how stuff works. Note: The triggers are connected to rumble, so expect battery drain.<br/></p>\n<p>I have tested it with PS4 and Xbox controller, but anything Unity has built support for should work with it.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Esc to exit</strong>. Controller only.<br/></p>\n<p>Bugs: The controller should be attached to the computer <em>before </em>you start the toy. Disconnecting it afterwards is indicated.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-15T03:30:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f60/f600d694629812f0d8011feceefacd4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["irve"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
