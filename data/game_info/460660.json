I\u00a0could for sure add more kind of tracks, but for now I'm moving on to the next idea.</p>\n<p>Feedback or suggestions so welcome!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T02:47:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5d/a5d3324e75bd45b5040ebecbece95cd8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["marteena"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
