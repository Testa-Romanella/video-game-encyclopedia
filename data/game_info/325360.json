Will you dare to take part in the secret word-challenge? The rules are simple. You have only 1 minute to spell out all words appearing on black board. Use all your attention and fast fingers to shoot letters in correct order to win in this mind battle.</p>\n<p>Use keyboard/mouse to type the words correctly. Currently, the \"survival\" mode is implemented so far, where each next level requires more words to complete for the same amount of time. How far will you go?<br/></p>\r\nGame Development\r\n<p>The current state of the game is a prototype/early alpha. There is some sort of road map. But games is for gamers, so if you have any suggestions/comments/bug-reports please don't passing by. Any feedback would be helpful for further game evolution. The current progress is listed in the development logs.</p>\n<p>A game by Undrev.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T12:53:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1e/f1e8ea53e79c732642e209114df58315.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["undrev"], "genres": ["Action", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
