At some point it became clear that it had grown in scope far more than I had intended and I felt I should remake the visuals\u00a0to get it to a point that I wouldn't have any copyright issues.\u00a0 Eventually I also started changing a lot of the gameplay to match the new visuals, and the new game started becoming it's own thing. Eventually I split off the project again and made Trash Quest, with the intention of coming back to the larger project when I had time. Trash Quest has far exceeded my expectation and instead of coming back to the project that spawned it, I'll probably be moving on to making a sequel. It will incorporate a lot of the mechanics of all previous projects and will be an amalgamation of all the projects that lead to Trash Quest.</p>\n<p>With that all being said, I no longer see my future project as just a reskinned Spikero, so I've decided that even though I no longer intend to finish this project, I will (somewhat) quietly release this and let those who are interested have a go.</p>\n<p>There will be bugs. There will be dead ends.</p>\n<p>But I hope there will also be some fun to be found.</p>\n<p>There's no in game soundtrack, so I recommend playing this in the background:\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>Discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/SyEKQmT</p>\n<p>Xbox controller:\r\nA to jump\r\nB to spin\r\nX or Right Trigger\u00a0to grapple/tongue\r\nY to map\r\n</p>\n<p>Keyboard:\r\nZ to jump\r\nX to spin\r\nC to grapple/tongue\r\nM to map\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T05:42:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f0f/f0f391090a645c34d5cb55dda709535b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FrancisVace"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
