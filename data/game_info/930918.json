Thus, each level is a full-fledged mini-game with its own story.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe sound of each level changes due to your movements through the location. And the biggest changes in sound occur when you interact with special objects, such as Monoliths. The audio experience of each playthrough is unique, in many cases you choose yourself which music track will be played in that location.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- about 1 hour of gameplay<br/>\r\n- 10 levels to explore<br/>\r\n- no text", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-02T18:29:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69f/69fd3077e10858988c412e1d4656dd29.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Podoba Interactive"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Marevo Collective"], "esrb_rating": null}
