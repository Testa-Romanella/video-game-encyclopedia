As he wanders the block, he shares fleeting connections over cigarettes with other lonely souls living on the fringe.<br/><br/><strong>The Immaculate Drag</strong> is an atmospheric first-person walking/talking/smoking simulator, a brief experience that takes players on a melancholic journey through themes of depression, nostalgia, mortality, and the meaning of creativity. <br/><br/>Featuring branching dialogues with a cast of eccentric characters and an evocative original score inspired by retrowave, lof-fi hip hop, and jazz, <strong>The Immaculate Drag</strong> invites you to light up and let go.<br/><br/>Breathe deep, life is short.<br/><br/>PLEASE NOTE: The Immmaculate Drag is a small game, and a single playthrough should take 30-45 minutes on average.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T03:39:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f00/f00a4833695b0c489548f8f05c1d2512.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Discrete Infinity"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Discrete Infinity"], "esrb_rating": null}
