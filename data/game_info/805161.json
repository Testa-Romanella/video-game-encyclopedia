However his tan is not finished and he really does not feel like staying in the dark night for so long. He\u00a0 will have to escape the night and run, fly and float towards the sun while avoiding yetis, UFOs and any other obstacle that might cross his path. Who knows, perhaps our little friend will get to meet the sun in person and finally achieve his dream tan at the end of this quest?\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\nControls\u00a0\r\n<p>Move with WASD\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Jump with W\r\n</p>\n<p>Dash with M when the penguin icon is blue\r\n</p>\n<p>Restart the level with Esc\r\n</p>\r\nTeam\r\n<p>Cochon Viking\u00a0 - Game Artist\r\n</p>\n<p>Talamh - Sound Designer\r\n</p>\n<p>Maureen Bastian - Game Designer\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Maxence Maire - Programmer\r\n</p>\n<p>Ahmed Ben Amor - Producer\r\n</p>\n<p>This game was developed in 48 hours as part of the Game Jam \u201cDon\u2019t stay in the dark\u201d\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T13:17:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb7/eb7cea6beb5fc446645fc50b0d5a1a34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cochon_Viking", "FeuilleMorte Entertainment", "Pioure", "Talamh", "Maureen Bst"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
