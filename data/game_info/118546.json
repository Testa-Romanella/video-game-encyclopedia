{"id": 118546, "slug": "seagulls", "name": "Seagulls", "name_original": "Seagulls", "description": "<p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tSeagulls is the adventure of Steven Seagull from boyhood to manhood. Kicked from his nest by his mother, he must learn what it takes for a seagull to survive on Larus Island. Finding his mother missing he must go on a quest to find and rescue her, proving his value in seagull society. Throughout the game you will play as Steven as he meets a zany cast of birds who will help him find his mother and grow as a seagull. Flapping into the sky, gliding through the air, grabbing objects and pooping on your enemies are just a few of the things you will experience.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSeagulls also offers local multiplayer! Three different arenas where you can complete with your friends to find out who is the best seagull around.\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>Shoot 'Em Up has you flying at top speeds to shoot down the most targets. Whoever gets the most hits wins! Can you outshoot your friends?</li>\n<li>Box Drop is about collecting the most boxes as they fall from the sky (and if you are sneaky enough, from your opponent's collection area!). Get the most boxes in your goal before time runs out!</li>\n<li>Destruction is all about blowing stuff up! Fly around the arena pooping on as many things as you can in the time assigned. Chairs, beach umbrellas, tables, cars and even buildings will crumble before you in this explosive mini-game.</li>\n</ul><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>Producer - Kory Lauver</p><p>\r\n\tCreative Director - Kyle Kolburg\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tTechnical Director - Brandon Austin\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tLead Designer - Richard Gray\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tLead Artist - Brenda Cruz\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tArtist -Abdulrahman Hashim\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tArtist - Jordan Ritter\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tArtist - Tommy Tyson\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tDesigner - Andres Lopez\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tDesigner - Bryce Hodges\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tDesigner - Sam Heineman\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tDesigner - Francisco Martinez\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tDesigner - Ryan Stith\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tProgrammer - Adam Clark\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tProgrammer - Keenan Horrell\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e9/9e9fcdd4072c8e0e2ac5161b66cbe940.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kory Lauver"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
