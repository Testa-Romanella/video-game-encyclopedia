Space to jump. R or Right CTRL to Reset immediately (jam it if you want to see the levels generate).\u00a0<br/><br/><br/>Plan your movements carefully. Jump pits, keep moving to avoid boulders (they are safe once they land).\u00a0<br/><br/>Tips: Let off the move key right as you hit the exit (you slide ever so slightly). The next levels lava won't start to rise until you press a key (this also stops you from diving straight into a pit). You can change directions mid air so if you're feeling gutsy you can get floating treasure from corners.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b11/b11156e00eea5425a74dccff1e7d1fe8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Elrobo"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
