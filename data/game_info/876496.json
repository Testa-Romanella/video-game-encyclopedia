Two good jihadis have the idea of robbing tombs to make a living because they have enough to eat.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nZhou Dasheng and Liu Yaoqiang began to gain the first barrel of gold from the tomb. Liu Yaoqiang began to expand. He lost all the money he had earned so hard to bring Ah Sheng's insight to the Japanese casino. So far, in order to satisfy Brother Qiang's vanity and gambling habits, the two men have made several tombs. In the process, the Japanese buyer asked them to help an archaeological team dig the ancient tomb and bring some things back. By accident, they knew the Japanese purpose.
