The faster \r\nyou press it, the more damage you do. Win more rounds than your opponent\r\n to win the match. You can also play against the computer, who's pretty \r\nchallenging. You can also play with 2 players, which is also really fun.\r\n It's a fun little fighting game that relies on speed. Please give it a \r\ntry and tell me what you think.
