Though we have our work cut out for us to find the planet's next 10 trillion species, we have to begin somewhere,\" the developers explain.\n\nCheck out the video below:\n\n\"The video game is a dramatic, extremely realistic way to travel through the ocean with coral reefs,\" said Outhouse CEO Micah Smoak.\n\n\"Coral reefs grow in numbers and are way more diverse than many people realize. We have created a video game that's meant to give you the sense of what a coral reef looks like, what corals can do and how important they are to our ocean.\n\n\"It's like dinosaurs hunting for food in the ocean today, but with corals. We hope that you will enjoy our creation and meet the amazing creatures in the video game.\"\n\n(Source: @katieacken)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T09:33:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a2/2a27e6f524717ac60b3b3ec9f6302bd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
