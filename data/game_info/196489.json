He meets a fairy there, which allows him the power to create explosions. You move either move the ninja, or select the location for the explosion with the mouse. This creates a puzzle game unique in its kind.</p><p><em>\"I think this is a really cool game. Level structure and leveldesign is very good and the idea is also very original (never seen something like this before). There are a few fun puzzles where I really had to think for a while and often I don't just had to blow a way through the blocks, but I had to think how the terrain would react on my explosion.\"</em> - Kah, Dutch Game Maker Community</p><p>The game contains 20 normal levels, 5 bonus levels (accessable when the game is beaten), and funny dialog between the ninja and the fairy. Most people beat the game in 45 minutes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2cb/2cbdb91c91a0ab24a65ebd208f795743.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Auroriax"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
