The game was developed in roughly nine months and was created in Game Maker Studio. The main idea behind the game was to create a 2D game with pre-rendered 3D assets, meaning that RAM was entirely animated in 3D.</p>\n<p>The game features four levels plus a tutorial stage, a main menu, credits scene and intro title screen. This was one of the first games I've ever made (before I understood what OOP was), so don't expect a super high quality product but rather a time capsule to see how my skills have progressed as a developer.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T06:33:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc0/fc03f6f6f3c21fb7db01ae1ea1573af3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["David Schutte"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
