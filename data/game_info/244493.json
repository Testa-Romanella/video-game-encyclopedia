This New Enlightenment era would lead humanity to the furthest edges scientific thought, and as a result, rejuvenate the life of the planet.</p>\n<p>To accelerate this era of enlightenment, Professor Tantalus Ohm, a rising star in robotics and computer science, and Dr. Lisa Shannon, the leading mind in artificial intelligence and information systems, created the Mega Drive Core to help spearhead the restoration and preservation of humanity.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Years later, through deception and betrayal, Shannon\u2019s part in the creation of the Mega Drive Core was eventually forgotten. Ohm was worshipped as a hero, and eventually, as the only voice that ever mattered. It was only a matter of time before war soon followed.<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks to his conquests, Ohm now has the tools to rebuild the world as he sees fit. His newest invention, the Calamity Contraption, would bathe the world in a wave of radiation once more. If the weapon is activated, the damage would be irreparable.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>But Unbeknownst to Professor Ohm, the Mega Drive Core never forgot its primary programming\u2026</p>\n<p>Time to save the world from calamity!</p>\n<p><em><strong>- The Gameplay</strong></em>\r\n\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Jolt: Fully Charged\u00a0</em>is made in the image of 16-bit era platformers, and functions the way you would expect it to. Your goal is to reach the end of each level, defeat the boss, and continue onto the next stage.\r\nWhere things differ, however, is Jolt's ability to become intangible and phase through enemies with his signature Bolt Dash. <br/><br/>Combined with his wall jump and double jump, the player has many different approaches to situations they'll encounter.\r\nYou collect various power ups, such as the Dash Shield, which gives you new abilities such as double-dash, item magnetism, or even the ability to glide. Explore and find them all!</p>\n<p>While this may seem like an easy challenge, where Jolt differs from most\u00a0platformers is that the character's health is carried through each of the stages (since they are being pursued by the main antagonist). This means that exploration is the only way to recover health, but doing so comes with its own risks.\u00a0<br/><br/>Make your choice fast though, Professor Ohm is coming for you!</p>\n<p><em><strong>- The Controls</strong></em></p>\n<p>Escape \u2013 Pauses the game; access options or quit.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Left/Right Arrow Keys \u2013 Move Left or Right\r\n  </p>\n<p>Up Arrow Key \u2013 Jump/Double Jump/(As Cycle)Multi-Jump\r\n  </p>\n<p>Z (In cutscene/menu)\u00a0- Confirm,\u00a0Advance Text.</p>\n<p>Z (+ Direction) \u2013 Bolt Dash/ (As Cycle)Spark Spin/(As Cycle)(Z multiple times) Disregard Known Laws of Physics</p>\n<p><em><strong>- The Features</strong></em></p>\n<p>\u00a010+ Large Levels, each with their own challenges.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Fast-paced platforming with an emphasis on aerial control and momentum.</p>\n<p>\u00a0A\u00a0similar, but distinct, playstyle for all playable characters, with other characters being unlocked through gameplay.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Additional gameplay modes, including alternate story modes (complete with playable characters), a time attack mode, and two secret modes unlocked through exploration of the main game.
