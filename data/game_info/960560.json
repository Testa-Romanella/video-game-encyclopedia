One day, an evil wizard stole six mystical hearts that protected the land and retreated to an old lighthouse.

To make matters worse, the wizard sealed the sacred hearts within the bodies of six horrifying creatures that protect each floor of the lighthouse.</p>\n<p>All seems lost until a man named Harry Flowerpower, armed with an unlimited stockpile of axes and spears, decides to scale the deadly tower, reclaim the hearts, and defeat the evil wizard to restore peace to the land of Neo-Africa... or die trying.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2007-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-11T15:49:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f05/f054e2ceedf8204c910fd95aab9613c7.jpg", "website": "https://archive.org/details/BananaNababa", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
