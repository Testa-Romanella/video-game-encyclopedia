You have been designed to explore the universe and colonize at least 10 new planets for your glorious empire!\r\nWill you succeed? The fate of Humanity rests upon you.</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>The game has two phases :<br/></p>\n<ul><li>First, when you are flying in space, you can use the\u00a0<strong>WASD</strong> or the\u00a0<strong>ZQSD</strong> or the\u00a0<strong>ARROW\u00a0</strong>keys to fly around. You can also use the\u00a0<strong>SPACE</strong> key to shoot the asteroids passing by.<br/>To find other planets you must use your radar (green orbs around your ship shows both their direction and their distance to you).<br/>When trying to land on a planet, you must be careful not to go to fast and to have a good angle (watch out for warnings at the bottom of your screen)<br/>During your flight, you will consume your fuel and your spaceship's population will increase.<br/>\u00a0</li><li>The second phase is on the planets. You can move using the first phase's controls<br/>When you land on a planet, you must plan carefully your moves : each moves will consume both food and population.<br/>On top of that, a city will be built behind you, you can't enter a town as it is too dense : each time you move you reduce the available space on the planet.</li></ul>\r\nCredit\r\n<p>We were two while making this game :<br/><strong>Art and music:</strong> Wyvelk<br/><strong>Code:</strong> MrSylar59</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/257/257863663de0d633131920321ef45e27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Thomas De Maen"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
