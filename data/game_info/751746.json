That's why, in Elk, you will also meet the living storytellers who inspired us to make this game.</p>\n<p><strong>How we used true stories in the game?</strong></p>\n<p>True stories? how to use a true story in an ethical way? This is how we have dealt with it in Welcome to Elk:<br/>The stories in Welcome to Elk, are told by the people who we know and/or were there when the events took place. All are told from memory. The way they are used both on our webpage and in the game is true to the core story but everything like names, locations and other details are changed, renamed and often re-framed to protect the real people behind them, therefore, we call them tall tales. The stories are not one to one like you would experience in true crime for example. They are rewritten and combined to one linear narrative. Characters may play a role in one story where they where not a part of originally and only us who designed it will ever know \u2013 or come close to the real truth of the stories.<br/><br/>Welcome to Elk might look like a \u201cfun\u201d game but it\u2019s about telling stories \u2013 some are filled with humour others are dark, but they go hand in hand.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T09:31:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ea/6ea57a57080e30f6ff890b8691e78e9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 235, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Triple Topping"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
