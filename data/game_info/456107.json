The player controls a barbarian who can curl into a ball and launch into enemies. The game is turn based: the player aims and shoots, then the enemies have a chance to strike back. I managed and directed the project, working mostly with one artist and one programmer.<br/>I designed all 50 levels myself. I had a small story or scenario in mind for most of the levels: A skirmish in a village, fighting in tight castle corridors, pitched battle against a horde of enemies, etc. Without any text, I used environmental storytelling to give a sense of place: enemy types and placements, scenery, and layout.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Art and animation: Niv Touboul, Shachar Tzin, Gal Borensztajn<br/>Programming: Or Avrahamy, Amir Blum</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T04:23:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e8/8e85069da9bca9aa215d8205648e6b23.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gideon Rimmer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
