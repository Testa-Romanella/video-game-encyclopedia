Simply stack blocks on top of each other. When all the blocks are used, you win! Sounds simple but each challenge gets more difficult.<br/>\r\nDown the right side of the screen are the blocks that you are given, ordered from bottom to top.  You place them on the stage, in order, attempting to build a stable structure.   As each block is placed, it disappears from the supply-list at the right, revealing more blocks.<br/>\r\nEach block has personality!  Their facial expressions reflect how they are feeling about their safety: big smile when feeling secure, frown and fearful glances when feeling shaky. Use all the blocks and a timer starts ticking.  If your tower of blocks can last 10 seconds you win!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSuper Stacker Party \u00a92010 inXile entertainment.
