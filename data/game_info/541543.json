Overall, however, this was more of a way for me to explore <strong>Unity3D</strong>, its physics engine and having a hand at creating my own <em>raycasting detection system</em> for object.</p><p>Honestly, the hardest part of all of this was the character controller which took about two and a half days in total to actually get something that felt fun and dynamic enough for a sports game (one of the biggest similarities I've noticed\u00a0jumping from 2D to 3D).</p><p>I would love some feedback if you have any and any comments good or bad will only make my future content stronger.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T03:34:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ec/2ec6f2aba4300781ed5ecc429414c5ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SpaceBabyGames"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
