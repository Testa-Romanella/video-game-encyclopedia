(Pretty much what AntiChamber did)\u00a0 We got carried away with making a player displacement script and made this.<br/></p>\n<p>(Click game to enable movement controls if not already active. WebGL usually.)<br/>WASD or Arrow keys to move.<br/>Use mouse to look around.<br/>Press spacebar to jump.<br/>Hold Left Shift to run.<br/>Hold Control to crouch.<br/>Press E to grab the temporal cube.<br/>Press E to drop cube. Drop cube while running+jumping to throw. Drop while just running to slide it forward.<br/>Press ESC to free mouse from game (WebGL only)<br/>Pressing ESC in standalone downloadable version will quit the game.</p>\n<p>A new pro strat was created here too. \u00a0We call it \"cube boosting.\" Run directly at a wall or corner while holding a cube. \u00a0Throw said cube as described above when you are close to the wall, then start repeatedly jumping. \u00a0If the cube clips through the level, don't worry. \u00a0Cubes re-spawn at their original location. \u00a0If that doesn't happen, the cube is now hiding somewhere.</p>\n<p>(Pre-upload testing shows that mouse sensitivity may be too high in WebGL version! I might try to fix this later.)<br/><em>(Lighting is also bad in WebGL version, the standalone version has better rendering options.)</em></p>\n<p>Feel free to leave feedback in comments!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66b/66bb9c516bf7c8feb4f4400a8b8d6206.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Gorgi Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
