Started in 2022 during my\u00a0third year of study\u00a0as a game designer.</p>\n\n<p>This game is a vertical slice. This prototype\u00a0is rough around the edges, especially the sound effects. Futhermore, no scenario is implemented at the moment.<br/></p>\n<p>Let me know in the comments if you have any feedback or suggestions about the gameplay.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you find any bugs or crashes please leave a comment so I can improve the quality of the game.</p>\n<p>You can find a more detailed description of the assets at:\u00a0https://h1to.itch.io/final-project-v-slice-agg</p>\n<p><strong>&lt;Warning&gt;</strong> <br/>At the moment, the HTML version seems to be suffering from low FPS issue. But my computer is quite old and my internet speed is not that high. If you face an identical challenge, please\u00a0let me know. You can also\u00a0download the standalone version for a perfect gaming experience at the download section at the\u00a0end of this page.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In a cyberpunk universe, a system of planets still follows rules from the ancient Greece. From 10 up to\u00a0the age of 20, every\u00a0young person must train in order to undergo a final test. You must succeed in\u00a0accomplishing one's agoge and so become a fully recognised citizen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thus, you are left alone on a hostile planet: Tartaris. The final test of your agoge\u00a0is starting. You must go back to Deimos by any means.</p>\n<p>As so, fight, improve your power, loot and create your build,\u00a0choose your own path!</p>\n<p>Agoge is a mix between 3 styles:<br/></p>\n<ol><li><strong>platformer</strong> : use your displacement abilities to avoid traps\u00a0 and get through\u00a0platform areas.<br/> You can dash, slide and climb walls, use multi-jumps and more soon</li><li><strong>hack'n'slash</strong> : you have to defeat numerous enemies, mini-bosses and bosses. Use your defensive and offensive skills to smash the hardships. At the moment, for the demo, a few\u00a0melee skills are available,</li><li><strong>roguelite</strong> : if you die during a level, you loose everything (loot and xp). Only what you\u00a0obtained during the level. To finish a level, you just must kill the boss and then teleport\u00a0\u00a0to your main base</li></ol>\n<p>You can access to a few menus:</p>\n<ol><li>main menu and in game menu: to modify the bindings\u00a0, a few in-game option, video and audio preferences\u00a0and so on.</li><li>player statistics: for each level up,\u00a0attributes points are available. The player can allow those points at his convenience.</li><li>skill tree, it can be modified. But take care, if so you would modify available skills, their damages and so on.</li><li>\u00a0inventory. Loots obtained from opening the chests in\u00a0the level are only available while the boss is killed\u00a0\u00a0and the player\u00a0goes back to the main base and interact with the stash tool\u00a0at the left of the teleport. This feature uses local files so it is not available with this demo on itch.io.</li></ol>\n<p>To ease your path on Tartaris, you can equip your avatar with 4 different qualities of armor available in the inventory (press C) for the demo:\r\n</p>\n<ol><li>Common\r\n</li><li>Rare\r\n</li><li>Epic\r\n</li><li>Legendary\r\n</li></ol>\n<p>Just drag and drop the parts to the right spot. Unique equipments are not yet\u00a0implemented.</p>\n<p>The game is developped for keyboard and mouse. At this point,\u00a0you can use a playstation gamepad but the menus.</p>\n<p>Tip : press \"ALT\" + \"MAJ\" to change between AZERTY and QWERTY keyboard setup.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T19:36:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dba/dba6b17610578327b97dbb4c553a3eef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["H1to"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
