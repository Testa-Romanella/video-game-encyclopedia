The catch? The rules are randomly generated, and you won't know what you're gonna get until it's too late!</p>\n<p>Throw guns, shoot giant parrots, and dodge ghosts on your way to become the King of All Rhinos! Buy powerups from your friendly neighborhood shopkeeper lizard between stages or scavenge what you can from each level.</p>\n\n<p>Gameplay tips:</p>\n<ul><li>Thrown guns instantly kill most enemies. You don't need to wait until you're out of ammo to throw a gun.</li><li>The goal always in on the right-hand side of the level.</li><li>Buying a health upgrade will heal you to max health afterwards.</li><li>While \"Coins hurt you\" is in effect, you will not actually take damage when invincible after an attack. Use this to your advantage to nab some cash!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T03:45:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ad/8ad942ec8cbb9bb22bb65fe9dc4c4302.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 233, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yal"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
