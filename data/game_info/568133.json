{"id": 568133, "slug": "immortus-temporus", "name": "Immortus Temporus", "name_original": "Immortus Temporus", "description": "\"Immortus Temporus\" is designed for speedrunners. It is created for those of us, who love to hone their skills by replaying their favorite games in order to find new ways to finish them faster than everybody else. However, it's not only about quick reaction and hand-eye coordination! If you want to outperform yourself, prepare to think outside of the box and break the game rules!<br/><br/><br/><br/> The puzzle-ish nature of challenges in \"IT\" allows for multiple strategies to beat them. If you crash into a hazard, it will become deactivated and you will be teleported back to the spawn point, which can help you get where you want faster. The actions you perform (such as collecting pick-ups or destroying hazards) persist through death, but should you run out of time - the level will reset.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If you're a seasoned speedrunner, here are a few features you're bound to fall in love with:<br/> The respawns are instant. Not just fast, instant.<br/> You can skip any 30 levels and still finish the game. Have fun in \"any %\" category!<br/> The game is deliberately filled with numerous skips and tricks which can help you win a few precious seconds.<br/> Laugh into the face of RNGesus, for he has no authority in this domain! The levels in \"\"Immortus Temporus\"\" always function in the same way. What matters is only your skill, wit and muscle memory!<br/><br/>Are you ready to prove you have what it takes? See you in the game, champion!\"", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T04:27:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70f/70f7f20a6f3a58df61f72e7233b785c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 8}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 41, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Khud0"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Khud0"], "esrb_rating": null}
