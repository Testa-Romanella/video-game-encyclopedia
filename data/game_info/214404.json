There are NO tools for 3D in GameMaker so this was a real challenge.\u00a0 Absolutely everything had to be done in code.\u00a0 </p>\n<p>The first hurdle was me and Sean just trying to get the models to import at all.\u00a0 In the end we found a blender plugin on an all-but-abandoned website, and Sean was able to model in his preferred modeling software, and use his preferred software for texturing as well. <br/></p>\n\n<p>We ended up with:</p>\n<p>20+ upgrades</p>\n<p>3 environments</p>\n<p>Procedurally Generated levels</p>\n<p>5 obstacle types</p>\n<p>Forestry and grass</p>\n<p>Water shader</p>\n<p>Smooth camera movements</p>\n<p>Particle systems</p>\n<p>Simple translation/rotation animations</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86a/86a3a14f96e2f98048cf4d0f87ba7806.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Carocrazy132"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
