Find a quality bumper with an aggressive forward lip.<br/><br/>*** This car is going to be about performance and speed. It is therefore important to have a technical gauge cluster for the various pressures. Find and install the gauges.<br/><br/>*** Racing around tight corners can really shuffle a driver around in a car. Buckets seats are a great way to help keep a driver centered, and safe. Find and install 2 buckets seats.<br/><br/>*** This car is going to need some sweet aluminum rims; a key investment for a racer especially when upgrading from the stock \"mag wheels\". Build a complete set.<br/><br/>*** The engine will need about 4 liters of quality oil to operate. Find the oil and put it in the engine block.<br/><br/>*** Take the stock wheels off the car. This will allow you to work on the brakes and suspension.<br/><br/>*** The stock hood weighs too much for racing and it does not provide an air intake for a racing engine. Find and install a dual-scoop fiberglass hood.<br/><br/>*** This car will need some ground effects to really amaze at night and during races. Find all of the 6 LED ground effects first and then install them.<br/><br/>*** The trunk is a great place to create a multimedia center for tailgate parties. Find and install a game console.<br/><br/>*** To support large speakers and subwoofers, two parallel amps will be needed for extra amperage. Find 2 amps and install them in the trunk.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-31T01:15:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/605/605757a0e4124e11bcde217422d6bcbe.jpg", "website": "http://firerabbit.com/portal/landingpage/customcar/game/en/itunes/full/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 262, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android"], "developers": ["FireRabbit"], "genres": ["Sports", "Racing", "Casual"], "publishers": ["FireRabbit", "alex gosselin"], "esrb_rating": null}
