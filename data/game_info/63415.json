The players will become members of an elite special purpose squad accompanying a large space mission. The goal of the expedition is to deploy the base, to get the extraction of the most precious cyrium up and running, and also to get ready for launching the Portal that will allow the Earthians to relocate to a new place of residence. But the new world holds its own threats and challenges.<br/><br/>The missions are intended both for cooperative walkthrough and for fighting single-handed. Combining the strong points of the weapons and the special abilities of the squad members will make each combat unique. The gameplay of FARHOME is a combination of different styles: here you will find both the combats with a lot of shooting and the unhurried exploration of other planets\u2019 worlds. <br/><br/>The game supports multiple modes of getting about (long-distance teleportation, short-range jumps, conventional movement by gliding along the surface). We\u2019ve tried to make the locomotion system as comfortable as possible, without the motion sickness effect in the virtual reality.<br/><br/>FEATURES<br/><ul><li>Different classes of fighters in the squad, each of them is equipped with their own types of weapons and unique abilities<br/></li><li>Alternative modes of shooting for all weapons <br/></li><li>Diversity of the enemies\u2019 types with unique behaviors and reactions to different types of weapons <br/></li><li>Possibility of equipping the squad with regard for the specific nature of the mission and of the prospective enemies<br/></li><li>Open levels on different planet types: jungles, dungeons, deserts, missions on a spacecraft and in the deep space<br/></li><li>The Unreal Engine provides for an amazing level of graphics</li></ul><br/>Enjoy the game!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:56:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05e/05e1b84c9ccf9d96ca733f918cc973a1.jpg", "website": "http://farhomevr.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 21, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 315, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DEVCUBE STUDIO"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["DEVCUBE STUDIO"], "esrb_rating": null}
