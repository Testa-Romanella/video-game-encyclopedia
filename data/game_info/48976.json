{"id": 48976, "slug": "magilore", "name": "Magilore", "name_original": "Magilore", "description": "Magilore is an RPG that satirizes on a majority of RPG tropes found throughout the history of these types of games. While the dialogue is comedic, there is a serious side.StoryKing Walter has killed Aaron and Ann\u2019s parents under the charge of treason. As well, Alex has been kidnapped. Aaron and Ann are forcefully ejected from the kingdom by their brother, who is somehow able to use Air magic. It is now up to Aaron and Ann to re-enter the Kingdom of Magic by recruiting all of the 9 other elemental leaders and retrieving their special weapons. Meanwhile, they will learn more about their heritage and become closer with their team.CombatThe combat in this game is similar to most other Role Playing Games except for one key component: Health and Magic points have been combined into one stat: Energy. In order to use powerful attacks, you must sacrifice some of your energy. This will leave you more vulnerable, but your opponent will die quicker. Will you take the risk in order to more efficiently win battles or will you play a more defensive role and stick to basic attacks? I hope you\u2019ve stocked up on items.CharactersAaron and Ann serve as your main protagonists throughout the story. Aaron and Ann are siblings, with Aaron being 18 years old and Ann being 15. Aaron is a bit more strategic while Ann is a bit more active. But this dynamic shifts occasionally.Jocelyn, the leader of the light kingdom, is the opposite of the clich\u00e9. Rather than being a pure being who can do no wrong, she is a gambler who is more sarcastic than kind. While she is still good, she is no saint. Barack, the flirty leader of the Lightning Kingdom, is more brawn than brains. He knows some things about his heritage and his kingdom, but his flirting falls on deaf ears or is insulted. Jackson is the leader of the Ice Kingdom and is the kindest character in this game. He does everything he can to help. Not to gain something out of it, but out of the kindness of his heart. Gale is the leader of the Air Kingdom. He is a firm believer that peace can be achieved by everybody leaving each other alone. He suffers from Polio and rides on a cloud to get around. Tal is the captain of the water kingdom. She is tough and tends to act as a lone shark, but knows when to team up. Her father was a pirate and her mother was a mermaid. Ember is similar to Tal in nature and behavior, as they have become very close friends throughout the years. However, Ember is a bit more passionate and willing to work with others. Dimitri is the leader of the Earth Kingdom. He is a very gentle person who believes in giving back to the earth that has given so much to humanity. However, pissing him off will be the last thing you do. Orville is the dictator of the Metal Kingdom. He tries so hard to be an evil tyrant, but always falls flat due to his convoluted schemes. Maddie is the leader of Hell. After taking Hades down, she ruled over the land of the dead with kindness and empathy. Her uncle is the Grim Reaper. But that\u2019s only 11 playable characters. Who\u2019s the twelfth? I guess you\u2019ll have to find out.LocationsIn total, there are 12 kingdoms to explore. Each elemental leader has their own kingdom. The Light Kingdom is themed after a Casino. The Lightning Kingdom is a large metropolitan factory. The Ice Kingdom is rather small, as most of the surrounding land is far too cold for even Jackson. However, they have settled down in a village near 2 mountains. The Air Kingdom is in the clouds, but Gale can only keep so many clouds from breaking down into rain, so he is unable to expand his kingdom. The Water Kingdom is an Archipelago. However, Blackbeard can only take you to four of the islands, since the seas can get a bit rough. The Fire Kingdom is a desert and a volcano. The Earth Kingdom is a mountain, with many other mountains nearby. However, Dimitri refuses to expand due to his belief that we can only take so much from the Earth. The Metal Kingdom is in a cave where the people are overworked and miserable, yet can\u2019t overthrow Orville. Lastly, there is Hell. But since Aaron and Crew are still alive, they can only visit a few areas of the underworld. As well, there is the Kingdom of Magic, Kingdom of Shadows, and one hidden kingdom. I wonder where it is? All I know is that it involves trees on the world map. I wonder if you can find it.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e1/4e1650b765f9779c3aa73af986802ebf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 100}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 1, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cole Kitroser"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Cole Fusion Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
