It was developed in a collaboration between Torus Games and Paradox Development, and published by Activision. It was released for Game Boy Color and PlayStation in March 2000. Unlike the previous The Lion King video game, it adhered more closely to the events in the film and the storyline carried on into The Lion King II: Simba's Pride, with Simba having to battle his evil uncle Scar, rescue his daughter Kiara (the protagonist from The Lion King II: Simba's Pride), and finally battle Zira.</p>\n<p>This game was the only console-based platform game to involve The Lion King II: Simba's Pride. All other games based on the title were educational or puzzle games and were released on the PC.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/675/67523ef9034b7f6a408c45bf3288714c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 243, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PlayStation", "Game Boy Color"], "developers": ["Activision", "Paradox Development Studio", "Torus Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Activision Blizzard", "Disney Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
