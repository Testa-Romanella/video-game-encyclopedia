The game was written for the Atari 8-bit family by Thomas J. Mitchell. Oil's Well is similar to the 1982 arcade game Anteater, re-themed to be about drilling for oil instead of a hungry insectivore. Ports were released in 1983 for the Apple II and Commodore 64, in 1984 for ColecoVision and as a PC booter, then in 1985 for MSX and the Sharp X1. A version with improved visuals and without Mitchell's involvement was released for MS-DOS in 1990.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1983-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:00:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02c/02c377f61340eb9ae7e65dbbff13382d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "Apple II", "Atari 8-bit"], "developers": ["Sierra Entertainment", "Sierra On-Line"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Sierra On-Line"], "esrb_rating": null}
