It's a simple game where you are a memory operations worker and have to complete tasks coming from different places of the PC. Write, read and release your data!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>But watch out! You can run out of memory very fast!</p>\r\nGoal\r\n<p>The goal of the game is pretty simple: complete as many tasks as you can! But remember: <strong>don't get out of memory</strong>!</p>\n<p>You can also compete on scores with others in an in-game <strong>leaderboard</strong>!</p>\r\nRules\r\n<p>1. You are given to complete <strong>X</strong> amount of tasks<br/>2. You have limited time for that<br/>3. You can't accept more tasks if there's no more memory</p>\r\nControls\r\nKeyDescriptionWASDMovement<br/>1Write value of 10Write value of 0ERead valueRReset value\r\nCredits\r\n<p><strong>Background music:</strong></p>\n<p>Source: Looperman</p>\n<p>Author: https://www.looperman.com/loops?mid=Fanto8BC</p>\n<p>Link: https://www.looperman.com/loops/detail/132374/8-bit-cls-120bpm-8bit-chiptune-syn...</p>\n<p><strong>In-game sounds:</strong></p>\n<p>Source: Freesound</p>\n<p>Author: https://freesound.org/people/LittleRobotSoundFactory/</p>\n<p>Link: https://freesound.org/people/LittleRobotSoundFactory/packs/16681/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d37/d376105f6a9063361c1e9a726bfa01a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Machinode"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
