To them, everybody wins - humanity sees that they have something to cling to, and Idols are remembered eternally as they livestream their triumphs a</em><em>nd tribulations.</em></p>\n<p>The Idol is a Spark designed for use with Spencer Campbell's NOVA. A Spark that thrives on the adoration of fans, it relies on players to display excellence and play for the spotlight. A powerful ally, though sure to get on more than a few nerves.</p>\n<p>The Idol was an entry in the Nova Jam.
