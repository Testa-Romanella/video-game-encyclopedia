The name \"boid\" corresponds to a shortened version of \"bird-oid object\", which refers to a bird-like object.\r\n\r\nAs with most artificial life simulations, Boids is an example of emergent  behavior; that is, the complexity of Boids arises from the interaction  of individual agents (the boids, in this case) adhering to a set of  simple rules.  The rules applied in the simplest Boids world are as  follows:  \r\n<ul><li><strong>separation</strong>: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates</li><li><strong>alignment</strong>: steer towards the average heading of local flockmate</li><li><strong>cohesion</strong>: steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates\r\n<br/></li></ul>\r\nMore complex rules can be added, such as obstacle avoidance and goal seeking. \r\n\r\n<p>In this small project you can do exactly that:<br/>Spawn Boids with the Spacebar<br/>Dynamicly change influence of separation, alignment and cohesion.<br/>Change the viewing distance and angle of every Boid<br/>Add and remove obstacles with right click<br/>Make them all reach the mouse with Enter<br/></p><p>(For copyright issues the downloadable file may be sent only on request)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T08:52:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c9/6c9fb81622950a27466a59dbac7cf993.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["il_Grigio"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
