It's a turn-based block-pushing puzzle game in a grid\u00a0 and it is also a homage to some game you may have heard before.<br/></p>\n<p>This is a prototype which may or may not be the final release and there are currently 12 level. Kinda hope to build new levels although creativity has been scarce.<br/> To skip a level, refresh the page and use the level selector.<br/></p>\n<p>Also keep in mind that this time the puzzlescript rules come in large numbers and thus it takes a while to compile. That's the reason why there's a pause with the \"Insert cartridge\" prompt. After that it may actually have low tick rate in cell phones.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T03:54:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/960/9608328f7e6362ec25a0f0b15ba26348.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["vexorian"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
