Based on your performance, you will be awarded The Medal of Honor (complete wave with &gt; 90% health), a Service Medal (complete wave with &gt; 50% health), or a Purple Heart. <br/><br/>StickBo's wave-based auto-save and simple interface is not only perfect for a quick game when you have a spare moment, but also allows for hours of seamless game play. As an added bonus, the wave selection option allows you to start the game from any wave you have previously completed.<br/><br/>====The Weapons====<br/><br/>M16:<br/>The M16 is your default weapon.
