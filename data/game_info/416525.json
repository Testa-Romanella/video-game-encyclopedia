I'm going to replace the enemy and weapon\u00a0models with something more interesting as well.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T03:59:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae8/ae8da87e1d6cca2be779711203c90c2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["stoatsandgoats"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
