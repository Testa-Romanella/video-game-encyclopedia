We like to call it \u201ccinematic platformer\u201d now, whatever that means.</p>\n<p>Our vision is to provide a gameplay experience where hacking feels realistic if you\u2019re into cybersecurity, and wrap it inside a cocoon of strong emotions delivered by a powerful narrative.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": true, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b6/9b67200915796cb10443270e167477b1.jpg", "website": "http://www.colorfuldarknessgame.com/press/index.php", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Colorful Darkness"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
