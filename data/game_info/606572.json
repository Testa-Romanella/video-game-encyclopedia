Unfortunately the game is very buggy and rushed but I plan on polishing it up after the game jam. I still have to fix a bug on restarting the game when the player dies along with some other ones like the spears not following the enemy spear men after stabbing the player.<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T08:19:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ded/dedca8b27cca618832e207cbc7cb0ffa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SlurpADerp"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
