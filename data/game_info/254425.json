We have no idea when and where did it come from. It can't be destroyed nor modified. Any attempts to blow the place up were unsuccessful, it looks as if nothing had happened. Things that cannot be explained by logic occur there. Creatures out of this world wander the corridors, and as far as we know, their intentions are not good at all. Be unlucky enough to encounter any of them, and you will most likely end up as another missing person.</p>\n<p>\r\nNot many people went down there - only those who were blinded by the supposed wealth that place provides. There are stories it's filled with worthy stuff, such as gold bars, or simply money in cash.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\r\nThey went down there to collect the loot, only to never come out alive.\r\nAnd yet, here you are. Thinking it's easy cash, and that there's nothing to fear. Simply ready to open the door and walk in there.\u00a0<em>Well, go ahead.</em></p>\n<p>____________________________________</p>\n<p><em>There is a chance this game could be made into something way bigger, but I need to see how people react to this version first. :)<br/>I could add randomly generated dungeons, more monsters, better mechanics, etc.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98d/98d9ad21bae3d75e4c0582f7b182fbb8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 260, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MrCiastku"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
