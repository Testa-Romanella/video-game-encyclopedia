It had the largest gestation period of any of these programs. Originally inspired by an exercise that came in the BASIC manual that had you navigate an asteroid belt on the low resolution screen. Taking inspiration from that and Surround and Tron Light Cycles, I worked on making a one player version of that. Once we got a Color Computer 3, I was able to change the palette of the PMODE 3 screen to make it look like outer space.<br/></p>\n<p>You start in the upper left of the screen. You have use the arrow keys to avoid the asteroids and planetoids and collect the red trash bins. You also have to avoid the blue toxic waste trail your leaky ship leaves behind. Why outer space is 2 dimensional is a question that has never occurred to you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T04:46:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3a/a3a574d981f15df9d7e279796a66c07c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Can Ken Make It"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
