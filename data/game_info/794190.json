Unfortunately, I ended up having to deliver another big project during the jam's start, and with timezones placing the final day on monday, left me with only 12 hours to develop. at this point, the alpha-ness of the engine meant i would have to add in scenes, transitions, tilemaps, sounds over WebAudio for spacial placement and a physics system that allowed for gravity to change. i didn't want to turn in nothing though, so i pulled in Unity and built this prototype instead.</p>\n<p>the original idea for this game was that you would have to navigate an open world using nothing but your ears, moving towards and collecting parts of a song while looking at a mostly black screen. once the limitation, \"gravity is under your control\" came out, it became clear that there would have to be some form of choices made. a top-down where the parts you collected would somehow control the weight, or gravity of the ending you got. the title \"gravity of your situation\" floated into my mind. in the end, i decided to make it a platformer, with the same navigation by ear and collection system as the original idea, and add some story elements (inspired by cats are liquid). the people i had asked to help write the story were also busy this weekend.</p><p>i may return to this game, in my own engine, and fill out 10-20 levels with story, and more appropriate music. i may not. either way, enjoy this funky little prototype i put together in the little time i had.</p>\r\nother info\r\n<p>Barely tested and maybe works on Chrome for Windows. Not tested anywhere else. Not mobile compatible</p>\n<p>Built using Unity, with Jetbrains Rider for C# code.<br/>Music made in Ableton Live 10 Standard.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T09:14:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5a/a5a6b7a4f1042b111fc68d17a09e54ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["hi-ashleyj"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
