Fight strange enemies, listen to smooth jazz, and amble about a dreamlike world at your own pace.  This is the second demo of the RPG, showcasing new maps, the first slice of gameplay, and a new rendering engine. Please note, this demo was originally circulated 1-2 months ago, and has some bugs that have already been fixed in the release I am working on (improvements on the lighting engine, rendering, and collision) as well as some events that are placeholders, please keep this in mind as you play! Hopefully, all that will  be long gone when the final release drops. However, feel free to leave comments and feedback below!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T06:12:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45f/45fb2134e7ec0dc6936859098359299b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Liziveth"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
