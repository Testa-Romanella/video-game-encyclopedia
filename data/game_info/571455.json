In this game prototype you'll find the image of a desert dune cut into triangles and need to rearrange the vertices to restore the image. After each run, you may increase the number of random vertices, hence the difficulty, by one.</p>\n<p>NOTE: You can drag the handles out of screen and there is no way to recover except reload (i.e. start from the beginning),\u00a0so be warned until I fix it\u00a0;)\u00a0 Bug is fixed, if you run in fullscreen.</p>\n<p>This puzzle game is my take on new forms of puzzle entertainment. It is a by-product of learning how to write shaders, but I figured it is kind of fun to randomise vertices and then puzzle them back together :D Note: The PC version has lines connecting the vertices, which makes it slightly easier, however, the WebGL version shader does not support it, at the moment.<br/></p>\n<p>Since this is a prototype, please leave a comment below with your impression of it. Or contact me on twitter (right from the app). Would you want to see more like this? What did you like?\u00a0What did you dislike? What would you like to configure yourself?
