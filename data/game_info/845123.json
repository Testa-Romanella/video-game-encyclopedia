Everything players do contributes to the soundscape in this innovative retro music shooting game! The game can sound as full or as empty as players want.</p>\n<p>Players control a cursor and assume a first-person perspective on an ever-expanding digital track in cyberspace.</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\r\nSTORY\r\n<p>Despite our best intentions, the world did not survive us.<br/></p>\n<p>The coasts flooded. Mass migration displaced hundreds of millions. Food supply chains broke. People fought wars over fuel and water. Social unrest led to the collapse of most organized governments.\r\n</p>\n<p>In the wake of this ruin, the Mega Corps and their Metaverse emerged as a beacon. Life became a luxury reserved for the wealthy. And the blueprints of life, the DNA data for all flora and fauna, became a commodity owned by the most powerful Mega Corp, Nu-Li.\r\n</p>\n<p>As each species went extinct, Nu-Li coded and copyrighted its DNA. Its fiercely guarded data banks became a new, proprietary Digital Ark.\r\n</p>\n<p>While most used the Metaverse to escape the desolation of everyday life, the eco-hacker group SOL (Save Organic Life)\u00a0used it to fight back.\r\n</p>\n<p>As time runs out for the world, SOL launches a desperate mission to hack Nu-Li and steal back all the copy-protected DNA data. With it, they can bring back what\u2019s been lost.\r\n</p>\n<p>In the hacker world, you are known only as Oratorio.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>You are the world\u2019s only chance for revival. \r\n</p>\n<p>Note: This game acts as a side story to my cyberpunk narrative universe <strong>The Last One Horn</strong>.
