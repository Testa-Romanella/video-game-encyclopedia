It is a beautiful interactive game that is designed to clear your mind from any stress and block out the nonstop thinking we all experience. Your brain experiences relief by entering a meditative state and just focus on the present with a therapeutic activity such as coloring and listening to calm music.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNegative thoughts are expelled as you take in positivity. We aim to lower any stress and anxiety while keep you really entertained, helping you achieve mindfulness. The music itself will help you unplug from your daily routine and promote creativity.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThat said, this game is dedicated to my wife, whom I love. Enjoy.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:50:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efd/efdeadba8616c3be35edbe6f0e7d5eac.jpg", "website": "https://weightlessgame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mismatch Studio"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mismatch Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
