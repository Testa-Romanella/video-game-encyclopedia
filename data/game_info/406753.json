Devlum is slightly bugged, because everything you click will either increase or decrease your score. The latter option isn't necessarily a bad thing. ;)<br/></p>\n<p>Music/SFX for Devlum were created by lotuscvlt: https://soundcloud.com/andreywww/tracks<br/></p>\n<p>A video about the creation of this game is now available on my channel: </p>\n<br/>\n<p>The game was made in ~1 day and it is extremely raw. Many features had to be simply cut out of it, but the main point should be clearly visible and some core mechanics are already in place.</p><p>(Please note that at the moment it doesn't make sense to go far in the game, nothing will change. If you figured out how everything works - great! You are done. ;))<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T04:39:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/835/8355db08590cea949225e55b7da808d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Khud0"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
