It uses the Arbalet (customizable Arduino-based LED table) as a luminous frame on the wall, on which the player draws colours. The traditional painter's palette is replaced with RVB/CMY colour sources that the player needs to hit to get paint on his brush.</p><p>In the frame of the Digital Art Jam, we imagined it as an experience which takes its full meaning set up in an art gallery or a museum, where passing visitors can either play or watch. Placed among regular museum works, this interactive LED panel could be a delightful moment of creation during an enlightening visit. That said, the game has its place everywhere, you can have a go at digital painting on your homemade Arbalet table, with or without friends!</p><p>Simply use the keyboard arrows to move around the painting, hitting sources and getting speed and momentum as you go.</p><p>Create dynamic, rhythm, motives of various colours, in total control or with the help of the creative Python code...</p><p>When you are finished creating, hit the escape key to get your work of pixel-art as a .bmp.</p><p>A game made in 48h by :</p><p>Pauline Devolle - Game Design</p><p>Jonas Dutouquet - Game Design, Sound Design</p><p>Arthur Villeneuve - Programming</p><p>C\u00e9cile Balsier - Programming</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9e/c9eeb502e5db441f67e34330f52d5f8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["joarpace"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
