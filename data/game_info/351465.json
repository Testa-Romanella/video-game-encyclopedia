What once was a mere hobby is now  our full time commitment.<br/>Cubicle Interactive began as a playtime project in Unreal engine. Our goal was to develop an adrenaline filled experience inspired by our childhood heroes, but as development went on we realized that Hero Swing could truly become an amazing game. That is when we transitioned to work full time on this project and after another year of development it was time to involve the community in order to finish Hero Swing VR. <br/>That is how Cubicle and Hero Swing VR came to life, our attempt to share the ultimate swinging experience.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acd/acd8057b31d34f3a985d9d90088c73d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 217, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cubicle Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Cubicle Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
