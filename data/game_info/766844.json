Once the game starts, use the keyboard keys WASD or arrow keys to move the boss on a hidden 3x3 grid. Aim your attacks with the mouse. Press Z to attack with a claw swipe. Press C to shoot a limited supply of fireballs.</p>\n<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The \"heroes\" will only damage you when they're standing still - as long as they're moving, they can't hurt you. Walking into a pile of stationary heroes, though, will definitely lead to a big pile of damage.</li><li>Fireballs always take the same amount of time (about 1 second) to reach their destination and detonate. Putting the mouse near yourself can turn a fireball into a lingering shield against approaching heroes.</li><li>Because of the awkward controls, it's probably easiest to focus on either moving or attacking. It's dangerous to run around all willy-nilly anyway, so make sure you've got a clear path before running around!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong>\u00a0\"Like a Boss\" was created with the Scratch engine in 72 hours with original code, art, and music.
