Game concept and\u00a0Character art\u00a0inspired by Fallout Shelter.</p>\r\n\"I created this tiny dress-up game thinking that: in my whole gaming experience, the Witcher 3 was the first time in my life I saw any semblance of East-European culture in mainstream gaming media.\u00a0 My country's traditional costume, the \"IE\" is a worldwide fashion symbol, so I think a lot of people will enjoy this experience,\u00a0even if for a brief while.\"\r\n<p>The game features:</p>\n<ul><li>5 possible outfits</li><li>4 (to ten)\u00a0minutes of playtime</li><li>3 backgrounds</li><li>2 characters</li><li>1 big Romanian experience</li></ul>\n<p>Design and art assets by Elena. Programming by Zack.<br/></p><p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS:</strong> Download \"Romanian Dress Up.rar\", then extract it to your choice of folder. Click \"Romanian Dress Up.exe\", which will launch the game. To exit game press Alt + Tab.
