The player does indeed only need to follow one rule in this game, but it's tougher than it first seems!</p>\n<p>This one was pretty challenging to make, I was almost too ambitious with what I wanted to incorporate, but I'm so glad that I muscled through it!</p>\n<p>In this game, you exercise your knowledge of multiplication tables by avoiding the targets that can be evenly divided by the floating red Forbidden Multiplier. It's a bit of an edutainment/shooter mashup.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Unity for hosting another Game\u00a0Jam, I'm really enjoying participating in these!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T06:39:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f8/9f8ca5036bf67306c742a883895bf6cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["technitaur"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
