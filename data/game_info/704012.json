Press the <strong>LEFT MOUSE BUTTON</strong>\u00a0to control the ECG monitor and your pulse. Ensure your pulse does not get too high or too low. If you hit green obstacles, your pulse goes down. If you hit red obstacles, your pulse goes up. The speed item lets you move straight forward.</p>\n<p>https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/kings-and-pigs</p><p>https://philippemoesch.gumroad.com/l/TEEfS</p><p>https://joshuuu.itch.io/short-loopable-background-music</p><p>https://void1gaming.itch.io/free-synthwave-music-pack</p><p>https://finalbossblues.itch.io/monsters-belly</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This game was developed live on Twitch:\u00a0https://www.twitch.tv/vojay</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T11:55:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e3/3e38729d98ea0054214595247d63e889.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["vojay"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
