It does not have creatures that devour other creatures right before your eyes. Hell, it doesn't even have any variety in attacks for the creatures that are in the game. For a Pokemon clone like that, might I suggest PalWorld*?</p>\n<p>If you're okay with those shortcomings, then enjoy 50-Mon.

I simply find the game fascinating.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T16:21:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/145/1459111ca6831f8b85cc4671b70732fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["djaloe"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
