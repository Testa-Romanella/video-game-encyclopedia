In the mean time I will prepare a fixed version.</strong></p>\n<p>Hello and welcome to Sky Fallers 1982!</p>\n<p>This is a rare and obscure game for the long forgotten\u00a0 Octagon 5000, a console released in Hong Kong in 1982. Not much is known about the console, only that 6 games were made for it and I'm one of only 4 known owners(one of them being no longer with us), so through the power of technology I bring to you one of its 6 games.</p>\n<p>In it your mission is to defend yourself from spooky ghouls from Mars. All you have is your gun, grenades and the inability to shoot anywhere but up.</p>\n\n<p>Shoot the enemies as they fall from the sky but if you're not quick enough you'll have to deal with them on the ground. Drop bombs and jump on grounded enemies to defeat them.</p>\n<p>Then once you have gained enough money from your killings, look out for the shop where you can buy new weapons, upgrades and bombs.*</p>\n<p><strong>*Please note,\u00a0<em>you cannot cycle guns in the shop, only on the battlefield).</em></strong><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Left and Right to move.</p>\n<p>X = Shoots from your gun.</p>\n<p>Down + X = Drop bombs.</p>\n<p>C = Jumps.</p>\n<p>Up = Cycle through guns you have purchased.</p>\n<p>Down + C = Cycle through bombs you have purchased.</p>\n<p>Enter = Pause the game.</p>\n<p>Remember you can view all the controls on the pause screen.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Enemies:</strong><br/></p>\n<p> - Little Ghoul</p>\n<p>He's little. Falls slow, has little HP but these dudes are fast, so watch out.</p>\n\n<p> - Big Ghoul<br/></p>\n<p>They're bigger, meaner and fall faster than those Little Ghouls, so be careful.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 - Ghoul Ship<br/></p>\n<p>Those Mars Ghouls had to get here somehow. It flies away fast and drops Ghouls so get ready.</p>\n\n<p>Rumour has it of a 4th super secret enemy that may or may not exist. So pay attention.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Guns</strong><br/></p>\n<p> - Your default and trusty Gun. It's basic but reliable.</p>\r\n\u00a0 - Boomerang. It will return to the position it was fired from.
