Tho I did it on my own and didn't upload it to the Official site.</p>\n<p>Interesting experience.\u00a0 Barely playable game.\u00a0 No menus, sounds, win state, lose state,\u00a0 danger or pacing. Just straight up granny tossing.</p>\n<p>The Good: Got to test my skills and try to adapt to limited time by not getting stuck on optimizations or by spending too much time tuning.\u00a0 Also allowed me to be spontaneous and make gameplay I normally wouldn't have tried.</p>\n<p>The Bad: Got a late start and had problems with my Voxel program so I had to use Inkscape instead. Slowed me down a little. Trying not to use pre made assets also took extra time. When I prototype I have some basic shapes to use. Bounds and layers are messed up.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fe/7fecbb4011ede2ef65db24933d763a55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rupert"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
