Jou", "description": "<p>From Wikipedia:</p>\n<p>&quot;Tottoko Hamtaro Nazonazo Q: Kumo no Ue no ?-J\u014d is a quiz video game released for the Nintendo DS in Japan in 2005. Eschewing an explorable world, this game consists of a large collection of quiz questions, most of which are wordplay-based riddles. A fraction of questions is dedicated to subjects such as mathematics and science, and to trivia about the Ham-Hams. Progress in the game is made by answering multiple levels of randomly selected questions in a multiple-choice format \u2013 though all but one kana of each answer is blacked out. To successfully answer these, the player is tasked with first playing a training mode which offers hints and the ability to reveal blacked-out kana, and thus learn the answer to each question in advance. During play, sunflower seeds are earned, which can be used as currency for furnishing a virtual home.&quot;</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2005-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T16:36:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70c/70cc2573b2df2f099f17cb7032ed4068.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 7, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": ["Alpha Dream"], "genres": ["Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
