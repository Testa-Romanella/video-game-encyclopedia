However, they don't just remove it, they <strong>harvest</strong> it. Is it safe for your mind to be exposed to these signals?</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Afterplay Notes-</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately I did not have enough time during the jam to make this (babies.. life.. woe) so it is now being released late under extra because I really liked my theme idea and wanted it to be a thing. I also wanted to demo a new mechanic (perspective) which I think is weird and fits my dream-esque vibe I was going for. The game is very short and lacks depth. I had a lot more planned, including polish, but I just need to get it out since I'm already days late. I may revisit this.</p>\n<p>I hope you can appreciate what I was going for regardless.</p><p>All assets made by me.
