Original version: Evan Parton - Mr. Micro Ltd / CBM.\u00a0Commodore 16/Plus4,\u00a01984. Created with GB-Studio 2.0.0 beta5!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>You are the captain of a space cargo ship carrying thousands of Blibbles from their over-populated planet to a new planetary system which has more room. Unfortunately someone has left the door to the holding cells open and the Blibbles are wandering around your space ship causing mayhem. You must round them up again before any of them enters the cargo transporter where they will be fizzled into oblivion. To make matters worse, your service droids have gone berserk, and a Wafoid has entered the ship through an open port-hole and is hampering the operation.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:</strong></p>\n<p>The title screen appears, press START to start the game.<br/>The scene is the engine room of your space ship. Blibbles enter the room through the door at the bottom right of the screen. Use your scanner, which starts in the large scanner box near the middle of the screen to pick up a Coerco-Stasis-Grille from the top left of the room and place it in the path of the Blibbles. Move the Grille by placing the scanner over it so that the Blibble will collide with it. After the firs wave of Blibbles has passed, the Wafoid enters the room. The Wafoid is unstoppable and will destroy your scanner or Grille if it comes into contact with them. If you lose the Grille you have to get another one from the top left of the room. <br/><br/>The more Blibbles you get, the more points you get at the end. If 7 of the Blibbles escape, it's game over.<br/></p>\n<p>Also available for download in .CIA format for the Nintendo 3DS virtual console!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Start the game</strong><strong>:\u00a0</strong>Start\r\n<br/>\n<strong>Directions:</strong>\u00a0Cursor keys<br/><strong>Hold/Put down the cage:</strong>\u00a0A\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Start the game:\u00a0</strong>Enter\r\n<br/>\n<strong>Directions:\u00a0</strong>Arrow keys<br/>\n<strong>Hold/Put down the cage:</strong> Z<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>http://plus4world.powweb.com/software/Mayhem</p>\n<p>WLS Hompage link\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T13:22:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f5/5f58571c46a11b9680d8cce7d633a5fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rajcs\u00e1nyi L\u00e1szl\u00f3"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
