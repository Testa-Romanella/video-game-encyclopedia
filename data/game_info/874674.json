While in mid-air, pressing these pedals will cause the vehicle to rotate, allowing the player to control the angle at which they land. Fuel is replenished by picking up gas canisters or batteries along the way. The player can perform stunts such as driving the vehicle into the air for a prolonged time or flipping it over to earn more coins, which after the race may be spent on upgrades or to unlock new stages and vehicles Conditions ending the game are depleting the vehicle's fuel or hitting the driving avatar's head.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T07:07:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6eb/6eb2ec42e37fe0b7e505ecb4043be411.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["omar732"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
