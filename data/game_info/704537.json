But, I definitely had fun making it.</p>\n<p><strong>Is it fun?\u00a0</strong>Probably not, it's honestly less playable than most of these submissions.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>What can I expect?</strong> <em>Trash, a magic wand, Danny Devito, and Dani's Milkers inside a quaint chest.</em></p>\n<p><strong>What's the objective?\u00a0</strong>Delve into the grotto, clean up as much trash and corrupted slimey boiz as you can. Use items\u00a0 such as Danny Devito, or Finn's sword to aid you in your journey.</p>\n<p>Anyways, here's the book summary of the game:\u00a0<strong>Magic Man: Trash Boogaloo\u00a0</strong>is a rogue-like dungeon game that takes place in underwater grotto. In this maze-like dungeon that seems to be awfully half-arsed, you'll find that someone has dumped there trash there. Residue is escaping into the ocean above, and corrupting the fauna below, fix it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T14:22:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c93/c933fe5f5789ca7fb7715a1dd959649c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["jbakeacake"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
