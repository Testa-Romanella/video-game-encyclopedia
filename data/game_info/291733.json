We also want to have <strong>four working playable characters</strong>. Two of them are in-game for now and one of them is almost finished. <br/></p>\n<p> <br/></p>\r\nWhat now?\r\n\n<p>Well, you get to <strong>play </strong>the demo! <strong>Exciting </strong>isn't it?</p>\n<p>We've recently been having very good reception for<em> Sold O2ut</em>. Not only from <strong>players</strong> at conventions, but also from different indie game journalists like OrgulloGamer, ElbotonSelect, Isla de Monos... Moreover, we participated in the <em>PSTalents competition</em> (a competition derived from Sony held for Indie games in Spain). We arrived to the finals\u00a0and\u00a0were\u00a0nominated for\u00a0<strong>best multiplayer\u00a0game</strong>!<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p>That's why we think that putting <em>Sold O2ut</em> on hold is not a bad thing. For us and for you. For one thing, we get to <strong>learn </strong>more from other projects that we can later apply to<em> Sold O2ut</em>. But most importantly, we finally get to really <strong>share </strong>our demo. Not only can you play it, but you can have a copy of the game for <strong>free </strong>(or the price you <strong>decide</strong>). We value your <strong>feedback </strong>on <em>Sold O2ut </em>very much as it will <strong>help us improve</strong> inmensely and it will show us what parts of the game you like or not.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Here's to hoping you <strong>enjoy the project</strong>, and thanks a lot for reading and/or playing. Any questions or comments, feel free to tell us something in the comments or over on twitter, instagram, facebookor by mail!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-08T04:58:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9a/a9a57ddfef56697fefb28f8298a74c19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 218, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SandBloom Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
