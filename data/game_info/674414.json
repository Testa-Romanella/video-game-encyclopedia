So basically, the game is probably a house of cards duct taped together ready to break.</p>\n<p>I didn't want to go find suitable sounds for the sound effects, so all of the sound effects were made by me making noises into a mic. I also made a mistake having the player run to the right rather than having the stage/level move, and I also was too lazy to fix that or reset the player's position if they had gone too far right. I don't know what would happen if the player runs really far right, but it probably can't be good :^)</p>\n<p>I used Aseprite and Tilesetter to make the sprites and tiles, and I used the Godot game engine to make the game.</p>\n<p>Everything here was made by me, except...</p>\n<p>Elevator Music</p>\n<p>Battle Music - Dodge</p>\n<p>And the Game Over music was the Game Over theme from the original Legend of Zelda, but me doing a really bad cover of it with improvised lyrics.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T04:41:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e02/e020494c70262f3951c08b43bd673a2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["gyaradomo"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
