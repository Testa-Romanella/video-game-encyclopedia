As you enter the game, the environment, a farm, begins to flood with wheeled cows. Cows come in three varieties: the normal cow, slightly faster than the character, is the most common; the baby cow, the fastest cow, is rare and highly deadly; the god cow, a rapidly accelerating giant cow, this cow is a one of a kind cow that focuses on breaking map exploits where the player can remain still for long periods.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An important part of the game is the concept of a high score. Scores are achieved by surviving as long as you can. The highest score - most likely in one session as a permanently-saved high score seems too difficult - is saved and serves as a goalpost for the player.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa8/aa8d7de0f2286b444cbadc1fb787d744.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["LTUSummergroupstudios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
