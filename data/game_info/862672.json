Try to serve the customers in a timely manner and don\u2019t let the line run out the door! We have a reputation for speedy coffee and our customers won\u2019t hesitate to start complaining.\r\n</p>\n<p>Use WASD/ZQSD/Arrow keys to move between the stations and Space to interact. Get your customer\u2019s order at the register and interact with the register again to fulfil it. If you screw it up then just grab a new cup. When interacting with a station you can click which coffee/tea/flavor you want, then click and hold to pour.\r\n</p>\n<p>Customers will spawn outside every ten seconds. On normal mode time will stop while pouring coffee to give you a break, but on impossible mode the timer never stops. You fail if you end up with too many customers waiting (you can\u2019t see the full line but you can see the customers coming down the street out the window). The drink orders will get progressively more complicated, requiring you to mix the correct percentage of coffee, milk, tea, and flavor. There\u2019s also an ice machine!\r\n</p>\n<p>The game was made using Unity, Blender, Audacity, Krita, Photoshop. All the 3d modeling and all animations were done entirely from scratch in blender.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T15:52:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d0/2d00d93e4a73cf83c80b699202554e84.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Trusty.shm"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
