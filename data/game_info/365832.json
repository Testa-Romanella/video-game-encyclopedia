(V 0.1.5-- 12/18/2016)</p>\n<p>This was my first ever attempt at making a game-- I gave myself one week and this is the concept / design that I came up with. It is scalar and able to have levels added / designed quite easily. This game was designed using the free version of the Construct 2 engine, and utilized all 100 functions. (the reason the game is not larger, or more in depth.)<br/><br/>I hope you guys enjoy, as I really enjoyed making this game. Sadly I do not have the funds to continue development, so this game cannot currently be expanded</p>\n<p>Concept and art \u00a92016-2019</p>\n<p>Contact Information:   superiorfuntime@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Programs used: Construct 2 (https://www.scirra.com/construct2), Pyxel Edit (http://www.pyxeledit.com/)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-16T08:51:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38d/38dcb1552bcf2d3204ee74443ac43f02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SuperiorFunTime"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
