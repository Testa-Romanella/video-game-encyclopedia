The game is quite straight forward. You click on seeds from your inventory and place them on a watered field. Fields can be watered with the Potion of Hydration, which can be made in the cauldron with 5 pieces of a Hydroangea flower. If you're ever confused, simply refer to the game's journal.</p>\n<p>This is just the basics. The game has a 'How to play' section on the menu and the game will guide you along the way.</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Potion Brewing</li><li>Plant Harvesting</li><li>Bird Feeding</li><li>Achievements</li><li>Story Elements</li><li>Day/Night Cycle</li><li>Weather Change</li><li>Statistics (if that's your thing!)</li></ul>\r\nNote\r\n<p>This game a neat little idea that Jas\u00a0and I had.
