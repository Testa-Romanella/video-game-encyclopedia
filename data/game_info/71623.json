Help him start a New York City food delivery service in this fast paced action game. Food on demand is a big business in the city that never sleeps!  You\u2019ll begin by delivering pizza, but new friends will help Rocky expand by bringing their favorite treats like ice cream and sushi. Deliver pizza, grow your business, and take the Big Apple by storm.<br/><br/>Enjoy one tap input in this simple side scrolling runner. Hold down to stop Rocky from getting crushed by traffic. He just wants to keep running, but you\u2019ve got to get him to his destination with both him and the pizza intact.<br/><br/>Dodge all manner of cars including police cars, taxis, and the occasional pink 1950s sedan driven by an Elvis impersonator. New York City can be dangerous for pedestrian delivery guys, gals and unicorns. Collect powerups to race through the city in a robot suit or get a few new crosswalks installed. <br/><br/>Rocky is not one to leave a stray friend behind. The more animals you save, the more coins you earn. You can use coins to unlock new areas of the city and new delivery characters.<br/><br/>Raccoon Rush is free to play with some in-app purchases in the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:25:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/503/503b09b48a4132549462c47b7e66f30f.jpg", "website": "http://www.kongregate.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 283, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Kongregate"], "genres": ["Racing", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Kongregate"], "esrb_rating": null}
