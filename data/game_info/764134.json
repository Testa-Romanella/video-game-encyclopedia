This is my first foray to bitsy.\u00a0 My game is heavily story and based and uses basic bitsy controls. It is about a hero's journey to save his home village told turning into a quest for divinity. The journey and the divinity are allegories I made up about how in real life people who achieve great success in professional life are sometimes unable to let go of the responsibility that comes with creating perhaps for example a really large company. These people I find are most often unable to retire and let go of their position as they feel responsible (maybe rightly so) for their company and the people within it.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-05T04:09:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/101/101bc684c69adc1d2575ecfe33740c21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hardcase101"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
