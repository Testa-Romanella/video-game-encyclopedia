It might as well be his last.</p>\n<p>The game was made in Unity together with my girlfriend for a 48h game jam. I did the programming and animated the main character while she made all of the art assets!</p>\n<p>The sounds effects are from freesounds.org and were edited in Audacity</p>\r\nNotice\r\n<p>I forgot to change the export settings, so some texture might contain horrible colors. The framerate and dialogue speed are really low for some reason., especially in the HTML5 build.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T06:14:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c3/6c378cd239159fc2b9ef6cff8bc970b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["TwinGhosts"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
