This usually means a choice of either abstracted and essentialized \"Mexican\" or \"Japanese\" food or some manner of sandwich garnished with sprouts for seemingly no reason. <br/>- You may eject, from your otherwise neglected body, the solid (\"Poopee\") or liquid (\"Peepee\") byproducts of the foregoing, deal flow permitting.<br/>- You may shut your eyes and render yourself unconscious for anywhere from 3 to 5 hours each night, deal flow permitting.  <br/><br/>Now picture, if you will, this horrifying scenario:<br/><br/>You have just consumed your ration of abstracted and essentialized food and are suddenly overcome with the urge to immediately expel Poopee.  Just as you begin inching from your desk, the corded phone practically bolted to it begins to shriek.  It's your boss and he needs something from you and you have to take great notes.<br/><br/>Now, what do you do?:<br/><br/>A. Declare your need to eject Poopee, hang up on your boss, and risk the safety and security granted to you by your job?<br/>B. Obediently listen and eject the Poopee directly into your pants?<br/>C. Navigate a middle road: get enough information to do a good enough job while making it to the bathroom in time before you soil yourself?<br/><br/>Part visual novel, part WarioWare-inspired minigame collection, Please Leave Me Alone, I Need to Poop captures this modern struggle.  What will you choose?  Will you succeed?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-12T06:56:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe4/fe443cdeef0e4eacb35b006dbe5156ed.jpg", "website": "https://www.coproteches.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 175, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["CoproTech Enterprise Solutions"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CoproTech Enterprise Solutions"], "esrb_rating": null}
