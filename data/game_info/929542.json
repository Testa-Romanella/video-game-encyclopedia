My name is Alice Fae, and I am transgender.\u00a0Transitioning is a life-changing process, and it can be difficult, scary, and painful. This project is meant to give a small glimpse into the things that a trans person may deal with. Some people have it easier, and some people have it much, much harder. This game is meant to be just a small window with an optimistic viewpoint, so it\u00a0will not linger on some of the harsher realities that some people face. Thank you for taking the time to share in my experience, I hope you enjoy :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T10:57:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c58/c5854a26623bc5ebbfbf692389ad024e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WinterCourtFae"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
