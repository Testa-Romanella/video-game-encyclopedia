A half robotic scientist (Named Mecha) attempted to mutate animals to have human like ability and created Scalex, but the mutation machine couldn't handle Scalex's power and the building exploded as Scalex and the scientist fell from the sky, Scalex managed to survive but the scientist was destroyed along with the building, now the scientists son (Named Nexus) is hungry for revenge and wants payback for Scalex obliterating his father and now sending all of his robots to destroy him. Now your only goal is to destroy each robot and snap Nexus back to his senses! Lets Go! The game is a fast-paced action platformer and is intended for younger audiences. (but older ages can obviously play it too)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T06:31:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6c/d6ca97914b84122d973ccdd759d21b03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["XenoDev"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
