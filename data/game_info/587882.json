SUMMIT is my very first game made as part of my CS 221 final and I am currently still improving/developing this opening sequence. This version serves as the opening sequence for what would be a much larger game as described in my one sheet. Using unity and C# I wanted to make a game that really focused on narrative story and immersion, with underlying themes of mental health. Any feedback is welcomed!</p>\n<p>The description of the overarching game if this were ever to be expanded upon is as follows:</p>\n<p><em>Finding yourself can sometimes be the climb within itself. Many before you have made the hike up this very mountain and it has become infamous for what little is known. They say those who hike up the trail aren\u2019t the same as they were before, yet none who have made the climb speak of it again. Everyone\u2019s reasons for the climb are different, and you\u2019re not sure what has put you at the threshold of a local fable, but something compels you to this place. Through your desire to reach the summit, you discover remnants of those who came before you and they may be the key to finding yourself again.</em>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T03:58:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27c/27cea1d348d0f7030949e3a7b90e97b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["daisypix"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
