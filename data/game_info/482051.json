Since it will still be in development for a while, we decided to release this demo build to see if you guys enjoy it so far :)</p>\n<p>Bust all the blocks to beat a stage, but watch out, there will be several obstacles along the way.\u00a0\u00a0Mastering the controls and the rhythm of the game is essential to getting through the stages and acquiring time medals.</p>\n<p>The demo consists of 20 stages from the full game, which get increasingly harder and show off many of the different game mechanics. You will die. A lot.</p>\n<p>The full game will be released on itch.io and Steam when it's finished. Since I can only work on the game in my free time, next to my full job, I can't say for sure when we are able to release the full game, since there is still a lot of work todo.</p>\n<p>If you want to donate to support\u00a0the completion of the game, I will send you a\u00a0key after the game is released (min 1.00$). It's greatly appreciated :)</p>\n<p>The full game will feature (atleast) 60 stages, boss battles and a speedrun mode, for players who enjoy perfecting their runs and shaving off milliseconds off of every stage.</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>- A/D to move left and right</p>\n<p>- ESC for pause</p>\n<p>- R to restart the stage</p>\n<p>Leave some feedback in the comments whether it is good or bad. We really wanna know your true opinion towards the game and we're pumped to finally release this demo.</p>\n<p>Thank you for checking this out!</p>\n<p>Thomas -\u00a0Kyril Games</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-21T02:56:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd5/fd5503850c48f0522c0922ae71a7fea2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tomkha"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
