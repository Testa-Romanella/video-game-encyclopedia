Made in under 48 hours using Godot.</p>\n<p>Control Pippen the die as he navigates dangers and obstacles on his quest. Pippen can only roll in fixed increments based on the result of his die roll. Once a number has been used, it can't be re-used until he hits a campfire or finds a power-up. Power-ups also randomly change the allotment of number on the die. Pippen begins with 1-6, but a power-up might trade a 2 for a 7, replace 4-6 with all 5's, or something else.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T22:11:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52f/52ffbe396a918910f41cadd8b7bd796e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cold Ivory"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
