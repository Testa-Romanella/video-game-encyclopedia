Rumor has it that any humanity she previously possessed was beaten out of her early in her childhood, and she has since become a stone-hearted warrior who swiftly ends anyone who gets in her way. Don't get too close to her, many terrified citizens warn, for she is a vessel of destruction and malice.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Musician: Faelyn (Gender Selectable)</strong></em>\n</p>\n<p>Once a petty theif, they were born in the nearby city of Monadh, but fled their land of birth in their youth to avoid being prosecuted for their crimes. Playful and bubbly, you'll rarely see Faelyn without a smile on their face. They have recently become quite a popular musician in Yaafena due to their incredible gift in both lyricism and playing many instruments. They travel often and have been to many other nations to perform, but, in their opinion, none can measure up to the great land they are so proud to call home.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Laird: Elsare (Gender Selectable)</strong></em>\n</p>\n<p>Your childhood best friend and the heir to the throne of Syleric, a kind and gentle soul known for their wisdom and compassion, Elsare has always been the perfect child, and will soon become the perfect ruler. You haven't spoken in over a decade, but, from what you can see, they are still the same curious and hardworking person as they were when the two of you were just children. They can often be seen in the palace library, perusing through the various books they have most likely read many times over.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Proprietor: Levias (M)</strong></em>\n</p>\n<p>The owner of a small underground tavern named The Sleeping Nomad, he was reportedly born to a noble family, but rejected their lifestyle to make a name for himself. Levias is notoriously handsome and flirtatious, and has women and men alike falling prey to his sweet talk and tempting offers nearly everywhere he goes.  Some speculate about his ancestry, as he tends to be incredibly secretive about his lineage. Many note his humanoid appearance, but he has many strange features that make some question what he really is.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T09:33:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/004/0042c9368e185417e0245b88cad20c0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ASH"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
