Good ship design must consider hull shape for receive low drag, gun placement to get best fire cover, security viable parts from enemies fire, place enough propellers, engines to make it move fast enough etc, etc. Now it has a  growing number of over 150 construction elements.<br/><br/><strong>GAME MODES</strong><br/>Sandbox mode will allow to build and test multiple vehicle or fortress, spawn saved constructions as enemies. There are also a series of scenarios tutorials and  challenges with specific win and lose conditions and limited build budget. It will be also multiplayer, in which players can check whose vehicle is better.<br/>Other interesting game mode will be total battle simulation, with possibility to spawn any number of AI controlled, saved construction, divide they to two armies and start mayhem. <br/>During early access new campaign mode will come, with big open living world from perspective of world map, with cities, ports, fraction and NPC fleets moving between them, in case of battle, ships from engaged sides will be spawned in simulation.<br/><br/><strong>DESTRUCTION</strong><br/>Most important part of any ship is it core block, there can be only one and its destruction destroys whole vehicle, every block must have connection to core. Each element have own hit points, vulnerability of fire, impact form collision or explosion, some can be flooded or lose its lift. Each destroyed element change ship's combat capabilities so different blocks placement can improve ship survivability and efficiency. Many neutral building and trees on map can be destruct during confrontation between mechanical steel monsters.<br/><br/><strong>WEAPONS</strong><br/>Each weapons is separate object with own physics, before shoot they try aim with consideration of its limit and checking if they don't hit or collide with their own vehicle. Weapons types include many variant of artillery, rockets, machine guns,  flamethrowers, torpedo launchers, bombs, depth charges and radical close combat weapons.  Unique weapons is harpoon, can grab and pull enemies or pull own ship to ground to speed up or work as anchor.<br/><br/><strong>PHYSICS</strong><br/>Shape and size of vehicle hull affect of air and water drag, ship with lots of slope angles will be faster than brick like. Some blocks generate buoyancy or lift, center of it must be balanced with center of mass. Ocean has a realistic wave simulation, there is also a wind that can be used by sail.<br/><br/><strong>MECHANICS</strong><br/>Game have quite realistic gun ballistic and armor penetration mechanic, angled armor have better protection from piercing and can ricochet bullets. For many blocks you can change the type of material it is made of, materials have different weights and resistances . Enemy ships can behavior different depend of its weapons and goals, can keep distance, move on back of enemies, strive for brutal ramming.<br/><br/><strong>VISIBILITY</strong><br/>Each construction have own detection range parameter and view range in four directions depends of size and placement od spoting elements. Game checks whether one ship see another by compare they detect - view range and by checking line of sight. So is possible to create sneaky vehicle or make enemy blinded.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:49:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfa/cfa8581ea3aabd0f0d148bdab65295ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 13, "achievements_count": 23, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 358, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Roasted Games"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PlayWay"], "esrb_rating": null}
