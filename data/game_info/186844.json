You have a colour wheel at the bottom. When you click on the board, whatever colour you click (and all tiles of the same colour) become the colour you have selected (denoted by a white square). Your job is to get the board one colour before the bar on the left runs out (40 moves). If this is complicated, just play the game and you'll get it.</p><p>This is my first game on the site, please leave feedback! This was also a project I used to get familiar with flood-filling.</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b36/b36c862c225fb7ee0faa6f39130f5695.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["unearth"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
