There's a background noise / sound so be aware of that. You might miss it if you have your sound set to low.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I made this back in 2017 when I had just started learning how to use Unity, so there's no title screen or UI or anything. I don't have an exit button either so please quit the application in a fashionably reasonable creative method of your choice. Maybe I will work on this again so there is a proper way to exit the game but as of right now my focus is elsewhere. - Hint: I've been spending a stupid amount of time trying to build a pyramid.</p>\n<p>Interpret the work as however it resonates,\u00a0 and let the fun begin!<br/></p>\n<p>(...but if you would like to know what I\u00a0was thinking about when I made this, here's a hint:\u00a0Do you feel that you belong where you are right now, emotionally and physically?
