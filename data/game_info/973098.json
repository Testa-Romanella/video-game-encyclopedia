Maybe you'd want to play Hide and Seek with dodgeballs, inflatable hammers and boxing gloves to raise the stakes a little more? Why not turn your friends into enemies in a free-for-all battle with all of the items mentioned? You and your friends can partake in these activities while also earning GP (Goofy Points). Levels are gained through earning GP, which can then be used to unlock unique cosmetic items to show off while you're winning in your game mode of choice!<br/><br/>If you just want to chill without the fear of being chased or you don't feel like turning your friends into enemies just yet, we have you covered! Goofy Gorillas prioritizes creating a social hub before any game mode begins, so you're able to do whatever you want to do - with small mini-games that can be played at any time too! <br/><br/>Goofy Gorillas is fitted with a football (soccer) pitch with a working score counter hidden within the play area, a bowling alley with two lanes also hidden within the play area, 2 large ball pits with large slides and there are some basketball hoops scattered around the entire venue - some easier to dunk than others! We hope there is something here for everyone!<h3>GAMEMODES</h3><h3>Hide &amp; Seek</h3><br/>The classic game that everyone knows so well. Seekers must find all of the Hiders in the given time, and every round, both teams swap sides! Sounds simple, right? Well in Goofy Gorillas, we take it to the next level! Featuring an economy just for this gamemode, Hiders and Seeker have access to a shop with items and utility that will help them defend themselves as a Hider, or help catching the Hiders in style as a Seeker. <br/><br/>You want to make the Seekers slip on a banana peel? You can totally do that! <br/><br/>You want to hit the Hiders with an inflatable hammer? We highly encourage you to do that!<h3>Infector</h3><br/>Infector is another classic game. It plays just like Hide &amp; Seek, just without the economy. One player is chosen as the Infector, and by catching the Runners, they too will become an Infector. Once everyone has been caught, the Infector team will win... or lose if there's just a single player still standing. The first player that gets caught will be the Infector in the next round.<br/><br/>Be careful who you trust in this gamemode; once your \"friend\" has been caught, they will not be your friend anymore!<h3>Free For All</h3><br/>The standard of any multiplayer game. This is the perfect gamemode for those who want to mindlessly cause chaos with friends! Just spawn in with an item, get stuck in the brawl and come out on top, or just respawn with another item if you weren't successful! The first player to reach the score limit wins, or if no one reaches that, then the time limit will decide who becomes victorious!<br/><br/><br/>With all of these activities included, we hope you enjoy your time here at Goofy Gorillas!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-08T07:14:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d9/1d997c4aefb14cd1b44074d3c0c96564.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 343, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Liam Bradbury"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Liam Bradbury"], "esrb_rating": null}
