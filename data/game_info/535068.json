Aliens will appear at the top and the bottom of the screen. These aliens can be pretty helpful, or a pain but will warp out if hit by the ball. Avoid the ball hitting the red zone underneath/above your bat too many times. Otherwise you will lose a life.<br/></p>\n<p>During game play, various power up items will appear on screen. Collect these items while you can. Some are good, some are bad. They are as follows:<br/><br/>- B = Barrier: This will give the player temporary protection <br/>- X = Extra life: Take a guess what this does? Yes, that's correct, it will give you an extra bat (unless the bat count is full)<br/>- F = Fireball: If you collect this, it will burn through the wall for a period of time<br/>- S = Increases the speed of your bat and ball<br/>- E = Earthquake: This will shake the game screen <br/>- T = Trance: Plays trance music and beats the screen frantically (This is the reason for my safety warning)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Can you clear all 16 levels and become a Blap 'n Bash champion. Or will you face embarassment of becoming a loser?</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/><br/></strong>Programming: <strong>Richard Bayliss<br/></strong>Graphics: <strong>Richard Bayliss<br/></strong>Music: <strong>Richard Bayliss<br/></strong>Tape Loader: <strong>Martin Piper </strong>and <strong>Richard Bayliss<br/></strong>Loading bitmap: <strong>Errazking<br/><br/>(C)2015-2020 The New</strong> <strong>Dimension</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game is free software and it may only be copied and released for free.
