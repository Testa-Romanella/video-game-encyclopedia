As the commander of the Cradle Project, you will establish control across the Grand Continent, gathering resources and support while training your troops and managing their gear, classes, skills, and trust in you.<br/><br/>Dispatch missions occur at the start of each week, where you will cleverly send your troops to handle certain situations depending on their personal strengths and abilities. As the week progresses, you will be given options for how to spend your time: taking on battles as they appear, training skills for groups of allies directly, socializing with your new friends, or even just exploring the world on your own and see what you come across!<br/><br/>Be wise with how you spend your time, though, because the next Major Operation is always right around the corner...<br/><br/><br/><br/><h3>200 Years Ago:</h3><br/>A society forged in sorcery and swordplay experienced a golden age of scientific advancement and technological growth. Soon after, the world\u2019s first space program began, set to blast off from their little home world and colonize the star system. There, the people could explore and experiment freely, and make the next great strides of science. Thousands of volunteers from across the Grand Continent came together, willing to face the hardships of unexplored space and a life without the latent energy they called \u201cmagic,\u201d in an event called the First Breach.<br/><br/>But, resentment grew among those left behind on the surface world. These volunteers had betrayed their promised land: the home of all life, and of the gift from the gods known as magic. The surface world \u2013 now called \u201cCradle\u201d by the spacefarers \u2013 began to regress back to its primitive, might-makes-right ways, and scientific accomplishments were rejected in favor of a return to tradition. Focus shifted to discovering the secrets of magic, instead. Communication with the spacefarers was cut off, and the surface dwellers moved on.<h3>2 Weeks Ago:</h3><br/>Without warning, the spacefarers have returned to their home world, bringing dire news: a cosmic calamity has been detected in the far reaches of space, and the threat of utter annihilation of all biological life in the star system is imminent.<br/><br/>The Grand Continental Leadership (GCL), the ruling government of the country of Duleur, agrees to meet with spacefaring representatives of the initiative known as the Cradle Project. They come offering a solution: shed their mortal bodies to enter an experimental digital collective consciousness, where their minds can survive the cataclysm, and continue to thrive indefinitely.<br/><br/>Assisting with the Cradle Project are the Forever Dawn organization, who are developing the digitization technology; the Beyond Frontiers Initiative, who are the spacefarers\u2019 main scientific researchers; and Inter-Space Operations, a well-armed paramilitary group. All of these factions have come together, offering a chance of survival to their ancestors still living on the home world.<br/><br/>But, resentment from the First Breach is stronger than ever, and new resistance groups in opposition to the spacefarers and the GCL are appearing all over the world.<br/><br/>As either the commander of the Cradle Project, or the ambassador from the GCL, how will you respond? Will you cooperate, and take a risk on this experimental technology that may allow the transcendence of life as you know it? Or will you doubt the spacefarers\u2019 intentions, and drive them away using the power of magic? Or, will you align yourself with one of the other factions at play, and look for an alternative solution \u2013 or an opportunity?<br/><br/>Take part in multiple branching campaigns in Eden\u2019s Last Sunrise. Trusted allies become bitter enemies, motives are called into question, and victories are hard-fought, as the days until utter annihilation continue to tick down\u2026", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T03:20:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0e/b0eca12d160b6806a0551ece89e6fa86.jpg", "website": "https://www.els-game.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 393, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sungazer Software"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sungazer Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
