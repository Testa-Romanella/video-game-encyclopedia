Gravity is your friend, but the twists and turns of the Wire are not!<br/><br/>Completing each puzzle quickly enough unlocks a fresh Wangle Wire for you to try.<br/><br/>You can try each one in four different Wangle Zones - Earth, Fire, Air and Water - each with a different look and feel, and with trickier zones giving you higher scores:<br/><br/>'Easy Earth' has a Wire that's not too slippery, and the whole things spins quite sedately.<br/><br/>'Frisky Fire' has a slick, polished wire that the Pip slides around rather more quickly; you'll have to work harder to keep it under control.<br/><br/>'Turbulent Air' brings a fresh challenge, as the Wangle Wire tries to slip from your grasp, and twitches back and forth when you aren't moving it yourself.<br/><br/>Lastly, 'Deep Deep Water' requires all your wits, as a blackened Wangle Wire in some gloomy depths is lit by the gleams of light from the Pip.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T10:01:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6d/b6dca5cc555d2a5a5f9630afa73931ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Mousepickle"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Mousepickle"], "esrb_rating": null}
