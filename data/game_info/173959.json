If you've ever hosted a minecraft server you probably already have done this.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4dc/4dc7de7082ae2e49cf3534c70db2e5d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["ThatchCastle"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
