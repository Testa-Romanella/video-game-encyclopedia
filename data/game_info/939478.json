Its my first time trying to put together my own real project with what limited abilities I have.</p>\n<p>As of right now, the project is around 1/2 of the way complete, not including bug testing and such. Where the game is\u00a0now, a playthrough takes around 1-2 hours, so I would assume the full game will be somewhere around 3-4 hours.</p>\n<p>Goodnight, Lola is a story driven puzzle game in which the player experiences 2 different worlds (the real world and the dream world). When visiting Lola's dreams, certain objects or learned information are used in the real world to solve puzzles/help her. However, when crossing over to the real world, certain objects in inventory or information may be changed a little bit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I started this game at the end of my high school career, but unfortunately, college has halted the pace of my progress and\u00a0the game is not available for download yet! :(.\u00a0I estimate this project will be completed around the beginning of\u00a02024.</p><p><strong>Story,\u00a0Illustration,\u00a0Pixel Art, Music</strong><strong>\u00a0by:</strong>\u00a0 Sloane Taylor</p>\n<p>Plugins Used:</p><p><strong>Yanfly</strong>\u00a0- use of MessageCore and CoreEngine pluggins\u00a0</p><p><strong>Sasuke Kannazuki</strong> - message sound plugin\u00a0</p><p><strong>Masked\u00a0</strong>- Map zoom effect</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T18:57:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d05/d05339b5506c37281a87f25b1a4d16f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Slocat"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
