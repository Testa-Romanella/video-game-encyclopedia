We leverage AI technology to achieve various improvement on top of the classic minesweeper game. <br/><br/>- Exercise your brain and logic reasoning skills<br/>- 4 difficulty options, tons of fun<br/>- Classic minesweeper redefined by AI<br/><br/>* Redefined by AI *<br/>1. Model the minesweeper game as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) [a]<br/>2. Precompute the heuristic score for each valid move using multiple state-of-the-art algorithms [b], to yield a stack rank of 10 (or less) best moves. <br/>3. Based on the heuristic difference between the optimal move and the actual move by the user, we use our pre-defined probability (non-uniform distribution) to control the mine position (by ad-hoc switching cells on the board). <br/>4. At the end of the game, further tune the mine-switching probability using win/lose ratio as an input [c], to ensure a custom tailored gaming experience that\u2019s challenging but not frustrating. <br/><br/>References:<br/>[a] https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa18/assets/slides/lec4/FA18_cs188_lecture4_CSPs_6pp.pdf<br/>[b] https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/14398552/BECERRA-SENIORTHESIS-2015.pdf?sequence=1<br/>[c] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T04:08:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c62/c623caab16f2d190a5cc25e90b5ca855_qF9Pu2P.jpg", "website": "https://ggfen.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["\u5fc3\u4e1c \u9ec4"], "genres": ["Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["\u5fc3\u4e1c \u9ec4"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
