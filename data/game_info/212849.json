Since I left the idea of having a kids level difficulty behind, I wanted to at least keep a kid friendly style. My little sister, who this game is in the end for, really loves Halloween. So in an attempt to keep a kid friendly version of that, I went with a pastel goth theme. Everything is in bright colors contrasted against a simple super dark background. The pastel goth theme meant I wanted music that was cutsy-creepy, so I made an attempt at a theme that isn\u2019t too serious but still feels a little creepy. The sound effects also came from this place, feeling almost a little cartoony in order to maintain the theme. </p>\n\n<p>7. It looks more like a finished product and provides reasoning for certain aspects. The cats give obstacles a reason to be there, and the entire theme gives a reason for the character to go across the sky in the first place. </p>\n<p>8. Art and audio are not my areas of experience. I found the entire process difficult. I had to teach myself how to draw digitally, the animations, how to make audio work, and everything else about the process was extremely difficult for me. None of it was more or less difficult because the entire process was hard for me. For as much as I enjoy art, it is not intuitive to me. Perhaps something that wasn\u2019t so obvious to me as a problem but was still difficult was remembering how to use certain aspects of Unity in this sense. With code I can look up how something works easily enough. In UI and Animation it is harder for me to express my questions, so it is more difficult to learn. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a3/5a3188a4691a6c75831c9dd1e08b68d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kreetin7"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
