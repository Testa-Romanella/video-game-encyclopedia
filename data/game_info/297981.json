Oh, maybe a bit\u00a0pissed too,\u00a0 a bit...\u00a0\u00a0extremely mindbendingly\u00a0AGNRY&quot;`&quot;<br />\nPlay as one of the four members of the Genokids; a crazy electronica band whose all concerts end up in violent brawling, seizures and a handful of broken ribs, as they blast their way through the invading aliens&#39;s bases to kick their butts back to whichever cosmic hole they came from.<br />\nYou won&#39;t be alone though,\u00a0your insane fans will follow you to the depths of hell to enjoy some good old smacking, they will cheer you up or throw you off the stage if you don&#39;t show them a good spectacle!<br />\nNOTES:<br />\nThis game is still early in development, as such, multiplayer features, the hype gauge or even proper graphics\u00a0are not in the demo yet.For a better experience we reccomend using an xbox controller, the demo accounts that you&#39;re using it for its tutorials so I&#39;ll leave the list of keyboard controls below in case you don&#39;t have a controller or don&#39;t want to use it.<br />\nKEYBOARD CONTROLS:<br />\nWASD; Move<br />\nSpace: Jump<br />\nShift: Dash<br />\nLeft mouse: Attack<br />\nRight mouse: Lock-on<br />\nE.
