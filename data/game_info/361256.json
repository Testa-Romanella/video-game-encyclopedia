Place your shot carefully!</p>\n<p>The more enemies you kill with one fire of your gun, the more points you get! The basic enemies are worth 100 points each normally, but getting 3 kills in one shot would get you a total of 600 points for example!</p>\n<p>Every time you get 500 points, a scary red ship of a random type\u00a0will spawn! Those guys take 2 hits to knock out.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>All the wonderful art in this game was done by my good friend Fluffysbeans.
