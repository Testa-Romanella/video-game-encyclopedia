A Boxing Clicker Game!\u00a0</strong></p><p><strong>&gt; NOTE: THIS GAME IS IN EARLY BETA! I WILL DEFINITELY BE WORKING ON IT MORE OFTEN!</strong></p><p><strong>&gt; Press F to punch left or J to punch right! Press both at the same time to get more coins ;)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&gt; See the \"hits left\" counter? Each time you get it to 0 it increases by 5! Also, every time you punch the dummy you get coins!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&gt; Go to the \"Menu\" to buy different gloves (ONLY 3 AS OF RIGHT NOW) which do different damage to the dummy! (Ex. Green Glove has 3DPP or \"Damage Per Punch\" meaning you do 3 more damage to the dummy every time you hit it!)</strong></p><p><strong>&gt; The better gloves you buy, the easier it is to defeat the dummy! There is also a code to get 300 coins (Just click see inside lol).</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&gt; Lastly, there is a World Record counter! It's not very useful in the BETA version right now but will be soon! Can you beat it?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&gt; As always, follow me for more cool &amp; intriguing games! This game took about 2 1/2 weeks to make (Plus breaks) so please consider giving it a reasonable rating and explain how I can improve on it!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&gt; Also, don't forget to follow me on Scratch and these other platforms to stay up\u00a0 to date on my games!\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Scratch:\u00a0https://scratch.mit.edu/users/KrazyKernel/</strong></p>\n<p><strong>GameJolt: https://gamejolt.com/@KrazyKernel</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Newgrounds: </strong><strong>https://krazykernel.newgrounds.com/</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T09:15:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c1/1c1ff54891c970839aa5209aa631f7ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["KrazyKernel"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
