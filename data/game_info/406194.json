Game Jam 2.0, I will be expanding this game much more! Adding more levels, bosses and more mechanics into the game to better compliment the main momentum mechanic. I really enjoyed working on this game and can not wait to begin improving all of its aspects in order for it to be a greater game! However, this Game Jam post will always remain so the full game will be considered a different project!! I will post on here when I do release it and post updates on @Bastraction (Twitter)!! Anyways I hope you enjoy the Game Jam edition of Sombrero Glitch!</p><p>//</p>\n<p>Sombrero_Glitch involves you going through several different levels in order to get to the end boss, the eye of the Developer. This task is sent to you by Green Square, Sombrero Guy, because he wants his Sombrero, which causes the momentum store glitch to occur, to be protected. However, he can not fight the Developer so he sends you to do it.</p>\n<p>Content:</p>\n<p>4\u00a0Levels, 4th one being the boss fight</p>\n<p>4 Unique songs for every level</p>\n<p>Hold Down Left Click to shoot!</p>\n<p>Other Info:</p>\n<p>This game was made for the WOWIE! Game Jam 2.0 and was made in 3 days (1/17/20 - 1/19/20).</p>\n<p>This game was worked on by 3 people, myself, Bastraction (Joseph Lee Rodriguez), with the programming and animating and such, Matthew Povian with the Music and Carlos Rubalcava with the idea.</p>\n\n<p>We hope you enjoy this game!
