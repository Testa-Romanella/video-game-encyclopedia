You can even <strong>play your own music</strong> and auto-next-song for key game events.<br/><br/>There are several stages, playable in any order, each ending with a challenging boss.  Wall layouts and spawn patterns are partially randomized so you never know quite what to expect.<br/><br/>Choose from a variety of ships, and create your arsenal from a huge selection of weapons!  The game plays very differently based on your choices: obstacles are harder to clear with larger ships, and weapons may travel only in certain directions or have other special features.<br/><br/>You can play in a window or in Full\u00a0Screen, and you can control how much of the display is used in Full\u00a0Screen mode.\u00a0 You can also set graphics quality to one of three levels.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbf/cbf0fab416ee39f48ec7894a44a50fec.jpg", "website": "https://www.kevingrant.name/apps/celtreos/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 304, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Kevin M.
