This is my entry, The Hungry Birdies.</p>\n<p>In this game you play as a mother bird with three new born chicks. You have to go out into the world killing and collecting bugs to bring back to your chicks until they are full. There are only seven days in the game with each one harder than the last. Sadly, I did not have enough time to add music or sounds effects because of school and life. This was my first game jam, and I had a great time! Thanks for the wonderful experience!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T06:50:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb2/bb2c80b83f8abe47e69cb2cec13a769f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["AwesomeRedflare"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
