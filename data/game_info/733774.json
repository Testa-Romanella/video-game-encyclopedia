In this short point-and-click adventure, guide a digital friend as he tries to see the 7:00 showing of his favorite movie,\u00a0<em>Explosion City</em>. Use WASD to move and your cursor to click.</p>\n<p>As my first real game in Unity 2D, this project was a huge learning experience for me. Instead of having a concrete plan ahead of time like I usually do, I let myself experiment and add whatever features I\u00a0thought it might be useful to learn. The original scope for this project was small: just to create a room where the user can click on items to animate them. But as I did research and gathered inspiration, I gradually added more and more, from lighting effects to dialogue to an entire inventory system, until eventually a weekend hobby became a months-long project.</p>\n<p>I really love how this game turned out, even if the gameplay is relatively short. I've learned so much on how to make (and how not to make) a game like this, and I'm so excited to take what I've learned and apply it to future projects.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy playing Cyber Theater!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T07:58:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/616/616e49a85e0a8ac75ee7aad5a478ae83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["liv bono"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
