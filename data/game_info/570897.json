The first thing you need to do is to find your shell.  Hermit Crab can\u2019t live without a shell. Every shell has a certain amount of wear-life. After this shell break, you will need a new one. Besides shells, the shallows you live in also have trash, like pills bottles and tin cans. Those things can protect you in the shallows, but will also cause trouble as the game goes.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Team: Crystal Tan, Lia Liang, Yibo Fu, An Kong</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T07:17:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f2/6f26db76cc22814b3bb68d3ab907ce8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AnKK"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
