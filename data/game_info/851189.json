After I made the backgrounds I realized I wanted animated backgrounds. So i used Disco Diffusion with a google colab, didn't want to pay for colab pro but was able to render 30 frames unfortunately that is not enough for the game background. I would have liked to get animated ai art but it was going to take way to long but thankfully i still had the stable diffusion backgrounds so i used that.<br/></p>\n<p>Also wanted AI to make the character and enemy sprite but i learned ai can not do frame animation it's good for like concepts or starting points but not for actual development. I ended up just doing a quick fun cycle in photoshop.</p>\n<p>This was fun, would like to continue experimenting with AI art and generating game assets with AI.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T11:57:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8d/c8de40e823ab75a7d8ed591d8c8d116a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Stephano Cardona Game Designer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
