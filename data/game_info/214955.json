Red things hurt you, and you can grapple and swing them around (solid red things can't be swung, but can still be grappled to). The exit is a pink square</p>\n<p>If a red thing hits another red thing, they will both be destroyed.</p>\n<p>Controls: Left and right click to grapple. Both clicks have different hooks, so use both of them at once for more control and speed</p>\n<p>Huge thanks to @diekie for patiently helping me with a seemingly unsolvable jar file problem, if he hadn't helped me this game and all the work that went into it would never have been submitted to the jam\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a93/a93fae472d83377f6f901b26c8eb8a61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KeyBird"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
