Known in Indonesia/Malaysia as kain kafan, the shroud is the prescribed length of cloth used in Muslim burials to wrap the body of the dead person. The dead body is covered in white fabric tied over the head, under the feet, and on the neck.\r\n</p>\n<p>According to traditional beliefs, the soul of a dead person will stay on the Earth for 40 days after the death. If the ties over the shroud are not released after 40 days, the body is said to jump out from the grave to warn people that the soul needs to be released. After the ties are released, the soul will leave the Earth forever. Because of the tie under the feet, the ghost can't walk. This causes the pocong to hop like a rabbit. They also have the ability to fly and teleport.\r\n</p>\n<p>But In this game, i only give him Teleport Ability ;)\r\n</p>\n<p>sorry for my bad english, i'm from indonesia, i make this game myself (actually my friend make the ghost (pocong) but after that, i'm on my own)\r\n#adventure\u00a0#horror\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T22:01:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ed/4ed1433db5c65e8458d19518047e46b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["noveriansoft"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
