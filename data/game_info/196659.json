It was a prototype of how the loading screen could be used to supplement the main game. CONTROLS: ASWD or arrow keys to move. B,N,M to switch what build mode during loading screen, N to fire during actual game. With my limited available time, I would like to have made the main game more satisfying, but I hope you enjoy nonetheless as this is my first jam : )</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30d/30dd86ebf15e9314af0e699ad78c9a75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["OnyLeon"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
