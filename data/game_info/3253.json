{"id": 3253, "slug": "hatoful-boyfriend", "name": "Hatoful Boyfriend", "name_original": "Hatoful Boyfriend", "description": "<p>In Hatoful Boyfriend: A School of Hope and White Wings, the player enters the world of sentient birds to romance with them.</p>\n<h3>Setting</h3>\n<p>The game is set in a weird post-apocalyptic future, where the human civilization was taken over by the birds. In a twist similar to Planet of the Apes film series, a pandemic killed most of the humans and transformed birds into sentient beings. They established a new civilization on the ruins of their human predecessors. The few remaining humans survive in the wilderness as hunters and gatherers.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The player assumes the role of a teenage human girl. She is the only human student who was allowed to study at the institute run by the pigeons. She befriends several of her co-students and can become their romantic interest, despite being a member of another species.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Hatoful Boyfriend is a visual novel and therefore has minimal gameplay. The player interacts with the characters mostly by clicking on dialogue options. Some of the options require the main character to have certain stats. The game rewards multiple playthroughs by unlocking documents that reveal more of the game&#39;s world and plot.</p>\n<h3>Endings</h3>\n<p>The game has thirteen endings that depend on the choices made by the protagonist. After the player discovers the certain four endings, the Bad Boys Love mode is unlocked. This mode reinvents the plot with a horror twist. In this mode, the protagonist receives dark visions, and deeper explores the conflicted relationship between birds and humans.</p>", "metacritic": 68, "released": "2014-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-01T20:18:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/81e/81e5cf3f433473af3a04888e3baceeba.jpg", "website": "http://www.mediatonicgames.com/hatoful-boyfriend", "rating": 3.27, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 90, "owned": 1050, "beaten": 128, "toplay": 24, "dropped": 77, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 67, "ratings_count": 194, "suggestions_count": 327, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 196, "platforms": ["iOS", "PlayStation 4", "PS Vita", "macOS", "PC", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Devolver Digital", "Mediatonic", "The Irregular", "Hato Moa"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Devolver Digital", "GHI Media"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
