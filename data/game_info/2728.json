The game includes both single and multiplayer (co-op) experience. Playing for The Division agent gamers will fight against the sources of virus throughout the city to save America from the terrible cataclysm. The main action is set in New York City, so players have an opportunity to explore an open-world Manhattan infected with the dangerous pandemic. According to the storyline, the disease called \u201cGreen Poison\u201d or \u201cThe Dollar Flu\u201d appeared as a result of a failed experiment and spread with dollar banknotes on Black Friday 2015. Players should assume a role of The Strategic Homeland Division agent whose aim is to clear the city and to prevent further extension of the pandemic. The gameplay is about completing the missions, earning experience points (for the player progress) and currency (for upgrading the equipment level), and gradual fight against infection. Due to properly worked out high-quality textures all the objects and the city itself are meant to be willingly destructible for the improvement of gaming experience.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2016-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-17T08:09:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c73/c73c4ffebfe968ba0982a56c2b5020ef.jpg", "website": "http://thedivisiongame.com", "rating": 3.7, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 173, "owned": 4198, "beaten": 711, "toplay": 114, "dropped": 624, "playing": 88}, "playtime": 27, "achievements_count": 395, "ratings_count": 1314, "suggestions_count": 654, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 1318, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Ubisoft", "Massive Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Ubisoft Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
