It falls under attack of haters, who using hate words want to destroy the fandom ergo kill the clown. They come towards him and words are used as a weapon that damage him even more and he can\u2019t defend himself on his own. You are an extreme fan (AKA fat sweaty guy) that REALLY doesn\u2019t want to let that happen and doesn\u2019t believe that such an amazing, loving, charming, astonishing, animating, wonderful, profound, giving hope and endless oblivion of happines can die, so you want to pay all the tribute to the master of the worlds Stephen Hawknig- er- Stephen King and defend your lovely Pennywise. You do that by BRUTALLY KILLING ALL THE HATERS WITH BFG YEAAAAH. There come more waves of Tumblr haters and you keep defending Pennie and upgrading your weapons.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T05:35:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca2/ca298e1b1360aa7e1605f146415e7a16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Skill Games Studio"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
