Pick a character, fight monsters, collect loot, unlock doors, and survive to explore the whole map. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Developer's Note:</strong><br/></p>\r\nWhat's uploaded right now is a kinda 'safety' upload - I'd love to get more done before the end of the jam, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to stay awake too much longer. Right now it's playable and losable, but not completable, and unbalanced. This has been a lot of fun, but very draining, and I probably took on more than I should have - my car is all busted up right now\u00a0(donations appreciated!) and I live in the middle-o-nowhere so I was housebound the whole time, which probably didn't help. Might've went a lil stir-crazy. Anyway, thanks to anyone playing, especially those giving feedback, and massive congratulations to all the other succesful entries in 7DRL2023 :)<br/>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br/>\u2022 Left-click for everything - double-click to attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Known bugs:</strong><br/>\u2022 There's no end yet<br/>\u2022 Difficulty curve and balancing is quite broken<br/>\u2022 There is a *rare* possibility in which a map may be un-completable<br/>\u2022 Save/load is implemented, but had to be pulled last-minute because it was broken</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T08:02:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b26/b26a5e356b563b3dacfbda9f60bb1708.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["chilly_durango"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
