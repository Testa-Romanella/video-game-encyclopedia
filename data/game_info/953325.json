A somewhat common disturbance makes it difficult for her to sleep, but, with some help, hopefully she can calm down and get some more rest.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTENT WARNINGS: a depiction of an imagined suicide attempt (skippable), behavior and discussions based on a specific personality disorder (one that involves having a \"favorite person\"), direct language about suicide and self-harm, direct language about self-hate and perceived rejection, manipulative behavior, strong language, physical assault (mentioned), and bullying (mentioned).<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Despite the content warnings, this is meant to be a happy story. It is a bit emotionally dense, though.<br/></p>\n<p>There are some references to\u00a0previous\u00a0fanworks\u00a0I've\u00a0made, but\u00a0it\u00a0should\u00a0be\u00a0perfectly\u00a0understandable\u00a0without having played/read them. <br/></p>\n<p>There is no sound or music in this game, but I would recommend listening to something soft and ambient while reading.</p>\n\n<p>There are around 8k words, and it takes around 30 minutes to finish reading.
