A dark voice whispers to Layne in his head and teaches him how to defend himself with magic and how to get stronger! Now Layne will have to face his creator, who lives in his castle on the mountains. A random set of bosses will challenge Layne on his way to the top, like the Black Mage, who can help you to become human again. Layne might be haunted by the old castle ghost, who eventually transforms into his old rotten body. Sometimes a vampire hunter will show up, to challenge Layne to a duel. An Assassin might stop Layne and lets him dance to avoid a rain of bombs.<br/><br/><strong>Tip:</strong> Just play as you want on your first playthrough and have fun.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T03:13:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/029/02951c357d0ef6dc0ae88b4188e23ccb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 238, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["John Schneddi"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Schneddi Universe"], "esrb_rating": null}
