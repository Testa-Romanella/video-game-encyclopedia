My one and so far only attempt at using RPG maker. Plan was to make a small game about a girl who goes to visit her grandmother at a home. Something happens and she's locked in a section of the building inhabited by obsolete technology like a record player, crt tv, vcr, etc. To escape, the girl would need to figure out how these devices worked to get parts of a code for the locked door.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3c/d3cef76c278bea8f9f451f2a93e3b3eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["XenosNS"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
