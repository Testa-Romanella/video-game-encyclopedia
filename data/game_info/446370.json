While there should not be any major bugs it is far from perfect and may present some minor flaws.<br/></p>\n<p>I have been a fan of PewDiePie since forever, and due to the current situation now more than ever I have been enjoying his content. I thought I could give back by creating a little fan project.</p>\n<p>So I hopped on the recent Floor Gang meme and made this short game.</p>\n<p>You are a member of the floor gang and your job is to infiltrate the Ceiling Gang (cringe) headquarters and destroy the device that their are planning on using to convert the whole world to Ceiling Gang (cringe).\r\n</p>\n<p>Let's say that their base is quite unconventional, but they are not known for being the sharpest tools in the shed.</p>\n<p>Let me know what you think!</p>\n<p>I also made a video about the making of this game: it was quite a ride and it was fun documenting everything in a short 5 minute game:</p>\n<p>Also I need to thank @studio67.ej and @avstenmusic on Instagram for making the amazing sound track. They are great!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T06:10:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/599/5999102509d382d030f9e1e04d57cd9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PunkPebbleStudio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
