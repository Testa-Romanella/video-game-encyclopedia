The studio successfully raised funds for development in 2014 at Kickstarter and released the project in the same year. Only two people worked on the game: they just graduated from college and had some experience developing game mods. The game uses the Unity graphics engine and is available on Steam for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and OS X.</p>\n<h3>Game mechanics</h3>\n<p>There are no conditions for victory or defeat in the game. Each time players simply spawn on the playing field, where they can interact freely with game figures and pieces. All the craziness occurs within the realistic physical model, which the developers have added for greater similarity to the real prototypes. In addition to the insanity that can be arranged in multiplayer along with ten other players, the game engine supports the ability to use preset rules for different board games and thus play them.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>There are several games included. For example, chess, poker, and checkers. The set is small, but the game supports Steam Workshop and the ability to download your own models of figures and game boards. Thus, players added to the standard set of three games three thousand more variations, most of which are variations on games, for the inclusion of which developers will have to purchase a license.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-21T00:50:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/f86/f869253c68b38fa789f58cc5be2cb996.jpg", "website": "http://www.berserk-games.com", "rating": 4.06, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 92, "owned": 3712, "beaten": 154, "toplay": 24, "dropped": 361, "playing": 140}, "playtime": 7, "achievements_count": 27, "ratings_count": 645, "suggestions_count": 325, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 649, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Berserk Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Berserk Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
