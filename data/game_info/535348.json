A fast-paced crafting platformer.</p>\n<p>Collect the colored dots to receive speed boosts, health or slow down you or the camera.</p>\n<p>But now all is fun, they can also combine to deadly combinations which will crack your egg.</p>\n<p><strong>Quick instructions</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You can move with WASD, the arrows and the space button.</p>\n<p>The goal is to get to the end of the level after which you can enter your score for the scoreboard. The brown bar will fill up to show your progress.</p>\n<p>The dots can be picked up (or avoided) to create powerups. The recepis can be seen at the top of the screen. The order of you picking up the dots has no effect (red and then green does the same as green and then red).</p>\n<p>The camera with the two arrows is for the speed of the camera, by picking up Green-Green you slow down the camera.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you have any other questions, feel free to let put them in the comments.</p>\n<p><strong>How this game was made</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game was made by one person, me!
