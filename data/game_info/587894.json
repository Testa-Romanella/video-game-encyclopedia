So the title was a play on word with the famous Clash of Clans.</p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s the pitch ?<br/></strong>3 squirrels team up against a lumberjack to protect the forest ! They need to avoid the working man, regenerate trees, and build snaring traps with the help of their allies. The Lumberjack, on his side, has to cut down the trees and can use the gathered wood to place cages around the field.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play ?<br/></strong>You\u2019ll need a party of 4 friends (play locally or using Parsec) with a controller for each person. Just Download the game and launch it.\u00a0The actions are displayed in game when you start it. You\u2019ll need to settle for a 1 Lumberjack + 3 Squirrels composition before everyone\u00a0enters the center circle. You can control the global handicap if you feel the Lumberjack is too strong or too weak.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who made this ?</strong><br/>\u2014 Design + Programming<br/>\u2619 Cyril 'Lhone' Canillas<br/>\u2619 RedSPINE\u00a0( + art )<br/>\u2619 Brattacke<br/>\u2619\u00a0Maxime 'Krywan' Th\u00e9zard<br/>\u2619 NalAna ( + art )<br/>\u2619 Sanctified<br/>\u2014 Music + SFX<br/>\u2619 Koku</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T04:02:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/620/62062c94d88d9f406e8b6f2512122430.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lhone", "RedSPINE", "Sanctified"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
