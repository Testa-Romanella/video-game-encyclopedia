I would love to hear ideas for improvements for this current project/ideas for a new game.</p>\n<p>The game's controls are as follows:</p>\n<p>1. The arrow keys and spacebar\u00a0move the player character\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. The \"R\" key restarts the current level</p>\n<p>3. Press Escape to halt the application and Alt+F4 to shut down the application.</p>\n<p>I think this would be a pretty cool game to try speedrunning for the first time as it (currently) has 14 levels with no loading screens, no menus, and a host of levels that can be easily beaten far quicker than I originally intended through creative use of the game's mechanics.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T07:35:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/140/1407c7d2d3ad76bc773fc0366dd753f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["theswimmerguy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
