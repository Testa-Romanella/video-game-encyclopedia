He has received an eviction notice in the mail, so he attempts to get to the top of a multi-purpose office building and speak with the CEO. He is a very sentimental father, as he keeps all of his sacred memories in his scrapbook. The power of reliving his memories will soon come into play as he sneaks past security and knocks out baddies. An old man getting violent? Not exactly. A dungeon crawler, with all original assets.</p>\n<p>Collaborated with Andrew Liu and Zane Fadul.</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;</p>\n<p>*If you are sharing this game or\u00a0your gameplay experience on YouTube or other platforms, please\u00a0credit me and\u00a0link back to this page.
