Gear up by winning or purchasing new weapons and armor, and use them to defeat over 64 unique enemies, collect over 64 items, and choose from over 64 different characters!<br/><br/>We plan on continuing development to fix some bugs, and possibly expand it quite a bit, as there was a lot of ideas we were not able to fit in. Follow our Twitter to stay updated. <br/></p>\r\nHOW TO PLAY\r\n<p>Explore the world, kill monsters, get better loot, kill better monsters, and bring it all back and sell it so you can upgrade the guild.
