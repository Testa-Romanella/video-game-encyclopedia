(Perhaps they are mice.) Avoid all obstructions. Hitting anything except a target including the snake's own tail loses. Consuming all targets on all levels and sub-levels wins.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Can you survive through all six levels? Although easy on lower levels, higher levels are quite challenging because, on every level and sub-level, the hungry snake grows a little longer and a little faster as it feeds on targets -- I mean mice!<br/></p>\n<p>TIP: Remember that the screen wraps around at the edges! To restart the game, simply refresh your browser.</p>\n<p>NOTE: Targets are randomly placed using AI to ensure their separation from other objects making every game both different and winnable!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T03:26:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/322/3220f2df78378e17e06c0f2bd2391441.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TomSwan"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
