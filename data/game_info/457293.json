Over the course of 3 simple mini games we will show a variety of accessibility topics concerning visual, hearing, and motor disabilities.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is NOT meant to be accessible. Quite the opposite. It is meant to frustrate users. It is meant to show gamers without disabilities what they may be taking for granted and how those with disabilities may struggle with what should be simple tasks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After a round of frustration, the game will give advice for combating these issues and then show the same game with more accessible features turned on. But even in their more accessible modes, these games are not completely accessible. The game is meant to be an eye opener, not a guideline or even a good example of true accessibility features\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T03:44:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9e/e9e71248dd4649fd82e346b6d6c4d67a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TempleDSS"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
