You are given a ship with advanced lasers, go up to an asteroid and click to target it. Watch your ship's lasers destroy the asteroids and acquire minerals! Use these minerals to upgrade your laser turrets.</p>\n<p><em><strong>GAME NOT COMPLETE!</strong></em><br/></p>\n<p>Yes, the game isn't 100% complete and I honestly don't know whether or not I'll finish it. Some of the programming was done with the help of\u00a0OpenAI's ChatGPT. Ship models and skyboxes\u00a0are from the Unity Asset Store and some asteroid models are from NASA's arc 3d resources website (NASA JPL).</p>\n<p>I would love to complete this game, but I'm not sure if I should try the project is a little messy. What I wanted to do was make this have an entire solar system the player could explore and add space pirate and space cops With occasional space cargo transports that roam by. Though I don't have the resources or the time to add those at the moment. Please tell me what you think though, would you play the full version if I were to finish it?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T09:01:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b5/0b5f4d334ec05316d731f376734ae3e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nobull"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
