The game is \n      set in a local pub where the players will settle in to play some of \n      their favorite dart games including 501, Cricket, Around the Clock, \n      Killers, and Baseball. Controls function just like throwing a real dart. \n      Players are able to create their own personal profiles, including \n      selecting their avatar image from a collection of creative characters \n      and the design they would like displayed on the dart flights.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d17/d176268ad6428e90eb9ee4a20f965763.jpg", "website": "http://ww2.bigbluebubble.com/games/pub-darts", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Big Blue Bubble"], "esrb_rating": null}
