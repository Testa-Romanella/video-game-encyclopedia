The goal of the game is to overcome the weaker self by overhauling it, but also by taking small actions that have a positive impact on environmental issues.\u00a0Currently the available actions are restricted to turning off lights, collecting and recycling trash (there are more ideas that will be implemented in the future).\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>I think the idea highlights\u00a0that we need to adapt to the current situation around environmental issues by taking the first step of overcoming our weaker selfes.</em></p>\n<p>What I\u00a0like about the game idea is that the player has to make the decision of overhauling the weaker self or to risk loosing to take another action.</p>\n<p>The current game still has some issues that I couldn't fix on time (as the close ups of the characters in the dialog that are not showing).\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you can enjoy the game nontheless and I am looking forward to your feedback :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T02:57:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e60/e60a005e9880460ba29dcf520806cd88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Leonie Kallabis"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
