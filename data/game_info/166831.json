Be careful, because just five hits to your ship and it's all over. A steady stream of hazards will make it their duty to make things difficult for you.</p><p>Take special care to watch out for the special enemy ships, the Lancer and the Salvo. The Lancers love nothing more than to reel back and charge straight into you, while the Salvos prefer to shoot you from afar with a barrage of missiles.</p>Controls:<p><strong>Movement:</strong><br/></p><ul><ul><li>W - move forward</li><li>A - turn left</li><li>D - turn right</li><li>S - brake</li></ul></ul><p><strong>Shooting:</strong></p><ul><ul><li>Up arrow: fire blaster</li><li>Left arrow: fire spread (moonshot)</li></ul></ul><p><strong>Other:</strong></p><ul><ul><li>P - pause game</li><li>M - mute audio</li></ul></ul>Credits:<p><strong>Developer</strong> - Danny Purdes</p><p><strong>Technical Consultant</strong> - Scott Munro</p><p><strong>Pixel Font Designer</strong> - Chris Early (@chriswearly)</p><p>Made using the Love2D framework (https://love2d.org/wiki/Main_Page)</p>Platforms<p>Available to download for both 64- and 32-bit Windows and Mac</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a0/5a0bea836ce15890fe7b60403450def0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["donnypueblo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
