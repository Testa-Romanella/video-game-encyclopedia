Currently, we have no plans to add English subtitles, since the game was designed and intended to be played by a primarily Hindi speaking\u00a0\u00a0audience and adding English subtitles will disrupt one of our core mechanic. To get an idea of what the gameplay is like, please watch our trailer (which has English subs) linked on this page.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE 2:</strong> Since the game has huge live action video files which cannot be compressed, it's size exceeds the size limit of Itch.io and that is why\u00a0I am not able to upload it here. The downloadable zip folder contains only the design documents and development process documents. If you still want to download and play the game, then contact me.<br/></p>\n<p>THANK YOU!</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Case No. 488 is a FMV Murder Mystery Puzzle Game that I made for IGX (Indian Games Expo) 2018 that was held in Mumbai, India.
