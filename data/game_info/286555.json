LOHAE is a peaceful tree growing simulation game with definitely no secrets.  Taking on the mythological role of a Reaper of Life, you must Choose whether to destroy life, or to destroy using the power of life.<br/><br/>You can also enjoy the demo of the Land of Mists and Trails, an \"Oregon Trail\" like game where you ferry the souls of the dead to their final resting place. <br/><br/>Future lands will include features such as: a tower defender, a word puzzle, a procedural story generator, a walking simulator, and a  city building game.  All will be woven together by a thread of narrative significance, sometimes subtle, gradually growing more and more relevant.<br/><br/>Don't worry about that \"essence\" bullsh**t. Who even cares about it? Not smart Players like you.  The Sleeping Serpent? Never heard of 'em. Must not have made it into this version of the game. You found a flashlight? Weird. Probably doesn't do anything.<br/><br/>Features:<br/><ul><li> Fully Procedural Trees and Fruit Descriptions<br/></li><li> Plant trees.<br/></li><li> Pick fruit.<br/></li><li> Hybridize fruit and trees together.<br/></li><li> ??<br/></li><li>Definitely no secrets.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:49:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a04/a0492287d97191660f91ff27bdb4bab1.jpg", "website": "http://www.farragofiction.com/LOHAEE/landing", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Farrago Fiction"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Farrago Fiction"], "esrb_rating": null}
