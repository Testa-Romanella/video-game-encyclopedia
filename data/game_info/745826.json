Grab a friend, or a complete stranger, and face-off for a heart-pumping, head-thumping good time! <br/><br/>Make 'em sweat! <br/><br/>************************************************************<br/>READ BEFORE YOU PURCHASE EARLY ACCESS<br/>************************************************************<br/>PLEASE read through our materials in the discussions including \"What to Expect From Early Access\". You can also watch our casual walk-through on YouTube with the Dev and remember that this is an EARLY ACCESS game with VERY little solo play content ATM. That will change as we move along, but we want to be up-front and very clear to tentative players. If you are interested in getting in early and helping with feedback about a multiplayer VR boxing game then this is for you! Join our discord and make sure you have some friends to play with as we build a player base! We'd love to have you!<br/><br/>*NOTE THAT OCULUS SUPPORT IS PLANNED BUT NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED* Does it work? Usually (via cabled link). However, our recommendation is that you do NOT purchase Early Access at this time if you intend to play via Oculus. We will change our message here when we officially begin to support Oculus HMDs. <br/>************************************************************<br/><br/>Use the solo training exercises, take on the AI, or jump right into what EOC Boxing was designed to do and challenge your friends to three different match types including exhibition, amateur or professional ranked fights where your reputation, stats, virtual cash, and boxer\u2019s title is on the line. <br/><br/>EOC is a physically demanding game that will push you to improve your cardio and your core. But you'll need some space to add this energetic workout to your routine. Make sure you have at least 1.5m by 2m of unobstructed space to swing and then tell your family members to stand back - WAY back. Or better yet, pick up another headset and challenge them to a no-impact, no-holds-barred grudge match to prove your unconditional supremacy! (separate VR rooms <strong>highly </strong> recommended)<br/><br/>We want to stress that EOC is currently <strong>Early Access</strong> and we are looking for <strong>your </strong> feedback, so if you love boxing and don't mind giving us a glove (er hand), we're all ears about how we can make this game the best that it can possibly be. <br/><br/>What\u2019s coming up in the very near future? We\u2019re glad you asked! Greater player customization, multiple avatars of gender and race, server moderated multiplayer cash, careers, and titles. A large expansion of the single player mode (we started with multiplayer in mind and need some AI polish during Early Access to give you the solo challenge you deserve). We'll be launching a number of AI opponents to make you sweat on your way to the top in upcoming free content upgrades as we move toward completing our Early Access roadmap. You\u2019ll progress through different venues and earn your place in the hall of champions. <br/><br/>EOC Boxing was designed from the ground up to support multiplayer VR and we want to ensure that EOC strives for realism while striking the balance in playability. We trust that Early Access already offers players a stable and challenging multiplayer experience that is above all else, entertaining.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T03:38:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ee/1eeaa44b4e3981a9265966e612c1bda1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 372, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nodtech Creative Industries", "Era of Combat Boxing"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Nodtech Creative Industries"], "esrb_rating": null}
