The action is fast and intense in this explosive<br />\ntale of power and betrayal.</p>\n<p>Features</p>\n<p>\u2022 Epic, six-mission solo campaign<br />\n\u2022 Sharpen your lethal edge<br />\nagainst infamous Bond villains in DS-exclusive Virtual Training mode<br />\n\u2022<br />\nWireless multiplayer mayhem for up to eight players with only one Game<br />\nCard.</p>\n<p>Kicked out of MI6 for excess brutality, your character&#39;s, ahem, unique<br />\nskill set gets him recruited by Auric Goldfinger. A nasty encounter with<br />\nDr. No costs him an eye, but Goldfinger\u2019s technicians replace it with a<br />\ngold-hued, synthetic and upgradeable eye, earning him the name<br />\n&quot;GoldenEye.&quot; Now it\u2019s payback time, Dr. No.</p>\n<p>On your quest for revenge, you&#39;ll encounter such legendary Bond baddies<br />\nas Oddjob, Scaramanga and Xenia Onatopp. GoldenEye: Rogue Agent lets you<br />\nslip into the dark side as a ruthless and unpredictable bad guy with<br />\nlots of big weapons and cool devices. The GoldenEye gadget, an<br />\ninfinitely cool device worthy of Q himself, and the heads-up-display<br />\n(HUD) let you see enemies through cover, hack electronics and weapons,<br />\ndeflect damage, monitor ammo levels, decode locks and more.</p>\n<p>You can wield two weapons at once or go one-on-one with a muscular melee<br />\nfighting system lets you throw and cold-cock enemies, seize hostages and<br />\nmore. Left and right-handed gameplay controls, plus stylus and thumb-pad<br />\nplay, take full advantage of the DS&#39;s unique touch-screen capabilities.</p>\n<p>One of the keys to GoldenEye: Rogue Agent is its array of control<br />\nschemes.
