Neon Valley has reached a point where I would love to bring in players for testing. During this proof of concept phase, I hope you players will find enough enjoyment to share with friends and be central for testing gameplay mechanics and the integrity of my design.</p>\n<p>I wish to tailor-make a competitive online shooter that allows a diverse variety of gameplay styles. Over the next few months I will be designing more weapons and gadgets, testing them one by one with the players. Experimenting with the gameplay feel and a variety of gameplay mechanics at the player's disposal, I hope to over time develop Neon Valley into a place where players can feel bad ass.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/199/1993bec4d7c11092b13f5e20838ac3b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 381, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Melloe"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
