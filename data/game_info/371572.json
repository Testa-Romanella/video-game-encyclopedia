If you get stuck on a level just explore other options. This game was made in 7 days for the community game jam. This is the first game jam that I have ever participated in, and my first real complete game. I had a great time working on this project. I wish everyone good luck. The theme of the game jam was \"the game is a liar\". Feel free to leave feedback in the comment section. If you play the game, please consider leaving a comment, I would love some feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T10:20:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b1/3b1d9ce058f4827e16e7b722316566d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["STEALTH FOX GAMES"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
