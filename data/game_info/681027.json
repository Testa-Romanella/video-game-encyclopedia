The Rewards Shop is empty in this build.)</p>\n<p>This game was originally built as a promotional tool for my family's ice cream shop. All the flavors you can catch are flavors that are available in store. The \"Scoop Tokens\" had real life counterparts that inspired the game. Scoop Tokens were able to be used in our store as currency to purchase a small, one scoop ice cream. The idea for this game was to incentivize players (our customers) to return to the shop with the rewards they earned in game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T06:56:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25d/25d22dc9c0f4ef8607e456163e79b9bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Magaldi Studios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
