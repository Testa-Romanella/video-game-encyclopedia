Seeing as the prompt of the Jam was Duality, we decided to create a bizarre situation where a Doctor would have to decide how to \"treat\" his patients. With inspiration taken from some other games, the title presents different routes to the player, depending on the amount of patients that were saved or... \"treates\" otherwise. Be careful not to go too overboard however, as you might freak out too many patients and lose your game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T11:51:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d1/8d157723b26c3f55aae7904f1ca8250d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Giovanni Damian"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
