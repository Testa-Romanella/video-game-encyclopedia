Tired of bombarding the battleship's main gun? Let's get some high-tech.<br/>\n<br/>\r\ncamp:<br/>\r\nThe Chinese navy that has developed rapidly since the 21st century<br/>\r\nOld but still very deadly Russian Navy<br/>\r\nAnd the unparalleled U.S. Navy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nunit:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach camp has almost all marine equipment from the 1960s, which refers to the first three decades of the 21st century.<br/>\r\nThey include:<br/>\r\nAircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, frigates, conventional submarines and nuclear submarines.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe aircraft carrier is equipped with the main fighters and attack aircraft of various countries including F / A-18, F14, F35, Su 33, and J-15.<br/>\r\nThere are also various types of helicopters, early warning aircraft, anti-submarine aircraft, electronic warfare aircraft<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn order to be able to restore a modernized combat equipment, we have unique uses and have an irreplaceable role in combat.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nset up:<br/>\r\nThe game has many settings to restore realistic naval battles.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach unit has its radar reflection cross-sectional area. Fighters like the F35 can only get close enough to be detected by enemy radar.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe range of the missile is a dynamic concept. If the target aircraft flies head-on without changing course, the missile's hit rate is high. But if the target makes an S-shaped maneuver or turns around to escape. Then the missile is likely to be thrown away. To this end, we will enable players to set the launch logic of each missile on each ship to achieve the best defense effect based on the situation at sea.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nElectronic warfare aircraft can interfere with the detection range of enemy radars, and can even launch anti-radiation missiles to eliminate enemy units with radar turned on.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn addition, each ship has its own noise figure, and even when sailing at different speeds, the noise will be different. If you do not grasp it well, it will be discovered by the enemy's initiative or passive sonar. Yes, sonar is also divided into active and passive. The active sonar detection capability is stronger than the passive sonar, but if it is used indiscriminately, it will definitely expose its position.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCustom AI:<br/>\r\nWe will also release custom AI functions that allow players to design their own computer behaviors.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-09T21:48:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/140/140982c215987fa5add605ea27fcdba0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AWACS"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["B1 GAME", "\u7535\u94ae\u7ec4"], "esrb_rating": null}
