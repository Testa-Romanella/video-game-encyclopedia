I hope you will enjoy it, if it gets a huge amount of support, I might develope a complete game out of this. It was originally created for the \"GameswithJam 2\" with the topic \"Space\". This project was just possible with the help of many free and payed graphics, which are all licensed under CC0 or legally bought, for more information please look into the credits. If i decide to develope this game further, the next step would be Google Play, Mac, IOS and Linux versions as well as a huge amount of new content. Enjoy the game and have fun! </p>\n<p><em><strong>Edit</strong>: New added Android Version: This is more like a test, i really don`t know how well it works. Please give feedback, so i`m able to make it better than it is right now. Have fun with it anyways, as far as it`s possible right now!</em> <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40c/40c769b64f8f67a8abe2d5a23c4d89b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Devilopergames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
