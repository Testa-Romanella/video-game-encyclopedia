You have two seconds to choose an option that you think will beat their option. Winning a round gets you a point, and choosing a losing option or not choosing before the timer runs out gives the enemy one point. The first competitor to gain 3 points wins the level. The options presented get weirder and weirder, showing some weird mixtures of interactions and results.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button - Select options/buttons.</p>\n<p>Escape - Closes application.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T10:39:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/caa/caa009ebd91b4385bbfe6a78a3584b22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MicaiahArts", "Mochithealchemest", "Pillbird"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
