But be careful : time paradoxes could happen !</p><p>You basically are a cube that can move. The world is also made of cubes, which have different features. Your goal is to reach a certain cube in the map.</p><p>But, to reach the end of the level, you will have to go back in time. This permits you to climb onto the \"you of the past\", or to do a kinda coop with... yourself.</p><p>As QuantumSquared is a tiny little game, it is realeased under the GNU GPLv3 license, which means that you can edit and republish the game, but only if you redistribute it under the GNU GPLv3 license too.</p><p>You can either create new maps, or edit the source code - that's up to you !</p><p>(DevKit is for Unreal Engine 4.9 - should work with newer versions of the engine)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc1/dc17059584d1d6f68f7ebaf28cf412d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Evols"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
