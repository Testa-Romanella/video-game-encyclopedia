Immerse yourself in her role as you try your best to clear all the trays before your shift is up!<br/></p>\n<p>We were inspired by the hard work that is done to keep our hawker centers clean, often by elderly people.\u00a0 The game aims to provide meaningful challenge by having players return trays under a time crunch and ensure they place them in the right tray return areas.\u00a0We wanted to give player agency to an elderly character, and put the player in the shoes of someone who has to clean up our everyday messes.</p>\n<p>Please play with sound. We did our own foley work on the sound effects and we hope you enjoy the bustling soundscape of a hawker centre.</p><p>Background sounds sampled from:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dancing Bacon</p>\n<p>Incompetech</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T06:37:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/449/4499091c77c55f70a6db709e7fa0b4bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jirehcwe", "anothernoodle"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
