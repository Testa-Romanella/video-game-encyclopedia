It is a 2D pixel style platformer.</p>\n<p>There are some bugs, and the second level is particularly broken, but I think in comparison to my last game, it's definitely a step up. And of course I am learning and getting better, as well as implementing new elements into my games, such as animations.\u00a0 For my next project I think I'm gonna go to 3D, and I want to focus on polish, and maintaining a better work ethic.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for viewing my game, and I hope you enjoy it!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T04:12:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/609/609f6c0a808e6c668a51fc6aa5763ade.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["joomis"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
