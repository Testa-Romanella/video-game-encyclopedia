In the spirit of \n      the Montessori method of teaching, students are encouraged to learn by \n      teaching themselves and at their own pace. Through enjoyable, \n      easy-to-follow in-game lessons and fun mini-games, players will be able \n      to develop their understanding of music by learning how to read and play \n      it. Hands-on activities help to reinforce more than 20 musical lessons. \n      Users of this educational software can learn, train, practice and \n      develop their musical aptitude on the DS at their own pace.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/113/113f12a1a817ea5430770e25defed6ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": ["Nobilis"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["South Peak Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
