However, as more and more tear their way closer to our realm, not everything can be saved. But, with all the\u00a0power you can muster, will you be able to save your home?</p>\n<p>=========================================</p>\n<p>All right, with story out of the way, RiftWorld is an rpg-adventure game with multiple endings. It is made by Dragon Studios (me), and has many different aspects due to these rifts being unpredictable. You might find yourself in an entirely new game with some of them!</p>\n\n<p>The current\u00a0Demo (V.4.0) consists of a small world to\u00a0explore and other things such as an arcade minigame to keep you busy and enjoying things while the main story is developed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T06:26:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/938/938285d9735ffacd3d3d621a46907ecd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crumble"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
