Look no further, you have found it.<br/><br/>You can select from 6 iconic Nissan cars, and build your ultimate drift missile. You can tune the engine, modify the whole suspension set up, front camber, rear camber, offset, ride height. You can also do weight reduction which you can do for really cheap and experience that power is not everything, and how much easier you can handle your car after dropping some weight from it.<br/><br/>Once your car is ready to put down some power on the ground, you can make your ride unique, with a wide variety of rims, custom paint jobs on both the car and wheels.<br/><br/>I know that for us drifters it is important to be in the most possible control of the car, that's why I implemented a manual transmission, so you can decide for yourself how much torque you want to send to the wheels.<br/><br/>You also have 3 types of controls, the classics button style, tilt and steering wheel controls. If you select the steering wheel controls don't forget to try out the cockpit view, because it totally feels like you are touching the steering wheel to turn. Give it a try, you might like it.<br/><br/>Here is a list of the available iconic Nissan cars, which you can build a drift monster out of:<br/><br/>-Datsun 510<br/>-Fairlady Z 432<br/>-GT-R R35<br/>-Silvia S15<br/>-Skyline GT-R V-Spec R33<br/>-Skyline GT-R V-Spec 2 R34<br/><br/>ENGINE SOUNDS<br/><br/>Real engine sounds! I am using a completely new sound engine, and the car sounds have been recorded from real cars, both exterior and interior engine sound.<br/><br/>CUSTOMIZE<br/><br/>Paint your car to your liking, select its color, reflection, and metallic color. You can also select from a huge collection of rims and they can be painted to your liking too.<br/><br/>MODIFY<br/><br/>You can get 3 stages of weight reduction with the final stage you also get a roll cage.<br/><br/>TUNE<br/><br/>Engine tuning is available in 3 stages too. In the first stage, some minor modifications come into play, stage 2 is a bit more aggressive, you also get some exhaust flame and pops, and with stage 3 your car gets turbocharged, if the car isn't already, if it is a turbocharged car to start with, then there is no such thing as too big turbo, so it gets a bigger one and we are turning the boost up. You get some turbo spool and blow off sound so it's beginning to sound a lot like a racecar. All the stages become a lot more aggressive with the increase in stages.<br/><br/>TRACKS<br/><br/>You can drift on 6 different tracks. The first track is a drift arena, and the other tracks are more circuit like tracks.<br/><br/>WEATHER<br/><br/>Random weather conditions occur on every track, and you can also drift at night on every track.<br/><br/>COCKPIT VIEW<br/><br/>You can drive every single car from the first person view and witness the highly detailed cluster, which illuminates if you drift at night.<br/><br/>DYNAMIC SYSTEMS<br/><br/>The dynamic tire smoke is still being used like in previous games with the company of dynamic brake disc glow.<br/><br/>We need your constant support to get going.
