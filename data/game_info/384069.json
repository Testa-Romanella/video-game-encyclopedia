In those times Marvila suffered great poverty and many houses didn't even have running water, which made people use public fountains and rivers to take showers. The Portuguese Police weren't very fond of this. If people got caught taking public showers they would be fined an extreme amount.</p>\n<p>This game was developed during the BiblioGamers Game Jam 2019 and it hasn't been updated since. The original plan was to have 3 distinct levels: One in the river, one in the city and one close to the player's home. Unfortunately, we were only able to make the first level (which we shuffled a bit to create 2 more levels). The original second level exists as a prototype with no art or animation.</p>\n<p>The game is free to download.</p>\n\n\n<p>Team:</p>\n<p>Arman Haeri (Programming)</p>\n<p>Diogo Louren\u00e7o (Game Design + Prototypes)</p>\n<p>Margarida Coelho (2D Art + Animation + UI)</p>\n<p>Roberto Medina (Sound + Music)</p>\n<p>Simone Lackner (Sound + Music)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-18T05:24:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ca/8caf89948d1279dcce025943aacdce79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Diogo Louren\u00e7o"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
