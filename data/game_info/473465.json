While everyone seems pretty normal in this world, you arent't: you can extract the souls of dead bodies to unleash extraordinary powers which allows you to take the advantage in combat, while your weapons are doing the rest.</p>\n<p>Use the multiple combinations of souls to create power and progress in the buildings, shoot every enemy that cross your way, and show them that with you, the number of enemy doesn't matter...</p>\n<p>This game was made during the Kindred Community Jam #3, which lasted a week. I made the game alone, except for some sounds that I took on ZapSlat. Feel free to test it, and don't hesitate to tell what you think about it!</p><p>WARNING: A few guys told me that they had Input Lag in the game. I do not have the problem on my side, but be aware that this problem may occur.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T06:12:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecf/ecfff88aea7e3c9d464fbf0c386a1075.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jules Rouault"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
