{"id": 185856, "slug": "the-old-bard", "name": "The Old Bard", "name_original": "The Old Bard", "description": "<p>Back in ancient times, before the deluge drank the old world, there was a bard who took it upon himself to improve the lives of the people using the power of his music. Going from town to town he would sing to deliver unto the townsfolk the inspiring message they needed to improve their own lives. In return, the bard grew younger empowered by the newly born happiness of the people who listened. Step in and put on your bard shoes, it is time for you to change the world! You\u2019re now entering the town of Furwick, a very sad-looking place. As the bard, it is your task to find out what\u2019s making these people miserable and pick an appropriate song to bring happiness to the local townsfolk. If you succeed in transmitting the appropriate message you\u2019ll grow younger and can continue on your journey. If you fail, however, you\u2019ll grow older and risk reaching the end of your life.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ae/4ae0721777fe6549b6021fac63ad2bc7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["J-riple"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
