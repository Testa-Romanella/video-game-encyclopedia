It is foremost a grand strategy game, with 4X elements, but also character and House management. We call it a 5X \u2013 the 5th \u2018X\u2019 being \u2018eXist\u2019. You are a character in AotSS, and if you die, the game ends\u2026 so tread lightly, your Majesty!<br/><br/>Main Features:<br/><ul><li>Top \u2013 level management \u2013 you have Action Points that are finite and vary from turn to turn. You can do anything, but you can\u2019t do everything<br/></li><li>You are the Emperor \u2013 you are a character in a game that has hundreds that you will interact with. If you die, or are deposed, the game is over<br/></li><li>Multiple layers of strategy \u2013 from a traditional 4X-type (exploring and scanning new systems, colonizing planets, establishing outposts, building militaries and trade) upwards to developing your Great House and managing the other Houses that all have specialties that you can only take advantage of if you are on friendly terms with them, to discovering and reaching out to other breakaway human civilizations, to your ultimate goal of uniting the Celestial Empire against a final attack by humanities\u2019 oldest enemy, the Xyl<br/></li><li>Maintain your Power - Everything you do in the game is dependent on your Power. You can quickly gain Power with a firm military hand and suppressing your people - but beware the repercussions should your hold on Power falter! But let your Power drop too low, and you will become a Figurehead, powerless to save humanity...<br/></li><li>Deep Intelligence System - Train and recruit powerful Inquisitor Squads to do professional intel gathering on characters, or recruit Informers to spy for you. Set up Special Ops to take out characters, planets.. even whole systems! Change the political landscape with one well-placed blackmail operation or even assassination!<br/></li><li>Dynamic character relationship model \u2013 you can affect your relationships with Actions that you can take against characters, from giving a speech to challenging them to having them executed. Of course, they have relationships with others in the game too, so consider the knock-on effects of anything you do\u2026<br/></li><li>Great and Minor Houses \u2013 Houses limit what you can do as Emperor. Houses own territory, armies, etc. and if you piss them off, they may even try to usurp the Empire. Build alliances to allow characters with special talents and traditions to develop the Empire the way you want. For example, if you want a strong economy, you need good miners to ensure your factories run at full capacity, so you\u2019ll want House Ilioaia (who has a strong mining tradition) on your side so you can appoint their members as viceroys of high-mineral planets\u2026 and so on<br/></li><li>Don\u2019t micromanage, create a Project! Unlike traditional 4X games, you don\u2019t make build queues, you create Projects to get things done, from colonizing a planet to throwing a celebration to upgrading a logistical region. You must assign an Adminstrator who gains power and influence from this post, and determines how smoothly your project will go! Assigning characters to Projects is a great way for them to earn power and influence\u2026 but take care that they do not gain too much, especially if they are of a House that hates you\u2026</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T04:40:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d42/d428c23a3737380de9b8528b30d8ebf7.jpg", "website": "http://www.allianceofthesacredsuns.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 412, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["KatHawk Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Hooded Horse", "KatHawk Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
