{"id": 504032, "slug": "echo-anomaly", "name": "Echo Anomaly", "name_original": "Echo Anomaly", "description": "<p>Your tribe has sent you on an investigation to a Colony base of operations that suddenly went inactive. Venture into the base to see what lies inside...</p>\n<p>Echo Anomaly is a puzzle platformer set on Titan\u00a0created for the Ludum Dare 47 Jam with the theme 'Stuck In A Loop'!  The game can be run in HTML in browser, but due to some audio issues and a few other bugs I would recommend downloading and running the Windows executable to get the full experience.</p>\n<p>The game is shorter than I would have liked it to be but that's just how game jams go. There are things I would have liked to add and things I didn't finish, but all in all I'm super proud of it as my first ever Ludum Dare entry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All programming and art was done by me, all of the awesome\u00a0Music and Sound effects were done by Chipper. Links to his stuff:\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://chipper1.bandcamp.com/</p>\n<p>https://soundcloud.com/5c0rg3</p>\n\n<p>How to play -</p>\n<p>Whenever you interact with an \"affected\"\u00a0object, after a certain period of time (a beeping audio indicator will let you know how close the timer is to finishing) that object will become stuck looping back and forth. It is no longer affected by physics, but will affect other objects, including yourself! There are 3 puzzles, the last one was a bit rushed and is not super well thought out but it is solvable. Have fun playing and please rate the game on ldjam.com!</p>\n<p>https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/echo-anomaly<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T09:54:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67d/67d2e8fce67026b2cc9aa0b5722242e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Fonics"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
