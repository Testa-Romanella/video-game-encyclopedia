For some reason you can't rewind the video, and as soon as you try winding it forward you find yourself in the Backrooms. Figure out whats in the footage and try to ESCAPE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE! <br/><br/>There are multiple levels and it seems impossible to escape, but dont give up! You have to get out of here!</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>Linear space in Level 0 is altered drastically; it is possible to walk in a straight line, return to the starting point, and end up in a completely different set of rooms than the ones previously passed through. Due to this phenomenon, and the visual similarity between each room, consistent navigation of Level 0 has proven very difficult. Devices such as GPS locators and compasses fail to function within the level, and radio communications are audibly distorted and often prove unreliable.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\"If you're not careful and noclip out of reality in the wrong areas, you'll end up in the Backrooms, where it's nothing but the stink of old moist carpet, the madness of mono-yellow, the endless background noise of fluorescent lights at maximum hum-buzz, and approximately six hundred million square miles of randomly segmented empty rooms to be trapped in.<br/><br/><strong>God save you if you hear something wandering around nearby, because it sure as hell has heard you.\"</strong><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T05:09:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8bc/8bc5d22e4c2d82a01d3e6b2a98310927.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Untold Backrooms Stories"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Untold Backrooms Stories"], "esrb_rating": null}
