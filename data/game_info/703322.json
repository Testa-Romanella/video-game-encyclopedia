I spent almost a whole week working on this ( the other\u00a03 weeks just procrastinating)\u00a0. I still love it though it's a bit cranky.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>I got the idea from watching this cool youtube video :\u00a0 (I know I know, the video's graphics are much better than my silly game. lol)</p>\n<p>And I just learned Unity by following this video:\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>I feel excited starting the game making journey. I don't know where it will lead me, but I do hope you guys like my game. If not, please leave comments and let me know. I will definitely try to make it better.</p>\n<p>Github page:https://github.com/2balancesgames/ProProBiotics</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T08:49:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/793/7930179ed2f202124ea2051369e83df6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["2balances"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
