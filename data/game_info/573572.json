The philosopher argued that, however much a tick moment lasts for, however longer it is as compared to a human moment, it is unlikely that they can just wait for such a long time like that.</p>\n<p>Therefore, he assumed that ticks must lie dormant for years, in the same way in which we sleep for hours, until a signal wakes them up. The signal that it's time to feed.</p>\n\r\n\u201cThe crucial point in this understanding of the metaphysical relevance of interactive digital media content is that it prompts humans to apply their cognitive and perceptual equipment as well as their subjectivity to a context that could not be encountered in their ordinary life\u201d (Gualeni, 2011, p.5, cited in Backe, 2017, p. 42).\r\n\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>Backe, H.
