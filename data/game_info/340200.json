{"id": 340200, "slug": "super-collector", "name": "Super Collector", "name_original": "Super Collector", "description": "<p>Super Collector is a side stroller (2.5D) platform game, it is based on action-adventure in 2.5D environment. The aim is to collect the keys and reach his house. I have played many games and inspired by a few games. In my Super Collector, I have referred Mario (Nintendo, 1981) which I used to play and I used to love while playing it, it used to be such a refreshment. I have chosen the jumping mechanic and collecting coin mechanics by Mario. Mario is a fractional character game which has 2D platform</p>\n\n<p>The second mechanic which is grapple hook I haven grab from the game Batman:Arkham Asylum (Eidos Interactive, 2008) and Just Cause 2 (Avalanche Studios, 2010).If I will talk about Just cause 2,so it is an open world action-adventure video game, and Batman:Arkham Asylum is also an action-adventure video game. I have mixed all the mechanics and created Super Collector.</p>\n\n<p>In this game, Player has to reach the house, But he has to face lots of obstacles to reach his destination. Player has to jump, Player has to save himself by the many enemies like ant, monster. Because once if the player will get in touch with the enemies player can lose twenty percent of their health which will be showing in the bottom of the screen, if health will be finished, the game gets over. There few moving balls,ants and a monster. The player can use grapple hook by pressing \u201cH\u201d to climb directly on the platform.</p>\n<p>\r\nNow aim of the Arav(Character Model) is to collect all the keys and escape from the enemies.</p>\n\n<p>Once the player will collect all the keys, the player will win else player has to go back and collect all the remaining keys. As soon as the player will get in touch with the enemies player will get burn. Player will get the information all over the game with the help of the trigger box which is available every desired place.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-12T03:15:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a1/4a1172bc930d82f71966fb69714d6995.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ashishvastav"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
