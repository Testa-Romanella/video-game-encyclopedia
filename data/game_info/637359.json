I've been trying to learn Javascript and this is the first project of mine that I've ever written entirely on my own without an engine. It's very simple but writing all the HTML / CSS / Javascript by hand\u00a0was so much for my goblin brain. My brain is now scrampled egg.</p>\n<p>I'm sorry in advance if you find any glitches or anything like that! Please let me know if you do and I'll try to fix them when I can.</p>\n<p>Also, there are like three different trans flag scarves and it's 100%\u00a0my fault for adding all three on accident instead of picking one. I have one brain cell. I decided against changing that, however, and I'm just keeping it now.</p>\n\n<p>Art and programming by me!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fonts used in the game are\u00a0Cute Written\u00a0and Arrows!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T14:36:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c22/c2248a43adb188eb4a76acfeaedc9329.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MayhemCats"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
