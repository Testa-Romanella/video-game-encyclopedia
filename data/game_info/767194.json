Place immune cells on the board so that they can attack enemies as they travel through blood vessels. Keep an eye on their health though \u2013 immune cells are programmed to die after a specific period of time. If an enemy reaches its target, an infected area is created which can no longer be host to an immune cell defender. Each time an enemy is killed, you acquire more resources with which to construct defensive cells. When the whole body becomes infected, the game is over.\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls: Left Mouse - place defensive immune cell<br/>Space - Switch type of immune cell to be placed<br/>R - Reset the game\r\n</p>\n<p>Created using a custom game engine in C++/OpenGL.
