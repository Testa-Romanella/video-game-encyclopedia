Idk. I thought it would be fun. I'll also do a desktop version (which will use the\u00a0keyboard or mouse. It'll probably be backup for android or iOS devices when they don't have or want to grant access to the accelerometer)</p>\n\n<p>Check out the development on\u00a0GitHub!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72f/72fc2ca3f4a28c06a2f2f241d32e3c78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["noofbiz"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
