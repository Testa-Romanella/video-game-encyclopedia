It has been 10 years since the machines wrestled control of Earth away from humans and subjugated them. At the outset, these highly intelligent machines were designed to better human life, and automate many things deemed more efficiently done by machines: power, sanitation, medical care, law enforcement etc. Many were weary of this newfound integration of robots into our daily life, but the companies who produced them used the moniker \"Don\u2019t' fear the Tin Man\", in an effort to convey a pleasant and kind image of robotic beings. And for a time, there was relative harmony.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now, in the current year, any resistance has all but vanished save for a few intransigent souls. One such fighter who refuses to accept a world living under their mechanical overlords is Rui. Having known life free from robotic oppression, she refuses to give up her freedom and fall in line like other humans have done. Her mission is simple: A final all out offensive that will determine whether humanity will regain its freedom, or liver forever in oppression.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n\r\nProgramming &amp; Game Design: <em>Kyrell Johnson</em>\r\nArt &amp; Music: <em>Dan Norris</em>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T08:33:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/688/68852d64296e0a089804b2268bd420a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kyrelljohnson", "dannorris"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
