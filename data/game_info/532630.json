Clear the garden to return home!</p>\n<p>Hoes Woes is a small, silly game made for a university project. It's a kind of a uhh... Twin stick shooter/extreme gardening/cleaning simulator. There are bees. There's a hosepipe. You wash bees.</p>\n<p>The aim of the game is to clear at least 70% of the purple stuff from the garden, then return home. Procedurally generated levels generally create 4 paths that branch out from the centre. Clear a path and use your hose trail\u00a0wisely to avoid getting lost. Snails and bees will leave trails all over areas you've already cleaned unless you wash them off and restore them to normal size. There are upgrades at the end of every path that will increase your hose power.</p>\n<p>The game probably needs a dedicated gpu to run properly.</p>\n<p><em>*Note - This is a solo, student game made with a deadline.*</em></p>\n<p><em>There may be bugs, quirks, compatibility issues or all of the above.</em></p>\n<p><em>It is lacking some basic features such as:</em></p>\n<ul><li><em>Window and resolution options</em></li><li><em>Input options</em></li><li><em>Quality options</em></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T04:39:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f38/f384dcd166d26797b092b368c6f1729f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["duriavenator"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
