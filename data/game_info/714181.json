In three rooms of an old castle a little hero fights his way against ghosts, pumpkins and a nasty bat.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Collect treasures and new weapons by destroying the candles on the walls.</p>\n<p>To play through the prototype you need just 2 minutes. It's more for testing the possibilities of Chris Maltby's GB Studio 2 and maybe even to inspire interested people to try a project with the mechanics of Castlevania using the engine themselves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you want to know how I made the prototype, feel free to check out my YouTube channel:</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAqti9ffZvBAzmsLFPHjF_w</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Movement: <em>[directional pad] - [W, A, S, D]</em></p>\n<p>Attack: <em>[A] - [J]\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Jump: <em>[B] - [K]</em></p>\n<p>Change weapons: [Select] - [Shift]</p>\n\n<p>Have fun!</p>\n\n<p>PS: Feel free to post your score in the comments and share your thoughts on the prototype.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T12:38:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/296/296ef1034ceac44dfae43033dd78d41b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hellfansing"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
