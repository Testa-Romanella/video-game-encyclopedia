Pack 8 friends on a couch and get ready to experience true chaos. Free-for-all matches now support up to 6 players, and team matches are playable with a full 8 archers at once! Every Versus level in the original game, including all the Dark World stages, are included, adapted to widescreen to fit all the absurd action.</p><p><strong>This is not an expansion for TowerFall, but a stand-alone game. This package does not contain the core TowerFall experience. This is an official mod for TowerFall that only includes Versus mode, and is heavily modified specifically for 5-8 player matches. It is also still possible to play with 2-4 players on the new levels.</strong></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The keyboard is supported for 1 player, but controllers are required! TowerFall supports many varieties of controller, including XBox 360 and PS4. Because this game requires so many controllers at once, we recommend using a USB hub and making sure all your controllers are connected before launching the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:26:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ed/9ed852578dea5f37f6099756def8b1de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 308, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Matt Makes Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
