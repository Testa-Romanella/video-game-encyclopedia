The player works as a router to manage data through the network as the game presents the elements of network communication systems through a narrative driven gameplay. A robot dog named FETCH is your guide in the game as you work to foil Dr. Error\u2019s evil plans to disrupt the network. <br/></p>\n<p>Project created as a part of PoNG Center 2021 Summer Internship in partnership with\u00a0Center for Wireless Communications.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Programmer</em>\u00a0: Chris Welter<br/><em>Proj.\u00a0Manager</em>\u00a0: David Frieder<br/><em>Artist</em>\u00a0: Duye Liu<br/><em>Tester</em>\u00a0: \u00a0Nathan Hunter<br/><em>Designer</em>\u00a0: Tyler Garraffa<br/><em>Coach</em>\u00a0: Nate Miner<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T04:39:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e9/9e921840c90585daf9ac428df8c57793.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PoNG Center"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
