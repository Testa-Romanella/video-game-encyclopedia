Imagine you are impatiently waiting for pizza you ordered and need some distraction. This is it !  <br/></li><li> Have you ever played old vertically scrolling shoot 'em ups but wanted<br/>more? Then River Rush is a game for you.  <br/></li><li> It's easy to start playing and easy to get to the next checkpoint (about 15 minutes).<br/></li><li> An improved version of oldschool SHMUP games , like River Raid, 1940, Harrier Attack, Galaga etc.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></li><li> Survive by evading or destroying enemies. <br/></li><li> Keep an eye on fuel and avoid terrain that is not river.<br/></li><li> Your weapons for terminating enemies are laser bullets (like form old GI Joe and Transformers cartoons) plus rockets. <br/></li><li> Rockets are fired with delay of 0.4 sec so you have to think ahead when to use them.<br/><br/><br/><br/></li><li> It has challenging gameplay, if you don't think ahead you'll get into mayhem from which it won't be easy to get out.<br/></li><li> Enhanced pixel art experience from the 80es.<br/></li><li> 13 types of enemies. Each needing a different approach.<br/></li><li> No need for mouse, just keyboard.<br/></li><li> Local leader board (like on old arcade machines, one per one PC).<br/></li><li> Relive your youth. Or see what dad used to play :)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T05:51:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6c/a6cffd9e2fab8e7ba41a53fe9f4e5b23.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["2nd best games"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["2nd Best Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
