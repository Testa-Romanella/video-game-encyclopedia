The player is contacted with by another astronaut that warns the player that they have to find a way to find a way off the ship which will cause it to self-destruct. You set out on your mission.</p>\n<p>Upon coming to, you find yourself in a suit and with a pair of gloves that manipulate the in-game objects. The environment around you is made out of blocks that can be moved in a specific way based on their colors. Some blocks are made to be extended or retracted, some are used as a trampoline, while others can rotate some parts of the walls upon interaction. </p>\n<p>As the game progresses, the puzzles get harder and harder. In some cases, the players have to remember the setup of the blocks in the room as the only visible blocks in the room are the colored ones.</p>", "metacritic": 69, "released": "2011-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-15T09:34:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b0/9b0814a634a54001aefa0ec6bbddd79e.jpg", "website": "http://qube-game.com/", "rating": 3.47, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 55, "owned": 684, "beaten": 67, "toplay": 14, "dropped": 25}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 52, "ratings_count": 88, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 90, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Toxic Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Toxic Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
