Craft new weapons, upgrade your fighter and build an ultimate aerial war machine!<br/><br/><br/>After the fifth world war, there was peace in the world. For over a decade, the Grand Alliance has been leading humanity towards a better tomorrow by stifling all dangers in the bud. For some time, however, there is suspicion of a new threat that cannot be ignored. <br/><br/>As a member of SAF forces, your mission is to take over the Shielton base, captured by unknown rebels. No one knows who they are and what they want. What's worse, even IMC forces couldn't drive them away from the base because of their advanced weaponry. Weaponry out of this world. But... are those rebels the main threat? Isn't there anything bigger behind all this? No time for questions! You must stop them at all costs!<br/><br/><br/>Gameplay mechanics are very simple - destroy all enemies and try to avoid every bullet... well, at least those which can be avoided. Your special maneuver allows you to dodge normal projectiles. Even if you get hit, you will only lose one extra weapon! However, watch out for powerful bosses! They can thorn you into pieces with their ultimate unavoidable attacks!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-20T03:07:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0d/b0d71d92449238a4e426a5c1e6fc9881.jpg", "website": "https://www.thegameplanet.pl/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Korgorus"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["G-DEVS.com", "GamePlanet"], "esrb_rating": null}
