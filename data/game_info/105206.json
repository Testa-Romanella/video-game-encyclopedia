All around you are a series of innocuous events to look at - a bearded man stretching, shirtless, a cute puppy, a loving couple, a minor car accident, a failed pick-up attempt. Whatever your gaze lingers on longest, you will dream about! What follows is a series of increasingly surreal scenes based around distortions of the things you witnessed in the park. The loving couple ends up becoming your parents in a series of bizarre vignettes where you, as the camera, are a baby. The shirtless man sweeps you off your feet and beds you. If dreams are the gateway to the soul, prepare to be LAID BARE.</p><p>We got the prompt:</p><p>\"A game where you have to do specific things during the day to have the coolest dream or nightmare at night.\"</p><p>So we took it as an excuse to film a bunch of increasingly surreal dream sequences! Bust out your Oculus Rift headset and STRAP IN! (Now supporting regular mouse control too!!!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ccf/ccfc313213575d7cecca5a213a483185.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["superdeath"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
