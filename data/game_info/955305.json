The levels will determine if the robots will be able to use the new gadget of the company : the scaling pistol.

The robot can decide on which axis the element will be scaled, either x, y or z. For example on the axis for the height, it will be scaled to grow upward and downward at the same time. </p>\n<p>The player will have to scale what is surrounding him to his advantage in order to exit from each room. Every mechanic will be discovered by the player through each level and he/she will have to work on a certain axis to begin to understand the basics. Once the player will have discovered different axes, the levels will combine them to complexify the puzzles.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T14:17:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20e/20e841ab52328cb43ddd369cbfb6abbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my Joly", "Meleine DION", "Pierre Trigon"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
