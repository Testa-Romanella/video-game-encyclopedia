Music by Beatscribe.</p>\n<p>(Story is just a rough idea for now)</p>\n\n<p>In the year 2050, Earth's resources were depleted and the planet was on the brink of collapse. In a last ditch effort to save humanity, a secret government organization began a search for an advanced spaceship that could withstand the harsh conditions of deep space.</p>\n<p>During a routine exploration mission to a distant galaxy, humanity stumbled upon an abandoned alien planet, Homorix. The planet was home to a technologically advanced alien civilization, long since extinct. The human explorers discovered a prototype spaceship, unlike anything they had ever seen before. They named this prototype spaceship \"Nemesis\"</p>\n<p>The spaceship was equipped with state-of-the-art weapons and technology, including a powerful plasma cannon and a cloaking device that allows it to become invisible to enemy radar. The ship's advanced shielding system gives it an extra layer of protection in battle, but it's not invincible.</p>\n<p>As humanity's last hope, the Nemesis was sent to the planet Zorix in search of new resources. However, Zorix was still inhabited by a hostile alien race. These aliens, seeing the human colony as a threat, attacked and captured most of the colony's inhabitants.</p>\n<p>As the only survivor of the initial attack and the only pilot of the Nemesis, you are humanity's last hope. Your objective is to fight the alien armadas and rescue the captured colony members.</p>\n<p>You engage in intense 2D shoot-em-up action, piloting the Nemesis through narrow passages, dodging enemy fire and using the ship's advanced weapons to fight back.</p>\n<p>With each alien ship destroyed, you get closer to rescuing the captured colony members. But be aware, the aliens will not go down without a fight and as you progress, they will send their most advanced ships to stop you.</p>\n<p>As you pilot the Nemesis, you'll face a variety of challenges and obstacles, but with each victory, you inch closer to save humanity's colony on Zorix from certain doom. Will you emerge victorious and secure a new future for mankind? Only time will tell in this action-packed Gameboy adventure.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T19:01:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab2/ab267181df640810ab7ef5848a2add5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fire duck"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
