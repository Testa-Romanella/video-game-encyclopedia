The strapping youth in a coming-of-age story; the lowly urchin who rises to greatness; the unsavoury rogue who steals their destiny.</p><p>This is not one of those legends.</p><p>Have you ever wondered about the little people that wanderers meet along the way? You know, the sort who provide background colour to a given location. Maybe they had helpful advise or sold an item to you.</p><p>This is not their story, either, but all will have a part to play.</p><p>* * * * *</p><p>Some notes about this game. In order to make the deadline for the game jam that this was created to take part in, approximately two-thirds of the content was removed. What is left is a coherent package and playable from start to finish with an ending sequence and credits. However, a lot of time and energy went into making sure that what remained slide into place and that the story, though not ending as planned, can still be enjoyed.</p><p>I spent a lot of time on flavour text to help make up for the fact that the actual meat of the story has been leaned down considerably. This is also my first fully completed project in RPG Maker and my first proper game ever. Apologies for the liberal use of vanilla tilesets, I tried to make my own character sprites and faces to match but ultimately still wound up using a couple stock ones to fill in the gaps when time ran out.</p><p>This is totally free and there's <strong>no obligation whatsoever</strong> to pay me anything. I simply have the option there in case someone wanted to leave a tip. Stranger things have happened.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c26/c2661b42f8951e6df4f856fd3d5fa75f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hiroshi Mishima"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
