Band your Hearts together and protect the world from the aliens by harvesting artichoke HEARTS from the farms WE SHARE and creating missile defense systems to shoot down incoming UFOs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you run out of space, start building up - your towers can build on top of each other. BUT BE CAREFUL because destroying supporting towers will destroy the structures above them as well. In this way, they are SHARING THEIR HEARTS. Also, if your artichoke farm burns, the structures above them will also burn (duh).\u00a0 Artichoke farms don\u2019t grow on trees (or other), so keep them on the ground.\r\n</p>\n<p>BUT BE CAREFUL to avoid global warming killing you first (which is shown by the sky turning redder)! Creating machinery contributes to global warming, which could make your artichoke farms burn. When you have money, build carbon capture devices and solar panels to reduce the effects of global warming and get sustainable energy.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The future is in your hands!</p>\n<p>Members</p>\n<ul><li>Eric Breyer</li><li>Luke Mason</li><li>Arnold Venter</li></ul>\n<p>Tools Used</p>\n<ul><li>Unity</li><li>Procreate</li><li>Musescore</li><li>GitHub</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T06:01:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cc/9cc07fa877295aeaafd11dc558f06a17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wild_Mortimer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
