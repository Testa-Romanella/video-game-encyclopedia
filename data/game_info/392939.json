Exploding a star tile will charge all adjacent tiles by 1. Chaining exploding tiles will increase the multiplier as well.</li><li>Play continues until all tiles have been placed -- sunrise!</li></ol>\n<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Every charged star is worth 1 point.</li><li>Every exploded tile is worth the number of stars on it x the current multiplier.</li></ul><p><strong>Source Code</strong></p><p>Added it as an option. You can do whatever you want with it (along with the assets). I do only have licenses for the fonts used for myself, however, so don't go paint the town with them or anything.
