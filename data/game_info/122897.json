The game puts you the player in control of the different camera effects within the game, allowing you to create your own unique visuals.</p><p>You simply toggle effects either on or off using the numbers from 0 to 9 on your keyboard and use the minus button (-) to delete all effects and start from the beginning once more.</p><p>Future plans are to make a custom controller to play with the game. LED arcade buttons will be used to tell you what effects you have on and off during the game. Then I also plan to hopefully show the game at different events. If you have any in mind please feel free to let me know. The game would be played in a very dark tent filled with lots of blankets and so on to get you nice and comfortable to play it. Secluding yourself from the outside world in this tent I feel will make it a much more enjoyable experience</p><p>Portfolio : http://slimjim.org/</p><p>Twitter : @Jamalamalamajam</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bad/bad327efd141d02294855a4fed99fc7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jamalamalamajam"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
