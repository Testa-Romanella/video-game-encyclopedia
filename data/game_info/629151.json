If you look\u00a0in your standard issue POC Ship's glove compartment you'll find a basic ball shot\u00a0revolver. This will be your standard issue weapon until you can prove yourself\u00a0\u00a0worthy of additional weaponry. Your mission as a new recruit is to go out and\u00a0help lower level planets in any way they may need you to (TL-6 and below planets).\u00a0YOU MUST avoid TL-7 and above planets at all costs. If you find yourself stuck or\u00a0otherwise stranded on a TL-7 or above planet you must call for backup using your\u00a0ship's radio IMMEDIATELY.\u00a0Now with that out of the way, you were provided a gun for a reason. On TL-3 and\u00a0above planets you may run into wildlife and perhaps even people that would mean\u00a0do you harm. You have been provided a set of HUD Glasses(TM) That will attempt\u00a0to provide information about both enemies and surroundings. Below is a picture\u00a0example of a set of HUD Glasses(TM) in action.<br/></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>As\u00a0you\u00a0can\u00a0see\u00a0the\u00a0system\u00a0attempts\u00a0to\u00a0Identify\u00a0the\u00a0creatures\u00a0name,\u00a0health/condition\u00a0and\u00a0how\u00a0many\u00a0turns\u00a0until\u00a0that\u00a0creature\u00a0attacks\u00a0you.\u00a0All\u00a0of\u00a0this\u00a0is\u00a0vital\u00a0information\u00a0in\u00a0combat.\u00a0Speaking\u00a0of\u00a0combat\u00a0you\u00a0will\u00a0need\u00a0to\u00a0fight\u00a0back\u00a0and\u00a0defend\u00a0yourself,\u00a0you\u00a0can\u00a0use\u00a0this\u00a0using\u00a0the\u00a0revolver\u00a0and\u00a0black\u00a0device\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0glove\u00a0box\u00a0called\u00a0a\u00a0Charge\u00a0Portal.\u00a0The\u00a0Charge\u00a0Portal\u00a0will\u00a0generate\u00a0a\u00a0constant\u00a0stream\u00a0of\u00a0Shot\u00a0Orbs\u00a0as\u00a0seen\u00a0in\u00a0an\u00a0illustration\u00a0below.\u00a0If\u00a0you\u00a0look\u00a0in\u00a0your\u00a0glove\u00a0box\u00a0you'll\u00a0also\u00a0notice\u00a0AP\u00a0charges\u00a0that\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0used\u00a0to\u00a0destroy\u00a0large\u00a0boulders\u00a0of\u00a0other\u00a0objects\u00a0blocking\u00a0your\u00a0path.\u00a0These\u00a0also\u00a0take\u00a0Shot\u00a0Orbs\u00a0but\u00a0a\u00a0large\u00a0amount\u00a0of\u00a0them\u00a0to\u00a0charge\u00a0the\u00a0device.\u00a0(If\u00a0you\u00a0get\u00a0a\u00a0large\u00a0combo).\u00a0Simply\u00a0click\u00a0one\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0orbs\u00a0to\u00a0attack,\u00a0try\u00a0to\u00a0get\u00a0a\u00a0large\u00a0group\u00a0of\u00a0similarly\u00a0colored\u00a0orbs\u00a0for\u00a0a\u00a0more\u00a0powerful\u00a0attack.</p>\n\n<p>As\u00a0you\u00a0participate\u00a0in\u00a0combat\u00a0you\u00a0will\u00a0slowly\u00a0get\u00a0better,\u00a0to\u00a0monitor\u00a0this\u00a0use\u00a0your\u00a0vital monitoring\u00a0system,\u00a0this\u00a0will\u00a0sometimes\u00a0give\u00a0helpful\u00a0tips\u00a0to\u00a0improve\u00a0yourself\u00a0in\u00a0combat,\u00a0you\u00a0may\u00a0find\u00a0it\u00a0hard\u00a0to\u00a0rememeber\u00a0both\u00a0tips\u00a0provided\u00a0so\u00a0simply\u00a0choose\u00a0one\u00a0to\u00a0focus\u00a0on\u00a0this\u00a0time.\u00a0What\u00a0this\u00a0looks\u00a0like\u00a0is\u00a0shown\u00a0below.</p>\n\n<p>With\u00a0that\u00a0you\u00a0should\u00a0have\u00a0all\u00a0the\u00a0knowledge\u00a0you\u00a0need\u00a0to\u00a0continue\u00a0on\u00a0into\u00a0the\u00a0great\u00a0unknown\u00a0and\u00a0start\u00a0helping\u00a0people.\u00a0Thank\u00a0you\u00a0for\u00a0your\u00a0service\u00a0and\u00a0try\u00a0not\u00a0to\u00a0get\u00a0yourself\u00a0killed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T11:18:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d7/5d77875e822f7fd947ad26b7ec3ca91f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zeke The Developer"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
