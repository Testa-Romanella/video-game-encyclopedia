I just couldn't sleep tonight. when i saw the first boss pop in with that yelling face i laughed so hard i knew in that moment I had to finish it instead of trashing it. but yeah, idk now. i guess at least I did something. Always doubting myself. I had fun making this, it was like, my own personal mini game jam, i was in my bubble for few hours just vibin.. 4 hours later and im terrified of clicking on the upload button. I'm so scared of getting judged for doing something I love. I just wanna make games that make people happy or something, idk. idk what I want. idk why I'm inspired by what I'm inspired by. I don't want to think about this anymore. fuck you, me, this is going up. show the world how much you make awesome fucking games.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Download's down here c: <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T06:25:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12e/12e5086fb9c84fb8d778bc2a93f7b46e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["redmoth"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
