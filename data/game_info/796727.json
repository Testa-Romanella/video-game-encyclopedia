Any astronomer worth their salt knows that its summoning heralds the coming of disaster. And disaster can reach even a noble like Noah, who secluded himself in the mountains.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Noah has the company of his lovely attendant, Isabelle. But the ghost of her previous incarnation, the Past Witch, will soon call upon the Evil Star\u2019s power to revive. If not stopped, the world will quickly and painfully remember why it tried to forget her nickname as the Graceful Nightmare.</p>\n<p>Harness the power of astronomy to destroy the Past Witch once and for all!</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>No MP gauge = No problem.</strong> Reimagine resource management to power your skills. Calculate the risks and benefits of restocking on the starlight available only now vs. attacking or defending.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Replayable. </strong>Pick a different personality for Noah to enjoy a different flavor of dialogue... and to fight a different style of the Past Witch\u2019s battle tactics. Fiddle with the settings to rebalance the game to your taste (defaults are set to hard!) or create a different experience.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Intensive gameplay-and-story integration.</strong> The plot progresses with the battle. Little details and even the ending can change based on your decisions. And if you care about backstory, there are many interactables.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T15:13:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a08/a08fccf3d612a4f50bcf4010644c4a6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["the13thsecret"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
