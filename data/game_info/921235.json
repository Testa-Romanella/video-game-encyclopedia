Did not give myself enough time at all to finish the core gameplay or\u00a0start making it reeeeeally juicy. Screenshake etc... but I hope it still feels satisfying to some degree!</p>\n<p>The idea is to make drinks from the menu on the right side. I did not have time to add the function for delivering the recipe, but you were supposed to fill the cup and then land it on the end of the conveyer and select the order it was made for to receive your cash.</p>\n<p>Some fruit need to be peeled in the peeler. If you peel fruit that don't need peeled then they will get destroyed!\u00a0</p>\n<p>A few issues with my pooler for the blended version of the fruit- sometimes the blueberries will not stop being pooled from the pooler when you blend the first time! So, be careful!\u00a0hah</p>\n<p>I\u00a0had a lot of fun, and will try and make a more complete version for the \"My first game jam\" jam that it running along side this.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for checking it out!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Credit: Subspace audio for the sound effects. I dug apart some of the corgi engine code to figure out\u00a0the pooler, so credit there too!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T20:59:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d87/d877883ae2db4cab884c58755c92413e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Benmols"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
