I do plan on adding a few more features and polishing the game up a bit more but I don't plan on spending too much time perfecting it as it was only a practice project. </p><p>Thank you checking out this game and thanks in advance for downloading it. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/460/46030c1f2327b67fbcd9daac9b26b6a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Justin Michael"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
