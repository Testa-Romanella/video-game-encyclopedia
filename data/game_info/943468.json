Why did you make THIS game?\u00a0</strong>Because I needed to burn time between this and my other active project which is on technical hold as I\u00a0wait. And, I\u00a0have a much better handle on the engine and knew I\u00a0could do this project better than last time.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Is this a remake?\u00a0</strong>Seriously?\u00a0 It's in the title.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Anything different?\r\n</strong>Yes, lots. And, no. But also, yes.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>4. Is this a remaster?\u00a0</strong>Only of my first completed original project, and that one could be considered a \"demake\" or \"demaster.\" So, riddle me this...\u00a0what do call a remaster of a demaster still potentially worse as a derivative of an original?</p>\n<p><strong>5. So, what has been remade?\u00a0</strong>The entire game has been updated to a newer engine to start.\u00a0In terms of new stuff, there are movies, achievements, cheat codes, lighting improvements, battle specificity, graphics, dialog and typo fixes, quality of life updates, widescreen, and, if you can believe it, the code is about half the length of the original. And more. You have to say that, but in this case, it's really true.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>6. When will it be finished?</strong>\r\nIt is out now. Go ahead and play it. It's free.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Is there a better Q&amp;A I\u00a0can consult?\r\n</strong>Dev commentary on many scenes incoming using an in-game code. It'll be part of the first update.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Is this for sale?\r\n</strong>Nah, you can have it for free.</p>\n<p><strong>9. Why'd you pick light blue for the sidebars?</strong>\r\nRepeating a meme in a different way.</p>\n<p><strong>10. What sidebars?\u00a0</strong>Turn your phone to landscape mode.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>11. Will you update the game?</strong>\r\nYes. This game was much better designed, and I have a much better handle on the engine, and included the potential for updates.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-18T00:35:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77e/77edde09659042c56154aca1d3d7cd78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["misterprmiller"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
