They cannot only instantly pick up new tricks, they can also telepathically transmit these to each other. Of course, with their pea brain they also tend to instantly forget these tricks after they used them. <br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Anyway, life was good for Ostark &amp; Didi... but nothing can last forever. Aliens have invaded these lands, looking to get a hold of one of them, to steal their unique powers. Make sure this doesn't happen! Guide them to the safety of their nest!</p>\n\n<p>This is a cooperative puzzle platformer game for two players. It is made to be played with two XBOX360 controllers (or compatible) on Windows, but it can also be played with two players on one keyboard, and also on Mac (keyboard only).</p>\n<p>Originally this game was made for the Global Game Jam 2018 (theme: \"Transmission\"), but since then, a lot of new content has been added.
