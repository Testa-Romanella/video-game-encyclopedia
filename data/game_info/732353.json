Have GTIA artifacting enabled for that retro authentic experience.\u00a0 For altirra you probably want to set the Input to the cursor/arrow keys.</p>\n<p>Use arrow keys to move, Z,X, or C and then ESC to quit to main menu, or just exit the emulator.</p>\n<p>Here's the story:</p>\n<p>You discovered a small town and ventured into the tavern. After one too many ales and tired of hearing of some wizard called 'Zwarth', you drunkenly boast you can vanquish this evil wizard with your mighty dagger. The gullible and desparate\u00a0townspeople at their wits end, decide to deposit you onto the shore of his island while you are passed out, in the hopes of riding the curse from their land.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To make it off alive, you find you must gather up your strength and stamina, slaying beasts left and right until you are at a high enough level to destroy the wizard.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T15:28:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/848/84858831913be68b40fd401a5114ecb8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Skulltip"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
