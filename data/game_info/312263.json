Your goal is to land drifts to score as many points as possible. Every time you successfully drift a multiplier increases, so the more drifts you do in a row the more points you get. However there is a catch, anytime you hit something your multiplier resets and you are back to square one. To make things worse, local authorities are out to arrest you.How to play<br/>Here are a couple of tips to get started:<br/><br/><ul><li>Your goal is to drift while getting away from police, doing only one and not the other won't get you far.</li></ul><ul><li>The map has the size of 5x5 downtown blocks with traffic lights at each intersection. If you drive down a road and see no more traffic lights ahead: slow down or get ready to drift, otherwise you are driving into a wall!</li></ul><ul><li>The game is relatively dark, both for aesthetic and difficulty reasons. Use the traffic lights at the intersections as a reference point to get a sense of distance.</li></ul><ul><li>The more damaged your car is, the slower it will drive. You can repair the car by picking up blue repair kits that spawn randomly at intersections around the map.</li></ul><ul><li>You recharge your boost by drifting.</li></ul>Controls<br/>Here are the controls for the game (Keyboard/Controller):<br/><br/><ul><li>Accelerate: W / Right Trigger</li></ul><ul><li>Break: S / Left Trigger</li></ul><ul><li>Steer: A&amp;D / Left Stick</li></ul><ul><li>Hand Break: Space / B Button</li></ul><ul><li>Boost: Left Shift / A Button</li></ul><br/>The controller has to be specifically enabled in the options menu (game-&gt;use controller)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d32/d32d2321a3522a4f7c02bf45e6c336ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 4, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ThatMadProgrammer"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ThatMadProgrammer"], "esrb_rating": null}
