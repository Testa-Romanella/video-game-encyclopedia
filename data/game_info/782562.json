Nobody knows what\u2019s in it, but people keep dying, and they would like it if someone would sweep out whatever horror awaits within.</em></p>\n<p>The Cave Outside Heltrap\u00a0is a solo writing RPG where you are a fantasy adventurer who has been tasked with investigating a problem in a cave that has everyone scared.</p>\n<p>Use the one page document to start your journal about wanting to be the hero who solves this problem and discovers what is in this cave and why it's killing people in this small village outside the larger city of Heltrap. The prompt table will slowly guide you through weeks of minor investigations and surprises, as well as\u00a0interactions and opportunities to get your imagination and creativity cooking.\r\n</p>\n<p>I was heavily inspired by Dungeons &amp; Dragons, first and foremost. The kinds of stupid sidequests me and my adventuring party always seem to end up in gave me good fodder for how this story winds and wends. The Witcher was another story that has captured my attention - I'm both down for the comics and the show.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To play this game, you only need a d20, a d6, and the way and will to write out an awesome adventure.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game was created using the\u00a0Second Guess System by Gamenomicon\u00a0- which is utterly brilliant in construction - and inspired by their\u00a0Hard Case\u00a0game - a brilliant single page of construction and genre.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you like this, please check out my other single page solo journaling rpgs:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Welcome To Faraday\u00a0- a suburban horror story\r\n</li><li>The Seven Islands of Qoy\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0a mystical\u00a0kung fu tournament story\r\n</li><li>The Lighthouse at Kindred Rocks\u00a0- an eerie coastal town mystery</li><li>The Heist on Foley Lane\u00a0-\u00a0a revenge heist story</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T06:57:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e3/0e31660500e35e1fd92ddffcae3dd803.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ryanklindsay"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
