My first thought was about old arcade games where a single run wasn't enough, you had to constantly die to improve and rise in the leaderboards. The second thing that came to mind was a old cartoon about a group of morons building crazy flying machines in order to catch a messenger pigeon, I combined those two aspects in the game. The cartoons name was \"Dastardly And Muttley In Their Flying Machines\"</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T09:53:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/363/3632a23e885df2dfacb14df8a20c11c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 223, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PcKaffe"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
