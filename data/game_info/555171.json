It was made in clengine as the first test game. To play it, you need a terminal emulator with ansi support (I'm already working on wasm build). Most linux terminals have this capability, but on windows you need to download the new terminal emulator. Due to the jam's time limitation, the game is still buggy. Please report bugs on the github repo, or here in the comment.</p>\n<p># CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>move: `wasd` - you keep moving in one direction, until you press a key.</p>\n<p>shoot: `e`</p>\n<p>quit: `q</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T04:27:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f8/5f858565daabb434dcaa681cc65a4a22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["maskarinec"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
