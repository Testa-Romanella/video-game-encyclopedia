I was unsure how to make it a survival game so I started with a timed runner.  Working with the colors was very easy, sprites and objects stand out from the background and work great.  Jason mentioned something about Bandits and Mages, I did try to incorporate those by using bunny people that have a sword and cape.  The main sprite is called skull guy, he is a Grim Reaper and has to traverse the land to get to the giant red orb pole.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bahtosi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
