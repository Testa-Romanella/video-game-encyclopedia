The ideia here is to play as you can, until you die. When you are dead, you come back as a new character, however your previous play will repeat the level with you - repeating the same actions as before.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To support the mechanics, the story is about a multiverse collapse. A time warp was breached and several worlds have a portal to that time, making it a mess.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The time to make this game was from friday 3 pm to sunday, 2 pm. It was done a lot in that time period - all movements and repetition mechanic, the platform mechanics and level design, some side tools to support the mechanics and even a small simple shader. It was a good challange. The game engine was Unity3D 2017.2, with c#<br/></p>\n<p>The art was most borrowed from \"https://0x72.itch.io/\". Thank you a lot.</p>\n<p>The sound was bought in unity`s assetstore.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51e/51efa46aac396c5ca3b7e7f5d7588540.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["matheusfernandes"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
