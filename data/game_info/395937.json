That topic is a bit complicated, so best to ignore it if you're not familiar with that game.<br/></p>\n<p>________________________________________</p>\n<p>CHANGELOG:</p>\n<p>________________________________________</p>\n<p>(11.21.14)\r\n-The last update broke the console entirely which meant I had to rewrite 20% of console.js to work with the new code.\r\n-The update made on the 19th broke backspace, so I fixed that.\r\n-Optimized each of the levels with Turnofflight.js so my frames didn't drop to 25 on standalone.\r\n(11.19.14)\r\n-Enter and Return now work, so the game will work on PC and MAC with no problems.\r\n-Fixed all of those lame and ridiculous PlayerPrefs issues.\r\n-Added a roof to 1-3 and darkened skybox (forgot).\r\n-Fixed timeslowing issue on 1-1.\r\n-There's a known bug with two console windows opening up, but it's not a big deal, so I'll fix it later.\r\n(Since the updated game can't even be played right now)</p>\n<p>(11.19.14)</p>\n<p>Updated the game to use Enter instead of ;.</p>\n<p>(11.18.14)\r\n\tUpdated the game so the settings don't bug out and its playable by default. Fix for the console to actually use 'Enter' is coming soon.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t________________________________________</p>\n<p>README:</p>\n<p>________________________________________</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHoly crap.

Thanks.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis is one of many prospective games in a series.

Haven't seen screenshots in a while.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tScott Slucher: Really awesome(looking) dogfighting game.
