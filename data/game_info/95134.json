You won't find waves upon waves of enemies, only waves upon waves of text.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Headphones, a dark room, and about an hour of spare time are recommended. The game does not have a saving system.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em><strong>Per gli italiani la fuori, navigatori intraprendenti nelle acque tempestose della rete, raccomando di giocare Adrian nella lingua madre dello sviluppatore.
