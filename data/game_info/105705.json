Joshua Cauller, Plus 10 Damage\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\n<em>Hands Off! v1.1 (released on 2015-05-29) introduces two new arena types, the meddle system and more.</em><br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe gloves are off. The gauntlet is down. Hands Off! asks \u201cHow ambidextrous are you?\" and then forces you to prove it.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tHand to hand, you and your opponent are locked in a never ending struggle* to get coloured pegs into their matching coloured holes. You could assume that achieving this wouldn't be difficult. That assumption would be incorrect.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tHands Off! will strain your brain. Three holes, three pegs, four hands (two each!) - that's a lot of things to keep your eyes glued to (literally or figuratively). You can team up with a friend and share your hands, offloading some of your brain strain and struggling with teamwork and cooperation instead.\r\n</p><p>\n<em>*individual struggles do in-fact, end</em>\n</p><ul>\n<strong>Key Features</strong>\n<li>Compete with your friends in frantic multiplayer battles</li>\n<li>Use your hands (and your brain) in ways you're not used to</li>\n<li>Experience a wide variety of arena shapes, themes and behaviours (around 30 possible permutations!)</li>\n<li>Smack the Meddle buttons in each arena to mix up the gameplay (and your brains)</li>\n<li>Challenge a friend to a one-on-one peg-in-hole battle or play the party modes for 2-4 players <em>(party modes coming in v1.2)</em></li>\n</ul><p>\n</p><ul>\n<strong>Force</strong>\n<li>Smack your opponent's hand to send their peg flying\r\n\t</li>\n<li>Smack the pegs to put an end to any potential point scoring</li>\n</ul><ul>\n<strong>Peg Control</strong>\n<li>Catch the peg you just sent flying or intercept your opponent's pass\r\n\t</li>\n<li>Throw pegs on the perfect curve to score from across the arena</li>\n</ul><ul>\n<strong>Strategy</strong>\n<li>Use dummy throws, bounce pads and portals to trick your opponent\r\n\t</li>\n<li>Use the arena meddles at opportune times to gain the upper hand</li>\n</ul><p>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tLocal multiplayer only. Controllers required.\r\n\tAny controller with two thumbsticks and four shoulder buttons (anything similar to Xbox 360 or DualShock) should work. \r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tHands Off! appeared in Brisbane at the \r\n\t2015 GO423 Symposium!<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tHands Off! toured Australia as part of SK Games' \r\n\tInterstate Arcade.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t Hands Off! went to AVCon in the \r\n\tIndie Games Room in July, 2015.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tFollow us on \r\n\tfacebook, twitter or check out our website!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tWe welcome all feedback and constructive criticism - you can send it to:\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t i2ngames /at/ i2ngames /dot/ com\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tPurchases here will get a Steam key when we release there!\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/adc/adcf5048d5ee24be30cc915076236c8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["i2n Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
