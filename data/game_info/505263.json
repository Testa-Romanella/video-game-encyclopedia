A game where nothing is like how it looks.</p>\n\n<p>You are Kamui. A young man who is often sarcastic and also hates life. He lives in Fallers, a relativly big city, but also a city with a lot of crimes. Oh and he dies... pretty sad huh? But hey, he get's resurrected and meets his new allies.</p>\n\n<p>This is Mentora. Founder of the organization \"Dark Resistance\" and als inventor of the magical weapons. Nobody really knows what he is thinking, but he tries to be the good guy.</p>\n\n<p>That is Lily, pronounced like \"Lee Lee\" you know? She is sometimes a bit harsh, but she has the heart on the right place. Lily will also help you on your quest.</p>\r\nWhen life is giving you lemon, take the lemon and squeeze it into the eyes of the life!\r\n<p>So what is \"Dark Resistance\" in detail? \"Dark Resistance\" is my second game I ever made. An oldschool RPG in modern times, but with some fantasy elements, like \"Magic\". But is that really Magic? You turn to find out. The story builds up slowly so you will throw into the game and find out for yourself what you need to do. (Don't worry, the NPC's will tell you what to do)</p>\n<p>I used a lot of the main assets of the RPG Maker, but I made a lot of the characters myself. The enemies are completly from me.</p>\n<p>Now I will credit some people, cause I used some copyright free music and one Plugin... well here we go!</p>\n<p>Portrait Plugin by Michael Dionne</p>\n<p>freesounds.org\u00a0music used from:</p>\n<ul><li>edtijo</li><li>4barrelcarb</li><li>sirkoto51</li><li>valentinsosnitskiy</li><li>foolboymedia</li><li>frankum</li><li>junkfood2121</li></ul>\n<p>Now we come to the Youtube Audio Library guys:</p>\n<ul><li>Jeremy Korpas</li><li>Quincas Moreira</li><li>Vans in Japan</li><li>Underbelly &amp; Ty Mayer</li><li>Corbyn Kites</li><li>RKVC</li><li>E's Jammy Jams</li><li>DJ Williams</li><li>Trevor Garrod</li></ul>\n<p>Some of the music of the persons I listed here is not in the demo, but will come later.</p>\n<p>My last words for the discription: Please give me feedback, report me bugs or tell me whatever you want to tell me!
