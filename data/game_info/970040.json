With no interference from you, the virus will spread around the world, infect new places ,evolve, mutate, and reshape the landscape of humanity\u2026 that is, it would, if it weren\u2019t for other viruses, and medical interference, waiting to stop it.<br/><br/>As Coronavirus's control, you have the power to aid it with powerful evolution, and to guide its progress with mutations and structuring. Even with your help, it may not be enough to make Coronavirus the most terrible in the world.<h3>The Game</h3><ul><li>A turn-based strategy game.<br/></li><li>Battle up to six other viruses to become the most dominant.<br/></li><li>An intelligent simulation of viral infection, mutation, and exploitation.<br/></li><li>A fiendishly difficult AI with various difficulties and modes to play on.<br/></li><li>Crafted from a love of Populous, Megalomania, and other ancient god-game classics!</li></ul><h3>Your Viral Spores</h3>At the core of the game, is the Virus you are nurturing. It will begin by infecting the different buildings in the city, mutating into various strains, establishing defence pathogens, sending out spores to convert other viruses, and eventually begin work on taking over hospitals and creating Mega-Strains. So long as no other virus stops it.<h3>Your Role</h3>As the Coronavirus mind, you can help it. The more spores you create, the more powerful you become.<br/><ul><li>Create strains which casue sickness, casuing hand washing zones, which slow enemy viruses, or atibac zones to destroy them.<br/></li><li>Create swarms of mild offensive pathogens to eradicate enemy viruses.<br/></li><li>Empower your virus to become a megastrain and let it seek out enemies, or guide it through an infection.<br/></li><li>Pollute and infect homes, schools, places of worship and airports to increase spore count and produce more mutation points for you.<br/></li><li>Turn toxic dumps into powerful strains or infected animals to fortify the Coronavirus.   </li></ul><h3>The Enemies   </h3> <br/>Unfortunately for your, Coronavirus is not the only infection.
