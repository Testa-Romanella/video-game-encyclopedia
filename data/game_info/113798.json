The Monolithic Cathode Corp. has taken control and is hoarding power from the city below. Enter the Incapacitor, a lone avatar of synthetic justice. Fight your way through the endless horde of disgruntled bad-bots as you ascend to the heights of the tower. On a mission to take the power back, you will stop bots till you drop, then get up and do it again.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIncapacitor is an FPS Rogue-lite with a heavy synth-wave aesthetic. Each play-through is different from the last with a wide array of weapons, levels and abilities.</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\tSoundtrack by \r\n\tB\u035d L \u0362\u039b C\u035d K\u0328 \u0315\u034f\u0360- N\u0322\u035e \u035fO \u0340I\u0328 Z\u0315\u035e E\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\tDesign -                    Harrison O'Connor\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tProgramming -          Liam Harvey, Benjamin Welsh\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tArt and Animation -   Kate Lulham, Che Hubbard, Hamish Standfield\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSound -                     Aiden Pedemont\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tincapacitor.com | @incapacitor | incapacitor@gmail.com<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/771/771a646347024fac6eb9d76fe3c9fa92.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Redacted"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
