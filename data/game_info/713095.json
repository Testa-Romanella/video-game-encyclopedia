I'm honestly proud of it, even though I know it's not very good. I'm happy to say I participated in a game jam for the first time in my life, as well as fleshed out an idea that I\u00a0had, and brought together multiple people to create assets.\u00a0<br/><br/>This has been a major learning opportunity and I look forward to participating in jams in the future!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T07:53:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6dd/6dde1860f58d99035b51d1a9d5dcd2be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yrllow"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
