But beware, the level you travel to will be at random! On each level you will also find a weapon key which will provide a random weapon on the next stage! Each of these keys will count toward your total score. Can you make it to the end? Unfortunately, no, you cannot. We're BRAND new to unity, so we didn't quite finish it in time. But please let us know what you think of this work in progress! <br/></p>\n<p>TL;DR, see above</p>\n<p>Note: If the red rectangular door is not bringing you to the next level, but you have collected the blue room key, you may need to try touching different faces of the door.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Move Left - (A)</li><li>Move Right - (D)</li><li>Jump - (Space)</li><li>Aim with mouse</li><li>Shoot with left click</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T02:12:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c62/c625b7862ca1a541461db4eb9e6538d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jameywags"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
