{"id": 862961, "slug": "lab-slime", "name": "Lab Slime", "name_original": "Lab Slime", "description": "<p>Lab Slime is a game where you are meant to navigate a maze, designed to test the player\u2019s reaction and input speed. Scientists orchestrated an ever increasing maze that you\u2019re meant to accomplish within 10 seconds. For every successful completion of the maze, the maze will increase by one tile, increasing until you slip up or fail to reach the end within the time limit. As you progress the game, the variety of tiles shall increase. There are 3 gamemodes, one being the previously styled gamemode, another that is without the tile variety and one more where the tiles increase instead of reaching a goal. Recorded Highscores are only temporary, should you want to have saved high scores, then I recommend playing the downloadable version.</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n</p>\n<p>WASD - Navigate/Move\r\n</p>\n<p>Enter - Confirm\r\n</p>\n<p>Escape - Pause/Cancel</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T17:55:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e0/0e02adcf24129192d359c2b636efb6a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cheville"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
