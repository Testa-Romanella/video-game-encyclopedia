The game fits the theme by taking the classic tower-defense genre and adding a twist where you only have <em>two</em> towers. This limits your arsenal and it therefor becomes a core mechanic to move the towers around while playing.</p>\n<p>[CONTROLS]</p>\n<p>Walk: [A] [S] [D] [W\u00a0]</p>\n<p>Pickup, place and choose tower: [SPACE]</p>\n<p>Some sounds were made possible\u00a0by great assets from\u00a0freesound.org :</p>\n<p>-\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/UnderlinedDesigns/sounds/188499/</p>\n<p>- https://freesound.org/people/zimbot/sounds/117138/</p>\n<p>- https://freesound.org/people/josepharaoh99/sounds/368512/</p>\n<p>-\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/zimbot/sounds/117138/</p>\n<p>-\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/OGsoundFX/sounds/423116/\r\n</p>\n<p>-\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/rickaldo09/sounds/327631/</p>\n<p>Everything else was made under United Game Jam 2020.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T03:39:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3a/a3a733e458237f25616148398cad6329.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Venelyx"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
