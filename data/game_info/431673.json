An uninvited guest shows up.<br/></p>\n<p>This game contains adult sexual content. This game has a male protagonist that will either stay male or become female. If the first sexual encounter is with a female character, then the male protagonist will become female. The male protagonist will start out as a human and transform into an anthropomorphic animal during his first sexual encounter. The sexual content includes M/M, M/F, F/F, M/M/M, M/M/F, M/F/F, F/F/F scenes. It is easy to avoid specific content, simply avoid characters of the undesired sex.<br/></p>\n<p>This is Version 1.05 of Smashing Stag Party. You can find more games on my Patreon, discord, and FurAffinity accounts with the specific links listed on the first page of the actual game.
