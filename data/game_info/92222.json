Practically everything in APOTU is made using Blocks, in VR, for VR.</p>\n<p>The combination Blocks and Unity makes turnaround time super-short, and enabled me to just think up this world, try it out, build on what I saw happen, and out of nothing grew this little piece ofcountryside!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'm trying to just let this thing build itself, seeing where it leads me.</p>\n<p>APOTU was featured on Engadget.</p>\n<p>You can follow bits of the process via my YouTube channel. Follow me on Twitter to keep up to date.</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>(here's a Steam-grid conform image for those that need it)</em></strong></p>\r\nTELEPORT\r\n<p>Press the trackpad (Vive) or push the thumbstick forwards (Oculus, WindowsMR) to engage in teleport. Keep it pressed/pushed to aim at a spot, then release to teleport.<br/> <br/> On Oculus Touch, you can rotate the stick around to also turn during teleport.<br/> <br/> To Cancel teleport, point at your feet before releasing the trackpad/thumbstick.<br/> <br/> When pointing at your feet, press a direction on the trackpad (Vive) or push the thumbstick in a direction (Oculus, WindowsMR) to turn on the spot -- useful to realign your VR space.</p>\n\r\nINTERACTION\r\n<p>Move your hand to an object and you should feel a slight vibration when it is interactable.<br/> <br/> Grab by squeezing the trigger (Vive) or the grab button (Oculus, WindowsMR), and you can pick an object up. Release the button to drop it.<br/> <br/> If you're holding an object that has some extra function -- like a lighter, or a flashlight -- you can press the trackpad (Vive) or push the thumbstick (Touch, WindowsMR) to activate it.\u00a0<br/> <br/> If you grab empty air, your controller will become a physical entity, and you can bash/push/touch stuff with it.</p>\r\nSETTINGS\r\n<p>There's a graphical settings control box behind the caravan!</p>\n<p> Teleport settings are accessed via your virtual glasses -- pull them from your head by grabbing the air in front of your eyes. Once you have them in your hand, try pulling the handles on them to see what they do!</p>\n<p>Do send me your feedback! Enjoy!<br/></p>\n<p>_/\\//\\ /\\ /\\/\\_</p>\n\r\nWARNING\r\n<p>This is very much still a prototype project! Some stuff will be broken, other stuff will not make sense. There's no game, no real story yet, just a place to potter about in, and hopefully enjoy!</p>\n\r\nCURRENT VERSION v0.65b2\r\n<p>New stuff: the teleport glasses, the tropical shower, lots of under-the-hood stuff, and a basic form of Sound Occlusion.</p>\n<p>b2 is Oculus only, and shoudl fix a calibration issue some users had at the start of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8e/b8efaee03e77b537543978e2ca390be3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 223, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["naam"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
