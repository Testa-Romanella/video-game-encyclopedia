As she arrives, Janine is greeted by <strong>Axiom 3B</strong>, the AI host that controls the station. Intrigue soon arises when <strong>Janine </strong>hears rumors that an <strong>Ant-Queen</strong> was kidnapped to be experimented on by the station\u2019s Chief Scientist, <strong>Dr. Halinkov</strong>. <strong>Janine </strong>now must navigate the crazy sci-fi environment, eliminating aliens, talking to residents, and finding secret areas to uncover the truth about the alien invasion!<br/><br/>All songs by Ozzed.

I mean EVERYTHING. (Well, almost.) You can destroy scene objects and NPCs. However, there\u2019s a Penalty System that rewards when you hit enemies and penalizes when you hit everything else. If you get more than 40 Penalty Points, your head explodes and it\u2019s game over, man!<br/><br/><strong>Money Combo System:</strong> Earn money each time you hit an enemy. Your multiplier increases at each accurate hit, and resets when you miss a shot. Also, earn extra money when you destroy shielded enemies with one shot. It\u2019s easy, just shoot the gaps. =]<br/><br/><strong>Clone System:</strong> You have only one life. However, you can create up to 5 clones in each stage. Your mind is transported to the clone\u2019s brain when you die. But clones aren\u2019t free! After each death, you need to make a new clone, for a price. I know, capitalism sucks. <br/><br/><strong>Secrets and Treasures:</strong> Search for hidden areas and collect retro video games to earn more money!<br/><br/><strong>Shops:</strong> You can buy the usual: Energy and ammo, grenades, a protective vest (that explodes when depleted!), two upgrades for your laser, and redemption for your Penalty Points.<br/><br/><strong>Talk to NPCs: </strong>You can talk to all NPCs. Also, in every stage you can find one Special NPC, with whom you can have a more in-depth dialogue. (It\u2019s optional, though, you can ignore them if you want. Of course, you\u2019ll miss the story that I wrote so arduously =P)<br/><br/><strong>Accuracy: </strong>At the end of all stages, you\u2019ll see a screen with statistics. If you\u2019re good enough, you can earn extra money.<br/><br/><strong>Story-Driven:</strong> The story is full with big themes: artificial intelligence, existentialism, religion, time travel, politics, the importance of having easy access to caffeine, and much more!<br/><br/><strong>Moral Decisions: </strong>As an agent of the state, your job is to eliminate 100% of the alien invaders. Thing is, some of them might surprise you in more than one way. The gun is in your hand, pulling the trigger is your choice! <br/><br/><strong>Featuring:</strong><br/><br/>= 10 handcrafted stages<br/>= 2-4 hours of gameplay<br/>= 3 raycast based weapons<br/>= 2 bosses<br/>= Grenades/Bombs for area damage<br/>= Look around corners move<br/>= Campaign Mode that saves your progress<br/>= Free Play Mode to jump straight to any stage<br/>= Unique pixel art in 3D environment", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T15:59:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/305/305040409cae730d0e1c6e6eea272cbc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["33 Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["33 Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
