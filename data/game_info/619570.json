In each level, you need to destroy all the enemy robots by sending them marching into Bombs. Once you do that, a Battery will appear for you to collect. There's just one caveat - every input you make also moves your enemies about. You'll need to program your moves wisely to ensure your own elbot stays out of danger, and your enemies meet their explosive demise.</p>\n<p><em>Created for the GMTK Game Jam 2021, in pygame. </em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T15:18:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8f/c8fe62b3f544fed75a39fbe827de3acc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rooben"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
