So when the clown uprising began, no one was particularly surprised that they would abduct 11-year-old circus patron Oliver Pendragon to use as a bargaining chip. But Oliver has other plans, and, armed only with rubber balls he finds on the floor, he begins his escape.</p>\n<p>This was a solo project, and I\u00a0did all the art and sound effects myself. I used Amper Music for the music. So far there are only three rooms, but more will be added later.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d5/4d59eb5205c3ab3f9e11afabadd7115e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Big Dave"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
