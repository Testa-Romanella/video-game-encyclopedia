The theme is \"Adventure\", so inspired by this genre, we decided to go with the classical battle between knights and monsters. The limitation was death as a core mechanic, so we implemented this by giving the protagonist the ability to collect the souls of his dead enemies, and use them to revive himself, or his companions.</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Protect the princess by upgrading yourself with the souls of your enemies. You can also use them to revive. In order to upgrade yourself, open the player menu ('p') and select your preferred option with the mouse. You lose if the princess dies, or if you don't have enough souls to revive. You can compete with other players on the desktop version.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Open/Close player menu (p)</p>\n<p>Move (a,d)/(arrows)</p>\n<p>Hit (space)</p>\n<p>Revive, HP, Heal (mouse left hold)</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>@Foundtexas / @Annalou_Iza / @Di\u00f3genes Grajales Corona / @George Guilty / @JSX2000</p>\n<p><strong>Music:\u00a0</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T10:10:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f54/f540493e63d2915d343950046fda15b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FoundTexas", "Annalou_Iza", "George Guilty", "Di\u00f3genes Grajales Corona"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
