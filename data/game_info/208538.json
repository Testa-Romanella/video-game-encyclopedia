I calculate all pixels myself and only send them to OpenGL to display it on screen. You can spawn balls by pressing B. Pressing G adds gravity, F removes it. I think it's kind of impressive how convincing it looks. Balls are 1 kg, 1 m diameter, and are absolutely elastic in this game. Just don't spawn more than 100 balls!</p>\n<p>You can even mod your own ball! If you change sball.tga image!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/200/2009728bfdc421d53f6d516cc9961b1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ScienceDiscoverer"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
