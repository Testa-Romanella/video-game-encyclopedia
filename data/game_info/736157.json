Hopefully this Naomi game, out now in Japan, is DC bound (and added network support would be nice!).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T15:06:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f4/6f4d9a7f655912722df2f65a8c99468d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Amusement Vision"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": null}
