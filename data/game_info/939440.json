There's no team, it's only me. The game is still in development and is not the final version. You can also download previous game versions\u00a0and submit bug reports in\u00a0here.</p>\n<p>The game consists in you wanting to make a ball reach its goal. You, as a player, can't move the ball with your cursor or keyboard. It only interacts with the labyrinth it's in. Now you would think \"Then how can I play?\". It's fairly easy. You are the maze itself. You have to move and rotate the maze in order to get the ball to the goal. Most of the bugs regarding the ball doing noclip are totally intended and should be abused. Every other bug should be reported.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T18:40:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab3/ab3cb68a1eb0e032a7f136096e4aa02e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RocketSmash"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
