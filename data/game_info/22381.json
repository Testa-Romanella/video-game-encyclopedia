It revolutionized the organization and size of European armies through the use of lev\u00e9e en masse (mass conscription.) But the strength of an army finds its roots within every soldier's individual skills. \n\n\t\t\tNapoleon: Total War Imperial Edition on Steam includes the exclusive \"Heroes of the Napoleonic Wars\" pack. This pack gathers the most superb infantry and cavalrymen who fought during the great Napoleonic battles: 10 exclusive units, which will all make a difference during key engagements, whether using formidable weapons or exceptional tactical skills.\n\t\t\tThese exclusive elite units become available on the campaign map once you have made a specific technological advancement or own the relevant territory. \n\t\t\tThe following elite units are included as part of the Napoleon: Total War Imperial Edition on Steam. These elite units will appear in both single and multiplayer game modes.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t7th Lancers (France) \u2014 These cavalrymen are armed with lances that make them particularly deadly when charging. The lance allows the user to put all his weight, and that of his charging horse, behind one very sharp point. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBrandenburg Uhlans (Prussia) \u2014 They are some of the most experienced cavalrymen in Europe and can persuade their steeds into breathtaking acts of speed. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1st Hussars (Austria) \u2014 The 1st Hussars are, without exception, superb horsemen, and all have a certain independence of spirit that makes them ideal for chasing down widely scattered men. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t15th Hussars (Great Britain) \u2014 The 15th Hussars are made up of veteran cavalrymen, deadly in close combat and at the charge. Their speed makes them ideal for chasing down skirmishers and for dealing with artillery units. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1st East Prussian Grenadier Battalion (Prussia) \u2014 Only the largest, bravest men can become grenadiers; this size and strength makes them an impressive sight in a charge, and gives them an edge in melee. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t6th Regiment d'Infanterie L\u00e9g\u00e8re (France) \u2014 Historically, the 6th Regiment saw action in over forty battles during the Napoleonic Wars and were awarded seven battle honours for their achievements. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t17th J\u00e4ger Regiment (Russia) \u2014 Able to fight in loose skirmish formation or fire a massed volley when organised in line, the J\u00e4gers are an adaptable response to enemy tactics. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1st Regiment Emperor's Own (Austria) \u2014 The 1st Regiment \u201cEmperor\u2019s Own\u201d is made up of battle-hardened Czech troops, as deadly with their bayonets as they are excellent marksmen. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t18th Regiment d'Infanterie de Ligne \"The Brave\" (France) \u2014 The 18th Regiment are revered by their fellow countrymen, who know them as \"The Brave.\" They are experienced soldiers and that makes them valuable on the battlefield. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMoscow Musketeers (Russia) \u2014 Formed into a disciplined line, they can unleash a massed volley into an enemy then, while the enemy is reeling, follow it with a decisive bayonet charge. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n<br/>", "metacritic": 81, "released": "2010-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T20:01:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86c/86c17a675945c99d77e217393fb6391e.jpg", "website": "http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=848", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 516, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Creative Assembly"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": null}
