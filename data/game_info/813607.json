You're up for a reinvigorating stay at your favorite seaside pool.<br/><br/>You are not alone. Different ducks will slowly and happily fall into the pool with you, each with their own style and demeanor.<br/><br/>Float on the water, sunbathe, dip your beak, go down the slide. The radio is playing a nostalgic tune.<br/>Here comes the night. Look at the stars. Turn off the radio, listen to the waves in the dark. Dream.<br/>The sun is rising. The sky is blue. Slide down into the second pool.<br/>An airplane is rushing somewhere, there's stuff to do.<br/>Not for you.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Live in the present moment, enjoy life.<br/><br/>Everything is going to be alright.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-29T22:13:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe2/fe2d676b9615f5ef976152b0ccdc9793.jpg", "website": "https://twitter.com/PPDuckSimulator", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 100, "beaten": 4, "dropped": 5, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 26, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 323, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["turbolento games"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["turbolento games"], "esrb_rating": null}
