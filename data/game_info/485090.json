We offer a promise of a unique economical concept to our users; that they can search and find an exact amount of crypto coins in the game environment.<br/>These types of promises usually come with worries that were the main game design concern as well. The question is how to produce and distribute the coins in the game without having the knowledge of it to monopolize the results?<br/>So we came up with a unique way of Coin-Distribution Method, we call it ''<strong>Proof of Location</strong>'' to use Blockchain\u2019s <strong>SMART Contract</strong> to generate and hide the coins without any track of it.<br/>Therefore, gamers can easily play and find coins like real-world Gold Miners and no one, literally NO-ONE has the knowledge of the coin placements.<br/><br/><br/><ul><li> In the LandRocker game, players have a mission to explore and mine the space with all the equipment provided in the game open market.<br/></li><li> They can buy, craft, and sell games\u2019 properties, and they can play individually or in a team-up activity<br/></li><li> LandRocker could be played using all the available platforms.

The mission is to explore, dig, and find worthy resources and get paid for the amount they find. These resources are all distributed and then validated by smart contracts.<br/></li><li> As we said, players can team up in unions and commercial organizations for efficient work and communication.<br/></li><li> The game currency, <strong>Infinite Coins (INF)</strong>, is the basis for economic relations among players.</li></ul><br/><br/><br/>The LandRocker open space is stabilized in the real economic model and functions due to the open market laws. Players have access to resources, planets, and mining tools. They can lend money, borrow, or invest in others' works, and grow their commercial activity way beyond the main game focuses.<br/>Like a real economic system, a well thought monetizing circulation has been designed to make it a complete DAPP from the beginning and could be released and maintained by users themselves through games private VM.<h3>LandRocker Future:</h3>We are making an infrastructure to invest in gaming industries with a new win-win concept so users alongside the game owners could benefit from it.<br/><ul><li> In this platform, we could use advertisements in line with the user's goals and without any mediators, we use smart contracts to manage them for us that makes it profitable for both sides,<br/></li><li> Google Stadia is a platform that we are focusing to be available for in near feature,<br/></li><li> Creating New IEO\u2019s methodologies for new Coins to come in the game environment will be one of our focuses in the near future,<br/></li><li> Above all, creating an engine that could add and monetize any game concept, is another important mission for our team.</li></ul><br/>Right now, LandRocker is in Alpha state, we will be ready to accept gamers to play and test the game features in autumn 2020 and we are focusing to be playable on both Consoles and Mobiles in the same and <strong>integrated networks</strong>.<h3>The Size Of Universe:</h3>Something around 5*(10^16) planet will be available for users.<h3>The Size Of IEO:</h3>Something around 10\u2019000 coins will be available on each planet that makes it 5*(10^20) INF Token in total.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-27T21:55:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f8/0f85192ec007b5d369f7f5ac2e62c274.jpg", "website": "https://landrocker.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 353, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Infinite8"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["Infinite8"], "esrb_rating": null}
