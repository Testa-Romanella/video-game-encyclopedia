It was made in a month based off of a nightmare the developer had. Actually, if you don't want Trump nightmares, then you're better off not playing this game. If you like it, then maybe donate to buy the dev a cup of coffee. If you hate it, buy coffee anyway and come pour it on the devs head.</p><p>Credits:<br/></p><p>3DMaesen - environment assets  |  Gage Skidmore - Trump photography  |Mark DiAngelo - Explosion sound  |  SoundBits - Sound effects  |  Dustyroom - Sound effects  |  LinneaS88 on Fiver - for trailer voice</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a0/5a0e5c6d5ec4db037cccff9914187a2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["shoinwolfe"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
