Spread the time better and maybe start a smaller project next time. I'm going to catch up on the sleep I've had the last few days.What I would have liked to add. If there was still time:storyMore craft recipesMore enemiesMore oreBigger mapcooperativeMore gunSkills/Skills tree(Maybe in the future)Helpful videos that helped me with the development:Nonetheless, it was a great experience and a lot of fun. (Develops on a person).Have fun playing.Easter Egg: An opponent that should actually come into play but for which there was not enough time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T06:24:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/947/947a8df52745c47fcca29a887e8972dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gamercom24"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
