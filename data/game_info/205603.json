With this social and situational awareness, the goal is to build rapport by avoiding an inappropriate invasion of interpersonal space based on the other person's culture.<br/><br/>The setting is placed in VR for the player to be a spy needing to go undercover to gain intel. The cultural clue is given in the form of music and picture, and the player must use the knowledge they have to decide how to interpret the clue and how best to approach the separate avatar. If the player chooses the incorrect interpersonal positioning then their cover is blown. If the correct choice is made, then the mission is successful. <br/><br/></p>\n<p>Video created by Ron Tolley<br/>Coding created by Josh Jones<br/>Music created by Karina Pardus<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/370/370f110a912e7f8e73b2d35496883bb8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["coycompositions"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
