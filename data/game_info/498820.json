It is now a collectathon that likely doesn't work because we finished it 2 minutes before the deadline. Feedback/bug help is appreciated.</p>\n<p>Use WASD or the arrow keys to control the cat, and SPACE to interact/talk. Also, be sure to talk to cats, most of them are pretty generous felines. Some even give you hints if you talk to them again!</p>\n<p>This was our first ever game, period, and also our first game jam.\u00a0We're really proud of the music,\u00a0 as all music is produced in house and\u00a0we have no composers on the team. Actually, everything but fonts is produced by us.</p>\n<p>This is literally the prototype of the the prototype of the prototype of the prototype. Just about everything is broken. Also, we chose a genre (RPG-ish) that needs tons of development time and yet most of the programming happened in the span of 2 days because of school.\u00a0If there is a prize for worst game in the jam, we have it in the bag! But we learned a lot and had tons of fun, so I hope you do too!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T05:12:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6db/6dbfab93166b8d6f60304f22f3b1b2fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["TrinityGamesDev"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
