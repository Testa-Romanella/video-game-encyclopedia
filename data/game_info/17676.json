This edition also includes a copy of the original Doom in its Ultimate version.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The plot is identical to Doom 3. The game is set on Mars in the 22nd century. The player controls a nameless space marine (nicknamed &quot;Doomguy&quot; by the fans). His task is to defeat the demons of Hell that invaded the Delta Labs research facility. Doom 3 features the series&#39; trademark violence, monsters, and black humor.</p>\n<h3>Expansion packs</h3>\n<p>BFG Edition includes two expansion packs. The Resurrection of Evil was previously released in 2005. The plot, set two years after Doom 3, follows a team that comes to a space station and discovers the hellish Artifact. This expansion introduces new weapons, such as The Grabber and the double-barreled shotgun, as well as additional multiplayer maps.</p>\n<p>The Lost Mission is a new story expansion that was not previously released. It allows you to play as a marine from the Bravo squad that was only mentioned in the original Doom 3.
