This game is tough. There are no continues for a Commando. It will take skill and patience to beat the mountain. <br/>\r\nThe world is watching, and you're the only man who can do it!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCommando Mountain Rescue's gameplay is platform based, with precise jumps to master, raining rocks to avoid and giant rolling boulders to outrun. Nature also throws viscous tornados and avalanches your way, as well as a host of wild creatures including mountain goats, snakes, cougars, bears and more to either fight or flight!<br/>\r\nThere are 3 unique levels - easy, medium, hard - and the aim of each is to rescue 3 stranded survivors (9 in total). The challenging part will be to jump, dodge, and battle your way to the top of each peak, achieving the ultimate reward of completing the mission and conquering the mountain!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T04:52:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08e/08e7631b3a2f34e7f971713e92ce7d1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 354, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JabroniGames", "John Jackson"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Jabroni Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
