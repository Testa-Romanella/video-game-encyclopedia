He now has all but one crystal, which you happen to possess. With no means of using it however, you must do all you can to buy the rest of the world time to prepare before all Hell breaks loose. The Devil is rapidly gaining power, there is no winning this fight. You're only delaying the inevitable.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\n<p>Devil of Destiny is a boss fight game where your only objective is to survive for as long as possible. The Devil cannot be killed, and his attacks grow stronger and faster. Shooting him will stall his power gain, giving you an extra edge in order to survive for longer.

The fight feels a bit barebones, if i had more time i would've added more attacks. Might *actually* make a post jam version this time. I also apologize to everyone who doesn't get the movie reference that inspired this whole idea.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T09:22:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af8/af8702b66298415e232b8adb874b1c10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fatsheep"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
