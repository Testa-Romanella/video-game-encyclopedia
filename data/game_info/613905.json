Oct 24, 2003. You're given access to the houses of three suspects. It's your task to collect proof and find the murderer.</p>\n<p>This game was originally made for the Brackeys game jam 2020.2 (August).\u00a0The game was nowhere\u00a0close to playable at the time of the\u00a0deadline, so it wasn't submitted.\u00a0 After some bug fixing and polish, it's overall not a terrible game though so why not publish it? Yes, a year later. Enjoy our second game; have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T04:58:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/329/3293325f5dee694cd32977c09eed11cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["leotti"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
