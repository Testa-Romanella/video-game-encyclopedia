I initially had tons of ideas such as multiple distractions/traps as tropes, unlockable monsters (horror clowns, masked men, little ghostly girls etc)\u00a0 each with their own abilities, pros and cons.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Multiple cabin locations etc.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, time was not on my side. I may further explore this prototype in the future. Until then, this is just\u00a0 that.. a buggy messy prototype :).</p>\n\n<p>Assets by Kenney (https://kenney.nl/)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T10:41:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1cd/1cd105858131631eb4c610e08c33cf10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mrpeanutbelly"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
