They were trying to make their games addictive and fun gameplay-wise, not relying on a phrase \"it's new therefore it's good\". I intended to bring back this style of gamedev - StarShip is, right from it's title, a simple game. You control your spaceship with 2 analog sticks (gamepad required), left trigger is a standard rifles, right - a minigun that takes away your Power. Once you accumulate full Power (over time or by killing enemies) you can unleash a powerful Beam Attack by clicking two triggers at the same time.</p>\n<p>To advance to the next level, simply destroy every spawner and alien on the map. Should you need some help, with enough luck a fallen foe will drop you a health pack, don't be afraid to use it.</p>\n<p>Good luck shooting down hordes of aliens!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20a/20ab0f9e2b07b93f5f6e3660febad828.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Walik"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
