{"id": 767937, "slug": "rps-arena", "name": "RPS Arena", "name_original": "RPS Arena", "description": "<p>RPS Arena.</p>\n<p>Pick a team of champions and send them in to battle in each round. Of course your opponent has an unlimited supply of champions and you only have thirty. So your one and only goal is to delay your inevitable defeat for as long as possible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your rock warriors, paper tigers and scissor ninjas make up your champions. Oh, did I forget to mention that RPS stands for Rock, Paper and Scissors? Yep, it does and the same rules apply.</p>\n<p>This was developed for the Ludum Dare 50 game jam. Written in about 12 hours over a 48 hour period. It's an idea I've been mulling around for awhile now. There are few issues with this playable prototype. First you sometimes get a double win, then again so does the computer. It pretty much balances out so... Second the end of a round isn't always determined properly so there's also a timer. Just give it a few second and the round will force end.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If this game does well in the LD game jam, or at least receives positive comments,\u00a0I have plans to rewrite it as a mobile offering with better graphics, more defined battle sequences and animations, and the option to play against a live opponent head to head.</p>\n<p>Dev Log will be published in a day or two. If you see it listed as one of the videos then it's already live.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-09T04:08:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42a/42ae1b52dc1ea43246dda356551814de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HungryCatGames"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
