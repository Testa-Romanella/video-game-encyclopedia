We know the feeling!<br/><br/>But, also tired of counting the points yourself? Or forget to turn those 50 point cards from time to time? We're here to help!<br/>Carcapp is an app that does the scoring for you. Simply add the players and tell the app which player gets points. We'll do the counting for you and show a ranking of all players.<br/><br/>Enjoy Carcassonne, don't cheat ;-) And good luck!<br/><br/><br/>* This is not a full game of Carcassonne.
