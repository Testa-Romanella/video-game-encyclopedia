In Japan, the color of the cartridges often matches the color of their original Famicom carts. In North America, all games in this series were released in a light gray cart made to resemble the default color of NES carts.</p>\n<p>All of these games were released to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Famicom in Japan.</p>\n<p>The Jaleco releases in the series were found to use the PocketNES emulator. The author has stated he supports the decision and stated it as one of the reasons he used for releasing his emulator in the public domain.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2004-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
