The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a unique solution.<br/><br/>Completed puzzles are always a type of Latin square with an additional constraint on the contents of individual regions. For example, the same single integer may not appear twice in the same row, column or in any of the nine 3\u00d73 subregions of the 9x9 playing board.<br/><br/>Features:<br/>- Unlimited sudokus in 4 different difficulty settings.<br/>- Great statistics that help track your progress.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:03:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/903/9039bf006ba6d69eb298ed3cc73fd805.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Yuan LiHua"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Yuan LiHua"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
