Proving a challenge for even the most seasoned player.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u201cI think the golden age of gaming just got here :)\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u201cYou nailed it when you overhauled the game a couple of releases ago. It's a joy to play, congrats on the full release.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u201cTo be honest this game took me by surprise, I just could not stop playing it.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u201cThe graphic style I must admit I love and the attention to detail is just amazing, one of the things I like the most apart from the game itself is building your own spacecraft it's really, really fun. This game is a must have.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u201cA big thumbs up. Another one of those VR titles that reinvigorates the genre.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u201cThis game takes me back to Gummi Ship building in Kingdom Hearts 1. Mostly the same principle. Spend points to buy ship structure, engine, power generators and weapons. \u201c<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u201cThe potential here is huge, you play this game and literally dream of where this concept can go.\u201c<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u201cSimple, fun and exhilarating gameplay, build the best ship your credits can buy to beat the game at the hardest level!\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u201cWhat a Great game, i really love the the building system in this game that you can build your own ship and shot your way through levels of levels. Its really enjoyable to just destroy everything on the map \u201c", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:06:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/295/2954da0ee6822c7119dbbdea6c844ff1.jpg", "website": "http://www.zenzvr.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 6}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 303, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zenz VR"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Zenz VR"], "esrb_rating": null}
