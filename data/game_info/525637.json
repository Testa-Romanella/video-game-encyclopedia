We use a combination of stunning pixel art, music, and unique narrative techniques to paint a charming postmodern story that will keep players intrigued and entertained until the end.<br/><br/><strong>100+ HANDCRAFTED CHALLENGES\u200b</strong><br/>This game features a distinct gameplay mechanic: our hero cannot move on his own, so you\u2019ll have to rotate platforms and manipulate environments to launch him around a beautiful 16-bit world. You'll need logic, brainpower, quick reflexes, and unconditional trust in A.I.D.E. to pass more than a hundred highly polished levels.

Given the history of our games, it wouldn\u2019t surprise us anymore.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Note: Audio is required to progress through the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T03:31:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e0/6e0a45508eb1a22dc67fc57d83015330.jpg", "website": "https://www.appsirgames.com/p/puzzling-peaks-exe.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Darius Immanuel D.
