Alongside the creatures and spell cards that can be found within their decks, each player can use their special ability to gain the upper hand on their opponent. During the game, the players will have a set amount of Lapis Lazuli which determines the type of spells they can cast, or creatures they can summon to the battlefield and when. With these spells and creatures, the players can choose to attack the opponent\u2019s creatures on the battlefield or go for a direct hit to the opponent's character themselves. There can only be 1 winner.<br/></p>\n<p>NOTE: The current build of Pandora's Box is a prototype and is actively being developed. The current build is by no means the finished game. I am currently seeking user feedback and constructive criticism to help further develop the game into the best possible version it can be.<br/><strong>If you have any feedback, feel free to fill out this google form.<br/>Find any bugs?
