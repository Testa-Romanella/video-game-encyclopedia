If you have never before tried any of the Humongous products, then you are in for a pleasant surprise, and you may find yourself sneaking to the computer once your child is sound asleep.\u201d <br/><br/>\u201cI played with Clare for a lot of this game, not because she needed me to, but because we both wanted to. At 8 years old she would certainly be in the top end of the target audience, and my input into what to do next was negligible. She was able to work her way through all the conundrums, with only the occasional nudge. She thought that the game was \"just right\" as far as the challenges were concerned.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cThis adventure game provides kids with plenty of opportunities to develop problem-solving skills as they sleuth their way through a colorful underwater world.\u201d<br/><br/>FEATURES:<br/>\u2022 New locations and puzzles each time you play! <br/>\u2022 Packed with puzzles, games and activities! <br/>\u2022 Find the clues and collect the tools to solve the mystery!<br/><br/>This product uses ScummVM which is released under the GNU GPL v2. <br/>For more information, please visit - https://www.scummvm.org <br/>The GNU GPL can be viewed here - https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-20T02:09:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20c/20c0143d0a30b47e1101a4b083d1baca_S9fwFQN.jpg", "website": "http://www.humongous.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 15, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Humongous Entertainment"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Educational"], "publishers": ["Tommo"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
