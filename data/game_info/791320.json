If that happens, you can use the SPACEBAR to reset with a new level.</li><li>Every time a new level is generated (either by winning or manually resetting), the blocks move faster and are harder to control.</li><li>If keyboard input is not working, try clicking inside the play area to return active focus to the game.</li></ul>\n<p>Made for\u00a0Low Effort Jam 22 (theme:\u00a0\"Three\") as an excuse to try out the\u00a0Kaboom.js game engine.
