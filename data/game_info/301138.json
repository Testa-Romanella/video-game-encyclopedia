Instead of having an attack stat and random numbers, your attack is the number on the die that's currently face up (although you still can miss). When you kill another die, you recover hp (the amount recovered is the number they had face up). Gain xp by killing die, explore the dungeons, and escape! <br/></p>\n<p>Controls <br/>Esc: bring up the quit menu <br/>wasd or up/down/left/right keys: move your character <br/>mouse: used for clicking buttons on the menus </p>\n<p>Resources:\u00a0<br/>https://opengameart.org/content/202-more-sound-effects<br/>https://game-icons.net/1x1/sbed/key.html<br/>https://game-icons.net/1x1/lorc/padlock.html<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-11T03:38:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c9/5c939905102fac05da896ba2c08c321b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BigBread"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
