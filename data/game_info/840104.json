Bo is just trying to stay afloat. </p>\n<p>Buoy begins with Volume I: Ebb, as Bo navigates a deep, dark, damp cave. In the cave, Bo is guided by a firefly to escape the shadow of Bog, a lonely water monster whose hugs can drown.</p>\n<p>Every month, a new chapter to Buoy is released and Bo faces new obstacles. At the end of each chapter comes a short story of someone\u2019s firsthand experiences with mental health. The obstacles in each new chapter are loosely based on the monthly story.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can submit your own story to be shared (anonymously if you wish) through our website.
