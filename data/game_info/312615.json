Roving its interminable wastes the nomad chances upon a sentient revolver beside an ominous pile of remains.</p>\n<p>The pistol offers its exploit in exchange for a pledge of inextricable compansionship. Espousing to be the player&#39;s conscience the dubious weapon directs the drifter to a nearby outpost wherein the story further unfolds.</p>\n<p>Despite its appearance as a wasteland the rift is home to many strange denizens---<br />\nsome volatile and others ineffectual. Whatever their disposition the pistol represents the choice to engage them or to spare them. Aggression and passivity have their appropriate times with rewards and consequences being granted to both paths respectively.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-10T17:01:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31e/31efb247c6ed19ccf7c4e6ac3817a56b.jpg", "website": "https://gamejolt.com/games/middens/9657", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 289, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Gunseed Collab"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["The Gunseed Collab"], "esrb_rating": null}
