It is based on an 8-bit AVR microcontroller, the ATmega644, which has 64 KBytes of ROM and 4 KBytes of RAM, driving video directly through an 8-bit port. It is clocked at 28.6MHz, however much of the processing time is taken for generating video signal, and most of what's left to compose the graphics.</p>\n<p>The source code of the game is available on GitHub.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T10:00:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e24/e24f4cc732487d3a468b41474d0317a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jubatian"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
