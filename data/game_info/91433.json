No physics simulation, no weapons - just master the boost, the drift, and the extreme speed of your ship through impossible loops and turns.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOr just play on the pre-made tracks and simply enjoy the thrill of high speed, no gravity racing!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nThe demo\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe game is still in development and \r\n\t<strong>this version is an early demo</strong> to showcase the core features of the game, and put them to the test. We're looking for feedback on the editor and suggestions on how to improve its usability, as well as general impressions on the racing controls.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSo, we'd like to hear from you!
