{"id": 117425, "slug": "infinity", "name": "Infinity (itch)", "name_original": "Infinity (itch)", "description": "What is Infinity?Infinity is a simple game. It has simple objectives, and a simple goal. The game features progressively harder levels. Each level builds upon the previous. Some levels feature verticality, while others have small platforms. The player must execute precise jumps, and movements in order to complete a level. However, what sets Infinity apart from other platformers, is the lack of checkpoints. Infinity does not feature saves, checkpoints or level selection. You simply play to complete all levels. We offer three gamemodes, Standard Play, Progressive Play, and Training. Standard Play is the 12 level experience. Players will play through 12 levels, all expanding upon different ideas, and introducing new challenges. Progressive Play is part of our post launch objective. This gamemode has one lengthy and challenging level. Post launch, we will be extending the length and modifying parts of the level. Training is a way for players to practice their skills in a safe environment. We intend on expanding this gamemode significantly post launch.Why purchase Infinity?Infinity will be supported for one year post launch. We will be adding even more content (Levels/Gamemodes) to the game. The entry fee is a guaranteed ticket for no priced DLC content.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:54:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7bd/7bdbb6bee730762acbfe4ed084092540.jpg", "website": "https://nonamedevelopments.wixsite.com/website", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TeamInfinite", "NoName Developments"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["NoName Developments"], "esrb_rating": null}
