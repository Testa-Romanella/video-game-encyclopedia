Absolutely couldn't have made it in time without him &lt;3<br/></p>\n<p>My self-imposed goal for this was to find an interesting way to explore this visual style while not doing any crunch \u2014 in the spirit of the jam. It's got bugs and it's got less content than planned, and I'm supremely happy with it. <br/></p>\n<p>Controls: WASD to move, E to interact, other controls will be given during gameplay. Launch the .exe file to play, there will probably be an Unreal popup you can happily ignore.</p>\n<p>Code design audio etc by me, props+animations by Martin. Additional sound effects from https://www.zapsplat.com.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T11:38:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa9/fa9ce3a1c404335858d24fcdc5dd4adc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MrMandolino"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
