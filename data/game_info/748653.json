You can do that and more in Squarena!<br/><br/>Squarena is a skill-based party game with an emphasis on physics combat. The game mechanics support ease of entry with a high skill ceiling. Enjoy a variety of arenas and variations in this 2D physics arena shooter, where your character's health determines its size. The lower your health, the smaller you become which makes it easier to maneuver and avoid bullets, but it also means the recoil from shooting will have a bigger impact on you!
