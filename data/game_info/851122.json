What you see here is just a vertical slice of what could be a full game,\u00a0 and a testing of the waters of\u00a0 what goes in to\u00a0designing a metroidvania.\u00a0 This is my second game that I completed using the Unity game engine, and as you can see, is a little bit rough around the edges in some areas. I tried to complete as much as I can with the given time frame,\u00a0 so I hope you enjoy my 1 month of work! Constructive criticisms of course, are always appreciated, and if you want to, you can follow me on itch to see what other projects I might have in store *wink wink*</p>\n<p>--CREDITS--</p>\n<p>Music: darlingSaw\u00a0</p>\n<p>YT:\u00a0https://youtube.com/channel/UChXMjeupViL8Jmk_0UmTwYA</p>\n<p>Art/Programming: SeanSS\u00a0</p>\n<p>TWT:\u00a0https://twitter.com/SeanSS_twt</p>\n<p>TWITCH:\u00a0https://www.twitch.tv/seansslive</p>\n<p>YT:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgKwyrTijiutn-eZR_XzKkg</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T11:28:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a25/a25b353b94a133f6032103490d8b1467.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["SeanSS"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
