But as I implemented small stuffs one by one, I kind of wanted to make it as little flash game that I could consider complete. So in a short amount of time, I went for a pixel art style in inspiration of my old Gameboy games. Then I decided to create more levels and different worlds. In the end, I had a total of 3 worlds having 10 levels\u00a0each.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To be frank, the game is quite hard to finish (I do love making hard level design), and I could have done more polish for my final result, but as I was making this project for fun and to learn more about gameplay coding, I wanted to finish it in a time limit so I could spend more time on other projects. Still, it was a nice time\u00a0doing this little flash game, so I hope you will enjoy playing it !</p>\n<p>A few lines about the game itself ! Basically, the game is a mix between a auto-scroller and a platformer. The only input of the game is the Space bar, and every gameplay elements of the game is based just on that one mechanic. One of the subtile\u00a0 mechanics of the game, is the ability to change gravity. So go on then, and give it a try !</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing and for reading these lines, and stay tuned for my future works on Itch.io or anything else !</p>\n<p>Follow me on twitter :\u00a0https://twitter.com/FarissierM</p>\n<p>Martin \"DBootJ\" Farissier.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T09:27:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d1/2d197c3038b5d7e771ea798ee242e4b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DBootJ"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
