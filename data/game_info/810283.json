Despite its original entry garnering large attraction out of region, this edition of Joker 2 was only made available in Japan on 31st March, 2011. On the bright side, fan-translations have been made to account for this.</h2>\n<p>The revamped version of the game shares the same storyline of its initial entry, although it does stray with adding extra sequences. In addition to that, there&#39;s a few visual changes players of the original may notice, such as the protagonist&#39;s clothing changing from red to blue. There are new maps to explore, with more items to collect and craft.</p>\n<p>As a call back to previous titles of the Dragon Quest series, and as a bonus incentive to pick up the game, the game also includes 100 new monsters to find and synthesize. Most of which come from the recent &#39;Dragon Quest IX&#39; and &#39;Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime&#39; titles at the time. To go in par with that, there&#39;s a new &quot;final-final&quot; boss for players to seek out- which can prove a challenging opponent compared to other bosses before it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-28T03:40:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/baf/baf437083487a138d78c852a005d6785.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 35, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": ["Tose"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Fighting"], "publishers": ["Square Enix"], "esrb_rating": null}
