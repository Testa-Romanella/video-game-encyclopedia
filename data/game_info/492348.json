The game now relies on some good old candy on vegetable violence.</p>\n<p>Oh yeah and about the vegetables. Due to budget cuts, the game only includes one vegetable. Still makes a good soup though!</p>\n\n<p>Hope you enjoy.</p>\n\n\n<p>#######</p>\n<p>This was the first game I ever made. I actually just started with game dev about 7 ays ago, so you know it's going to be good! ;-)</p>\n<p>The audio really sucks. Sorry about that.\u00a0I ran out of time to record something decent.</p>\n<p>#######<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T12:17:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53b/53b289651fc91dbc15eb3fd34cdf76dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["dmetron"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
