You can find androids and an alien inside the level, along with fascinating plant life. The goal of this project was to create a science fiction video game level from scratch, with my own original 3D assets and code. These are the software programs I used to complete the project: Unity, Maya, Substance Painter, Adobe Photoshop, and UV Layout.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T06:55:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/333/333c17bd61bfc6e0fa1e3305a9f0c390.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["connorjbryant"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
