It has 4 colors on its sides: red, yellow, green and blue but we must pass with the opposite colors to those of the platforms to get the highest possible score as it is an infinite runner.... Right?\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>In this game you can collect power ups and balls of wool and we must dodge the saws... or not. Remember, nothing is what it seems! At least that's the theme of this Jam ;)\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanics</strong>:\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Jump</strong>: With the keys \"W\", \"Space\" and \"Up\" we will activate a jump with which we will dodge oppositions and it will be necessary to continue with our path.\r\n</li><li><strong>Rotate</strong>: With the keys \"A,D\" and \"Left, Right\" we will rotate our character to place it with the corresponding color on the ground. It will be able to work while we are in the air when we jump.\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T07:27:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08d/08dc540ce6ef53f827c5fa653cc1ab75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZeroZer0"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
