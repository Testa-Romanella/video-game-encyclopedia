Help him read the minds of the children to figure out what they want.</p>\n\n<p>This game was created for the Let's Create Game Jam #2 with the theme of Psychic Powers<br/></p>\n<p>The game was written using the Godot Engine</p>\n\n<p>Children will sit by Santa for a chat - indulge in a long enough conversation to go up through their mind until you find what they are after.</p>\n<p>Leaving them hanging will shorten their attention span.</p>\n<p>Asking the same questions over and over again will make them impatient and asking odd or offensive questions will make them angry.</p>\n<p>All children get a gift, but those that get exactly what they wanted will be extra thrilled.</p>\n\n<p>Controls - arrows or wasd to move and jump, and 1-2-3 to select the next question (numpad OK).</p>\n\n<p>Santa's questions are in blue, replies are in green and silent thoughts are in magenta.</p>\n\n<p>Game is experimental, due to time constraints for the Game Jam submission. Also, game was not properly beta-tested. Please report bugs if you find any.</p>\n\n<p>Enjoy, and spread the holiday spirit!</p>\n\n\n<p>Game design and art: Tacratis</p>\n<p>Font:\u00a0UnAuthorized Type (Created by\u00a0Ben McGehee)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/050/050740caacca8bed0a3d2a8ca5ad683f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tacratis"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
