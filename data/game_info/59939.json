You'll be given randomized goals in order to complete enemy waves. In-between waves you'll spend currency on items that modify your jet in various ways. Zones end with random boss encounters. Difficulty is pretty harsh, you'll probably die a lot. But each next run will play out a little different. Throughout the game you'll unlock additional items to find on later runs. The game is fairly light on story, but you might piece together things through item descriptions and combat chatter.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Feature list?</strong><br/>- Juicy, impact-full and tense 2d air combat, framed in a weird sci-fi universe<br/>- Colorful pixel art, powered by the Pico8 16 color palette<br/>- More than a hundred different passive items, some providing simple bonuses, some completely changing how your jet behaves<br/>- More then 50 sci-fi jet weapons, including lasers, explosives and aerial melee options<br/>- 40+ active items used for offense, defense or utility<br/>- Strong focus on synergies and weird jet builds.

Not very innovative.</strong><br/>HDog was born from mashing together elements of my favorite roguelikes. So yeah, in the larger scope of indie games, it probably isn't very innovative. Please expect the game to be an iterative but proven design with known mechanics and decent replayability. I had fun making it and weirdly enough I still have fun playing it, so I just hope that it works for you too! &lt;3<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Why does this game not have controller support? Will that be added?</strong><br/>Some item/abilities in the game need you to be able to control your mouse cursor separately from the ship. (It'll make sense when you get those items.) Right now I don't think I can reconcile this with controller controls. I'm still investigating this but can't promise anything. For now please assume that the game won't support controllers.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Can I get the game without all that screenshake? That stuff gives me a headache...</strong><br/>Yep, all the feedback stuff can be configured/turned off in the options.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>I found a bug?!?</strong><br/>We did a year long alpha but there is still the possibility that some things slipped through the cracks. Please report your findings in the steam forum or contact me on twitter and I'll look into it. <br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3<br/>Stefan Widany \u2013 Sleeper Games", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29f/29fd040873693dd9b648c8066d2a48af.jpg", "website": "http://www.hyperspacedogfights.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 10, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sleeper Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sleeper Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
