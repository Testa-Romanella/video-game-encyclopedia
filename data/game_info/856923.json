The sole purpose of the hospital is to find the best method in which to raise and harness an inner beast that can reside within a child. After 60 years of very small progress the hospital is being threatened to have all funds cut and the entire facility along with it's doctors disposed of.\r\nWith time running out the doctors at the facility shift their attention to a promising child that arrived 2 years earlier.\r\nYou play as that child's brother.</p>\n<p><strong>Current known issues</strong></p>\n<p>- Light bleeding through Level 1\u00a0security door and not showing up when door is opened. [This happens because the light doesn't properly identify the object in front of it as a wall.]</p>\n<p>-Light bleeding through top of security doors from the second floor on to the first floor</p>\n<p>- When you enter a room without your light on it will reset and turn back on. This small problem also causes the player to have to press L twice in order to turn off the light. The problem with resolve it self after that.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Message from creator</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This is just an upgraded version of the previous playtest demo. I'm definitely making headway with the longer demo. I'm pretty bad at social media but I may start trying to upload my progress for those who are curious about the progress. Rambling aside please don't feel shy to leave any criticism.\r\n</p>\n<p>I would love some feedback, compliments, or anything really lol\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T09:06:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d8/5d8e99a8a6282be01ca76becddbe113b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Enigma"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
