Bit ironic that I did it in a jam based off ms paint. Hey, at least I didn't need to stress over the art too much.\u00a0It was also the first game jam I worked on it with someone.\u00a0Roshi was a great person to work with! Honestly I really enjoyed the process of this game. Me and Roshi should be making game devlogs for the game soon, so then you can see the full experience of making it.
