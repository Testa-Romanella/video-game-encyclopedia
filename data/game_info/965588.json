Last August I lost a good childhood friend of mine and took it pretty hard. When I was visiting my hometown for his funeral, I connected with his parents who shared with me some of his old belongings. Among them was a copy of an old map of his backed up on a 3.5\u201d floppy from high school. Thomas and I were into amateur Doom mapping in the early 00s but I had never seen this map of his prior to uncovering it on one of the old floppy discs. As a way of paying tribute to him and all the great memories we had together, I took the plunge and installed Doom Builder in order to polish up his map and add a few modern amenities just for convenience sake.</p>\n<p>I haven\u2019t touched an editor in over 15 years so it was quite a surprise to find out how easy mapping has become. I may have gotten a little carried away with these new UDMF features and, as such, the map is designed for GZDoom. From the text file:</p>\n<pre><code>Doom 2 - GZDoom, hardware renderer  \n1 map: Not much of a challenge and roughly 10 minutes of play time. All difficulty settings implemented.  \nJumping &amp;amp; crouching disabled, freelook is fine  \nLots of Doomcute!\n</code></pre>\n<p>Making maps of your house was all the rage back-in-the-day, but I feel like this is a pretty adorable and detailed tribute to my friend and a great way to share something of him with a community we loved. Miss you, Tom.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-28T14:10:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/781/78123c9fecfbda0c07828da58c911cf0.jpg", "website": "https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/134292-myhousewad/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "beaten": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
