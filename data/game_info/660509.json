{"id": 660509, "slug": "haunted-vines", "name": "Haunted Vines", "name_original": "Haunted Vines", "description": "<p>In Haunted Vines you must try to gather food for your family by trekking through a haunted forest which grows uncontrollably.</p>\n<p>Use your axe to cut down vines and make a path, lay stones to stop vines growing and tread carefully. Watch out for the ghost that haunts the forest - you can't hurt it, and it can camouflage itself as some vines; can you keep track of where is safe, or do you feel confident you can outrun it?</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Arrow keys: move</p>\n<p>X: Chop vines down</p>\n<p>C: Lay stone down (if you have collected one)</p>\n<p>R: Reset game</p>\n\n<p>Items:</p>\n<p>Apple: Collect these and bring back to your house to score points</p>\n<p>Axe: Collecting this will give you 3 more\u00a0cuts with your Axe</p>\n<p>Stone: Once collected, you can place this down to prevent vines growing in that area</p>\n<p>Note that picking up an item will anger the forest and cause it to grow uncontrollably!</p>\n\n<p>Hints &amp;\u00a0Tips:</p>\n<p>1. Up to 3 vines can be cut with a single swing if you position yourself correctly</p>\n<p>2. The less vines there are before you pick up an item, the less growth there'll be</p>\n<p>3. The player character can squeeze between 2 diagonal vines</p>\n<p>4. The ghost will give up chasing you if you can get far enough away</p>\n\n<p>This game was created for Godot Wild Jam #36 with the theme Uncontrollable Growth, and using the Wildcard 'Now you see me, now you don't' to include camouflaged elements.</p>\n<p>As always, really open to feedback on what you liked/disliked and how it could be better next time. (Keeping in mind that I am a solo dev with not a lot of time - approx 10 hours spent on this)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T18:18:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fb/7fb23de336e266ff42361c58a96cb17e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["KnightAdz"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
