With a focus on players who enjoy simulation and strategy games, this modern game targets both casual and hardcore gamers, catering to young adults and adults interested in business and entrepreneurship.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game starts with a small store in a local shopping center, and it's up to the players to attract customers by offering high-quality products and exceptional customer service. As their business expands, players will need to hire employees, build relationships with suppliers and customers, and compete in challenges to obtain exclusive rights to sell special items unavailable elsewhere. To stay ahead of the competition, players must expertly manage inventory, pricing, and marketing strategies, all while navigating the complex web of city taxes and laws.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe innovative AI \"State-Machine\" ensures that employees and customers react quickly and realistically, providing a truly immersive experience. Employees have unique traits and skills, requiring expert management to hire, train, and discipline them effectively. Players must also manage employee stress levels, as neglecting staff can lead to high turnover rates.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCustomers, on the other hand, are picky yet prone to manipulation. Players must employ various tactics to entice customers to spend more, such as carefully selecting store music, adjusting lighting, and strategically placing products to encourage impulse buys. Time spent in the store can also induce \"choice fatigue,\" further influencing customer purchasing behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"Urban Entrepreneur\" features three types of events that can change daily store operations: random events, semi-predictable occurrences, and scheduled events, such as the infamous Black Friday. Players must adapt their strategies to respond to these events and maintain a successful business.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAdditionally, players can implement policies to shape the way their store operates, such as requiring customer memberships, adjusting store hours, and offering employee benefits.
