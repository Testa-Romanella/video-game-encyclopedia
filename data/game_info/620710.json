{"id": 620710, "slug": "flesh-rock-mountain", "name": "Flesh? Rock? Mountain!", "name_original": "Flesh? Rock? Mountain!", "description": "<p><strong><em>Flesh? Rock? Mountain!</em></strong> is a game where the player and the mountain are joined together, as the character is a representation of the mountain, or vice versa.</p>\n<p>You must defeat the big evil in this great adventure, by wandering through immersive rooms, filled with all the details imaginable (no).</p>\n<p>Dialogue transcription in case it goes too fast:</p>\n<p><em>\"Inside a mountain, a\u00a0mountain person lives.\u00a0Is the mountain made\u00a0out of flesh? Or are\u00a0they made out of\u00a0mountain? They scream,\u00a0</em><em>for they do not know.</em> I\u00a0came here, following\u00a0the screams... So... The propechy... It was true... What I mean is that it\u00a0was told that one day,\u00a0when the mountain were\u00a0in great danger, it'll\u00a0come alive and fight\u00a0those who hurt it. And\u00a0it is you, you are\u00a0the mountain. Either that or somehow\u00a0you and the mountain\u00a0are joined together,\u00a0which I think is,\u00a0technically, the same. To use the keys, just\u00a0walk past the doors,\u00a0and they'll open. Press <strong>X</strong> to use a bomb. But beware!! As you\u00a0are the mountain, you\u00a0will take damage each\u00a0time one goes off. Now,\u00a0go away, and may the\u00a0luck be with you.\"</p>\n\n<p>PS: I know that with PICO-8 everybody's able to look the source code of a game so, please, do not do it. For your own sanity, you are warned. It is horrendous. But it somehow works, so I'm not gonna complain that much.</p>\n<p>Also, given that this is my first finished game, I'm more than satisfied with the result.</p>\n<p>Have fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T19:58:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49c/49c028483e5ec978b09ad773c36de8fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mlle.
