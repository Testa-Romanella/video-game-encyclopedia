Categories range from animals, colors, furniture, continents, sports, etc.<br/><br/>Anyway, drag the tile groups at the bottom of the screen and drop onto the puzzle screen which already has tiled word segments to form words specific to the category of the level. You can only complete words in a horizontal and vertical orientation. Diagonal doesn\u2019t work. At the top of the screen, you will notice a series of white \u201cbullets.\u201d These indicate how many words you are to find in the puzzle in order to succeed and move to the next level. <br/><br/>Wordpack is designed for anyone who likes word puzzles and word games. With this game you can easily improve your vocabulary, concentration and spelling skills.<br/><br/>Once you complete a word, the puzzle will highlight the word in color to indicate whether your move is correct or not. If you get stuck, click on the light bulb icon in the upper corner for a hint. You will initially get fifteen (15) free hints, and any more will be at cost. I am about three cities into the game and have yet to use all of my free hints, although, it is indeed getting harder.<br/><br/>*Wordpack Game DOES NOT REQUIRE THE INTERNET and COMPLETELY FREE and this game does not require unnecessary permission from your phone.*<br/><br/>Get your backpack ready, and start playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-10T02:29:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d89/d8929d178dea9e92345f15263e9288e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mizoreigar"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
