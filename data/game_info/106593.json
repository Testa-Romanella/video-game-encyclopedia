Light all the\r\nfireworks in each level before the match extinguishes. Mind the mobs!\r\nIf you fall or run too fast, the match will burn out faster.</p><p>\r\nOriginally\r\ncreated for the three-day \r\n\t<strong>Ludum Dare 28</strong> competition, <strong>YOGO\r\nMATCH!</strong> was improved in our spare time about six months.
