Brawling is the formula for<br />\nFullmetal Alchemist: Dual Sympathy, a side-scrolling action game that<br />\nputs players in the role of Edward Elric, the Fullmetal Alchemist, on a<br />\njourney to combat the evil Homunculi and acquire the fabled<br />\nPhilosopher\u2019s Stone.</p>\n<p>Alchemy might be hard, but controlling Fullmetal Alchemist is easy. You<br />\npress A to attack and B to jump. Players can execute different attack<br />\ncombos, but make no mistake: the game&#39;s formula calls for tons of<br />\nbrawling.</p>\n<p>The most valuable attacks come from the DS touch screen. Each of the six<br />\nplayable characters have special attacks, and to activate them, all<br />\nyou&#39;ll need to do is touch the appropriate icon on the touch screen.<br />\nEdward, for example, can put up walls and produce an explosion from a<br />\ncannon. To activate these attacks, you&#39;ll just need to touch the<br />\nrespective icon.</p>\n<p>As you fight through each level, you&#39;ll occasionally come across<br />\ntouch-screen challenges. You won&#39;t need to do this on-the-fly, which is<br />\nimportant to note. The game will stop and let you prepare for the<br />\nchallenge. In one challenge, for example, you&#39;ll need to untie a<br />\nkidnapped person.</p>\n<p>Bottom Line<br />\nAlthough this game will mainly appeal to Fullmetal<br />\nAlchemist fans, those who like brawlers should give it a look.</p>", "metacritic": 58, "released": "2006-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-07T13:08:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/320/32023ad4be0a257aed3b9b44d15b261f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 304, "game_series_count": 12, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": ["NATSUME"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Destineer", "Bandai"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
