It's been created to help players train their accuracy and timing in a snapshooting battle. If you can keep up with it, then you will be able to compete against the best.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a fps paintball mini game. In tournament paintball there are many different aspects to the game: game plans, clock management, communication with teammates, coaching, etc. But the most atomic part of the game is the gun fight. Snapshooting is when a player \"snaps\" out from behind cover and takes a few quick shots at their opponent to either cause them to flinch and gain dominance or hit them.</p>\n<p>Remember to switch hands. The gun should be in the hand of the side of the bunker you are leaning from.</p>\r\nNotes:\r\n<p>The quit doesn't work since this is a WebGL\u00a0build of the game. On a PC it would quit to windows.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/834/83404249d56fa46c68698d990f4d73a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["ebrown"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
