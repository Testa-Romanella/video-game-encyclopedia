The theme was \"3 of a kind\".</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>Each of your 3 key (QWE) controls a character on the screen. Your aim is to press the key when the circle is within the grey box. If you manage, you will be awarded points based on your precision.</p>\n\n<p><em>You can get \"Ok\", \"Super\" and \"PERFECT\" depending on your precision.</em><br/></p>\n\n<p>Chaining corrects inputs raise your combo meter, the higher the combo meter is, the more point you gain for each input! Be wary, missing a circle, or having false input reset your combo to 0 and you lose a life orb. You start with 5 orbs and once your reach 0, it's GAME OVER. There is 3 levels of difficulty, triggered when you reach a certain score, making the circle faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a GAME OVER, you are directed toward the High Score screen. If you are among the best, you have the opportunity to enter 3 letters to commemorate your achievment. Try to be <strong>#1</strong>!<br/></p>\n<p># Credits</p>\n<p>- All art and code done by me, source code and files available here. <br/></p>\n<p>- Music is It Feels -Good to be alive by  Loyalty Freak Music (CC0).</p>\n<p>- Font used is FieldGuide by rarelikeunicorn (CC BY 4.0)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T17:29:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef4/ef4c3f48cd879dafd2bd44e1c7dfcc41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Emberger"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
