The theme of the jam was 'Death is not the end, it's only the beginning'.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Arrow Keys/Left Stick - move/navigate menus</li><li>Enter/A Button - interact/select option</li><li>Escape/Y button - pause</li><li>Escape/B button - previous menu</li><li>Shift/ X button - Dash</li></ul>\r\nDownloads\r\n<p>There are two different versions available to play. The first download, labelled 'Jam Entry', is the game as it was upon submission to the jam. There exist several bugs, some minor spelling mistakes, and some of the weapons/spells/enemies could be classed as too strong or too weak.<br/></p>\n<p>The second, labelled with a version number, is an updated build of the game that has been changed after the jam finished. This build has fixes in place for the bugs found in the Jam Entry version, with changes also made to some of the stats for some of the spells, skills, weapons and enemies.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T05:26:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bcc/bcc2daae35d5b704663d358190cc3b9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 235, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Allus Interactive"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
