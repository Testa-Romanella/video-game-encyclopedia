I jumped into this game jam with no experience.\u00a0I spent a lot of the jams time watching tutorials and running into bugs. Initially I was not going to submit, however my gf urged me to. The game is buggy. It has no enemies (though I spent time doing all the art code for them, I think something was wrong with my collisions and masks). The game also has no sound. I will continue to work on this game after the jam so it's more enjoyable.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T14:06:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/889/88904df3d2a1e8aad268528ea57058c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dirt Goat Studios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
