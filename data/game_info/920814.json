All parts of a bonsai - the roots, trunk, branches, foliage and container - must, like traditional sculpture, express the artist's feeling for balance, form and line. When these are combined with the forces of the natural world, they can evoke a larger and deeper concept. A bonsai is a miniature representation of the mystery of the universe, unchanged in everything but size\"\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>-The Little Book of Bonsai</em></p>\n<p>Grow your own bonsai tree and maintain the perfect balance to score the most points. Prune the roots, control the growth,\u00a0 water your tree and stop spreading the infection from the evil weevils!</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T17:31:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41d/41d072e15e6bf944284a9731f87a6a7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CyclopsGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
