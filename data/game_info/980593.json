Under the cover of night, venture out of your house into the mysterious dark world and tend to your duties, the food won't grow itself.<br/><br/>Bone Meal is a game about gardening, except everything you plant grows eyes and teeth. Over the course of three seasons, you will stock up on food and resources you harvest from your plants under the glow of your lantern.<br/><br/><br/>Use various facilities around the grounds to your every advantage. Brew tonics at the still, and apply them to your plants to maximum effect. Use the sifter to roll new seeds until you find exactly what you're looking for, and freeze seeds for later use. Upgrade multiple aspects of the farm in the workshop, creating a specialized style of play. Compost, dig, and plant in either the garden or the greenhouse, each with their own quirks and plant types.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-22T07:39:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/227/227229d79b57b16a36201d75c3e46130.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rook Book Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Rook Book Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
