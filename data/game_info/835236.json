Many of the assets are not mine but are from other creators (the names of whom I don't know). This was just a fun project that I made to help introduce myself to Godot. I hope to be able to improve from this and create better games in the future. In this game, you are a lone adventurer who must try and end the Godot take over and destroy their leader. Be warned, this game can be pretty tricky (especially the beginning and the secret parkour section). I hope you enjoy and have fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T06:25:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea2/ea2e8d154c08f277795f308cd38b1f03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["gamelordofswager"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
