That's a game for more cyclops, but he had learnt to play alone.

FUTCCGCSC had learned to\u00a0<strong>slow time down</strong>. That was a huge thing for him. Yeah, he could only slow time by standing still, but even then that let him play his game and become better and better at dodging the beams. Maybe he will cheer up someday? Maybe after picking up\u00a0<strong>50 coins</strong> in one game?</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/972/972a361751f4f5d6ae1cdcfc03048e64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LeonardoDipilato"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
