{"id": 391176, "slug": "sightless-serene", "name": "Sightless Serene", "name_original": "Sightless Serene", "description": "<p><em><strong>SIGHTLESS SERENE</strong></em>\u00a0is my second complete game as well as my second game created with the RPG Maker series. My first game, Aurora, was produced in RPG Maker VX Ace and Sightless Serene was produced in RPG Maker MV. I've spent nearly 700 hours in RPG Maker MV creating this game and while it's a complete, fully functional game that can be completed from A to Z, there may be small hiccups in the game \u2014 including minor spelling and grammatical errors, scenes that may not not flow \"perfectly\" (but they are nearly perfect to me!), and other minor, non-game-breaking things. I'm very proud to release this and believe it's a very good game. This game has a lot of oomph to it and a very good story with several twists and turns that should leave you wanting more and asking questions. It was solely created by myself, independently, in my free time \u2014 700 hours taken from my weekends and weeknights after working my full-time job. <em>I don't expect everyone to like this game</em>, but any encouraging comments or even constructive criticism would be greatly appreciated. Again, I've spent a lot of time working on this game and really hope you, the player, come to enjoy it. If you do, I would encourage you to try my previous game as well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you find any bugs or game-breaking situations in the game, please let me know so I can attempt to duplicate and fix them. I'm sure something will happen that will cause the game to break, so I encourage you to save often when given the chance.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T04:11:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07f/07f95d9f2d419312d352774ac83f0e18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 266, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nicholas Turner Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
