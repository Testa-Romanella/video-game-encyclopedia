It is recommended for the final boss.</p>\n<p>What life does, well emm... we already know that hehe...<br/></p>\n<p>(To the left of each object tells you the price).</p>\n\n\n<p>I will not give details about the boss because otherwise this would be eternal... And it would be good if you discover it :)</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>So far my project, I hope you like it and can use it for your games.
