Limeguy is able to step around obstacles without getting hurt, unlike his brother, Pieguy (who is very stubborn and determined to march forward towards the goal).</p>\n<p>To Guide Pieguy around you can:\r\nYou can stop Limeguy in front of him to turn him around;\r\nYou can have Limeguy duck around him to make him jump;\r\nor Hold SHIFT or SPACE or Z keys to make Pieguy move faster.</p>\n<p>Limeguy controls are:\u00a0\r\nArrow keys to move Left, Right, Duck, and Jump.\r\nYou can also use the X key to Jump too.\u00a0\r\nHe can duck while in the air too to do some tricky trickies.</p>\n<p>Pressing the P key is the last option you want to do (it's full of P).</p>\n<p>I originally created music using FamiTracker for this game but didn't include it because I didn't like how the Looping sounded in this engine. I'm also not a good music composer so I have a hard time working around that.</p>\n<p>This game was made using Construct 3's free trial for the Construct 3 Game Jam on Newgrounds.com.\u00a0 It is my first game made and it took awhile understanding it and using it to the best on what I had access to. It is a great game making tool, and feels better than Clickteam Fusion in my opinion.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d72/d7227e4835da8ede37a8a3682f68884d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MisterIX09"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
