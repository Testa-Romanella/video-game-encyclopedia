At the edge you notice some large boulders in the water. You see the color of the fish running near the edge of the third boulder. Hmm\u2026 if you make your way across the rocks, you may be able to count better. You pause, taking notice of the speed of the current. You step carefully on the first rock. The wind blows across your brow. Nervous, you carefully step to the second. You look down and the current in front\u00a0of your boots\u00a0seems faster. Oh no, what have you done? Should you return? The next boulder is larger. You reassure yourself, regaining confidence, you step to the next. Whew, you made it! You can see clearly into the water now. Are you ready to start counting?<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Boots - a fish counting game</strong>,\u00a0was developed as part of the Alaska EPSCoR\u2019s Fire and Ice Project Game Jam session, Summer 2020. </p>\n\n<p>Explore some of our process and notes with the thinglink below:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Game development team:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Carie Green, Associate Professor, School of Education, University of Alaska Fairbanks, cjgreen2@alaska.edu\u00a0(Storyline)</li><li>Nathan Feemster, Instructional Designer, University of Alaska Fairbanks eCampus, nfeemster@alaska.edu\u00a0(Creative Direction, Art)</li><li>Sarah Stanley, Associate Professor of English, University of Alaska Fairbanks, sstanley2@alaska.edu\u00a0(Narrative, external links)</li><li>Nate Bauer, Director, University of Alaska Press, nate.bauer@alaska.edu\u00a0(Sound Design)</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Eric Lonn, Media Studio Production Designer, University of Alaska Fairbanks eCampus, eglonn@alaska.edu\u00a0(Unity Developer)</li><li>Eric R.
