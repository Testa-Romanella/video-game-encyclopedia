You can play as either Joachim or Boaz, a pair of God siblings who must fight for all eternity in order to bring balance and peace to the universe, whether they want to or not. However, you have a time limit to do so, that means that you must be quick and fight your way trough hordes of monsters, lethal traps and a lot of mystical mysteries in order to reach the top of the tower and become the ultimate God of Time.\r\n</p>\r\nFEATURES\r\n<p>\n<strong>Pixels Everywhere</strong> - Explore a beautiful pixel-art realm filled with details and references.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Run Player, Run</strong> - Reach the top of the tower before the time limit runs out.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Procedural World</strong> - Each rush will be quite different, so you'll always run into new surprises.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Random Treasures</strong> - Lot of weapons, spells and relicts to collect.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Tough Foes</strong> - Your enemies get stronger and gain new abilities as the time goes down.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Inner Potential </strong>- Use your God Mode to unleash all your power.\r\n</p>\r\nFAQ\r\n<p>\n<strong>-What is Itch.io?<br/>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt's a platform for indie developers to upload and sell their games. It help us reach the audience without the hussle of many market places and perform closed betas like this one. It's really easy to use and safe.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>-Is this the full game?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tNo, this is only a demo. A small portion of the game designed to give you a small taste of what the full game will be like. We're still working on building this experience, of course, and we want your help to make it happen.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>- Can I play with controllers? What if I don't have any? </strong><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tYes, you can play with the following controllers: Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS3, PS4 and Logitech. If you don't have controllers, you can always play with your keyboard.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>- Does the game has procedural levels?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tNo, this version of the demo does not have procedural levels, the enemies and items however are somewhat randomized, so the experience will not be the same every time. The full game will feature fully procedural levels, so we hope you look forward to that.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>- So what rogue-like elements does the demo has right now?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tYou will find 7 different weapons, 3 different sub-weapons and 5 different stats items. The enemies will change each time you play, as the decoration and the items. You just may find a hidden surprise here and there...\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>-Does this demo feature more playable characters?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tNot yet. For now you are only able to play as Joachim the Sun God, who specializes in swords and melee combat. If everything goes according to plan, we'll be adding Boaz the Moon Goddess soon, who specializes in magic and devastating spells.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>- What are the most important things to report on this closed beta?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMostly bugs and feedback in general. Do you like the game? Is it hard? Easy? Did you understand the mechanics? What features would you like to see in later versions of this demo?\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>- When does the closed beta stage will be over? </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWe don't know yet, as soon as the game is stable and functional.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>-When does the game come out and for what platforms?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWe don't have a release date yet, and based on this closed beta we can estimate better how much work is left to be done. The game will be available for PC and Mac for now, but we would love a future console port. We'll see in the future.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T04:25:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5e/b5ef10bcd80d839519296f250bc80aa1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["fatpanda"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
