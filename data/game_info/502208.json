Up to seven mines can be on one tile.

Quickly clear the board as it descends. You take damage if the lowest row has unopened non-mine tiles when it falls off the board. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nHot keys for quickly opening all 4 corners.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T02:52:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ab/6ab3f63d023400f354028ac3d54d7712.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tilenauts"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Tilenauts"], "esrb_rating": null}
