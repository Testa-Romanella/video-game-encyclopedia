I made it in 3 days for the Indie Cookie Awards 2 in Clickteam Fusion 2.5. The game's not much, actually not very good, but still, I'm proud of what I made in 3 days. Anyways, here's how to play.</p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY</p>\n<p>The game's pretty simple at face value. You install things to keep out the raiders. It is slightly strategy-based, though. It's not too hard, but just keep your wits about you. I'll go over the items real quick.</p>\n<p>Wool Wall: This subtracts the amount of people in your fleet killed every 3 seconds by 2.</p>\n<p>Mad Cows: These cows will kill 10 raiders every 3 seconds.</p>\n<p>20 People: Basically what it says it is. Gives you 20 more people in your fleet.</p>\n<p>T-Shirt Cannon: Will kill 5 raiders every 2 seconds.</p>\n<p>X-Ray: Will kill 30 raiders every 10 seconds.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>~Aden, Village Idiot Games</p>\n<p>Made in Clickteam Fusion 2.5</p>\n<p>#cookieawards2</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T18:07:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/901/90150aea435190d0621a64ab3769dc4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["adenboi"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
