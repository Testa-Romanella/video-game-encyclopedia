This pack comes with seven pre-made fully animated skeleton warriors and also includes a spriter file and more character pieces for you to mix and match to create hundreds of variants. If you just quickly want to include the sprite in your game the download also includes HD png keyframes. each keyframe makes a sprite around 800 pixels high. You can also use spriter to export in much higher definition if you wish up to round 2000 pixels. These sprites are 4k ready. I recommend you use texture packer to trim unnecessary alpha from each frame as all the combined sword animations adds extra padding to many frames. If you wish to change keyframe size or animation size I recommend you use spriter to re-export the animation.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T07:09:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b86/b860dcbd1b10f0a471b4e6e61f1e2084.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Robert Brooks"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
