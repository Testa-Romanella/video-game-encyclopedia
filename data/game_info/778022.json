Now, the games themselves must fight back against the spirit! However, they're only capable of fighting within the confines of their own cabinets. And to make things\u00a0worse, due to the spirit's meddling only one ship at a time is able to attack.\u00a0Take control of three different\u00a0starfighters\u00a0and swap between them to shoot down enemies and dodge incoming attacks.\u00a0Can the games work together to save the arcade?</p>\n<p>Our team's entry to Bullet Hell Jam 2022. The theme for this jam was \"confined\". We hoped to explore this theme by limiting both\u00a0the player's movement and\u00a0the range of their attacks. The swap mechanic allows the player to wiggle out of a tough situation, but in the end they're only swapping one confinement for another.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Z - Fire</p>\n<p>A - Swap Left</p>\n<p>X - Swap Right</p>\n<p>Escape - Pause</p>\n\n<p>Our team:</p>\n<p>CH51 - Level Designer</p>\n<p>Cody Mosblech - Audio Implementation and Sound Design</p>\n<p>Kevin Sousa Santos - Music</p>\n<p>Ben \"TrickyTriangles\" Springer - Programmer</p>\n<p>ZXQ - Ship Models</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T18:22:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/186/1861c0fcdab76eaf59c7de48daf54bcb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["trickytriangles", "CMosAudio", "ZXQ", "KSousaudio03"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
