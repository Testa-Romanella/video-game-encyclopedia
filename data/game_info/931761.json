Rescuing them will add a unique home on your island and give you an extra ability. With custom sound effects, art, a soundtrack, and persistent high score, Gone Fishing is an engaging and challenging game that you won't want to put down.</p>\n<p>The game was created in the Unity game engine by Felix Wilton, Katarina Zosel, and Evan Richardson\u00a0in just 30 hours for the 2023 UBC Design League Designathon and won first place, built around the prompt \"Explore\"!\u00a0All the game assets except for the font were created by the team.
