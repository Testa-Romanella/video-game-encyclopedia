It has been theorized that it is possible to port the entire game in PowerPoint. Also, I threw in some extras, like the 3DO intro and the 3DO choices voice lines. HUGE thanks to psychoticgiraffe for ripping the original PC game, which would allow me to use the original images and sounds. Other thanks go to\u00a0Daniel Marschall for making this software, BinEdit, which would look into game.bin and show you how much time is between the images and what sound is used! Cheers, friends.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T08:44:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/454/454ddb66e9de6a77f37464b77f96f10c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mister Foureyes"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
