The goal of the game is to beat enough bosses to reach and defeat the champion. On the way, you battle wild Automons. If you beat them, you get to capture one. You get benefits for having multiples of a type in your party and you can upgrade your Automons by finding 3 copies of the same monster.</p>\n<p>&gt;another monclone</p>\n<p>Feedback appreciated</p><p>https://twitter.com/AutomonGame\u00a0btw<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T08:41:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c5/2c54129458950d10ff769728b3322f15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AutomonDev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
