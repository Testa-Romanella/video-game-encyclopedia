You can't aim. Instead, the player needs to anticipate the continuously moving reticle and shoot at the exact moment to make sure their shot hits the enemies. In the game the player controls a character, who clearly had a bit too much to drink and dozes off in a bar. Upon waking up, he finds himself holding a banana and a lot of angry-looking faces staring at him. Bring chaos and death to the monsters who want to throw you out from your favourite bar.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>Movement: W/A/S/D<br/>Shoot/Throw items: Left-click<br/>Pick-up items: E</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T06:56:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/361/3619830238fd94231d658ce2afcc6ade.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Quaximi"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
