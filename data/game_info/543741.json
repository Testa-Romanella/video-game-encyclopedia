You can upgrade your bottle with the money you earned.\r\nYou can change your bottle or you can change your kicker. all bottles have different features. More gliding or more liquid power.</p>\n<p>\r\nI can hear that you say what is liquid power. When you kicking bottle, it explodes from bottom, it helps you to reduce gravity and helps you to go higher.\u00a0But liquid can drain away. So you need more tank and more and different liquids to go higher\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you liked my game you can donate\u00a0to give me a hug. Peace!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T07:27:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/691/6912aeccb3929cfe3442480d47374c54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["chapaindiegame"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
