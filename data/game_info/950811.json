The game is flatter than ever, making it easier, and more fun! I hope you enjoy the new direction for the game going forward. :)</p>\n\n<p>Editors Note: Apparently people actually did like that the game was 3D? Welp heck that then, Obama 2D is now cancelled, and in it's place, Obama 3D will be starting back development! Yep! It's back baby! Hope you didn't enjoy this wonderful 2D version too much cause it ain't getting any better than this! &gt;:)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T17:03:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df1/df1d492817b1a9835f4295063f155a5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BabyPinkSnail"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
