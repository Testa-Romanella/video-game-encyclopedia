Instead, I opted for a garden with some 'evil' flowers. If I were to expand upon this game, I would have there be a variety of flowers that have different properties.\u00a0 With more flowers, I could achieve my initial goal, which was to have the bullet hell coming at you also take form of a beautiful garden. I would also have the scoring system work.\u00a0 Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T06:37:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e91/e910d81af473c5318338c0d0e1afe793.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["soppart"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
