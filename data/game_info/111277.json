The year is 1872 and you\u2019re a young archaeologist searching for the answer of your father's disappearance. You feel both scared and intrigued because you know that as you venture through the pyramid you get closer and closer to Amenti, the death realm and you know that if you reach it you will obtain the powers of the gods from all over the world. On your way down you pick up a ring, and as soon as you pick it up your hand becomes cursed and your flesh begins to rot away. However, the curse has given you supernatural powers. The only way to cure yourselves is to venture deeper into the death realm in search for an Ankh, an item of immense power, said to be able to resurrect the dead.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>A school project made during 9 weeks, only a prototype of a vertical slice.
