Try out elements of the levels to learn and overcome obstacles. Some rules and details of this game are obvious at first glance, others are less or more hidden in the interactions.</p>\n<p>Test the possibilities, and share your findings in the comments :)</p>\n<p>Controls are intuitive - Arrows and Space.\u00a0<br/>Skip a level\u00a0by Enter. Restart a level by Home.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimers:\u00a0\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>1. For now, it is not guaranteed every level has a solution. If you encounter an obviously impossible level, feel free to skip it by hitting Enter.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>2. You may rarely (but still) run into situations which don't behave as intended. However, most of the interactions obey well defined rules - use what you have learned and you will be rewarded by a satisfying solution to the puzzle.</p>\n<p>3. Not including a full tutorial or written help inside the game is intentional and part of the experiment.</p>\n<p>Bonus: Once you encounter a level you particularly like, hit Ctrl+C to copy its seed number and share it with other players. You can generate this very level by copying it back into the game by Ctrl+V.<br/>(HTML5 version doesn't have clipboard functions sorted out yet)</p>\n<p>Created in Game Maker: Studio 1.4</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T06:44:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7e/c7ec49a35a10ef8f64e2934a7a02a3fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nero Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
