It took me about 2-3 weeks, in my free time, to finish this game. I ended up liking this one more than I thought I would. I hope you do, too. </p>\n<p>\tI made this game by myself, including code, models, animations, design etc. but that doesn't mean I was alone. I'd like to thank my girlfriend, whom I normally partner with in game projects, for her support and input in almost every step of the way. And my good friend Caner, who did an excellent job in QA testing in such a short time, and really helped me improve the game feel with his great ideas. I'd also like to thank my family for letting me use their computer to make this game, since I couldn't get a hold of my laptop. :-) </p>\n<p>\tok enough with the oscar speeches, here are the amazing artists that provided me with their music/sfx/fonts:</p>\n<p>\tCredits:</p>\n<p>*sounds:</p>\n<ul><li>InspectorJ on freesound.org</li></ul>\n<ul><li>CarlosCAv on freesound.org</li><li>yurkobb on freesound.org</li><li>mixkit.co</li></ul>\n<p>*font:</p>\n<ul><li>Kenney.nl</li></ul>\n<p>*music:</p>\n<ul><li>swipesy cakewalk by E's jammy jams\u00a0</li><li>promoted by Chillpeach</li></ul>\n<p>p.s. wanted to make this webgl but can't do it for some reason</p><p>edit: here's the source codes, you can do w/e you want with them:</p><p>https://github.com/BadWand/biker-cat-scripts<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T05:17:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/092/092b31d1d1789342ebef00d38e1c5bca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Placebo Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
