It is a puzzle-platformer with a twist: You don't have to reach the level goal, but shot a spear on it. However, to do that you need to navigate the levels to position yourself so the goal will be in open sight.</p><p>The theme of the jam was \"One Weapon, Many Uses\" and I decided to make a game revolving around using the spear to attack enemies, activate devices and confirm the end of the level. I also planned on using the spears for traversing the ambient but I got problems with coding the spear to act as a pass-through platform. The game is basically sliding squares in a blank screen with no sound since I don't know how to make sound effects and background music, so the game is mute.</p><p>I will keep a comment section here for any criticism you may want to give me. I may come back to this project if I get enough constructive feedback to be able to make a better version of it but, as it stands now, the gamejam version will continue to be the final one.</p><p>Thanks for checking this page and the game, if you did, and leave any criticism on the comment section below if you have an user in here on ITCH.IO.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/910/910c4990b886e800dea4102cd43eacc2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fil089"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
