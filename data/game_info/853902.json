Each item can be upgraded in multiple ways, and new slime effects can applied as you get further in each run. There are thousands of combinations to try. Just choose your starting gear and head out. After clearing each area you will be provided with a choice of rewards, or you might just feel lucky and spin the upgrade wheel. You can also find coins to use for in-run upgrades or gems to be used for unlocking new starting weapons and permanent upgrades.<br/><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Don't worry if you have problems differentiating between colors, Turf Wars provides\u00a0<strong>a full colorblind mode</strong>\u00a0using shapes to display slime types.
