Using the keys <strong>A</strong> and <strong>D</strong> you can jump from a line to another.\u00a0</p>\r\nThe <strong>yellow stars</strong> are your friends. Pick them up to gain\r\n some speed and a shield. While this boost is active you can smash the \r\ncircles. But be careful! This boost wont last for long and when it's \r\ngone you'll have to avoid the circles again.\r\n<p>You get <strong>0.1 points</strong> for switching the line, <strong>0.3 points</strong> for picking the PowerUp and <strong>1 point</strong> for smashing a circle.</p>\n<p><strong>Update 1:</strong> I added the 'Fun Mode'. Not gonna say much about this one. I'll let you find out for yourselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Known Bug:</strong> If you hit a PowerUp (Star) right at the moment when the previous PowerUp has ended, the PowerUp will not be reactivated.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Words from the developer:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Hi! I'm Emil. I'm a young and novice game developer. This is the first game I published online and I really hope you'll enjoy it.
