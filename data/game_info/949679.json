Maybe you can buy some skills to beat this game. This action game... or platformer game?? But definitely not both.\u00a0You can decide what it is and play it as you wish.</p>\n\n<p>In order to beat the game, you have to either kill <strong>ORCINUS ORCA</strong> or complete the platforming monument above. But beating the game is not that easy. So you may want to collect some coins and buy a couple of skills.</p>\n\n<p>This game was started to be made for\u00a0GeoJam 2022, a three-day game jam with a theme pick a side, but I missed the deadline by nine months\ud83d\ude33.
