Or is it... It is a little known fact that slime molds can shapeshift into the fearsome dire slime mold -- if they survive long enough. Nobody who has witnessed the dire slime mold has lived to tell the tale, and it is your job to keep it that way.<br/></p><p>In this game, you play as a slime mold. Half of the game is spent trying to avoid being killed by the humans, the other half is spent killing them as fast as possible before you return to your original form. While in dire slime mold form, you are impervious to damage and can shoot slime projectiles at the humans. These projectiles do not take turns to move, unlike the human fireballs. They also can penetrate through an entire row of humans. When in normal slime mold form, a single hit can kill you so be careful.</p><p>The Ludum Dare page is http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-35/?action=p....</p><p>Controls:</p><p>Both Forms:</p><ul><li>movement: WASD</li><li>wait one turn: E</li></ul><p>Dire Form:</p><ul><li>ranged attack: Shift-WASD</li></ul><p>The two songs used are:</p><ul><li>Waltz in A flat major by Chopin played by Olga Gurevich (https://musopen.org/music/3020/frederic-chopin/wal...)</li><li>\"Mort!
