My first semi-big project, this game was made in the context of a college session game project. We all worked as a team to put together code and assets together as I learned the basics of Unity along with pixelart. The style was heavily inspired by hyper light drifter, wich was our reference for base gameplay aswell.</p>\n<p>If this project piqued your interest, be sure to visit my twitter at\u00a0@Purple_Flourish as I'll be posting new\u00a0 projects along the way!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T09:36:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc9/dc9b840d54b859b023ac6edf77a4ec3a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PurpleFlourish"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
