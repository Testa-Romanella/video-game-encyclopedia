You\u2019ll also need to hire and manage your workforce if you want to ensure an efficient train service, whilst also develop over 300 technologies ranging from mechanical improvements to the trains themselves to workplace infrastructures and advanced amenities as you progress through five eras of technological innovations.<br />\nHowever, you can\u2019t just build and research your way to the top \u2013 the competition never sleeps, and to keep your business on track you\u2019ll have to survive against up to three rival tycoons.
