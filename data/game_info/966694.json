Enjoy 60+ simulations that bring realism to destruction with shatter physics, soft body dynamics, real-time fluid simulation, structural integrity, and countless exciting features!<br/><br/>Unleash the raw power of fluid dynamics in over 60 simulations. Shatter objects, crumple metal using soft body physics, or obliterate structures leveraging real-time structural integrity mechanics.<br/><br/>Note: \"Liquid Havoc\" is not a game and there is no concept of winning or losing. It is a sandbox of many possibilities, where your imagination is the only limit.<br/><br/>New objects and improvements to the editor may be added in the future with support, feedback and the success of the simulation.<br/>Make sure to try all the simulations. Don't prefer a simulation? Simply skip it and move onto the next by pressing F2.<br/><br/>Press Tab while playing to view the controls and tutorial:<br/><br/>Let me know your thoughts in the discussions, I will use the funds generated from this game to help fund this game or my other projects.
