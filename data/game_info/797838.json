It is intended\u00a0for the\u00a0GameDev.tv game jam.\u00a0I challenged myself to make\u00a0all the art assets for this game. I am really happy with the way the Tilemap came out. Creating and animating my silly little pixel characters was a lot of fun.\u00a0I have never used Libresprite before or made any animations, so it was great to learn about.</p>\n<p>This is not a serious game, hopefully it will make you smile. A short but challenging platformer, it gets easier after each death.</p>\n<p>Note: There is a minor problem with the ending. The player is meant to be pulled up into the beam of light, but it looks bad in WebGL. I have no idea why and there is no time to work it out. It's a shame because it looks really cool in Unity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T23:32:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1a/b1a932d1580b64a8507cec281d529272.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Freebooter Phantom"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
