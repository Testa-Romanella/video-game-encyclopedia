Together with your faithful assistant Gregor, your task is to repair the monsters that are destroying You will need to work together to repair the monsters as you have access to different body parts. Will you be able to push back the pack of fork-wielding villagers, or will you destroy your creatures faster than you can put them together and finally overrun your fortress last? The controls are quite simple. You move with the control stick and pick up body parts from the assembly line with A. You can either place them on the table in the middle to give them to your helper, or bring them to the table with the body parts to assemble the monster. Once you have all the parts together you will need to press a sequence of four keys to complete the process and release your handcuff on the villagers.</p>\n<p>===========================================</p>\n<p><strong>Controller Controls (recomended):</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Move: LeftStick</li><li>Action: A</li><li>QuickTimeEvent: ABXY</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Keyboard Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Move: WSAD | Arrow-Keys</li><li>Action: E | Space</li><li>QuickTimeEvent: 1234 | VBNM (green, red, blue, yelloq)</li></ul>\n<p>===========================================</p>\n<p><strong>Team</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Catharina Schwarz</li><li>Konstantin von Wendt</li><li>Marian Becher\u00a0https://twitter.com/Theras123</li><li>Nino-Julian M\u00fcller</li><li>Norman von Rechenberg -\u00a0http://cybernorm.de</li><li>Thor Myrdal\u00a0</li><li>Tom Witkowski -\u00a0https://gummibeer.de</li></ul><p><strong>Credits &amp; Special Thanks\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li>0x72\u00a0https://0x72.itch.io/</li><li>Calciumtrice\u00a0https://calciumtrice.tumblr.com/</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T07:17:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f1/4f1bf24569462429d2f97a4ce3749b7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Theras"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
