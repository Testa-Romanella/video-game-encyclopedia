A Game Boy Color version was also developed, but was later cancelled.<br />\nDespite having less recognition, it received high scores from both IGN and GameSpot, being seen as &quot;technically superior to Tony Hawk&quot; and an &quot;almost sim-like approach to the sport&quot;. Aside from less advanced graphics, this was one of the reasons Thrasher was ignored, as the learning curve (due to unconventional controls) is fairly steep compared to the &#39;pick up and play&#39; style of the Tony Hawk games.<br />\nThe objective of the game is to take one of the six fictional skaters and work through a total of 12 levels across the globe, gaining sponsors, decks and clothing, and eventually appearing on the front of Thrasher magazine - from which the game takes its name.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-14T03:30:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/430/430bd75d5e389b59f5ceeb26d515bd90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 4, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 255, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": ["Underground Development", "Z-Axis"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Rockstar Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
