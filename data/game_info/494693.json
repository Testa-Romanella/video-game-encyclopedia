Many years ago I had the idea of a story but I never had the courage to tell it, initially I thought of making a comic book, but during the pandemic I ended up having contact with the RPG Maker and I ended up seeing the opportunity to tell this story. The game is still in its initial phase, I will make the download available here and I count on your help and opinion to complete this project.\u00a0Currently the game is in Portuguese (Brazil) as it was a requirement to participate in a contest, soon I intend to switch to English.</p>\n<p><strong>Important: the game is still in its early stages and may contain bugs.</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Plot</strong></p>\n<p>We are a family owned and operated business.<br/>The human race has advanced its technology a lot, but over time it caused almost irreversible damage to the planet due to the greed of its leaders, that's when a miracle happened. Those responsible for bringing balance to our planet now known as the new world came from the skies, the transcendentals who guided us to a better path where there are no more wars, diseases, aggression against nature and different species inhabit the planet in harmony. They choose our leaders, provide us with the technology and knowledge necessary for the inhabitants of the planet to live in the best way, as they know what is best for everyone.<br/>One of the greatest achievements of the Transcendentals was the creation of the Sora academy, the largest research center on the planet and the birthplace of the best scientists. It is at this academy that young Nicolas Flamel dreams of studying to become the alchemist who discovered the secret of eternal life. However, with the progress of his course, the young Flamel will discover that even with the progress that humanity has achieved, it is still not prepared to know some answers.</p>\n<p><strong>Media</strong><br/></p>\n\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T03:34:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/008/008b67e001157ca947bac47d0ca3e0e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hericfisio"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
