It was developed for the Leap Motion 3D Jam 2015. In Rayhands we use two different hand skills; a) a simple locomotion and selection UX and b) casting of light rays and bullets that reaches beyond the normal reach of leap motion hands.<br/></p><p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p><p>* Leap Motion<br/>* Oculus Runtime 0.8<br/>* Powerful GPU: It was developed using a GTX970 and 980 since it utilizes Unity 5 realtime Global Illumination setup. Apologies in advance if your machine can not cope with the lightning conditions :)</p><p><strong>Note:</strong><br/></p><p>Works best if you enable the \"Automatic Interaction Height\" tickbox in leap motion.</p><p><strong>Objective:</strong></p><p>Find the pillars at the end of the corridor and try to light up the spheres surrounding them. </p><p><strong>How to play:</strong><br/></p><p>With your left hand you will ge able to move back and forth (after solving a puzzle) by extending your palm away from your head (move forward) or pointing your palm toward the head (move backward). Be careful with the latter since it is not stabilised at the moment. See movie: Moving with left hand</p><p>With your right hand you will select objects and aim your rays of light (just point and click). You can gain access to the light ray from either side of the ray by selecting the light bulbs.
