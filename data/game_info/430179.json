Just your cab, gravity, and money to be made. In 16 colours or less. Those were the days of\u00a0Space Taxi\u00a0on the Commodore 64. Space taxi holds my fondest childhood gaming memories, and it has aged far better than others such as Choplifter, Burger Time, and Battle Thru Time. It\u2019s even more fun than Bruce Lee, Aztec Challenge, and Fort Apocalypse!</p>\n<p>As an interesting project, I set out to\u00a0remake the original for the PC. I wanted it to look and play exactly like the game did from back on the Commodore. Via an emulator on the PC, I copied the original graphics and sampled the original sounds. I used a stopwatch to calculate gravity, acceleration, and fuel consumption rates for each level. Playing obsessively, I dug for details to match my remake to the original. The \u201cbong\u201d as each part of the giant beanstalk grows. The time between customer spawns. The taxi\u2019s bounce behavior on hard landings.</p>\n<p>My remake coincided with a\u00a0full sequel called Space Taxi 2\u00a0by Steve Verrault of Twilight Games. John F. Kutcher, the original game\u2019s author, still has the rights to it and was involved in the new game. This meant that I couldn\u2019t simply remake the full game and release it for free as it might have negatively impacted the new game\u2019s sales. However, John generously allowed me to release my work with the first eight levels (the Day Shift) to spur interest in the new game. He even gave me the option of finishing the full game and selling it as an add-on to Space Taxi 2. Sadly, believing that not too many gamers would pay for my retro version, the project got pushed aside for other interests and I never completed the remaining 17 levels (yes, 25 levels total\u2026 didn\u2019t you find the hidden level?)</p>\n<p>Fans of the game will find lots of touches even in those eight levels. You can still fly your taxi just ever-so-slightly above the exit window and off the sides. If you are fast enough on Beanstalk, it\u2019s possible to pick up just the first passenger and be done with the level in a hurry. And if you buy the farm on the teleporting level your cab can still be teleported even as it\u2019s crashing to the ground in a huge fireball.</p>\n<p>There are a couple of differences. The taxi looked absolutely terrible when it wasn\u2019t showing on a television. I think it may have had something to do with the colours John chose to make the cab have rounded edges (anti aliasing). I had to design a new taxi that kept the look/feel of the original. You can see the same effect on the passengers, but I left them alone. I also increased the pixel resolution to three times the original depth. It just didn\u2019t feel right playing with such chunky movement on a modern platform. It wasn\u2019t retro\u2026 it was simply awful! I added in mouse support to the menus and put in a check for quit on press of the escape key (though you can turn those options off for authenticity).</p>\n<p>I have a few regrets. I never fully captured the behavior of level 8 \u2013 Puzzler. Only the biggest fans will spot it, but I would like to go back and improve on it. The game is also lacking in a bit of robustness. It only runs full-screen, and only at 1024\u00d7768. If run from a protected folder (or inside the zip file) it will crash and provide no information as to why. This has to do with a 3rd party file packing utility I employed, and I need to give it some attention or strip it out for an alternative.</p>\n<p>Space Taxi has aged incredibly well. Something about the gravity, acceleration, pressure for good tips, and the level variety came together in a perfect storm of gaming. Give it a try. It\u2019s possible to break $1000 even from those first eight levels as long as you don\u2019t need too much fuel (or any extra cabs). Have fun, and let me know\u00a0if you enjoyed it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T12:34:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f80/f8095f4a763089cc5e1b5c9ca34db639.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mike LeSauvage"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
