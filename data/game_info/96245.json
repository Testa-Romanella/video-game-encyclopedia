Each puppet has a series of sensors which trigger facial deterioration. After 3 rounds, the victor is decided by whoever has managed to cause the most damage or who has knocked their opponent's face off.</p><p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p><p>SNAGGLE DADDY - ARROW KEYS</p><p>SPEDUSA - W A S D</p><p>Note: Whilst this game can be played with a keyboard, that's boring! </p><p>Make your own puppets and play it with those!</p><p><strong>WHAT OFF EARTH IS HAPPENING?</strong></p><p>GAME</p><p>CONTROLLER</p><p>Built in two weeks for fun by:</p><p><strong>FUNKTOVEN &amp; THE MAKERS ARE:</strong></p><p>Alex Borovski - Puppet Design and Production</p><p>Tyler Giordano - In Game Visuals</p><p>Alex Johansson - Game Programming</p><p>Featuring the Music of:</p><p>Will Bedford - Music Production</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41c/41ce7faa86e1fd820bb04f457a1cc91e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alex Johansson"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
