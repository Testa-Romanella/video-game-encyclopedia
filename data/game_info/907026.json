The player is tasked with traversing the layers of Hell. Along the way the player will acquire new weapons and abilities to help them defeat anything that stands in their way.<br/><br/>Developed using Unreal Engine 4.</p>\n<p>Source Code</p>\r\nMy Role\r\n<p>My primary role on this project was Gameplay Programmer. The majority of my time working on this game was spent developing the player combat system. I like to break the combat down into three smaller sub-systems: Combo system, Damage System, and a custom Ability system.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong><em>Dynamic Weapon/Combo System</em></strong> that allowed for <strong><em>easy creation of multiple weapons</em></strong>, each with a <strong><em>variable number of attack animations</em></strong> as well as other attributes\r\n</li><li><strong><em>Damage System</em></strong> allowed for <strong><em>multiple different damage types</em></strong> like Fire, Ice, and life-steal.\r\n</li><li>The custom <strong><em>Ability System</em></strong> allowed us to <strong><em>easily create multiple different abilities</em></strong> that would affect the character's attributes in different ways (overtime, instant, for a duration) as well as <strong><em>create more unique attacks</em></strong> like an AoE knockback.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>I go into more detail about each of these systems in my blog posts made during the development of this project. My final blog post\u00a0links to the individual posts that highlight each system.</p>\n\n\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>WASD - Movement</li><li>SPACE - Dodge Roll</li><li>LMB - Attack</li><li>Q - Activate Weapon Ability</li><li>E - Activate Player Ability</li><li>ESC/P - Pause</li><li>Mouse - Camera</li></ul>\n\n<p><em>This project was developed by C-Monkeys, a team comprised of myself and four of my classmates during the final project period of my degree program at Full Sail University.
