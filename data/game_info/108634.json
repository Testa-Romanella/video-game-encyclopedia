Some objects hold multiple lines of dialogue. Run into objects with the hamster\u00a0to interact with them.\u00a0The hamster is not constrained by gravity, but can only \"jump\" up one tile in the first room. We wouldn't want him to escape his cage!

It was made in 7 hours, but it will only take a minute or two to play, (if you don't rush.) I hope you enjoy it!
