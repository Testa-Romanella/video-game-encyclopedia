Eternally adhering to the operational templates from the Last Great War, they interpret any life or machine form that deviates from their own build as an aberration that requires eradication. The efficiency of the machine and the mindlessness of total war...a constant cycle of rebuilding and destruction, until, some day, there will be nothing left.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Zeta Leporis RTS is a solo dev project that is currently quite a distance from its anticipated finish line. That said, a lot of features are present already:<br/><br/><ul><li>Single player mode featuring random map skirmish matches with up to 11 reasonably capable AI opponents.<br/></li><li>Fighters, frigates, destroyers, cruisers, battleships, missile corvettes, defense turrets, battlestations, and more.<br/></li><li>A literal resource transfer system unique to the RTS genre.<br/></li><li>Build queues and rally points, dynamic control groups, hotkeys and a navigable minimap.<br/></li><li>Upgradable resource collectors and turrets, and other upgrades.<br/></li><li>Options for adjusting resources and other match settings; not present in the demo.<br/></li><li>A save system; not present in the demo.<br/></li><li>A basic tutorial to help you get started.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-01T07:20:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2c/b2ce6cfb9566e6826c84e5de15a87ff6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 374, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jason Gieske"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Jason Gieske"], "esrb_rating": null}
