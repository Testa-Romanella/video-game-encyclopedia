It is said that Captain James Cook used to play a variant of Connect 4 with his fellow officers on his long voyages, and so this game has also been called \"Captain's Mistress\". Connect4 is named Force4, or Puissance4 in French, Forza4 in Italian, Conecta4 in Spanish, 4gewinnt in German, 4 op'n rij in Dutch, Fire p\u00e5 stribe in Danish, Nelj\u00e4n suora in Finnish, Czw\u00f3rki in Polish, \u0427\u0435\u0442\u044b\u0440\u0435 \u0432 \u0440\u044f\u0434 in Russian, \u56db\u5b50\u68cb in Chinese, and \u56db\u76ee\u4e26\u3079 in Japanese... <br/><br/>The contemporary Connect4 game was launched by Milton Bradley at the beginning of the 70s. It consists of 7 columns, each 6 pieces high. This game is a neat conversion of a classic game where the aim is to connect four tokens in a row, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally, while keeping your opponent from doing the same. Sounds easy, but it is not! The \"vertical\" strategy you need to play Connect4 creates a unique challenge: you must think in a whole new way to block your opponent\u2019s moves. <br/><br/>As any successful game, Connect 4 has been ported to numerous platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We largely tried to recreate a full experience of the game in a tiny download package, including powerful AI engine with multiple different difficult levels, ability to play against other person or the phone, undo and hints. Use menu (top right corner) to activate all those features.<br/><br/>Don't forget to check our Games section for more fun time killers.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:15:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/327/327642f8f3afe0b9998006de3852f093.jpg", "website": "http://www.gaspmobilegames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["GASP Mobile Games"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["GASP Mobile Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
