Can you find a way to advance and get better items? You can find rocks and stick on the ground, but you need to figure out how to turn them into pickaxes and swords and so on.</p>\n<p>You can craft items in your inventory to make useful items. You can also use different tools to change items and their abilities. This game has two music tracks and bunch of sound effects. They are not perfect, because, after all, I made them, but you can always turn them off in the settings.</p>\n\n<p>Dungeon World is a game I have been working on for about two months. The game started when I wanted to make a little\u00a0dungeon with\u00a0procedurally generated doors once in a while. Then I added a player and it went forward from there. And this is the result. I probably won't continue with this game, but if I do, I'll add monsters and HP and other stuff like that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T03:13:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e70/e7011a604697edd9bed2155abf40265d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tsombi100"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
