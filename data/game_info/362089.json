In the game, the player takes a backseat, as the only way to interact in combat is to choose what item to use and press the button to use it.</p>\n<p>Given more time there would be a greater diversity of enemies, some basic music and sound effects, and there would be a system to level up items (a mechanic which would give the player more to experiment with) . Unfortunately I had to end the Game Jam about 12 hours early, so this is as far as I got.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6f/a6f2544f8f0b93797c201b2c0bad5043.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nathan Jesudason"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
