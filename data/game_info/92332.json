Welcome to Seven Photos: The Photographic Detective! This game is inspired by Dangan Ronpa, Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney, and Layton Brothers! (Three of my favorite murder mystery games!)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Put simply, Seven Photos is a murder mystery game where you have 7 photos to figure out exactly how and why you woke up, without memories, outside a locked room containing two presumably dead people. \u00a0This is a point and click, action thriller game in which you try to figure out who the murderer is before you go insane. Could it have been you? Who's lying? You have seven photos to figure that out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gameplay</p>\n<p>Point and click:\u00a0<br/>-Look for evidence by clicking around for them!<br/>Drag to shoot evidence bullets:<br/>-When you get to the countering phase, drag to shoot the evidence bullet at the statement that you can prove wrong with that evidence!<br/>-(ex. if you have a evidence bullet that says you 'love dogs more than cats', if a statement says 'you love cats more than dogs' you would prove that statement wrong by using your 'love dogs' bullet! If you love Dangan Ronpa, you'll see that this mechanic pays homage to the classic 'You've got that wrong'! from that game :)</p>\n<p>Also, I threw in some references to Dangan Ronpa, Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney, and Layton Brothers within the game if you want to find those!</p>\n<p>Let me know if you guys find bugs and enjoy!<br/>RECORD: [could be you!]</p><p>Thanks so much to my beta testers for sticking through this development process with me and helping make my game the best that it could be!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/164/16468b177acae9136aa4a8d2a4591396.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["chibixi"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
