Rumors and superstitions gripped the community, attributing dark powers and mystical abilities to her. The old lady was labeled a witch.<br/><br/>Over time, his opinion deteriorated further. The community's fears and prejudices completely isolated her, and she found herself deprived of any meaningful human contact. Alone in her house of instruction, she found solace in solitude, though solitude allowed dark thoughts to take over her mind.<br/><br/>She then began to be carried away by demonic influences, exploring occult knowledge and practicing forbidden rituals. She succumbed to the darkness, fueled by the anger and bitterness that life had inflicted on her.
