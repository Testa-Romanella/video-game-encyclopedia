When you gain enough, you'll level up!<br/>Leveling up increases your stats and sometimes unlocks new abilities.<br/>To use an ability, press either the main or secondary button. (Z or X on keyboard)<br/>After use, the ability will go on cooldown.<br/>The round will end after a set time limit at the top.<br/>Destroy the enemy tower in each lane to win!</p>\n\r\nHERO ABILITIES:\r\n<p><strong><em>DRAGON KNIGHT</em></strong><br/><em>Breathe Fire (Lv 2)</em>: Deals damage through a wide fire blast in any direction.<br/><em>Dragon Form (Lv 4)</em>: Temporarily turns Dragon Knight into a blue dragon, greatly increasing his HP and damage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>PUDGE</em></strong><br/><em>Meat Hook (Lv 2)</em>: Instantly teleports the nearest enemy hero to Pudge's location.<br/><em>Rot (Lv 3)</em>: Deals damage in a radius to all enemies, along with Pudge himself.</p>\n<p><strong><em>CHAOS KNIGHT</em></strong><br/><em>Chaos Strike (Lv 3)</em>: Deals a random amount of damage to every hero in a radius, up to 10 times Chaos Knight's current attack power.<br/><em>Phantasm (Lv 5)</em>: Spawns 3 clones of Chaos Knight with half health that attack the nearest enemy.</p>\n<p><strong><em>ARC WARDEN</em></strong><br/><em>Spark Wraith (Lv 3)</em>: Spawns a wraith that deals strong damage, but dies quickly.<br/><em>Tempest Double (Lv 5)</em>: Spawns a clone of Arc Warden with Hero AI.
