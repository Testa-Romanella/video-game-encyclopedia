It's going to take effort, time, and work, but I hope you can enjoy it and utilize it as it does. God knows I would have leapt at the opportunity to have one of these when I was starting out!</p>\n<p>This is a VERY early prototype. I made it overnight. If you want to really try the functions, bear with me while I develop it further, and feel free to ask questions. - Derge</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T06:08:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31b/31bc6a086ab88b4016fdfa27a71e121b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Derge"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
