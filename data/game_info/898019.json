As your time ticks down, unescapable, your determination to succeed will grow stronger.</p>\n<p>Can you emerge from this sea of troubles the victor?</p>\n<p>Will you try to face this alone, \u00a0with all the weight on your shoulders? Or will you lighten your burden, and call for assistance, introducing a friend into the fray?\u00a0It depends on how you want to play.</p>\n<p>No matter what you choose, all will not\u00a0be forever\u00a0set in stone.</p>\n<p><strong>The Cycle will always repeat... But the Cycle is never truly the same each time.</strong></p>\n<p>In the Pumpkin\u00a0Punting Project, you sit down at your keyboard, or pull up your controller, and launch pumpkins into the omnipresent void in a twin stick-shooter adventure built in the Unreal Engine. Controls are simple:</p>\n<p><em><strong>E or START \u00a0to spawn in your player.<br/></strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>WSAD or Left Stick to move.<br/></strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Arrow Keys or Right Stick to aim.<br/></strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Space or any shoulder/trigger to attack the pumpkins.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Esc or Menu to return to the menu.</strong></em></p>\n<p>This game is rather simple in gameplay looping. You select a time, and try to knock off 25 pumpkins before said timer runs out. Players can be a keyboard, or controller, and Player 2 can drop in at any time. You will play until the timer runs out, or until you reach the goal of 25 pumpkins.</p>\n<p>It is an interesting challenge, which will most likely require multiple playthroughs to master the game's system.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T15:42:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/159/1590a6707dd79574ae323e6b5abf9277.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fancy Fairy Design"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
