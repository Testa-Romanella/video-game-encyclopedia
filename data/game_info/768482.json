In this game, the player, which is the mug, has to collect the coffee beans in order to stay alive. If you run out of coffee beans you have to retry. This is an infinite game and helps release stress. The player can also upgrade itself, possibly by upgrading speed, jumping, or increasing the quantity of the beans in the game. The game has a tiny bug which you will find out once u play it but I don't think the bug is that huge so its alright.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T06:57:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0e/d0e12d9f2a8d26a033d5932b887b1780.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TITAN GAMER"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
