Assign medical staff to patients to increase their chances of survival. But be careful! If patients die the morale of your staff will lower, making them less effective. Manage their morale by giving them breaks from the constant flow of casualties. Can you keep soldiers alive while war wages right outside your hospital?</p>\n<p>Programming: Justin \"Warspiteful\" Almendral,\u00a0Brandon Lyman,  Kane \u8bb8\u9e3f\u5eb7 Xu<br/></p>\n<p>Music &amp; Sound Design by: Eric Franklin, Achilles Jiang</p>\n<p>Written &amp; Designed by:\u00a0Natalie \u201cWitch Hat Natalie\u201d Bickelhaupt<br/></p>\n<p>Art: Peter \"MrPeterss\" Bidoshi</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T12:38:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13d/13d099c684762b43ff3f3fbba7500ffd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["warspiteful", "Composerkiwi", "BrandonLymanGameDev", "Witch Hat Natalie", "Voidling", "mrpeterss", "Kane Xu"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
