Pummel rats with the many types of hammers you can unlock throughout the game. Bored of the regular mode? Go to advanced mode, where you'll have to hit the right rat according to your hammer color. The best part is that there's no penalty for not hitting any. You can play this game relaxingly or competitively, it's up to you! Either way, if you love whack a mole, you'll love this. However I do recommend a large space to play this game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNo actual rats were harmed in the making of this game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T02:34:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/197/197b69220130ad5b82e0aa25684cd6a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Derrick Davison"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Derrick Davison"], "esrb_rating": null}
