I've recently started a project in an attempt to create a game with a very similar feel. The 22 years of technological improvement will allow for much smoother, visually appealing, larger scale battles (and without the need for DOSBox). As you can tell, appropriate graphics and animations are not yet implemented to keep the web-player build small and quick to load.\r\n</p><p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/445/445c77f8126a72183b67350b6be7ab01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["tomgsx"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
