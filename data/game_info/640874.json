The opponent can do the same, so play your cards wisely.</p>\n<p>Versus is a digital version of the classic typewriting competitions. The text is always the same and it's in Latin so it's fair game for everybody in every country (except Vatican people, they may have an advantage). Challenge your friends and find who's the fastest typewriter.</p>\n<p>WARNING!\r\n</p>\n<p>This game is not complete, it is just a prototype, so there are missing assets and features.
