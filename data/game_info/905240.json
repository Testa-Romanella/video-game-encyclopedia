You take the role as an almost-bankrupt night watchman that must ensure the safety of the pizzeria and its animatronic mascots, starring Pj the Rabbit and his band. But little does our night guard know how bad his timing to take the job really was...<br/></p>\n\n<p>You sit in an office with 2 doors to protect yourself, you have a camera system on your tablet to help monitor the animatronic mascots. If they get too close, check the lights or close the doors. Oh yeah... and also try to keep an eye on the Puppet Show's feed...<br/></p>\n\n<p>------Update Log------\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Game Jolt Devlog First Created: December 3, 2021\r\n</li><li>First Version of the game released: February 12, 2022\r\n</li><li>Version 2.0 of the game released: June 13, 2022\r\n</li><li>Patch Update 2.1.5 of the game released: June 15, 2022\r\n</li><li>Patch Update 2.1.8 of the game released: July 3, 2022</li></ul>\n<p>Game Made Solely By: Scott Zimmerman (@ScottZimmerman)</p>\n<p>Game Inspired By &amp; Dedicated To: Scott Cawthon</p>\n<p>Most assets in the game were taken and modified from assets that were already pre-made.
