Collect the nutz and avoid the evil bananas. Lighting is intended to be flat, but in this version it is not, so it may be difficult to see during later parts of the level, so apologies for that. I left some debug features in so feel free to use them if you get stuck: D = Moon jump and M = damage recoil. Also the monkeys name is Travis (this is vital information).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T07:08:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbf/bbf7248a4c15a2a24e81806114dddce2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joshua G 04"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
