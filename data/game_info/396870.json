Dragon Ball Z: A Fierce Battle at the Number One Under Heaven Martial Arts Gathering) is the first fighting video game based on Dragon Ball Z. It was released only in Japan by Bandai on December 29, 1992, for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game was unique in that it came with a special card reader attachment for the NES, the Datach Joint Rom System, which requires several special cards to be swiped in order to add characters and items in the game. <br />\nThe game features many playable characters from the series (at least 28) and most of their transformations, with a corresponding trading card for each. There is also cards for varying versions of each single character, all with completely different attributes, statistics, and usable special moves. Each single version of a single character has only one special attack.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-07T12:42:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/334/334d92a7ba6f1b7517522479b6f4cf9a.jpg", "website": "https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z:_Gekit%C5%8D_Tenkaichi_Bud%C5%8Dkai", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 56, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["NES"], "developers": ["Bandai"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting", "Indie"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
