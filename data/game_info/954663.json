Then the code was transcoded line-by-line to 68K assembly. The 'core' code is platform-agnostic and calls out to an operating system dependent (OSD) layer written for each target platform.\r\n</p>\n<p>The original target is the Neo Geo (AES/MVS/CD). It runs in 'tate' mode.\r\n</p>\n<p>Subsequent targets include the Amiga (requirements TBD).\r\n</p>\n<p>In theory the core can be ported easily to any 68K target that can support the resolution, number of sprites (performance) and palette.\r\n</p>\n<p>PROGRESS:\r\n</p>\n<p>The core transcode is 100% complete. One \"last\" gameplay bug to be confirmed.\r\n</p>\n<p>The Neo Geo target is playable with sound on an emulator and also on real hardware (tested on an AES with NeoSD cartridge and NGCD).\r\n</p>\n<p>The Amiga target is playable.\r\n</p>\n<p>FEATURES:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>game play is identical to the original arcade game, including the pseudo-random number generation\r\n</li><li>both <em>Xevious</em> and <em>Super Xevious</em> available</li><li>original dipswitch options supported (except cocktail cabinet mode)\r\n</li><li>all original graphics and colours reproduced perfectly on Neo Geo target\r\n</li><li>1 or 2 players supported\r\n</li><li>high score load/save for each variant</li></ul>\n<p>CREDITS:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Mark McDougall (aka tcdev): reverse-engineering, core and Neo Geo code and assets\r\n</li><li>Jean-Francois Fabre (aka jotd): Amiga code and assets\r\n</li><li>Namco: original game :)\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T09:24:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3c/a3c6acbccfbda962810909e874b9e735.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tcdev"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
