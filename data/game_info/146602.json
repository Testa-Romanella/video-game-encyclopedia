In it's current state, you roam randomly generated forests killing knights and mages, gaining gold to buy upgrades in between levels. If you can get to the last level, there is a high score system, so hey, there's something to work towards. There's somewhat functioning coop and versus modes as well. Controller support included. Oh also there's a debug menu in there. Hit F1 and go crazy.</p>\n<p>This is a game that I worked on over the course of a year as a senior project for high school. A lot of hours went into the development, and it was my first major GameMaker project. Because of that, there are still a few bugs kicking around that I never got to fixing. Development is cancelled, mostly because the project is kind of a mess, and would require making a lot more assets to continue development.</p>\n<p>Controls\u00a0(KB&amp;M, Controller):</p>\n<p>Move: WASD, Left Joystick</p>\n<p>Fire Projectile: Left Click, Right Trigger</p>\n<p>Melee: Right\u00a0Click, Right Bumper</p>\n<p>Dash: Space, Left Trigger<br/></p>\n<p>Reflect: Q, Left Bumper</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c41/c41a41b2ddd73b69c0ec20327269cbfd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["blstrManx"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
