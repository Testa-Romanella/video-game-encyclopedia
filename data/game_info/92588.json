For the new and more robust version,\u00a0view on the App Store.</em></strong><br/></p><p>\n<strong>Planetone (<em>Planet-tone</em>) is a planetary music sequencer in which players grow plants to create melodies.</strong></p>\n<p>\r\n\tPlant sprouts, trees, and cacti in 7 different colors and watch your harmony grow and evolve as you plant more.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Mouse \u2013 Place sprout, cactus, or tree. Click again to remove.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Scroll Wheel / Click and Drag Background \u2013 Rotate Camera</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSelect a color from the \r\n\t<strong>sprout tab</strong>, <strong>cactus tab, or tree tab</strong> to change your instrument. Sprouts will change pitch according to their height on the planet, while cacti will play a drum beat at the same pitch. Trees will play the same note as a sprout, but will not disappear when the sun is out. This lets you perform over a persistent track.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Tempo</strong> can be adjusted by clicking the planetary orbit in the bottom left corner.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tToggle between \r\n\t<strong>sun</strong> and <strong>shade</strong> to prevent sprouts from growing.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMade for Ludum Dare 38 (A Small World). Sounds sampled or created using an OP-1.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/921/921b0e5009cafef704792906b305fc92.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Michael Shillingburg"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
