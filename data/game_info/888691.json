Explore a cardboard world stylistically inspired by Paper Mario and Bug Fables, talk to dozens of cute hand-drawn birds and help Joseph and Mary find a place to rest for the night (and maybe a mojito on the way).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD or arrow keys to move</li><li>Space or Enter to interact</li><li>Shift to run</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Made by Theresa (idea, artwork, level design, piano) and Lukas (programming, dialogues, level design, ukulele), using sound effects from zapsplat.com and additional textures from opengameart.org:</p>\n<ul><li>\"Snow Texture\" by Downdate</li><li>\"Seamless Beach Sand\" by n4</li><li>\"Handpainted Wood\" by PamNawi</li><li>\"Animated Water Texture 128px\" by YCbCr</li></ul>\n<p>Thanks to Aziza for spontaneously agreeing to a short beta-testing session,\u00a0even though time was running short, and giving us valuable (and very encouraging) feedback.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Some More Thoughts</strong></p>\n<p>This is our first foray into the world of adventure games and I have to admit, worldbuilding and writing dialogues even for such a small-scoped game is a lot more difficult than I imagined. Still, I'm reasonably happy with how things turned out and even though there's not a lot of content or mystery to be solved, I hope that you enjoy engaging with our weird little world.</p>\n<p>Have fun playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T12:59:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c0/5c08f88b100774af9f75795f8be55c41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LukasWho"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
