{"id": 121662, "slug": "typography-revised-demo", "name": "Typography (Revised Demo)", "name_original": "Typography (Revised Demo)", "description": "<p>Typography is a simple platformer heavily inspired by games like Atlantis no Nazo in that it's a tough experience where almost every abstract shape is out to kill you. You dash across short obstacle course-like levels as fast as you can while avoiding enemies/pitfalls along the way. </p><p>\r\n\tEvery level is unique: from the art/color palette to the various kind of enemies you run into; hardly anything in this game is reused. In one level your dodging and weaving in between swarms of (what look like) bees, and the next level, you find yourself being chased by a giant, weird looking comet. </p><p>\r\n\tThis is my first attempt into programming and game design, and it's been one hell of a learning experience for me. I've practically fallen in love with this project. I hope to get this game finished soon and released for PC and Android.</p><p>\r\n\tThis is a small, early-in-development demo featuring a few sample levels from Typography. The game is far from being completed, but I hope this will give you the general idea of what to expect out of this mess.</p><p>\r\n\t**The demo has been revised and includes new updates to the game. While avoiding enemies is still the safest option, you can now attack enemies by dashing. There is also a timer that can be used to keep track of how fast you can clear levels.</p><p>\r\n\tAny feedback would be greatly appreciated. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e70/e7040b882488a9b3a8a1658beb16e16b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Comrade_Mike"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
