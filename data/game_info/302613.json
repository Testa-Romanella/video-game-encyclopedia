She's not the most studious of witches, but she's determined to protect this enchanted forest (and earning her license while doing so).</p>\n<p>Adventuring heroes are always the good guys, right?\u00a0Well, we know better, that was the first lie exposed in Witch's College!\u00a0 It's one thing to overlook their towns and farms, but they always start exploring. Those adventurers, once they start exploring, they begin encroaching upon the lives and livelihoods of the faerie and forest folk.</p>\n<p>Between self-declared heroes, not-so-friendly wildlife, demons, ghosts, and all sorts of miscreants this might be a challenge for our flunky witch. With the help of <strong>Zoom</strong>, the broom, and <strong>Gnibbles</strong>, the familiar cat, Ursa is going to have her work cut out for her.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Current Features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Quick - Currently, this project is only a mapping demo, so it will only take a few minutes to view all the gags.</li><li>Cheerful - Emo has left the building, nothing overly dark here.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Intended Features:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>RPG \"Short\" - Even upon completion this game is intended to only take a couple of hours to complete.</li><li>Standard Combat - Because not every game needs to re-invent the wheel.</li><li>Colorful Cast - Dull NPC's sporting only \"Hi welcome to our village\" as their dialogue are not allowed.</li><li>Many more locations than is presented in this first mapping demo.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Cast:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Ursa </strong>- An initiate witch, who wants to be come a grand witch, but her grades work against her.</li><li><strong>Gnibbles </strong>- Ursa's feline familiar with an over-abundance of cat-itude.</li><li><strong>Zoom </strong>- A broom that's sentient, but has a phobia of corners and dark places.</li><li><strong>????</strong> - A young woodsman who seems to be the best friend of a werewolf?
