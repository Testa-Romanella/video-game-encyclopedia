Each player starts with 4 dice.</p>\n<p>2. When attacking a player can pick 1 or 2 dice.</p>\n<p>3. When a player has attacked, the other player can block with 1 or 2 dice.</p>\n<p>4. If 2 dice are picket, the game picks the \"best\" one based on if it\u2019s for defending or attacking.</p>\n<p>5. Normal dots are attack/defense points</p>\n<p>6. Hart dots heal the roller</p>\n<p>7. Shield blocks any attack</p>\n<p>8. Cubes give the roller more dice</p>\n<p>9. When the deck is out of dice, each attempt to get a new dice removes one health point</p>\n<p>10.

The goal of ODJ is to create a   simple game in one day with a time budget of 8-9h. That's why there is a\u00a0second\u00a0version\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0game\u00a0that doesn't have\u00a0art\u00a0and\u00a0was\u00a0finished\u00a0in &lt;8\u00a0h.      </p>\n<p>Extra rules for ODJ that I follow:      </p>\n<ul><li>One scene - no multiple levels, just one screen; \r\n</li><li>No music, sound, effects, options - this saves time and I'm lazy; \r\n</li><li>Very simple game idea - simple enough to port to mobile without adding onscreen joysticks and button clusters; \r\n</li><li>Use Unity or any high-level game engine - it saves a bit of time :) \r\n</li></ul>\n<p> This is my 3rd ODJ and I plan to do more of these. That's why this one is dated 16.07.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T11:53:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2a/c2aafab4c8a709bc29fec2f17da6c263.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["CRA Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
