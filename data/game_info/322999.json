They are sentient and they must be destroyed. Why? Because they'll destroy what we've already built! You've been assigned to kill them with your electricity device. You have a limited supply of energy on each level, so make sure to be careful.</p>\n<p>This game is a sort of first person view but in 2d. You control a device mentioned earlier with either the mouse or keyboard. The keyboard is for skilled players. By the end of the game you will meet the \"large baloon\", and decide what to do with him.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-27T05:23:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0c/e0ce5cf1dd9bf97e388df05268cfaff2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["bombisGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
