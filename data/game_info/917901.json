Ill-tempered and entirely too convinced of his own greatness, he lives at the edge of a small settlement somewhere in the most remote sector of the garbage-covered planet Deponia. He dreams of a better life in the floating cities of wealth and beauty high above the planet surface. When the angelic Goal falls from these privileged spheres down into a neighboring trash heap, Rufus sees his chance. He decides to bring the unconscious beauty back to her home. Only a vague hope of making it off Deponia at first, he soon formulates an unscrupulous plan, as he learns that he is a dead ringer for Goal\u2019s upper-class husband. The planned handover is only the beginning of a wild chase across Deponia full of twists, turns and mystifying mix-ups.<br/>\n<br/>\nChaos on Deponia<br/>\nAfter the events in Deponia, Rufus came to his senses. He's grown prudent, amicable, kind and caring, without any intention to cause major mayhem just to further his own selfish ends. It seems he is far from chaining himself to flaming saw blades, training torpedo-dolphins or plundering platypus nests. Or is he? Eventually, it's a flaming saw blade that \u201cpersuades\u201d Goal to stay on Deponia once more, splitting her personality into three parts in the process, each aspect of her consciousness stored to a different cartridge.So it's up to Rufus and his remarkable charm to persuade Goal's personalities to fuse into one again, make his way to Elysium with her and save Deponia from certain Chaos while he's at it. Join Rufus on his way through the vast area of the Floating Black Market, meet new, bizarre characters and reunite with familiar faces.<br/>\n<br/>\nGoodbye Deponia<br/>\nMore chaos, more destruction, more Rufus. Not one, not two, but three Rufuses cause all kinds of crazy mayhem in the long-awaited adventure comedy Goodbye Deponia: The Organon plans the destruction of Deponia, the lovely Goal has (once again) disappeared, and anti-hero Rufus just can't seem to stop getting in his own way.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeponia Doomsday<br/>\nOne fateful night, Rufus awakes from a haunting nightmare: he sacrificed himself to save Deponia. But at what price? Elysium, the floating city crash-landed on the planet. As the last surviving Deponian, he fought savage fewlocks, but in the end, there was only one way out: He had to blow up Deponia! And...
