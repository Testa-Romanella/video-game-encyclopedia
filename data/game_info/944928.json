Your task is to pass procedurally generated maps. The more part of the map you clear, the higher your final reward. There is a <strong>boss</strong> at each level. To complete the race, you need to beat him. The choice is yours, kill him as soon as you find him, or else search and clear rooms to increase your reward. For the received in-game currency, you can buy a new design for yourself, weapons and maps. <strong>Good luck!</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T02:43:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f5/1f59af2a9ce42356675c26b8a029b3ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MPG Digital"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["MPG Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
