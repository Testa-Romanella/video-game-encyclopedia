In the distant ancient times, there was a people who could control the power of the wind. They were grateful for this power, and thought it was given by the Goddess of the Wind, so the people built a Temple of the Wind to worship her. The temple itself is machine-operated, which is full of ancient people's understanding of the wind. Hundreds of years later, the protagonist explored and awakened the relics left by his ancestors with the power of the \"create a gust of wind\". The puzzles of the game are designed around the core interaction mechanism of \"create a gust of wind\". Unlike traditional puzzle games, players need to understand and use some wind characteristics to complete the puzzle. The game is operated with a keyboard, and it supports gamepads.</p>\n<p>We spent 8 days on the\u00a0prototype of it:https://mcatin.itch.io/call-of-wind</p>\n<p>\u00a0Then we spent over 1 month to finish this version,\u00a0 and the development is paused for now.</p>\n<p>Who made it?</p>\n<p>Programmer, Composer: \u6bdb\u5e38\u677e Changshong Mao</p>\n<p>Artist: \u6731\u679c Guo Zhu</p>\n<p>Programmer, Designer: \u5434\u4f73\u6e20 Jiaqu Wu</p>\n<p>Artist: \u9ec4\u6021\u7136 Yiran Huang</p>\n<p>Designer: \u66fe\u4e66\u626c Shuyang Zeng</p>\n\n<p>\u300a\u98ce\u4e4b\u5524\u300b\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u4ee5\u573a\u666f\u89e3\u8c1c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u76842D\u6a2a\u7248\u6e38\u620f\u3002 \u9065\u8fdc\u7684\u53e4\u4ee3\uff0c\u751f\u6d3b\u7740\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u9a7e\u9a6d\u98ce\u4e4b\u529b\u7684\u65cf\u7fa4\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u611f\u6069\u3001\u656c\u754f\u8fd9\u79cd\u529b\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5b83\u662f\u88ab\u98ce\u4e4b\u5973\u795e\u6240\u8d50\u4e88\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u65cf\u4eba\u4eec\u5efa\u9020\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u98ce\u4e4b\u795e\u6bbf\u6765\u4f9b\u5949\u5979\u3002\u800c\u795e\u6bbf\u672c\u8eab\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u673a\u5173\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u9971\u542b\u7740\u53e4\u4eba\u5bf9\u98ce\u7684\u9886\u609f\u3002\u6570\u767e\u5e74\u540e\uff0c\u4e3b\u4eba\u516c\u51ed\u501f\u201c\u626c\u98ce\u201d\u7684\u529b\u91cf\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5e76\u5524\u9192\u5148\u4eba\u7559\u4e0b\u7684\u9057\u8ff9\u3002 \u6e38\u620f\u7684\u8c1c\u9898\u56f4\u7ed5\u7740\u201c\u626c\u98ce\u201d\u8fd9\u4e00\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u673a\u5236\u800c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u89e3\u8c1c\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u73a9\u5bb6\u9700\u8981\u5207\u5b9e\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u8fd0\u7528\u4e00\u4e9b\u98ce\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u5b8c\u6210\u89e3\u8c1c\u3002 \u6e38\u620f\u4f7f\u7528\u952e\u76d8\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u624b\u67c4\u6e38\u73a9\u3002</p>\n<p>\u6211\u4eec\u7528\u4e868\u5929\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\u00a0\u5b83\u7684\u539f\u578b\uff08\u5730\u5740\uff1ahttps://mcatin.itch.io/call-of-wind\uff09\uff0c</p>\n<p>\u5e76\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6708\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u5f00\u53d1\u6682\u65f6\u505c\u6b62\u3002\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-09T03:05:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/085/0856ecd0ddf65a303578a7cd0c26fad4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["WuJiaQu", "Chukaalco"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
