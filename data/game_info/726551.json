I made it so that you play against a bot in a 1v1. It's pretty simple as far as what is seen on the screen, but it took a lot more time to make than I thought it would. Either way, I hope you enjoy it, I might continue to add to it in the future, but in the meantime let me know if you have any suggestions or improvements for it. Also, if you play it enough times, you will most likely come across a bug where the bot just freezes and doesn't do anything. If that happens, just click the restart button in the top left corner to reset the game. I'll try to fix it, but I've already sunk a lot of time into trying to with no avail.
