I am a solo indie game developer making a game called \u201cCorrafinium\u201d The end goal of the project is to create a souls like first person shooter in an open world setting with a low poly western/science fiction aesthetic.</p>\n<p>I'm releasing a demo of my progress so far to test out the core mechanics to tweak and get feedback on. (So there's no need to sell your soul to me.)</p>\n<p>It is a unique self contained set of two levels. These teach the basics of the game and general taster of what to expect from the main game. The goal of the game is to eliminate different boss targets in order to progress further and unlock new skills/abilities.<br/></p>\n<p>I am really excited to get this out there and I hope y'all have a great time with the game demo!</p>\n\n<p>Link to website:\u00a0http://corrafiniuminc.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-18T02:54:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a4/3a408fc109cb7164d31c49bcc3140139.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CorrafiniumInc"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
