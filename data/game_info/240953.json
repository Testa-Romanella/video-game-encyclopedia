Journey through the broken world of Alma as you search for the powers locked within the human body.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>What sort of mysteries will you uncover?\u201d<br/></em></strong>Kleinman XOXO/Internet Personality</p>\n<p><strong>Flesh </strong>is my entry for the 2018\u2019s \u201cA Game By Its Cover\u201d held on itch.io. The idea behind this game jam was to pick up a fictional cover made for the \u201cMy Famicase Exhibition\u201d hosted by Super Meteor in Japan and turn it into a game/project/anything playable (or not). I got really inspired by the \u201cFlesh\u201d cover and description. So much I decided to contact the original creator, Kleinman XOXO, who wasn\u2019t only extremely nice and answered all my mails, he also wished me luck with the project.</p>\n<p>The game can be considered an adventure with some really light RPG touches and \u201cexperiments\u201d with certain elements present in a number of NES games, particularly <em>Hydlide</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> and <em>Megami Tensei</em>. The player controls the main character, Neux, on a journey through Alma, a monster infested territory in an attempt to stop the siege of the demon race. The game world it\u2019s semi-open, as objectives can be completed in different orders, and to aid you in the (turn-based) battles you can summon undead versions of the monsters you defeat by using specific items during combat.</p>\n<ul><li>Unravel the secrets buried in the blasted lands and darkest dungeons of the mysterious land of Alma.</li><li>Dominate your enemies by learning fantastic spells and finding hidden power-ups.</li><li>Use the remains of defeated monsters to summon their undead counterparts.</li><li>Get ready to face <em>Valak</em>!
