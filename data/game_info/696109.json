Now what's so interesting is that how quickly things elevated. From selling charcoal then coming back home in the evening to find out your family was murdered by random people, which is so unusual and such an absurd thing to happen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now doing this story was very complicated as I wanted to make this twine story as interactive as possible to gather the user's attention and compare it to the inspiration \"Demon Slayer\" it's so similar yet so different as I added a few more extensions to make it as interactive as possible so the user can have a pretty good experience.\u00a0 Now as I include a few more things to the story I did come to a problem of running out of ideas as things needed to fit in well with the story.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To me, I think I could have done better with the design of my work since I mainly focused on the story but I honestly prefer having a good story with a good design as it's more appealing to the user which I kind of failed to do.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T05:58:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94d/94d25926f68f2f25cf4413381177d412.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jake Laurence Paz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
