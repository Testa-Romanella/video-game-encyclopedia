Can you survive the night with the Spirits at some of the most haunted locations in the world?<br/>And if you are afraid of ghosts and paranormal activities, you better team up with your friends because every horror is little less scary when you are not alone in the dark.<br/><br/>The haunted locations are crawling with paranormal activities and various Spirits. Use your equipment to get in touch with the other side to help you survive the night, but be careful, summoning a wrong Spirit can have fatal consequences.<h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Explore haunted locations - Find energy fields that act as amplifier for the Spirits and allow them to step into physical realm. Avoid haunted energy fields and objects that can summon evil Spirits.<br/></li><li>Multiple Spirits per session - There are multiple Spirits present at the location and only one can be summoned at a time. Your actions determine which one will be summoned. There are good Spirits that can help you and evil Spirits that try to lure, attack and kill you. Watch out for sinister ones as they present themself as good ones!<br/></li><li>Communicate and play games with the Spirits - You can use the <strong>Spirit Board</strong> and <strong>Estes Method</strong> to communicate with the Spirits. Once you have contacted the Spirit, you can find out more about them through questions and also play games with them, such as <strong>ClapClap</strong> (and many more to come).<br/></li><li>Rituals and Spirit sessions - Gather the chairs, light up the candles, form the circle and summon the Spirits.<br/></li><li>Prepare and defend against evil Spirit attacks - As you cooperate with the good Spirits, they will help and reward you with charms that will help you repeal evil Spirit attacks. You can also find objects around the map that can help you defend, such as crosses (and many more to come).<br/></li><li>Event based Spirit mechanics - Spirit manifestation through events like appear, anger and attack (and few secret ones). From the classic stereotypical events like banging on the door, footsteps, light flicker to the events involving teleportation, hallucinations, astral planes and more (if you dare to find out).<br/></li><li>Voice recognition - Use your microphone to communicate with the Spirits! Friendly advice, don't curse or mention the word of God in the presence of evil Spirits (but you can always find out what will happen if you do).</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T06:22:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2dc/2dc0f39e9021463a515e29be9eac7c59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 523, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ClickToPlay Games"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["ClickToPlay Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
