Have you ever seen a tree battle-royale? Neither have we (so far). That's why we decided to create one. I present to you a world of fairy tales and legends, where each of you (players) will take the form of a sapling of the mythical tree Yggdrasil, the very tree on which (literally) Norse mythology is based. The goal of each player is to become this mighty entity entwining the nine worlds. Well, Yggdrasil is one, so you have to compete with other seedlings for this venerable title. You will need cunning and agility to win. You have to watch out for stones and roots of other players because they can block your way. The winner is the player who eliminates the hearts of the remaining trees or blocks all their roots. Game for 2-8 players, played with a split keyboard and gamepads.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T07:00:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/975/975821e72d28104c2907395244c7a703.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Knurled", "hokaros"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
