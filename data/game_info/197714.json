Don't forget that the walls are really bouncy though.</p><p>Best experienced with two players although it works great with only one player too(if you're forever alone).</p><p>The game doesn't have any sound yet so i'll let you turn on your favorite music. You can also choose to sit in complete silence but that is not recomended.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c2/5c277409ccd86978546eafe5f65e52e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Superfroggman"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
