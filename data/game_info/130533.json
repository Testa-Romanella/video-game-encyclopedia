The basic concept is simple, each move you make advances the game world by one turn. Each turn you are either getting more powerful by moving onto the grey power squares or loosing power. Gain 5 power units and you will raise a color level. Raising a color level enables you to enter locked squares and overcome enemies that have an equal or lower color level than you.</p><p>An earlier version of this game was initially created for the Ludum Dare 48 hour game making competition. It placed 76th overall and was well received. Spectra represents a more polished version of that game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a32/a32a075c0c0b2d3b9f8d932ad42e0885.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Albedo Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
