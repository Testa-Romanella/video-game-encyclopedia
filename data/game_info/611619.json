Decide who is your opponent and shoot them down, or play as the criminal and shank the cop!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBefore the game begins decide who will play as a cop, and who will be a criminal. The cops must shoot the criminals, but if they shoot a civilian they will be terminated.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nShoot or shank your way to victory!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFor the best experience, plug in an Xbox controller. If you don't have one, the game will revert to keyboard controls. You must have one controller for each player in order to enjoy local multiplayer.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T02:54:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca8/ca8451f7b55c43ac637d93393e1210e5.jpg", "website": "https://2barrelarts.com/?page=ShankTheCop", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["2 Barrel Arts"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["2 Barrel Arts"], "esrb_rating": null}
