The higher you sing, the higher the fish swims. The lower you sing, the lower the fish swims. If you don't sing, the fish inflates and do not go through the hole. That is all. In addition, each hole is associated with a single tone, so understanding the melody of the level will help you get safely to the end.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T04:10:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df5/df5686930aa7c8f43131a74793c4210c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jind\u0159ich Skeldal"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Jind\u0159ich Skeldal"], "esrb_rating": null}
