Conflict was a simple game (straightforward diplomatic and military options), yet it was quite intense with the political and military drama that arose. It could also be completed in a lunch break, which made it a nice quick distraction.</p>\n<p>Upheaval's initial scenario is an alternative China South Sea Dispute, however my aim is to allow different countries/weapon systems/diplomatic choices via mod support, allowing people to create their own scenarios.</p>\r\nWhat next?\r\n<p>I'm constantly working on the game, but I'm a solo developer. That means progress is slow but steady.\u00a0 Current plans are:-</p>\n<ul><li>Mod support at mentioned, so can add and modify scenarios.</li><li>I'm looking for a graphic artist to help improve current placeholder graphics.</li><li>Hopefully will receive feedback from the community, to improve balancing, ideas and comments.</li></ul>\n<p>Future feature additions can be found here:-\u00a0https://itch.io/t/355621/features-to-be-implemented</p>\r\nFuture hopes.\r\n<p>Hopefully\u00a0the prototype will develop into a\u00a0fully functioning game. At which point the game will likely\u00a0 become\u00a0a paid product and will look to get the game on other platforms (steam, etc.).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/875/875e1d3fa68fc0ff72f3b060a7d12789.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Niris Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
