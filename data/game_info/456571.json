It doesn't go particularly far, but shows a some of the ideas I've been working with.\u00a0It'd be great to have some folks try it out and, as it's a more or less open game, it'd be awesome if anyone would be willing to take video of their playthrough. Please let\u00a0me know if you find any bugs/errors/weird stuff.\u00a0Thanks for checking it out!<br/><br/>You can play in browser, or the downloadable file is a Gameboy rom, and should work with any Gameboy emulator.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T06:11:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63f/63f0a90751e32fe8ece9392929808eb9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["themoonsidian"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
