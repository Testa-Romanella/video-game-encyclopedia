Consumption of \"Not Sandwich\" items will damage your smugness levels.</p>\n<p>Consume items that were designated as \"Would Eat\" to regain health. If you accidentally consume items that are \"Would Not Eat\", you will lose health.</p>\n<p>(Uses sprites from Kenney [@KenneyNL, created in Unity])</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d10/d10225b3a76e186265fb0824a2d3255f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hekemp"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
