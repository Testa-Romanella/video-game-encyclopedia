Panorama Cotton is the third entry in the Cotton series and made a major departure from the original gameplay formula of prior Cotton entries; instead of being a side-scrolling shooter like the others, it was a pseudo-3D shooter in the style of Sega's classic arcade hit Space Harrier. Stylistically, it also stands out for having lost the melancholy undertones that the other games have; instead, it simply strives to be uniquely psychedelic.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:36:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3cd/3cd01aaa12d93517798cc37d055eb69f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 283, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Genesis"], "developers": ["Success"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Sunsoft"], "esrb_rating": null}
