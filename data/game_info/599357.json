A Boat Full is a top down 2D trading game in which you play as a merchant with your own ship, and sail the seas visiting ports at islands and landmasses to buy and sell items in the hopes for a profit. The games world is made up of a simple pixel art tile map and small sprites. The game has a map feature, and the shops stock is generated randomly from a range. The shops refresh on a minute rotation so they are always different and never get sold out for long.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T06:15:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb3/bb3d47168737a3082d42ff6854b35b51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RackhamUP"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
