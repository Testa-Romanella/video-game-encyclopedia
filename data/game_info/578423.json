When Blaine goes on a space mission to explore the far side of the moon, his boyfriend Finn stays on Earth. Yearning quickly turns into an unhealthy obsession. In an attempt to help himself, Finn digs out a dream buried in his heart for over a decade: breakdancing.</p>\n<p>The goal is to survive five more months of long distance, but little does Finn know that the real love trouble will start right after Blaine\u2019s return.</p>\n<p>Can the two trust each other after so many months apart? Finn desperately needs a promise, but will Blaine ever feel ready to give it to him?</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Player's Age: 18+</strong> (sexual humor, adult people's issues, based on a short story solely\u00a0 for adult audiences)</p>\n<br/>\n<ul><li>10,000+ words of professionally written and edited text</li><li>A linear storyline / no choices\u00a0(sorry...\u00a0we believe in determinism when it comes to love!)</li><li>1 great protagonist, 1 mysterious love interest, 4 amazing supporting characters</li><li>An adorable happy ending with lots of kisses and moon basalt</li><li>Several colorful locations (university, dance school, skatepark, aquarium, etc.)</li><li>Quirky characters (no animations but with different clothes)</li><li>Finn's mood displayed in the upper right corner of the game screen</li><li>A handpicked soundtrack (with the possibility to listen to the protagonist's radio)</li><li>A game interface\u00a0stylized as an artistic, grunge diary</li><li>Original cursor</li><li>12 unique presents you can collect (with hilarious, sarcastic captions)</li></ul>\n\n<br/>\n\n<p><strong>Finn</strong> is the main character of this game. He's an insecure guy, who however sinned before (LOL). His hobbies are physics, (talking about)\u00a0breakdancing, doodling in his disorderly diary, and gathering trashy souvenirs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Blaine\u00a0</strong>is\u00a0<em>the\u00a0</em>man.\u00a0The one\u00a0Finn is pining after, and who claims to love him back (?!), but then packs his stuff anyways\u00a0and moves out of his... no, not apartment.\u00a0<em>Planet.</em>\u00a0You'd hate him, but what can you do, Finn loves him anyways.</p>\n\n<p><strong>KT\u00a0</strong>is Blaine's sister. She's the only person who can actually understand Finn's pain. Having a brother in space is painful, but apparently, not as much as having a boyfriend in there, as she seems to cope better than Finn.</p>\n<p><strong>Ari</strong> is one of Finn's college classmates. She has a great personality but sometimes, she makes Finn feel awkward.\u00a0We don't really know why, she doesn't do it on purpose, she just always says the first dumb thing that comes to her mind.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Waldo</strong> is Ari's boyfriend, and another college classmate of Finn. It's unclear though how they became friends, Waldo is not exactly the type anyone wants to be friends with. He's mean and won't lend you his physics notes (unless you beg). He's\u00a0heavily homophobic, and always picks triggering movies. Yikes!</p>\n\n<p>There she is, <strong>Flavia</strong>. She's a beautiful trans lady, the breakdancing competition's superstar, and\u00a0Finn's childhood friend. Her energy and enthusiasm\u00a0<em>never\u00a0</em>ends. She won't take it easy on Finn's workouts, but that's only cause she knows, how important breakdancing is for him.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br/>\n<ul><li><strong>Esc</strong> - Go back to menu screen</li><li><strong>Space</strong> - Progress game</li><li><strong>J </strong>- Open Finn's Journal (Backlog)</li><li><strong>L</strong> - Load screen</li><li><strong>S </strong>- Save screen</li></ul>\n<br/>\n<p>Avast accidentally flares up when launching this game, considering it a \"new application.\" If this happens to you, you can safely proceed to play the game.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Follow Lucky Star Games on itch.io to receive updates about the newest games!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T04:30:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/425/42564490c08d519f6c0e63cb352337d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 307, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lucky Star Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
