This is a fan parody re-creation parody of a game created for the following youtube video by \"Jerma985\".  It is a parody based on the video. All copyrights belong to their respective copywriters.\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p>Painstakingly recreated after spending countless hours analyzing every small detail in the \"Castle Griffensteed\" video. Originally the project started as a personal project. Facing the question of \"Can I do this?\". It quickly transitioned into \"Why am I doing this?\". Which left me with the result of what you see today. I've tried my best, given both the engine's constraints, and my own sanity, to make a true-to-original version of what was shown in the original video.</p>\n<p><strong>I've had trouble identifying sounds and music from the original video please leave a comment if you think you've found a missing song or sound or something is in the wrong place</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Interesting facts about this project:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Made in GameGuru Classic.
