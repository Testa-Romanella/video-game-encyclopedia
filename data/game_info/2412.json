{"id": 2412, "slug": "dungeons-2", "name": "Dungeons 2", "name_original": "Dungeons 2", "description": "<p>Dungeons 2 is a strategy game where you take on the role of an evil lord named the Ultimate Evil that wants to restore his power over the lands he lost. While the Ultimate Evil himself is an embodied spirit, he can control minions that fight and build facilities. The Evil, in his turn, has to keep them happy so the minions could continue their work and stay loyal.<br />\nThe game combines elements of a real-time strategy and dungeon manager. The simulation part of the game is focused on the underworld where you are to build dungeons and summon new monsters that will serve you. As soon as you decide to go up and occupy several castles, Dungeons 2 turns into a tactical game where you need to manage your units effectively.<br />\nDungeons 2, as a follower of Dungeons, keeps its sarcastic spirit and the narration that helps you to understand the tasks and just entertains you. Despite the dark setting of the game, it\u2019s full of pop culture references including Lord of the Rings and Warcraft, and filled with dark humor.</p>", "metacritic": 70, "released": "2015-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-28T13:09:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/476/4767c380895fd35a4f1b59016dc45967.jpg", "website": "http://www.dungeons-game.com/", "rating": 2.84, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 253, "owned": 3205, "beaten": 50, "toplay": 18, "dropped": 91, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 85, "ratings_count": 269, "suggestions_count": 570, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 269, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "iOS", "PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Kalypso Media", "Realmforge Studios"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Kalypso Media"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
