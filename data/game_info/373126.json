I decided to add some shooting with Powerups.</p>\n<p>There is no goal. Actually, you can try to achieve as much score as you can, get your highest combo possible, destroy as much Tetrominoes as you can, grab the powerups.</p>\n<p>Just avoid falling pieces.</p>\r\n\r\nAssets\r\n<p>All sprites were made by me in Photoshop.</p>\n<p>All sounds were created with BFXR</p>\r\n\r\nScoring\r\n<p><strong>Score</strong>: You get 5 points for each destroyed Tetromino<br/><strong>Combo</strong>: Rises with each destroyed Tetromino - by default, you have 4 seconds to destroy another piece or you will lose your combo. It multiplies base score by this value</p>\r\n\r\nStrategy\r\n<p>Maximize your efficiency with diagonal shooting and jumping.</p>\n<p>Holding Left+Right locks your position and allows shooting in the direction of the first horizontal input pressed.</p>\r\n\r\nDifficulty\r\n<p>The game introduces Difficulty:<br/>For each 5 Tetrominoes destroyed, the difficulty goes up. It means the pieces will fall faster, and your combo timer will shorten.<br/>Maximum difficulty is 14, so it can get pretty tough.</p>\n<p>New Tetrominoes will spawn with random HP:<br/>\r\nGreens - 5, 6 HP,<br/>\r\nBlues - 7, 8 HP,<br/>\r\nYellows - 9, 10 HP,<br/>\r\nReds - 11, 12 HP</p>\r\n\r\nPowerups\r\n<p>There are (currently) 4 powerups available in the game:</p>\r\nAimTemporary fixes the weapon spread.
