The \"Dreamy\" theme served as inspiration for both the visuals and floaty mechanics. My interpretation of the \"each playthrough is different\" limitation was simple. I didn't want it to complicate the process too much so since this was mainly a learning experience for me, so I chose the \"i guess rouge-like\", auto-scrolling shooter route. This was a lot of fun and help me establish plans and goals for myself. Any suggestions or corrections are appreciated. Hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T21:15:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/143/143d6a4b5b1d003a603dbb85b5e051ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pre Dude"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
