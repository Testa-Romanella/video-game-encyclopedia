The game was published by Capcom and run on their CPS-2 arcade system board. Mars Matrix was later ported to the Dreamcast video game console in 2001. The arcade version is notable for using a horizontally aligned monitor (much like Giga Wing), something that is considered rare for a vertical shooter.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-27T01:10:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/838/8388e738550138ddc3053c409592f029.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 282, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Dreamcast"], "developers": ["Takumi"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Capcom"], "esrb_rating": null}
