Unfortunately, they keep accidentally sending their balls over to your side of the fence. Throw them back to be a good neighbour.</p>\n<p><strong>Objective</strong><br/>Be a better neighbour than your opponent by keeping your backyard clear while theirs gets filled with balls from their own other active neighbour.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong><br/>Place balls by moving and rotating them.</p>\n<p>There are five different sports a ball belongs to. There are two types of things thrown from your neighbour \u2013 normal and throw types. Normal types are balls from one sport. Throw types include both a hand and a ball from a sport. </p>\n<p>To throw back balls to your neighbour align a throw type vertically or horizontally with the same corresponding normal type ball. Any matching balls in the next space vertically or horizontally are also thrown back.</p>\n<p>Every time you throw back four balls your opponent's neighbour will hear of your goodwill, become jealous and respond by throwing your opponent one rubber duck. Rubber ducks are thrown back when a nearby normal type ball is thrown. Subsequent balls next to rubber ducks will not be thrown.</p>\n<p>You win when your opponent places a ball outside their backyard, out of view.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/>* Player 1 controls</p>\n<p>\u00a0 W \u2013 Very fast ball drop<br/>\u00a0 A \u2013 Move balls left<br/>\u00a0 S \u2013 Faster ball drop<br/>\u00a0 D \u2013 Move balls right</p>\n<p>\u00a0 F \u2013 Rotate ball anti-clockwise<br/>\u00a0 G \u2013 Rotate ball clockwise</p>\n<p>* Player 2 controls</p>\n<p>\u00a0 I \u2013 Very fast ball drop<br/>\u00a0 J \u2013 Move balls left<br/>\u00a0 K \u2013 Faster ball drop<br/>\u00a0 L \u2013 Move balls right</p>\n<p>\u00a0 ; \u2013 Rotate ball anti-clockwise<br/>\u00a0 ' \u2013 Rotate ball clockwise</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong><br/>Tested on Windows 10 only.</p>\n<p><strong>Assets used</strong><br/>* https://kenney.nl/assets</p>\n<p>* Vivacity Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>\u00a0 Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>\u00a0 http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p>* \"Winner Winner!\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>\u00a0 Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>\u00a0 http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/383/3838ad980ddb8ebef2ce3146f7af8179.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["milmoe"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
