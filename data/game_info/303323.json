{"id": 303323, "slug": "hark", "name": "Hark!", "name_original": "Hark!", "description": "<p>Hark! Is a minimalist mobile puzzle game for HTML and\u00a0Android where you conquer blocks based on numbers. Click a block to take that block and the blocks adjacent to it (no diagonals!). If you are playing as Player 1, if the blocks on the clicked block's sides amount to an even number when added with the clicked block, you capture those too. For Player 2, the blocks are only captured when the resulting sum of the two numbers make an odd number. You can steal your opponents blocks - blocks with a higher number are worth more - and whoever has the highest score wins!<br/></p>\n<p>Made for the NotGDC Jam!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-22T03:16:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/773/77329d44369797066eceece3967d9173.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Web"], "developers": ["valentijnnieman"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
