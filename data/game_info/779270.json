{"id": 779270, "slug": "before-the-cat", "name": "Before the Cat", "name_original": "Before the Cat", "description": "<p>This is a nearly complete collection of all the games I've released before 2021. Some of these used to be available on my webpage, but they were under a different alias, so I feel like they don't really fit anymore. That being said, I still wanted them to be available somewhere, hence the idea for this collection.</p>\n<p>Also included are source codes whenever available. I figure, these games are old enough now that I feel comfortable with people digging into them. It's worth noting that a few of these games were made with Game Maker in versions that are probably obsolete today, so it might be a challenge to look into.</p>\n<p>In addition, I've decided to include a few unfinished games that I think had potential, but unfortunately never had the drive to finish. This is some really emotional stuff for me, for years I beat myself up over not being able to finish anything. It wasn't until recently I found the courage to finish game development projects, so for me this is a way of casting off the baggage of the past.</p>\n<p>As you can see, this collection is very personal to me. My ultimate hope is that I can maybe inspire other people who were in the same position as me, to see that it is possible to move forward despite the entire universe telling you no.</p>\n<p>Thank you for everything.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T12:42:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5df/5df9b81bfeb1400fe346f14d3071d676.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fat, Lazy Cat"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
