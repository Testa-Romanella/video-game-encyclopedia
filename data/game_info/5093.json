{"id": 5093, "slug": "hustle-kings", "name": "Hustle Kings", "name_original": "Hustle Kings", "description": "<p>Hustle Kings is a pool game released exclusively for PlayStation consoles. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The video game represents a classic kind of pool games, the eight-ball type, which is played on a table with six pockets along the rails, a full rack of fifteen balls and the cue ball. The goal is to claim a suit, pocket all of the balls, then pocket them, while denying one&#39;s opponent opportunities to do the same with their suit, and without sinking the balls early accidentally. The player wins if he pockets eight balls into a selected pocket, if the opposing player illegally pockets the eight balls, or if the opposing player knocks the eight balls off the table. </p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>In Hustle Kings, the player can have a face-to-face or a team match, switch four career levels, do daily tasks for additional points, and upgrade the cue and the balls. The game features a career mode as well as various trick shot and tournament modes. It also features online play which allows the player to compete against other players. Hustle Kings lets the user play their external music from the PlayStation 3 hard drive during matches. It also lets them implement the YouTube API to record video of their gameplay and upload it on the platform. The developers add rudimentary virtual reality support and Move control support so that the player could feel as if the game is performed for real. It is possible to use VR; the functions don&#39;t change much, but the player can look at balls closer than ever before.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-10T18:33:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ab/8abe21e59968c9e81b29f6cf41cdda79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.41, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 25, "owned": 759, "beaten": 7, "dropped": 56, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 127, "ratings_count": 93, "suggestions_count": 238, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 93, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Sony Interactive Entertainment", "VooFoo Studios"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
