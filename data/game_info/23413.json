Here are six more finely-detailed vessels for viewing at both room- and full-scale with a VR headset. You can stroll along their decks or pick them up for a closer look. Models are displayed on a beautifully-rendered ocean with a dynamic day/night cycle that you control. Each ship includes an \"action\" event, whereby mighty cannons fire, ship horns bellow, the submarine dives, ice-breaker breaks-ice, etc. Only exteriors of ships are modeled, as the high level of detail is already pushing system requirements to their limits.<br/><br/><strong>Included Ships:</strong><br/><ul><li>First-rate ship of the line: HMS Victory  <br/></li><li>Ford class aircraft carrier: USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78)  <br/></li><li>Research Vessel: RV Calypso  <br/></li><li>Ocean liner: RMS Queen Mary 2  <br/></li><li>German submarine: U-boat Type VII-C/41 (U-659)  <br/></li><li>Icebreaker: USCGC Healy (WAGB-20)  </li></ul><br/>Note: this is a standalone experience and does not require Volume 1.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:07:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/916/916e00dcf1b841744389e0c674b8a586.jpg", "website": "http://www.vroom.space", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VROOM"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["VROOM"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
