I'm working hard to get this one finished and polished (see notes below).</p><p>You play as Mr. Cherchez, a baron who spent his life searching for a mythical altar promised to be able to create a perfect woman. He finally go to the other side of the world, to a land of three goddesses that have the power.<br/></p><p>Use arrows and space to play. The game has been made with as minimal number of text information as possible (actually there are three words: RECIPE, ITEM and INVENTORY). I tried to bring classic mechanics of grinding &amp; crafting to a bare minimum.</p><p>It was a quite challenging project I took to finish in very short time (spent 3 days on it). I took the hard path of using good old C and my own micro game engine Punity. The game is not quite finished yet. I'll do my best to finish game's missing ending scene (one godess + the game ending), so hold your horses if you want to know how the story ends. I had a ton of fun working on this, but now lemme sleep for a few days.<br/></p><p><strong>Changelog</strong></p><ul><li>Version 3 - finally fixed the audio!</li><li>Version 2 - fixed window title and hid the console window.</li><li>Version 1 - original submission.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/866/866680b619abe2f93877d1df2c80c28a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Martin Cohen"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
