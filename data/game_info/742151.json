As Henri Bergson puts it, there\u2019s \u201csomething mechanical encrusted on the living.\u201d In an essay on literary criticism, Viktor Shklovsky argues that as perception becomes habit, it becomes automatic, and to live in a state of automatism is to live a life half-expressed. As we become used to our routines, we stop truly \u201cseeing\u201d the things we pass by every day.</p>\n<p>I practiced \u201cseeing\u201d a mundane aspect of my life for the first time by going for a virtual walk and mapping my new perception of the sights I\u2019ve gotten used to, through a technique Shklovsky calls \u201cdefamiliarization\u201d \u2013 presenting a common thing in an unfamiliar way.</p>\n<p>This is a mix of music, thoughts, and scenery, just like my usual daily walk.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Game credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Music by Vladim Vilain (Instagram: @neuroticmamacita) and Oriana Confente (Instagram: @urghleshmeck)</p>\n<p>Bitsy by Adam Le Doux, a little game maker</p>\n<p>Pixsy by ruin, a tool for turning images into Bitsy rooms</p>\n<p>Borksy by ayolland, a tool for hacking Bitsy</p>\n<p>Google Maps, for source images</p>\n\n<p><strong>Theoretical resources:</strong></p>\n<p>O\u2019Gieblyn, Meghan. \u201cRoutine maintenance: Embracing habit in an automated world.\u201d <em>Harper\u2019s Magazine</em>, 8 December 2021.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shklovsky, Viktor. \u201cArt as Technique.\u201d <em>Literary Theory: An Anthology</em>, edited by Julie Rivkin and Michael Ryan, 2nd ed, Blackwell Pub, 2004.
