When his maniacal plans of world domination backfires, he accidentally creates a potion that has turned him into a little dust ball! He must now collect enough ingredients scattered around his basement to create an antidote to turn himself back to normal, all while hiding from his magical pet who is out on the hunt for some delicious food. Can he manage to create an antidote before being eaten, or is his fate sealed? Hide from monsters, collect food and save the magician!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please Don\u2019t Eat Me was developed by students at Futuregames. Inspired by games such as Overcooked and Little Nightmares we set out to create a fun little 3D platformer where the main mechanic is to transform the player into different kinds of food. Much like prop hunt, you hide from enemies by transforming yourself into objects in the environment.</p>\n<p>We targeted our game towards a younger audience, though the game can be played by anyone of any age! We sincerely hope you enjoy Please Don't Eat Me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T08:18:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5b/d5b15921cbd6446258293c8eb96c27f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Futuregames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
