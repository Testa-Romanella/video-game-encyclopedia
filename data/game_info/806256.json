A\u00a0child has gone missing, a demonic witch haunts the woods and if you're not careful, gnomes will take your socks. Also, there is a pig king...\u00a0don't ask. But why have all these creatures suddenly appeared? Where did the witch come from and what does she want?\u00a0Could the answer to everything lie behind the ancient gate in the nearby mountains?</p>\n<p>The Witch's Lullaby is a classical point and click adventure reminiscent of the King's Quest or Quest for Glory series. It was made in two weeks for AdvJam 2022, mainly to scratch a nostalgic itch for lush fantasy forests in glorious 320x200.
