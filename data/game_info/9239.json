A game designed to challenge you, and to entertain you in a brand new fashion. Linearis is a unique take on the classic Match 3 game, with some innovative twists to push your wits to the limit.<br/>Match 3 or more orbs together by linking them horizontally, vertically, or both. Orbs can be right next to each other, or across the screen. I\u2019m sure it sounds like a cakewalk, I\u2019m sure. But I assure you, you\u2019ll be in for a hefty surprise. This game will throw some serious obstacles your way, designed to punish you, but with the right amount of brainpower, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll prevail. <br/>Perhaps. :)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:30:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b51/b512c48a83b0d6d498b1c7ffdda62368.jpeg", "website": "http://www.mode-44.com/Linearis.aspx", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Mode_44"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Mode_44"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
