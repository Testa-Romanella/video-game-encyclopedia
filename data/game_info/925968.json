The more times the ball bounces before hitting an enemy the more points you get and the more damage the ball does.</p>\n<p>The core pillars of my design are:\u00a0\u00a0Purposeful action,\u00a0Improvisation and\u00a0Stylish\u00a0</p>\n<p> I want the player to feel quick-witted (smart and powerful) and also have a sense of mastery and discovery.</p>\n<p>In the game, you can hold down the left click to see a trajectory of where the ball will initially go and if you press E after you throw the ball it will explode (making it easier to hit enemies). Also, every bounce will increase the size of the explosion.</p>\n<p>I currently have 2 levels, one with stationary enemies and one with moving enemies. I have done this as I found it may be too hard to hit moving enemies whilst also quickly lining up shots so I am going to test which one works better</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T10:15:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8de/8de8a6b22cd9553f6e496e9158e752ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jack Beddows"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
