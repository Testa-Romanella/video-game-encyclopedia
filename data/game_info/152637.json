Each of these resources will need to be replenished as you play by finding pickups scattered across the level.<br/></p>\n<p>Each of the four levels are composed of series of individual objectives that must be completed to clear the level. Accessing your map and mission objective screen will help you navigate between points on the map. <br/></p>\n<p>Their is no saving mid level, instead the game automatically unlocks the next level upon the completion of the current level and saves your progress.</p>\n<p>Currently the game only supports keyboard and mouse controls.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Developer's Note</strong><br/>I'm a self taught game developer and this is my first commercial release.
