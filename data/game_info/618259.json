The mace cannot be moved independantly and is attatched/reliant on the player and their fates are thus \"Joined Together\".</p>\n<p>Thanks to one of my friends for the music! You know who you are :)</p>\n<p><strong>Sorry about the UI and the game fitting the screen badly. I had major issues with exporting from unity and applying the used aspect ratio in Itch.io, if anyone knows anything to help with this then it will be grately aprecciated :)</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T09:59:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9fe/9feda30f24251ec8d59780ec52efc2ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MegaSharkx1"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
