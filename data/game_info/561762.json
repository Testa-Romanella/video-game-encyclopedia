It is a game only playable by 2 players (or one with two controllers) locally.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>In\u00a0<strong>Luggers,\u00a0</strong>you will have to get through 4 EPIC puzzles, you will need to use your arms and strength to reach the end of the castle.\u00a0</p>\r\nYou want to play with your friend who's at his home ?\r\n<p><strong>No. Problem.\u00a0</strong>You just have to download\u00a0<strong><em>Parsec</em></strong> and connect with your friend, he can now virtually plug his controller (or keyboard) in your computer and you can play (stronger) together ! :)</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Action ==&gt;\u00a0KEYBOARD/MOUSE ==&gt; </strong><strong>GAMEPAD</strong></p>\n<ul><li>L.U.G / THROW ==&gt; E ==&gt; South Button</li><li>Put down ==&gt; F ==&gt; East Button</li><li>Movement ==&gt; WASD ==&gt; Left Stick</li><li>Lock mouse ==&gt; Left Alt ==&gt; -----</li><li>Camera rotation ==&gt; Mouse ==&gt; Right Stick</li></ul>\n<p><strong>How to play ?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>First, you need to be 2. Either you with yourself (keyboard + gamepad alone).</p>\n<p>Either you with your FRIEND ! But you can not start the game if you only see the red player on the main menu :(</p>\n<p>Try out the parsec way ! :)</p>\n<p>SECOND, if you ever get stucked in a level, I'm sorry... You have to go back to the main menu (via the pause menu ;) ), rebind the players to the controllers (make'em spawn), and hit 'Continue' which should have saved to your furthest level reached.</p>\n<p>Third, HAVE FUN ! It is not a huge game, it's really short, bugged in many ways, but hey, YOU CAN THROW YOUR FRIEND OUT ! that's pretty damn funny.</p>\n<p>Have fun discovering our really small game, we really hope it makes you have a laugh !</p>\n<p>Take care !</p>\n<p>Sylver &amp; Pantoine (you can find us on the brackeys discord!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T07:40:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ef/7ef4d6d2974df6caf99b06306f6b5690.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pantoine"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
