{"id": 955572, "slug": "super-spatial", "name": "Super-Spatial", "name_original": "Super-Spatial", "description": "Super Spatial is an exploration and puzzle game.  You have safety in your spaceship which helps you jump into hyperspace to travel between solar systems and reach planets that may have the material you need.  Once in a solar system, your map helps you triangulate and find planets where you can navigate your ship so you can descend and begin searching for the material that you need to load onto the surface capsule and return to your ship.  Your ship holds some of the machines to begin building the tools and machines you'll need to do research to find your home.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2018Esc\u2019 reveals settings, recipes and research that will provide you guidance on what you will need to collect, forge, refine, and build to progress in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNo one is there to help you, so you must solve what to do next on your own, each tool and machine more complex to build than the next. But, as you collect items from planets and refine them, you build tools to use on your ship and on the planets to speed your progress.  Your mission is to find resources, solve problems and discover how to put everything together to hopefully find your home, and complete the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T05:07:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c6/7c675e5a2113a8e4932e25a7c4fbd82f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Josh Verhaaren"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Jonas Anderson"], "esrb_rating": null}
