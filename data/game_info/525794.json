Twitch chat was able to decide the main game\u00a0mechanics, and even the name of the game. After each major decision Twitch chat was then released to wreck havoc upon the streamers itshafu, storymodebae, and wavy.\u00a0 Where even more\u00a0more choices were presented to influence the game.</p>\n<p>Now for a limited time, you too can harness the power of Dr.\u00a0Doggo, and relive some of the experiences at GlitchCon! Just download the game, activate the game with Crowd\u00a0Control, install the Twitch extension, and let your chat decide your fate!</p>\n<p>Need help or have questions?
