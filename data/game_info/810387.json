Nope. It's much simpler than that.<br/>The aim of the game is to drive as long as you can, trying to avoid running out of fuel and avoiding hazards.<br/>Controls are simple. Just press <strong>FIRE</strong> on joystick in <strong>Port 2 </strong>to change the direction the car rotates/drives. This is how you navigate around the screen to try to collect gas cannisters to replenish your fuel.</p>\n<p>Bonus points are awarded every time you collect a gas cannister.</p>\n<p>You can speed up and slow down the car by pushing <strong>UP </strong>or <strong>DOWN </strong>on the joystick.<br/><br/>Why would we wanna do that, Roysterini?<br/><br/>Well, I'm glad you asked.<br/>Speeding up might make things trickier, but it also will increase your score pickup multiplier. You can have a max of THREE times multiplier for your gas cannister collection score. However, if you wuss out and go too slow, your multiplier will drop to <strong>0.5</strong>.<br/><br/>That's it. Just try to beat your best scores. Anything over <strong>800 </strong>is <strong>VERY </strong>respectable.<br/><br/>Download and play in you fave C64 Emulator or load on hardware if you have the facility to do so.<br/><br/>Game was designed primarily for <strong>PAL</strong> C64, but it should run okay on <strong>NTSC</strong>. It might sound a bit odd on NTSC, but the game will play the same.<br/>I find the sound works best on C64C versions of SID chip.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Fun Fact: I didn't even use any IRQs in this game. Just rough ass CMP raster checks and loops. </em></strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T04:16:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d2/9d226dbe98c4a4b114a1afeb75b92aac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Roysterini"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
