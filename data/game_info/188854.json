I created it after following the tutorial and then adding my design flair. Its rudimentary and most probably can and will be broken. Any comments are much appreciated as its my first real game I built with minimal assistance, except from my tutor and of course the awesome Mitchell!<br/>My design process and methods are discussed here:<br/>Not Just Another Gamer!<br/></p><p>If you do try out the game please leave some feedback more specifically about:<br/>1. How did controlling the player sphere feel?<br/>2. How did the music make you feel whilst playing each level?<br/>3. How did you know what to do in the game?<br/>4. Did you find any bugs/mistakes? I know of at least one bug but lets just look at it as a 'feature'.<br/><br/>Thank you so much for your time and interest.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/069/0699ce5eec2df13e22d512606aa30b91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 265, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Not Just Another Gamer!"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
