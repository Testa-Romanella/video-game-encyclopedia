{"id": 946540, "slug": "gridical", "name": "Gridical", "name_original": "Gridical", "description": "<p>Gridical is a grid based action game where the goal is to score as many points as possible by moving up. The only issue with moving up is that you can't go down. If you miss an ammo pickup, its gone forever. Healing is also a lot different than your average game.<br/></p>\n<p>To heal, you need to get rid of your infection first, patch up the bleeding spot, and ice the bruise. In that order, if you don't have an infection, for example, just move on to the second step.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You get points for killing enemies although two of them can't move. So this game is actually very easy, just with more complex systems.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Attributions so I don't get sued:</p>\n<ul><li>Sport Racing Car | DRIVE by Alex-Productions |\u00a0https://onsound.eu/<br/>Music promoted by\u00a0https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/<br/>Creative Commons CC BY 3.0<br/>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</li><li>second song didn't require attribution and the attribution given was a link to a website so no</li></ul>\n<p>Known Issues:</p>\n<ul><li>walls don't have a hitbox, so anyone and anything can walk through them</li><li>gunner enemies only shoot once</li><li>you can collide with pickups</li><li>runner enemies all move at the same speed</li><li>ammo doesnt save between stages</li><li>no tutorial</li></ul>\n<p>might try to remake this game in godot and/or discord at some point with less bugs and more features but for now, it barely works and that is what matters</p>\n<p>not very proud of this game tbh</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T17:35:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/873/873aa88d8da224c79c850267df2c49cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Abyssal"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
