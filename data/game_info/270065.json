Someone from the King's past is lurking, waiting for the right opportunity to strike.</p>\n\n\n<p>Each of the five characters of your party have a unique set of skills. Each character also has access to three unique Classes, each with their own skill sets. This, combined with the importance of managing and manipulating buffs and debuffs gives combat in The Last Journey a wide range of strategic options.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While buffs and debuffs affect all sorts of attributes and damage and so forth, there is an added mechanic where the quantity of buffs and debuffs affect the damage received by a character. The more buffs a character has, the less damage they take, and the inverse is true as well; the more debuffs they have, the more damage they take.</p>\n<p>Emphasis is placed on creating synergy with the various characters and Classes. Piling up certain debuffs on the enemy and certain buffs on yourself, you can create hard-hitting combinations to quickly drop even the strongest enemies!</p>\n<p>But, if you find that combat is too challenging (or perhaps not challenging enough) you can freely adjust the difficulty at any time during the game through the main menu.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e2/3e288aafacf0a513064caf10aaeba7dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 334, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PVGames"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
