You are in a war zone and your mission is to eliminate all other enemy tanks while dodging their missiles. You can aim and fire missiles at will at the enemies.</p>\n<p>Tank Elevated is a blend of classic platformer and artillery genre.<br/>You move with A / D (or the Left / Right arrow keys) and jump with the Space Bar key. You can aim your turret with the mouse and shoot missiles with Mouse Left button. When you get power-up missile/s you can use Mouse Right button to shoot those.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f4/0f4d3158a2f598d77d2cb73b2e4588fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["WizardOfTheValley"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
