{"id": 544937, "slug": "penguin-pub", "name": "Penguin Pub", "name_original": "Penguin Pub", "description": "<p><strong>Welcome to the Penguin Pub! A place for all adventuring penguins, new and old to come and eat, drink and be recruited for adventure!</strong></p>\n<p>You run the Proud Penguin Tavern. But it's not as simple as running a tavern. Your primary job is to recruit adventuring parties to head out on grand quests. If they make it back successfully, you take a cut for setting them up in the first place. And if recruiting has left your pockets a bit empty, you can still make a bit of cash from the patrons who come to your tavern. But who wants to come to an empty, boring old tavern? Nobody, that's who. Don't forget to spend some of that gold upgrading the place so your visitors leave better tips!</p>\n\n<p>This game was made in 7 days for the Kindred Games Community Game Jam 5.</p>\n<ul><li>Art and Design - Kitsunne</li><li>Programming and Design - Kindred</li><li>Audio - Assorted purchased and free sound and music packs from the internet\u00a0</li><li>Penguin Voices - Kindred</li></ul>\n<p>We also work on another game together called Swords 'n Magic and Stuff.
