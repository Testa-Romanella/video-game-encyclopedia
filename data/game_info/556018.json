But--armed with the healthiest metabolism the world has ever seen--you're going to put a stop to that.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMake your way across the park and poop everywhere. Little poops will only slow the joggers down, but keep pooping to increase poop size. When a jogger hits a large poop, they'll be stopped for good and you'll score a point! If you run out of fuel, simply go back to the starting point alongside the taco restaurant and eat. Then you'll be ready for more!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn this love letter to old console games from the early 80s, you'll enjoy unique, one-button, fast-paced action that only gets faster! The action is paired with classic-style visuals and authentic sound effects created with Korg synthesizer software.  With two difficulty levels, and Time Attack mode, you'll chase high scores across 4 Steam Leaderboards.  Available DLC adds three unique new rulesets and 12 more Leaderboards!  There's a set of Achievements too!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe joggers will come faster and in greater numbers, but you'll be ready. This time is going to be different. Look out, joggers...you're going to have a crappy day.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T02:40:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb8/eb86cf1bd8f44c3d4296a2faf78b54e9.jpg", "website": "http://yyrgames.com/?q=pixelpoops", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 15, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Mostly Random Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["yyrGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
