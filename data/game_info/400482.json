If you would like to, play it and leave feedback here\u00a0 or at the game's\u00a0 jam page. It is a quite fun, and pretty polished top down shooter. You play as santas cousin \"The butcher\u00a0\" and you\u00a0 need to save santa by killing, killing and killing.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, I did not get as much detail and originality as I thought I would be able to from the beginning, but I\u00a0 might\u00a0 update this with an after jam version with just a bit more detail.</p>\n<p>And just gonna put a WARNING: GORE! here since I may have forgot about that\u00a0 in the game.</p>\n<p>Controls: (also displayed in tutorial)</p>\n<p>-WASD to move</p>\n<p>-Mouse to aim</p>\n<p>-Left mouse button to shoot</p>\n<p>-Right mouse button to throw your gun</p>\n<p>-E to pick up new gun</p>\n<p>-O to go back to menu</p>\n<p>Objective:</p>\n<p>Free santa by clearing every each one of the 25 levels from enemies and get every key on each map.
