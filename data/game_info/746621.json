Sadly did not have much time to work on the project and add audio and polish, but still wanted to share what I've done.<br/></p>\n<p>The game revolves around the theme of\u00a0 \"It is not real\". The idea was to create a factory where you capture creatures called gloops, scare them to producing ploops and selling. The \"it is not real\" could relate to how we feel bad about creatures that are not real, fear and the ultimate goal of the game. <br/></p>\n\n<p>The game keeps your score between sessions.\u00a0If you get stuck in a situation where you can't play, press \"space\" to reset.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Make games not war<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T07:46:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af5/af54879601c41436d91ee72b9ab08385.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Poor-g"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
