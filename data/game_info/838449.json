There are enemies that shoot missiles into you, but you can eat them! Also, every 60 seconds a boss spawns. Boss battle is a great opportunity to earn 1 HP and decrease game speed a little bit.</p>\n<p><strong>Please, read the tutorial inside the game before you head into playing! There is everything you need to know!</strong></p>\n<p>It has an online leaderboard I implemented using\u00a0<strong>LootLocker</strong>!</p>\n<p><strong>Please</strong>, write your opinion about the game in the comments below. Also, I'd appreciate it if you\u00a0report any bugs you've encountered during your session. Thank you!</p>\n\n<p><em>Useful links:</em></p>\n<p><em>*Some sprites are from: Link</em></p>\n<p><em>*Music is from: </em><em>Link</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T21:22:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/544/544b1c70a9b7cd09472ade1c8a9b96e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Delinester"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
