Its been a while hasn't it? Its good to have you back on the team after such a long time, we all missed you and we are very exited that you have returned. We have a lot of catching up to do but that is for another time.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>I know its been a good few years since you had to deal with things like this, so for your fist job, tonight i'll task you with keeping an eye on a small, abandoned office that\u00a0is infested\u00a0with entities.\r\n</p>\n<p>Don't worry, all you will have to do is\u00a0observe, get your assigned tasks done, survive and most important of all... Follow. The. Rules... The list\u00a0should be\u00a0somewhere on your desk, but you already know all of this!\r\n</p>\n<p>You've been working with us for a long time before your departure so I am confident you will handle this job just fine! You were our best agent after all. Good luck!\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0From_Paranormal Security and Observation Company\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0_Overseer Jonah\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>_Mouse = Look around / Interact</p>\n<p>_F = Use Flashlight</p>\n\n<p>Dev Note:\u00a0 \u00a0Hello everyone! This is my second\u00a0ever game, and the first one\u00a0that I\u00a0managed\u00a0 to release. It's basically\u00a0a\u00a0fnaf\u00a0clone. Even though it\u00a0isn't\u00a0anything impressive, it still took me months to make so please don't be too harsh with the\u00a0criticism. Thanks for playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T07:37:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9dd/9dd9f7a1efb8f2d7a9329e8d99b210fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["NamezAndrei"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
