I\u00a0was given 1 week to design a level. Part of the assignment was that we were only allowed to use basic materials with no textures, we were only allowed to use a unit block to create our level, and only use the default unreal third person controller with the default jump.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!! Feel free to leave feedback!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-01T05:16:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b6/5b6a97112968c1c2850912968b4a6851.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Luis Garcia Remes"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
