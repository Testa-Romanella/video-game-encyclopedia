I'm having a great time learning and exploring new things.</p>\n<p>It's pretty rough and ready in places, I'm sorry about that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Talking to characters multiple times and re-examining objects can yield\u00a0 some slightly different results. As can the order some things are carried out.</p>\n<p>I think it should take roughly 10 minutes to play.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thankyou so much for taking a look!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>The whole game can be controlled through the left mouse button.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5a/d5ae863da6e5ca931569d384326ac033.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 191, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Tookipalooki"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
