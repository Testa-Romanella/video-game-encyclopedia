Now stranded on an alien world, you must save humanity by fighting your way through deadly combat, exploring, and escaping and returning to the surface to claim your freedom.\n\nThe game is currently in Early Access, but it was recently released to the public, and Outhouse Media has posted many more screenshots on their website.\n\nWhile the game is still in alpha, the developer says they're excited to see if this unique take on the strategy franchise is the one that catches on.
