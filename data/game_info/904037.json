In general, she doesn't really mind the ads that you'd usually expect from one of these games. One day, she found a \"ball-sorting\" game through an interstitial ad while playing some other game on her tablet and promptly installed it. However, it turned out that the amount of ad interruptions from this \"ball-sorting\" game was too much even for her. <br/></p>\n<p>She felt frustrated over this and asked me if I could \"find an alternative version\" of this free game for her... ideally, one with less intrusive ads. With current mobile game standards, I knew that this was an impossible task.</p>\n<p>I'd watched her play the game for a couple minutes and its core gameplay mechanics seemed simple enough to understand. So then I said: <em>\"Screw it, I'll make my own version\"</em>.<br/></p>\n<p>2 days later, and now I've uploaded the resulting ball/colour-sorting clone game to this page.</p>\n<p>It's a very simple game, but it's suitable for young kids or older adults who aren't core gamers. If you know someone who's interesting in playing one of the many clones of these types of games, I hope this serves as a good free alternative.</p>\n<p><strong>Only Android build is available. Sorry, iOS users!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T15:35:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13e/13e99be5823ca7b2f6e9ab77336fc986.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Henry Loo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
