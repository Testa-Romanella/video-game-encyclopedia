We would still appreciate it, if you looked into it. Please please watch the opening intro, because the intro-music is just awesome.</p><p>Controls:<br/>- Gamepad: Is explained / comes anturally<br/>- Keyboard: WASD/Arrows to Move, J K L to transform</p><p>This was probably the most fun Game Jam because we didn't focus on making the BEST GAME EVER, but focused mostly on having THE MOST FUN EVER creating a duck related game. We often had gaming breaks and even played a spontaneous \"Murder Mystery Game\" at one of our pizza dinners. We understand, this game has LOTS AND LOTS of loopholes and bugs! We still appreciate your feedback, though. And we're sorry that so many civilian breads just die uncontrollable and scream out of fear. all. the. time.</p><p>Regarding Audio: Our talented Artist Vanessa has made the StarWars-like intro. The IntroDialog-Music and MainGame Music is made by Kevin McLeod and therefore not made by us!</p><p>MAY THE DUCK BE WITH YOU</p><p>PS: Whoever finds our easter eggs wins!<br/>(Hint: One is in the Main Menu, one is on a lonely island. Good luck!)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2d/c2d68911d36d630c6fd44954ae74e096.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hollowspecter"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
