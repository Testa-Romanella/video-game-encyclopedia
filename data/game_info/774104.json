This is due to the fact that itch.io does not support external highscore systems (as of April 20, 2022). Therefore, if you as a player want to save your time of completion, you will have to do that yourself by taking a screenshot or otherwise. In spite of the highscore system the game is fully functional.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T19:35:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/234/23409e0d82b2c2f321ce67b2de120ec8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pauliskolan Malm\u00f6"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
