To charge a balloon, type out the word you see above the chosen balloon. If Skyler reaches a balloon while it's charged, it will join onto him. Balloons lose charge over time, going from blue (charged) to red (not charged).<br/><br/>If Skyler reaches a balloon before it's charged, it will pop! Also, if you spell a word wrong, it will pop too!<br/><br/>Have 10 balloons combine with Skyler to win!</p>\n<p>Made for the GMTK 2021 Game Jam<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T15:29:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f9/7f9e0e1c0c0b39a567bad407ba3eceb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["KorimFidelis", "Semok", "Batmantis"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
