When your team's soul colors are combined, the color formed changes your team's stats dramatically.</p>\n<p>Explore the post-disaster overworld, with hundreds of items, gather survivors and try to understand details of the disaster before its too late. Dark passages can be navigated fully by sound alone.</p>\n<p>Inspired by games like Golden Sun, Suikoden and Undertale, and a soundtrack inspired by a unique blend of ambiance, 80's synth, 8-bit and Supertramp. The game has a heavy focus on philosophy and deductive reasoning.
