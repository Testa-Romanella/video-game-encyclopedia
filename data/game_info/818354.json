If you get it then the door will open and you can continue to the next dice, but the roll that you'll need to advance will be rarer and rarer every time, but otherwise, there will be enemies and traps that will appear to make your adventure harder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When rolling the dice you're teleported back to the start!
