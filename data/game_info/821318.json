A plate with a tortilla will spawn.</p><p>3. Walk down to the arena (below the kitchen) and fight (with right click) to gather the required ingredients.

Bring the ingredients back to your burrito and press <strong>E</strong>. Once all three ingredients are on the burrito press <strong>E </strong>again to fold it and <strong>E</strong> once more to pick it up.</p><p>5. Go over to the customer and give them their burrito by pressing <strong>E.</strong></p><p>6. Rinse &amp; Repeat.</p><p>This game was made in 48 hours for the <strong>GMTK 2022</strong> game jam. The theme was \"<strong>Roll of the Dice.</strong>\"<br/></p>\n<p><strong>THE PREMISE:</strong></p>\n<p>You have 5 minutes to complete as many orders as possible before closing time. Will you rise to the challenge and satisfy the mindless swathes of burrito shop customers? Lay out your plates!\u00a0You need to get down to the cellar and dice up your ingredients quickly or the customers will get impatient. After putting your ingredients on the burrito, roll it up, and serve! Be careful not to lose customers!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I\u00a0can't wait for you to play\u00a0as Jimmy the chef and have one heck of a burrito adventure!</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p>Use the <strong>W</strong>, <strong>A</strong>, <strong>S</strong>, and <strong>D</strong> keys to maneuver throughout the burrito shop.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>E </strong>is the button used to interact with items in the world.\r\n</p>\n<p>Press\u00a0<strong>Shift</strong> to run!</p>\n<p><strong>Right mouse click</strong> allows you to dice ingredients.\r\n</p>\n<p>I've gotten some confusion on the inventory system. To clarify: the player can only hold one item at a time. If you pick up the wrong item or there is no plate ready to take the item, you need to dispose of it using the trashcan at the bottom right of the kitchen.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDIT:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Direction</strong>: 7Bit/Duke of All Spud</p>\n<p><strong>Art</strong>: 7Bit</p>\n<p><strong>Programming</strong>: Duke of All Spud</p>\n<p><strong>Animation</strong>: 7Bit/Duke of All Spud</p>\n<p><strong>Playtesting</strong>/<strong>enthusiasm</strong>: PokeMaster6101</p>\n<p><strong>Music</strong>: alimon</p>\n<p>and a special thank you to <strong>all the participants</strong> in the <strong>GMTK </strong><strong>game </strong><strong>jam </strong>and a thank you to <strong>GMTK </strong>for hosting the event :) It was a ton of fun and a great learning experience for the whole team!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T07:41:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fb/2fbc0dc46b9edd4f507feb8c46919ad8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["DukeOfAllSpud"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
