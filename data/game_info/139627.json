Your stats are \"Money\", \"Social\" and \"Army\". Each stat has its color code, army -&gt; red, social -&gt; blue and money -&gt; green. The last stat is the  \"Techno\", when this stat is at 100%, you need to finish the round and after you can choose a new technology. Each technology get a bonus to its speciality. For example, if you choose \"writing\", you have a bonus of 1% for each choice corresponding of the technology.</p><p>The game is written in Java, I use Inkscape for the graphisms (except the font, I use Gimp).
