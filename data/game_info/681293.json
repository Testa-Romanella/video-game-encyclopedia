This guide covers how to create a LARP in the <em>Solemn Vale</em> setting, how to create characters, and how to resolve actions in a consent-based framework. It addresses what we consider to be the essential aspects of consent, safety, and ethical issues.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We want to start by saying you cannot win or lose in LARP, all you can do is experience the LARP and hopefully have fun, and the more you help others have fun the more fun you\u2019ll have. Please be generous to your fellow players; they\u2019re with you sharing the same story, everyone is in this together. This is important because throughout Solemn Vale and within all its denizens is the Wyrd, a force flowing through everything. It\u2019s the life in your character, the energy of the land, the power of the hidden, and of course some of it is a twisted dark energy. This energy flows though the LARP, from place to character or character to character, as the darkness slowly takes hold.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Our vision is to retain core aspects of <em>Solemn Vale</em> mechanics and to streamline these, so resolution is as seamless as possible and maintains flow within the LARP experience. This guide will show you how to portray the dark creatures of <em>Solemn Vale</em> in a live, first person environment, and convey the sense of foreboding, entrapment, and descent into madness or decay present in the tabletop version of this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T08:05:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bf/0bf0d599769eaa1c4df013f9348a6c0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dirty Vortex"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
