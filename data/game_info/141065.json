The concept is as per usual: Push the blocks to the goals and make sure that all goals have blocks at them to finish the level. The twist is that you push when you move away from the blocks instead of pushing into the blocks. This might seem like a small detail, but it creates a lot of interesting new mechanics which this game explores. There are a total of 11 levels.</p>\n<p>Controls: Arrow keys to move.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1b/a1be5992eaafb11c1137252488fc96a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["OveAhlman"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
