Enjoy :)</p><p>This my first ever entry in a game jam and my first game made in Unity! The theme was \"Stronger Together\", so I decided to make a nice simple platformer in which you (and hopefully a partner) would have to rely on each other to get the job done. Each player is isolated to their side of the map, and must work together to open the door and reunite within the given time-limit (shown at the top-middle of the screen).\u00a0Hold on though - no co-op partner? No problem! Select 1 Player mode and enjoy the 1.5x time limit to complete each level!<br/></p>\n<p>I have really enjoyed the last 7 days, taking on new challenges and learning lots of new stuff. I am really happy with the end result: having developed it in the evenings after work while learning the engine. I hope you enjoy it too!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T10:01:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fb/7fbd7ed67dd5293640e0699aef9b7c64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Carooke"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
