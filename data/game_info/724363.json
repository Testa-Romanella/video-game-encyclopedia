After the placement phase, each turn a player can either:</p>\n<p>a) move their cannon to a different position<br/>b) try and shoot the enemy cannon</p>\n<p>Players win by sinking the other cannon into the sea or by hitting the other cannon 3 times. However, the wind needs to be taken into consideration as it influences the cannonball trajectory significantly.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Mouse Cursor --&gt; Select initial position / move your cannon<br/>Right Mouse Button --&gt; Rotate the game board<br/>\"W\" and \"D\" or Arrow-Keys --&gt; Rotate/Aim your cannon<br/>Space bar --&gt; Build up power for your cannonball shot<br/>Mouse Scroll --&gt; Zoom closer to the board<br/>Escape (ESC) --&gt; Exit the game<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Code, models and concept by J\u00e9r\u00f4me Wagener<br/>Unity Personal 2020.3.16f1</p>\n<p>Music by Andrey Sitkov<br/>Licensed via Retro Casual Music Pack (Humble Bundle: Big Music 2)</p>\n<p>Font \"Germania\" by John Vargas Beltran <br/>Licensed via Open Font License</p>\n<p>Sound Effects from:<br/>Humble Music &amp; Sound Effects for Games, Films, <br/>and Content Creators Bundle Part 2</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T06:37:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c7/5c751f471910d8f8195939a7cb1f3f51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jeromewagener"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
