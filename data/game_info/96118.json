{"id": 96118, "slug": "the-witching-hour", "name": "The Witching Hour", "name_original": "The Witching Hour", "description": "<p>The Witching Hour was created by a small team of university students for their coursework and should be seen as an early alpha game. It is inspired by games like Trine, Skyrider, Enslaved and of course the Tomb Raider series and\u00a0is a casual, single player puzzle game. The original idea behind the game was to create a puzzle platformer with a multitude of ways of completing each task, therefore creating a sense of control for the players.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The main features here is the ability to create platforms literally anywhere in the world which fits the idea perfectly and is one of its main USP\u2019s.\u00a0 The game has been designed for younger people and casual players and therefore we shifted the theme of the game to a unique fantasy world which allowed us to have several different appealing biomes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The stylized art scheme is sure to appeal to the target audience too. The Witching Hour starts off in the main town which acts as a hub world to the other four levels. Each level rewards the player with a new ability which can be used to reach the next level in the hub world. When all abilities have been acquired the player can face the final level which they need to use all their abilities to complete. The abilities have been designed and tweaked to give the player openness on how they want to approach each scenario and therefore encourages replay-ability.</p>\n<p>Review:\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Falmouth Games Academy</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf4/bf4496dde3faf9595d943748462a2162.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 240, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DefiantNarwhal"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
