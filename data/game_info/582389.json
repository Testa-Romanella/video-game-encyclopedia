The programming language you get to use, NothingScript, is a full programming language with a syntax similar to C or Java, with support for lambda functions - if you don't know what that means, don't fret, this game is accessible to people new to programming as well.</p>\n<p>Due to time constraints, some features couldn't be realized, such as multiplayer or more levels.
