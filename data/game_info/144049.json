I recently rediscovered it hiding on my hard drive.  It was made very quickly and isn't perfect, but it's home to a pretty big desert.  Although it may seem aimless, there is a narrative that will reveal itself over time.</p><p><em>LoA</em> takes inspiration from the writings of T.E. Lawrence, and the film <em>Lawrence of Arabia</em>, which is based on his life.</p><p>--</p><p>Note: This is technically a prototype, as I do plan to expand on this game in the future.  However, I am marking <em>LoA</em> as released for now as the full game will probably look very different.<br/></p><p>Version 1.0: prototype complete.  aware of a bug that requires odd character placement to pick up some objects. download coming soon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/558/558a6ed222ef9738a2b4bf41ba8f8e97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["muinil"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
