We feel this would fit better with our occult mystery theme.</p>\n<p>We used the idea of a Utopia being a society where everything is peaceful but has a dark underside to it.\u00a0 There are futuristic technologies such as the ability to erase memories and the ability to control the daily lives of people by creating a Utopian society.</p>\n<p><strong>Group</strong>:</p>\n<p>Jeremy Colfer, Christian Flasza, Rigel Kuper, Kwan Wa Mok,\u00a0 Al Prachumsri, Jake Williams</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>:</p>\n<p>Temple: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/travel/Chhatarpur-Mandir/ps44856002.cms</p>\n<p>MC_House: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Modern_house_in_Sherwood,_Queensland.jpg</p>\n<p>Friend_House:https://www.flickr.com/photos/colinsite/30216225774</p>\n<p>MC_room:https://www.flickr.com/photos/homespace/4589156286</p>\n<p>cell:https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/en/view-image.php?image=297591&amp;picture=empty-white-room</p>\n<p>Pixel art characters derived from: https://www.pinterest.at/pin/860891285006577944/</p>\n<p>Prayroom: https://www.wallpaperflare.com/closed-brown-wooden-cabinet-beside-window-rest-church-window-wallpaper-zfhrm</p>\n<p>map:https://sites.google.com/site/dreamzresidencydelhi/home/zonal-plan-of-l-zone-delhi</p>\n<p>Park bench - https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/pictures/30000/velka/green-park-bench.jpg</p>\n<p>Garden walkway - https://www.piqsels.com/en/search?q=garden+walkway&amp;page=3</p>\n<p>Park field - Photo by Serghei Savchiuc on Unsplash</p>\n<p>Park entrance - Photo by Egor on Unsplash</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T03:23:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94d/94db3b52768989fe3faa3d02b80d63f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rigel91"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
