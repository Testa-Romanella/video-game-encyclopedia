The game itself is extremely simple, and was made with 99 lines of code (JavaScript). It was a great polar coordinates practice!</p>\n<p>\u00a0Its main features are screen wrapping and a serpent that is not grid based, which changes the gameplay quite a bit when compared to the original. Also, snake was a very present game in my childhood, and it brings some happy memories for me (the game jam's theme enters here)!</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Aside from the engine (TIC-80), I made\u00a0the rest (from the code to the meh music). Still, I got some great feedback from Sucraiso (thanks to him the game has screen wrapping, for instance).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T03:01:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38e/38e6d1d849c312bea202dd650ef14f14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Delta Key"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
