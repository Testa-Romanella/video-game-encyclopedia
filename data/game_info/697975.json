Your day consists of taking a nice rainy day stroll through your fields to collect herbs, spices, and rocks.</p>\n<p>Your Cozy Master has gifted you a Magic Teacup!\u00a0How thoughtful! Use this to craft a variety of creatures and pets to fill your greenhouse with homebrewed friends!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong><em>The CthuluControllerApp must be used alongside the game to play. This is your controller.</em><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Your teacup controls all. Use it like a joystick to walk around, and tap it to interact with things when prompted.\u00a0</li><li>Tapping one of the four bowls on screen will add 1 unit of their held ingredient to the teacup.</li><li>Tapping the teacup while it has ingredients (is glowing), will attempt to create your brew! You'll here a sound if it failed.</li><li>Holding your finger on a bowl for a few seconds will dump it without adding to the teacup.</li><li>Certain sources will add ingredients automatically. For example, if your phone shows a fireplace on screen, your tea is being heated!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/>- Josh Northouse (Programmer)<br/>- Nick Ziegler (Programmer)<br/>- Donavan Ritchie (Artist) -\u00a0https://www.artstation.com/inkwarden</p>\n<p><strong>Attributions</strong><br/>- Backplate for quest log and title sequence provided by Vecteezy:\u00a0https://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/1372968-vintage-ornament-border-background<br/><br/>- Music provided by http://www.zapsplat.com</p>\n<p>- Font provided from:\u00a0https://fontesk.com/old-cupboard-font/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T05:40:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd2/cd28510b0110184207d96e1a1264ced5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["JamJosh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
