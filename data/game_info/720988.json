Suddenly, a storm, which was rapidly approaching the ship, appeared on the horizon. The team prepared for the worst. A monstrous storm broke out. The ship was tossed from side to side, and giant waves were covering it one after another. The squad was already saying their last farewells to life. The incredible storm, having played enough with the ship, smashed it like a toy on the rocks of a deserted island. Fortunately, many managed to survive.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe small, lifeless island seemed to promise nothing but death.
