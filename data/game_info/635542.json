It cuts waves beneath its prow sending cold sea spray high, hanging in the air before falling to be churned up again. Should this creature be allowed to find passage to its hunting grounds it will greedily consume our comrades and sink any hope of our nation's survival. We cannot let this come to pass, pilot. Grab your coat and say your farewells. It's time to mount up and slay a monster.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T05:38:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57f/57f93b3016380f6391e84af08327146a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ReeveSummers"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
