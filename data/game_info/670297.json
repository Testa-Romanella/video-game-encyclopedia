Feel free to download, but keep your expectations real low. This is my first game so if by any chance (0% ) you decide to try this out , feel free to tell me how bad of a programmer i am or just perhaps give feedback :))<br/></p><p>Features:</p><ul><li>Randomised names!</li><li>Random stats !</li><li>Not full screen!</li><li>No bugs!
