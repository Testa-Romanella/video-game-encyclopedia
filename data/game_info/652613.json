Unzip it and put it in the \"Jeremy Couillard\" folder and it should be fine</p>\r\nThis Month's Games\r\n<br/>Will Die Alone (WIN/MAC) by\u00a0Arianna Ravioli\r\n\n<p>The first breakthrough for Alex came when her best friend Vince realized that some memories are not meant to be kept. The second coincided when she was hired by Dewitt Corp. On paper, the task is simple: to delete her clients\u2019 painful memories so that they could be happy again. Her new job begins in two days. Alex will find herself lonely and in the middle of nowhere with an assignment that no one wants to do. She must make hard choices. Her entire world resides in her computer, but reality will keep intruding. All she can do is pray and hope that nothing bad will happen to her family while she is stuck in virtual hell. Will Die Alone is a journey through painful memories. It\u2019s a game about loss, the role of the past, and possible futures. Every choice comes with a price. Will you be willing to pay?</p>\n\r\nMind Psychometry (WIN/MAC/Browser) by\u00a0Juniper-C\r\n\n<p>Mind Psychometry is a personality test designed by a dystopian HR department to coerce employees into signing away their freedom.
