Daniel Lamb and Leo Kasper are the only surviving subjects.

You open your eyes. A white-coated body slumps to the floor through your shaking hands. A bloody syringe slips from your arm. Waves of confusion and paranoia crash over you. You have no idea who you are or how you got here.<br />\nThe door to your cell is open. One choice. Once chance. They took your life.
