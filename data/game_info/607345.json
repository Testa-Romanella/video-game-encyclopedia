{"id": 607345, "slug": "mage-garden", "name": "Mage Garden", "name_original": "Mage Garden", "description": "<p>This digital boardgame is an entry for the 4th Eggplant Jam. The theme is \"Making Magic\". My initial idea involved casting elemental magic in different combinations to create different effects, but the game's ended up themed around gardening.</p>\n<p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>\n<p>Taking turns to place 1 tile each turn, the players aim to have more tiles of their colour on the board by the end of the game. The game ends when every square has a tile placed on it.</p>\n<p>Some tiles have effects after being placed. Tile effects take place for each player right after the opponent's turn, directly before they can place their tile.</p>\n<p>Here are the tile types:</p>\n<p><strong>Stone</strong> - This tile can be placed anywhere on the board, including on top of existing tiles. Tree and Water tiles cannot be placed on it.</p>\n<p><strong>Water</strong> - This tile can be placed only in an empty square. At the start of the player who placed it's turn, it will expand its range outwards by one tile. It will never place these tiles over any other tile.</p>\n<p><strong>Tree</strong> - This tile can only be placed in an empty square. The inital tile placed is the \"seed\". At the start of the player who placed it's turn, if the seed is directly next to a Water tile, it will begin to grow. When growing, a Tree will extend outwards by one tile each turn, in each of the four directions. These tiles will be placed in empty spaces or over Water tiles, but not over other Tree tiles or Stone tiles.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T11:32:15", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Velleic"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
