Space Invader is a beloved well-known game that has been around from 1978 and has pioneered the Shoot Em Up genre of game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For our project, we have decided to implement this beloved game but using Three.JS's library, and with a twist in the design, such as the moving targets, using 3D as objects, and using interactions such as shooting missiles both from the user and the targets. The goal of the game is simple, but it's not as easy as it looks. All you have to do is survive.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T09:01:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5f/f5ff455f1d7efb7e1e3130c98877a02d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dysza"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
