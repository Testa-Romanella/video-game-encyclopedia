I\u00a0spent my Spring 2018\u00a0 semester of college making this for my first Game Development class at NYU. This game was the reason for a lot of late nights, tears, and sadness but it also was the reason I\u00a0fell in love with making games. The entire experience was something to learn from, so I am proud of it, no matter how imperfect it is!</p>\n<p>This game is about my two dogs Marco and Polo. They have always had a habit of escaping the back yard no matter how many times we refurbished the fence, so I\u00a0decided to make a little game based off their adventures.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If I could do everything again, I would do it all differently, maybe some day I\u00a0want to\u00a0come back and make this game the right way!</p>\n<p>Spring 2018</p>\n<p>Made using Unity 2018.2.6f1</p>\n<p>Windows 10</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a0/5a0cff68ace978e5432d8f3dd0e4055d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["saminatrachier"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
