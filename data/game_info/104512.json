Within this village lives an old man who claims he use to be some sort of archeologist and studies the ancient civilization. Everyone is aware of the unusualness of the this civilization and the dangerous creatures they created, so they all agreed to just stay away from it and the temples. Gwyn is aware of this but she is fascinated by the ancient civilization and sometimes likes to hang around an area near the village where there are some ruins. The old man is aware of her fascination and asks her to help him with his studies.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ec/4ec5b689b118a9ec47f99183833f0a04.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["diest"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
