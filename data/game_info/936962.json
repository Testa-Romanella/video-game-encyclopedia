It is a very simple game, and was created using the blueprint system.\u00a0 I hope you enjoy the simple showcase! :)</p><p>Any advice and constructive criticism is welcome.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T09:08:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f7/4f757b46e8307cb0b6a7a60498924102.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HungryToast"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
