Mankind has no choice but to use its last known resource, freeloaders. Offering high pay to explore planets deemed worthy of sustaining a human colony, these free loaders are sent to the planet surface to find out what dangers may lurk. Many will die for the cause, but with a limited number of worthwhile individuals to make a colony successful, we have no other option. </p>\n<p>Within our solar system and beyond, 3 planets have been found and need to be explored. Hundreds of thousands of slackers have been voluntold for the benefit of mankind. So get to it! We have no time to waste!</p>\n\n<p>Additional planets will be added based on total number of\u00a0 donators, details will be included in later updates.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Background will be included in future updates.</p>\n<p>If end level menu buttons do not work, click and hold any button until the player dies than the menu will be functional. Fix coming in future update.</p>\n\r\nBug TypeLocation of bugResolvedPriorityRelation to other IssuesLevel exit menu buttons not responding consistentlyMost levelsYes5NoColision IssuesAll levelsYes1NoDeath animation On O2 depletionPlayerYes2YesJump O2 Depletion valuesPlayerYes2YesJump sound effectPlayerYes2Yes\r\n\r\nFeatureLocation#Of RequestsRandom Employee Number at respawnPlayer RespawnDeath and respawn AnimationsPlayer death and respawn\r\nLevel complete animationLevel end", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc8/cc8e32057b4e3c6ed4c891004468827b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eclectic Animation"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
