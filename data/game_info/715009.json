The length of each symbol name is added to your score as you enter correctly-spelled names. A symbol reaching the bottom of the screen causes you to lose lifepoints. When you run out of life points, the game is over!</p>\n<p>The window resolution is fixed at 800x600 because I'm lazy lol</p>\n<p>Source Code is available for those interested:</p>\n<p>https://github.com/williamblair/nguzosabatyper<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T05:41:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75e/75e3ffce732acf18fbcfb297fece03ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["beedge19"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
