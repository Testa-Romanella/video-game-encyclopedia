You assume the role of the high priest in the town of hutshire, determined to sacrifice enough townspeople for the return of your lord. <em>Shadows of Huntshire</em> was developed over 14 weeks in Unity and was based on a previous prototype by Claire Wang, Luna Wu, Isabella Chen, and Zitta Chen.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Shadows of Huntshire</em> has a fixed narrative with multiple endings based on your choices. It also involves managing the stats of the townspeople, pairing and using their abilities strategically so their stats are low enough when the next sacrifice season occurs.\r\n</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy managing Huntshire and uncovering the mysteries of the old gods.\r\n<br/></p>\n\r\nCreator Links\r\n<p><strong>Claire Wang:</strong>\u00a0https://hybridvm.itch.io<br/><strong>Drew Caines:</strong>\u00a0ttps://itch.io/profile/drewcaines<br/><strong>Euris Adino:</strong>\u00a0https://euris-adino.itch.io<br/><strong>Geneva Heyward:</strong>\u00a0https://gensuta.itch.io<br/><strong>Jordan Grayson:</strong>\u00a0https://jordangrayson.itch.io<br/><strong>Miles Rosenthal:</strong>\u00a0https://miles-logan.itch.io<br/><strong>Zitta Cheng:</strong>\u00a0https://zittacheng.itch.io<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T05:45:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb5/fb5c58210d35d47bbf44dbb1f6ba32e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["gensuta", "Zittacheng", "JordanGrayson", "Miles Logan", "ClaireW", "drewcaines", "Euris Adino"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
