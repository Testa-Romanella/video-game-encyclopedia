After commandeering a \n      handful of rockets to rescue her, they\u2019ve wound up on a strange (and \n      sometimes scary) adventure through outer space. Now players must rescue \n      both their classmates AND their teacher \u2013 and just maybe the whole solar \n      system while they\u2019re at it.\n    </p><p>\n      Madeleine, a respected and powerful teacher at Will O\u2019 Wisp magical \n      academy, tells her students that she will undertake a dangerous mission \n      in space and trains them for combat should the need arise. After not \n      hearing from her for some time, the kids stumble upon a hangar of rocket \n      ships. One by one, they board individual ships and crash land on distant \n      planets alone. Players hop from planet to planet assembling the group of \n      classmates. Once together, they learn of an evil sorcerer \u2013 a former \n      student of the academy who now has ambitions to destroy reality \u2013 and \n      set out to stop him.\n    </p><p>\n      Some innovative stylus mechanics, unique magic system, and a \n      planet-hopping storyline make for a jolly good roleplaying experience. \n      Magical Starsign is a good entry in the RPG genre for players who've \n      never tried one before.\n    </p><p>\n      As of May 20, 2014, the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service for Nintendo \n      DSi and Wii systems has been retired.
