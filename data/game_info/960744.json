You lead a group of four colorful characters through a series of encounters, fighting against monsters, acquiring loot and eventually -- hopefully -- recovering the ancient artifact that's the object of your quest. <br/><br/>For an experienced player of tabletop roleplaying games, the entire game takes about 40 minutes to play through, from beginning to end.<br/><br/><ul><li> Five difficult encounters in varied locations against varied monsters<br/></li><li> Four interesting characters to play as (an honorable orc fighter, a silent rogue, a well-spoken sorcerer, and an excitable cleric)<br/></li><li> A complex OGL-based rule system which makes for strong strategic gameplay</li></ul><h3>Cut straight into the gameplay</h3>This game is a cinematic experience, where you fight one combat encounter after another, and these fights are interspersed only with (voiced!) cinematic cutscenes. The game doesn't waste your time: animations are lightning fast, cutscenes skippable, and you can really focus on the engaging combat experience.<h3>Powerful rule system</h3>Each turn, you get three actions to spend on moving, attacking, casting spells, taking combat maneuvers, drinking potions and defensive or other actions. <br/><br/>You can preview the effects and success probability of all actions before you commit and weigh your options. All combat encounters are balanced but difficult: To win the game reliably and consistently, you will need to make use of almost all of your options.<h3>Story of the Dawnsbury Four</h3>Experience the first steps of an up-and-coming party of young adventurers as they take on their first quest and attempt to recover an artifact that has once protected their beloved home town.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-15T02:32:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01b/01b6600ed8267f6eb15cfbb3768f560a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dawnsbury Studios"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Dawnsbury Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
