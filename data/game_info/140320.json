You can make your match private (so you can let friends join) or public. You can choose between a bunch of different skins. The skins are made by Hallosgames and the community! Some of the skins have special powers. Some skins can, for example, do more damage while others can run faster, jump higher and other stuff.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:38", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Hallos Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
