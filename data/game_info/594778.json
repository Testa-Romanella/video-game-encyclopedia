However, he is fated to fail and every page of the book foretells his doom\u00a0until he alters his fate by changing the text.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to rearrange the orange words to change the story into a good outcome for Peter,\u00a0however, I didn't really end up finishing much to play. There is just one \"level\" and it is very short, meant to be a tutorial level.</p>\n<p>The demon drawing is supposed to de-load at the end of the level but I didn't have time to make that happen either. This was my first time making a game without an engine so it took me longer to get basic stuff setup.</p>\n<p>There are some bugs. Sometimes letters you type will be printed twice, and sometimes the space key won't work and it will print the word \"SPACE\"\u00a0instead. Also, the music pauses before it restarts, to my unending frustration.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T10:55:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d48/d4849e342750a8b8917524a25a8d3743.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rhbourke"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
