There are also images on the walls so that you can see what it is talking about. This game can be played in VR, that was how it was orignally intended to play. You must have an HTC Vive in order to play. To use the Vive, the round trackpad is what you use to move around. Hold down the pad until it clicks and point it at the ground. You should see a laser and that is where you will teleport. Release the pad and that is how you will move. Without the Vive, use WASD or the arrow keys to move around.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d2/4d2143172340e6cdc0dd4888eb7fdffd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 175, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Boss Studios"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
