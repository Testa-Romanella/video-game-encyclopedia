For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical\r\n    work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in\r\n    timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered an\r\n    Adaptation for the purpose of this License.\r\n b. \"Collection\" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as\r\n    encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or\r\n    broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed\r\n    in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and\r\n    arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in\r\n    which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along\r\n    with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and\r\n    independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a\r\n    collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be\r\n    considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this\r\n    License.\r\n c. \"Distribute\" means to make available to the public the original and\r\n    copies of the Work through sale or other transfer of ownership.\r\n d. \"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that\r\n    offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.\r\n e. \"Original Author\" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work,\r\n    the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work\r\n    or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in\r\n    addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers,\r\n    musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,\r\n    play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or\r\n    expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer\r\n    being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a\r\n    performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the\r\n    organization that transmits the broadcast.\r\n f. \"Work\" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms\r\n    of this License including without limitation any production in the\r\n    literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or\r\n    form of its expression including digital form, such as a book,\r\n    pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work\r\n    of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a\r\n    choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical\r\n    composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are\r\n    assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography;\r\n    a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or\r\n    lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works\r\n    expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied\r\n    art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work\r\n    relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a\r\n    performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the\r\n    extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by\r\n    a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise\r\n    considered a literary or artistic work.\r\n g. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this\r\n    License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with\r\n    respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the\r\n    Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous\r\n    violation.\r\n h. \"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public recitations of the Work and\r\n    to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or\r\n    process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital\r\n    performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that\r\n    members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a\r\n    place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public\r\n    by any means or process and the communication to the public of the\r\n    performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to\r\n    broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs,\r\n    sounds or images.\r\n i. \"Reproduce\" means to make copies of the Work by any means including\r\n    without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of\r\n    fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a\r\n    protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic\r\n    medium.\r\n2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,\r\nlimit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from\r\nlimitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the\r\ncopyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\r\n3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,\r\nLicensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,\r\nperpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to\r\nexercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\r\n a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more\r\n    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the\r\n    Collections; and,\r\n b. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated\r\n    in Collections.\r\n c. For the avoidance of doubt:\r\n     i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in\r\n        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\r\n        compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor\r\n        reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any\r\n        exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\r\n    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in\r\n        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\r\n        compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the\r\n        exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You\r\n        of the rights granted under this License; and,\r\n   iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to\r\n        collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the\r\n        Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers\r\n        voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise\r\n        by You of the rights granted under this License.\r\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now\r\nknown or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make\r\nsuch modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in\r\nother media and formats, but otherwise you have no rights to make\r\nAdaptations. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by\r\nLicensor are hereby reserved.\r\n4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made\r\nsubject to and limited by the following restrictions:\r\n a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms\r\n    of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource\r\n    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You\r\n    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms\r\n    on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of\r\n    the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that\r\n    recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the\r\n    Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and\r\n    to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You\r\n    Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly\r\n    Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological\r\n    measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the\r\n    Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under\r\n    the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as\r\n    incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection\r\n    apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this\r\n    License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You\r\n    must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit\r\n    as required by Section 4(b), as requested.\r\n b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or Collections, You\r\n    must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep\r\n    intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to\r\n    the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original\r\n    Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the\r\n    Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties\r\n    (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for\r\n    attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice,\r\n    terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party\r\n    or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the\r\n    extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor\r\n    specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not\r\n    refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work.\r\n    The credit required by this Section 4(b) may be implemented in any\r\n    reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a\r\n    Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all\r\n    contributing authors of the Collection appears, then as part of these\r\n    credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the\r\n    other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only\r\n    use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution\r\n    in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this\r\n    License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any\r\n    connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,\r\n    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your\r\n    use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written\r\n    permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution\r\n    Parties.\r\n c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be\r\n    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or\r\n    Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any\r\n    Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other\r\n    derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial\r\n    to the Original Author's honor or reputation.\r\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\r\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR\r\nOFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY\r\nKIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,\r\nINCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF\r\nLATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,\r\nWHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION\r\nOF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE\r\nLAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR\r\nANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES\r\nARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS\r\nBEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n7. Termination\r\n a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\r\n    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.\r\n    Individuals or entities who have received Collections from You under\r\n    this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated\r\n    provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with\r\n    those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any\r\n    termination of this License.\r\n b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is\r\n    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).\r\n    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the\r\n    Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at\r\n    any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to\r\n    withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is\r\n    required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this\r\n    License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as\r\n    stated above.\r\n8. Miscellaneous\r\n a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,\r\n    the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same\r\n    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\r\n b. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\r\n    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\r\n    the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action\r\n    by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to\r\n    the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and\r\n    enforceable.\r\n c. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no\r\n    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing\r\n    and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\r\n d. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with\r\n    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,\r\n    agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified\r\n    here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that\r\n    may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be\r\n    modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\r\n e. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this\r\n    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention\r\n    for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on\r\n    September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright\r\n    Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996\r\n    and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).\r\n    These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant\r\n    jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced\r\n    according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of\r\n    those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the\r\n    standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law\r\n    includes additional rights not granted under this License, such\r\n    additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this\r\n    License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under\r\n    applicable law.\r\nCreative Commons Notice\r\n    Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty\r\n    whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be\r\n    liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages\r\n    whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special,\r\n    incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this\r\n    license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative\r\n    Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it\r\n    shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\r\n    Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the\r\n    Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize\r\n    the use by either party of the trademark \"Creative Commons\" or any\r\n    related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior\r\n    written consent of Creative Commons.

DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN\r\n    ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS\r\n    INFORMATION ON AN \"AS-IS\" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES\r\n    REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS\r\n    PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM\r\n    THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED\r\n    HEREUNDER.\r\nStatement of Purpose\r\nThe laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer\r\nexclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator\r\nand subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an \"owner\") of an original work of\r\nauthorship and/or a database (each, a \"Work\").\r\nCertain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for\r\nthe purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and\r\nscientific works (\"Commons\") that the public can reliably and without fear\r\nof later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other\r\nworks, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever\r\nand for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.\r\nThese owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free\r\nculture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific\r\nworks, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in\r\npart through the use and efforts of others.\r\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any\r\nexpectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person\r\nassociating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she\r\nis an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily\r\nelects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its\r\nterms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the\r\nWork and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.\r\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\r\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and\r\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not\r\nlimited to, the following:\r\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,\r\n     communicate, and translate a Work;\r\n ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\r\niii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or\r\n     likeness depicted in a Work;\r\n iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\r\n     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\r\n  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data\r\n     in a Work;\r\n vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\r\n     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\r\n     protection of databases, and under any national implementation\r\n     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such\r\n     directive); and\r\nvii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the\r\n     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national\r\n     implementations thereof.\r\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention\r\nof, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,\r\nirrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of\r\nAffirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes\r\nof action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as\r\nfuture claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories\r\nworldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or\r\ntreaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future\r\nmedium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,\r\nincluding without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional\r\npurposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each\r\nmember of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and\r\nsuccessors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to\r\nrevocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or\r\nequitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public\r\nas contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\r\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason\r\nbe judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the\r\nWaiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into\r\naccount Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the\r\nextent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected\r\nperson a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\r\nirrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and\r\nRelated Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\r\nmaximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future\r\ntime extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number\r\nof copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without\r\nlimitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the\r\n\"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was\r\napplied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any\r\nreason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such\r\npartial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder\r\nof the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she\r\nwill not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related\r\nRights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of\r\naction with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's\r\nexpress Statement of Purpose.\r\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\r\n a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\r\n    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\r\n b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or\r\n    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,\r\n    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of\r\n    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non\r\n    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or\r\n    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to\r\n    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\r\n c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\r\n    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\r\n    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\r\n    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\r\n    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the\r\n    Work.\r\n d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\r\n    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to\r\n    this CC0 or use of the Work.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\n</p>\r\nPixelMplus by Itou Hiro (M+ Font License)\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2002-2013 M+ FONTS PROJECT\r\nThese fonts are free software.\r\nUnlimited permission is granted to use, copy, and distribute it, with or without modification, either commercially and noncommercially.\r\nTHESE FONTS ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY.\r\n\u3053\u308c\u3089\u306e\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u306f\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\uff08\u81ea\u7531\u306a\uff09\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a8\u30a2\u3067\u3059\u3002\r\n\u3042\u3089\u3086\u308b\u6539\u5909\u306e\u6709\u7121\u306b\u95a2\u308f\u3089\u305a\u3001\u307e\u305f\u5546\u696d\u7684\u306a\u5229\u7528\u3067\u3042\u3063\u3066\u3082\u3001\u81ea\u7531\u306b\u3054\u5229\u7528\u3001\u8907\u88fd\u3001\u518d\u914d\u5e03\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u5168\u3066\u7121\u4fdd\u8a3c\u3068\u3055\u305b\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\n</p>\r\nWenQuanYi (Spring of Letters) Bitmap Song by The WenQuanYi Project Contributors (GPL 2.0)\r\n\r\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\r\n                       Version 2, June 1991\r\n Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\r\n 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\r\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\r\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\r\n                            Preamble\r\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\r\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\r\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\r\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\r\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\r\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\r\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\r\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\r\nyour programs, too.\r\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\r\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\r\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\r\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\r\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\r\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\r\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\r\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\r\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\r\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\r\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\r\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\r\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\r\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\r\nrights.\r\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\r\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\r\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\r\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\r\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\r\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\r\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\r\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\r\nauthors' reputations.\r\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\r\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\r\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\r\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\r\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\r\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\nmodification follow.\r\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\r\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\r\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\r\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\r\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\r\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\r\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\r\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\r\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\r\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\r\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\r\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\r\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\r\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\r\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\r\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\r\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\r\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\r\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\r\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\r\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\r\nalong with the Program.\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\r\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\r\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\r\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\r\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\r\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\r\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\r\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\r\n    parties under the terms of this License.\r\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\r\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\r\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\r\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\r\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\r\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\r\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\r\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\r\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\r\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\r\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\r\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\r\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\r\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\r\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\r\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\r\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\r\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\r\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\r\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\r\ncollective works based on the Program.\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\r\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\r\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\r\nthe scope of this License.\r\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\r\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\r\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\r\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\r\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\r\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\r\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\r\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\r\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\r\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\r\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\r\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\r\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\r\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\r\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\r\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\r\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\r\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\r\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\r\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\r\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\r\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\r\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\r\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\r\nitself accompanies the executable.\r\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\r\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\r\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\r\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\r\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\r\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\r\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\r\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\r\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\r\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\r\nparties remain in full compliance.\r\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\r\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\r\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\r\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\r\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\r\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\r\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\r\nthe Program or works based on it.\r\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\r\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\r\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\r\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\r\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\r\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\r\nthis License.\r\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\r\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\r\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\r\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\r\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\r\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\r\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\r\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\r\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\r\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\r\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\r\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\r\ncircumstances.\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\r\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\r\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\r\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\r\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\r\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\r\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\r\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\r\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\r\nimpose that choice.\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\r\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\r\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\r\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\r\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\r\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\r\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\r\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\r\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\r\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\r\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\r\naddress new problems or concerns.\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\r\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\r\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\r\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\r\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\r\nFoundation.\r\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\r\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\r\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\r\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\r\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\r\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\r\n                            NO WARRANTY\r\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\r\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\r\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\r\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\r\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\r\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\r\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\r\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\r\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\r\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\r\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\r\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\r\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\r\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\r\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\r\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\n<p>This software was created using the open-source Defold game engine, which itself makes use of several other open-source projects.

(LGPL 2.0)\r\n\r\n                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\r\n                       Version 2, June 1991\r\n Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\r\n 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\r\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\r\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\r\n[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is\r\n numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\r\n                            Preamble\r\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\r\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\r\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\r\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\r\n  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some\r\nspecially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any\r\nother libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for\r\nyour libraries, too.\r\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\r\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\r\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\r\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\r\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\r\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\r\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\r\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\r\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\r\nyou distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\r\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\r\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\r\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\r\ncode.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide\r\ncomplete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\r\nwith the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling\r\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\r\n  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\r\nthe library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\r\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\r\n  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain\r\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\r\nlibrary.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we\r\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original\r\nversion, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on\r\nthe original authors' reputations.\r\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\r\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free\r\nsoftware will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\r\ntransforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,\r\nwe have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\r\nfree use or not licensed at all.\r\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\r\nGNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This\r\nlicense, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\r\ndesignated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary\r\none; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is\r\nthe same as in the ordinary license.\r\n  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\r\nthey blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\r\nprogram and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without\r\nchanging the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\r\nanalogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in\r\na textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\r\nderivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\r\ntreats it as such.\r\n  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\r\nPublic License for libraries did not effectively promote software\r\nsharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We\r\nconcluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\r\n  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\r\nusers of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\r\nlibraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to\r\npermit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\r\npreserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\r\nlibraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve\r\nthis as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards\r\nchanges in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this\r\nwill lead to faster development of free libraries.\r\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\r\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\r\nformer contains code derived from the library, while the latter only\r\nworks together with the library.\r\n  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary\r\nGeneral Public License rather than by this special one.\r\n                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\r\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which\r\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\r\nparty saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library\r\nGeneral Public License (also called \"this License\").  Each licensee is\r\naddressed as \"you\".\r\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\r\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\r\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\r\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\r\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\r\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\r\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\r\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\r\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\r\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\r\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\r\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\r\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\r\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\r\nand installation of the library.\r\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\r\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\r\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\r\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\r\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\r\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\r\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\r\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\r\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\r\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\r\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\r\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\r\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\r\nLibrary.\r\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\r\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\r\nfee.\r\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\r\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\r\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\r\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\r\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\r\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\r\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\r\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\r\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\r\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\r\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\r\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\r\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\r\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\r\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\r\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\r\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\r\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\r\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\r\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\r\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\r\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\r\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\r\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\r\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\r\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\r\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\r\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\r\nit.\r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\r\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\r\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\r\ncollective works based on the Library.\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\r\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\r\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\r\nthe scope of this License.\r\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\r\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\r\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\r\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\r\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\r\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\r\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\r\nthese notices.\r\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\r\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\r\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\r\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\r\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\r\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\r\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\r\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\r\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\r\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\r\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\r\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\r\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\r\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\r\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\r\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\r\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\r\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\r\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\r\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\r\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\r\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\r\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\r\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\r\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\r\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\r\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\r\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\r\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\r\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\r\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\r\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\r\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\r\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\r\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\r\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\r\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\r\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\r\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\r\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\r\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\r\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or\r\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\r\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\r\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\r\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\r\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\r\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\r\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\r\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\r\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\r\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\r\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\r\nof these things:\r\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\r\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\r\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\r\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\r\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\r\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\r\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\r\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\r\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\r\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\r\n    to use the modified definitions.)\r\n    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\r\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\r\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\r\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\r\n    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\r\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\r\n    specified materials from the same place.\r\n    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\r\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\r\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\r\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\r\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\r\nthe source code distributed need not include anything that is normally\r\ndistributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\r\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\r\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\r\nthe executable.\r\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\r\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\r\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\r\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\r\ndistribute.\r\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\r\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\r\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\r\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\r\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\r\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\r\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\r\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\r\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\r\n    Sections above.\r\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\r\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\r\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\r\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\r\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\r\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\r\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\r\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\r\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\r\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\r\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\r\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\r\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\r\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\r\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\r\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\r\nthe Library or works based on it.\r\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\r\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\r\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\r\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\r\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\r\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\r\nthis License.\r\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\r\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\r\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\r\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\r\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\r\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\r\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\r\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\r\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\r\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\r\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\r\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\r\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\r\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\r\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\r\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\r\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\r\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\r\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\r\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\r\nimpose that choice.\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\r\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\r\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\r\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\r\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\r\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\r\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\r\nwritten in the body of this License.\r\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\r\nversions of the Library General Public License from time to time.\r\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\r\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\r\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\r\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\r\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\r\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation.\r\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\r\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\r\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\r\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\r\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\r\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\r\nand reuse of software generally.\r\n                            NO WARRANTY\r\n  15.
