The goal of the game is to leave two pieces on the board (one of each color) by following the rule: \"Blue eats blue, red eats red.\" A puzzler that is deceptively simple but hard to master.<br/><br/>Moving pegs. Removing pegs. These two simple mechanics allow for an incredible amount of possible strategies to aim for the each puzzle's solution. Future planning. Piece set-up. These equally simple skills will be gradually honed to tackle the hardest puzzles.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>\r\n Key Features</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Over a hundred hand-made levels, divided into several specially crafted boards.</li><li>Daily auto-generated levels for a never ending experience.</li><li>A color palette friendly for people with deuteranopia and similar visual complications.</li><li>Several selections of zen music to fully immerse into relaxation.</li><li>In-game options that allow gameplay speed tweaking, suitable for different play styles.</li><li>Fully wordless UI for accessibility that ignores language and age.</li><li>A simple, yet addictingly complex gameplay for everyone to enjoy.</li><li>Pegs.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>(Steam key included)<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Special Thanks</strong></p>\n<p>Once again, thank you very much to everyone that gave their feedback and support that led to this project's creation.
