Everytime the game is loaded, the maze is procedurally regenerated using\u00a0Randomized Prim's algorithm.</p>\n<p>There are three types of trigger in the maze:\u00a0the trap, the\u00a0light switch, and the goal. You can guess what they do by their names. There are infinite levels after level 2, since each time the marble reaches the goal, it will be brought to a whole new maze.</p>\n<p>During the development, I\u00a0focused on implementing the algorithm and the lighting/sound effects. I intended to make it some sort of horrific.\u00a0Overall, I'm pretty satisfy with the visuals. A possible direction for further development can be adding pickable items to the maze.</p><p>(P.S. Use Space to switch on the lights when if you are stuck somewhere)</p>\n<p>The sound effects were found from\u00a0freesound.org. The textures were from google images.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T08:09:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/689/689597345c2386a39bc2372a281ce3b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zixuan"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
