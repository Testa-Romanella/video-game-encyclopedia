The harvested enemies' DNA will fill up a progress bar that, when full, lets you assimilate one enemy, which in turn will upgrade your agent. Weave your way around dangers, maximize captures, and choose wisely which enemies and associated upgrades you want to assimilate.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs you complete objectives and reach higher scores, you will unlock new enemies, new capacities, and new objectives. The research must go on.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFor better accessibility the game features a set of different palettes apart from the original one shown in the screenshots and trailer.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-20T06:40:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7f/a7f3cf9734f894be6d511e51253fd141.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PUNKCAKE Delicieux", "Benjamin Soul\u00e9", "PUNKCAKE D\u00e9licieux \ud83e\udd5e"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["PUNKCAKE Delicieux"], "esrb_rating": null}
