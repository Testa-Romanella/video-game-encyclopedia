Or if face-to-face battles are more your forte, choose \n      Game B, climb into your fleet's submarine, and set off to face your \n      opponent's fleet head-on. Use your sub's sonar to track enemy movements \n      from beneath the waves, then surface to attack. But keep in mind, while \n      you're hunting the enemy, your enemy's sub is hunting you...\n    </p><p>\n</p><p>\n      No matter what you choose, it's up to you to lead your fleet to victory!\n    </p><p>This game is only playable in 2D.</p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
