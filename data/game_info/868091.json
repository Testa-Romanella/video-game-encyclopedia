{"id": 868091, "slug": "war-of-velana", "name": "War of Velana", "name_original": "War of Velana", "description": "War of Velana is a single player 16-bit RPG that combines world exploration and interaction with an orthographic grid-based tactical battle system. In many ways, War of Velana is in many ways a spiritual successor to the Shining Force series on the Sega Genesis. Elements of those games are the core, and combine with some design ideas from Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics to create a new tactical experience. In War of Velana, your characters have static classes and gain a variety of skills and equipment upgrades as you progress through the game. In between combat, you\u2019ll be able to explore and interact with the world around you.<br/><br/><strong>Setting:</strong><br/><br/>The world of Velana, in its current state, has four nations: <br/><ul><li>Alta, a royal kingdom of sprawling green fields, meadows, and riverlands. <br/></li><li>Kovell, a nation with a wide plain of autumn-gold, a dark forest, and a northern tundra.<br/></li><li>Ishdar, a small desert island nation of artisans and warriors to the far east.<br/></li><li>Jakka, a jungle archipelago with towering mountains and devout monasteries.</li></ul><br/><strong>Story:</strong><br/><br/>Our story starts in Alta near the foothills of the Goravia Ridge, outside the small village of Pell.
