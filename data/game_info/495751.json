Enemies attack from all sides, combat forces are limited, but it is necessary to hold out as long as possible.<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Management is carried out using the console. There are currently three commands available:<br/>move A1 B2 - moving a unit from sector A1 to sector B2;<br/>status - health of the station; status A1 - unit's specifications\u00a0from sector A1<br/>help - show two previous commands :);</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0It's our first project and we made it for \"Mini Jam 63: Future\", we tried our best. A game has bugs which we will fix in updates. Also we will add new commands and diversify the gameplay. We hope you'll enjoy it.
