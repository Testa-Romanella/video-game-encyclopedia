In this game, you play as a security operator who oversees the security system for Downston Medical &amp; Research Facility.\r\n<p>\u00a0Sometime in the past, the Downston Medical &amp; Research Facility\u2019s managerial AI computes a decision that will determine the fate of humanity. As a result of its final decision for the \u2018benefit of humankind\u2019, a manual operator is immediately called to action in order to contain the source of a disaster that is currently unfolding in the Medical Facility. As the operator starts up their application on their mobile device, they find out they have to guide a lone survivor out of the pre-apocalyptic facility infested with all kinds of environmental hazards and unsound lifeforms.
