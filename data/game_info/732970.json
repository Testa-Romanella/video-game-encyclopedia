This is a minimalist, one-button game developed for NYU's Game Design Course in Spring 2022. At the start, there are two shapes (one red and one blue) and a rotating line. Press SPACE to cut the shapes along the line. You have 20 cuts to try and make as many blue shapes as possible, and as few red shapes as possible. Good luck!</p>\n<p>Developed by: Graham Todd, Elvis Cabreja, and Zhixi Wang</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T04:36:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54d/54d3456805df3f10db97bfe63252ba04.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Orbitalics"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
