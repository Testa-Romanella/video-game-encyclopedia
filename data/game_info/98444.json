If Ed does become injured you can opt to take a break and regain some health at craft services; however in doing so you will lose precious time and as result Ed will earn less money (which he needs to pay his exorbitant medical bills)!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e5/0e56fe94200230cf826632eb05e310c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["stunted"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
