I got a little carried away and put a little too much effort into it, but I really like how it turned out!</p>\n<p>The game includes an online leaderboard so you can compare your scores with a bunch of other people. If you can beat it without getting hit you get extra points!\u00a0I've only had one person beat it hitless so far, can you?</p>\n<p>I'm uploading it for free, if anyone wants to donate that's cool, but you really don't have to.\u00a0If this is popular enough I\u00a0might consider making more levels in a future update, or maybe just make a Puck Daddy 2.</p>\n<p>I hope you all enjoy! NOW WITH CONTROLLER SUPPORT!!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T18:33:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a02/a0265a5acbf590c63d9dbb9937599a13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AltTabbed"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
