It is not good by any means but I am happy that I made this and put it out there. Just extract the Zip file you download from here and click the application that says Super Paddles once that is done.</p>\n<p>It is a simple paddle game where the ball bounces between and you don't want to let the ball pass and into your goal. You can play as the blue paddle vs. the computer. Or you can play vs a second player that will have to use the same keyboard as you. First to three points wins!</p>\n<p>\u00a0Controls will be listed below.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you for taking the time and playing my game. I am open to any and all advice and look forward to creating and making more games.</p>\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/StoryGamer92</p>\n<p>Blue Player Controls:</p>\n<p>W = UP</p>\n<p>S = DOWN</p>\n\n<p>Red Player Controls:</p>\n<p>Up Arrow = UP</p>\n<p>Down Arrow = Down</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T14:53:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/690/690faa3f3454c9abc70e2f87b5a8b5e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["glarance84"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
