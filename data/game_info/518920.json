The golden Bat beckons the shamans, so it is your duty, nay, your destiny to follow and aid the regent of all that sleeps and glitters.

Your way is blocked by obstacles which you need to overcome. You can do this by using powers of the spirits of the forest which you encounter on your way down the cave. By taming the spirits they grant you the usage of their powers for a limited time.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\n<br/>A &amp; D \u2014 \u2190 &amp; \u2192, respectively\r\n<br/>Space \u2014 Jump<br/>E \u2014 Interact\r\n<br/>E near a spirit \u2014 Initiate conversation (If you type out what they want, they will grant you power![use your keyboard])\r\n<br/>Space in Air\u00a0 \u2014 Double Jump\r\n<br/>Left Mouse Botton (When you hold the stag spirit) \u2014 Dash in the direction you are currently moving\r\n<br/>Q (When you hold the bear spirit) \u2014 Break brittle Tiles in the room\r\n<br/>W near a Wall (When you hold the gecko spirit) \u2014 Climb a wall</p>\n<p>Spirits only stay with you for a limited time, so don't sqander it!\r\n</p>\n<p>The game has been made during the #ifGameSHjam and\u00a0<strong>Mix and Game Jam 2020</strong>\u00a0which had the theme\u00a0<strong>MIXING GENRES</strong>.
