{"id": 616000, "slug": "fly-quest-demo", "name": "Fly Quest Demo", "name_original": "Fly Quest Demo", "description": "<p>\n</p>\n<p>You play as Guy the Fly, a fly born in a nursery box abandoned near a beach. </p>\n<p>Fly will travel through beaches, sewers, and wherever else to reach Flytopia. Along the way you'll face unique enemies and grow with each foe beaten. </p>\n<p>This game will be light on the story. The trade off is getting into the gameplay as fast as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Basic jump and shoot platforming with some twists. </p>\n<p>Guy can attach to walls and stay in place. Once attached to a wall, Guy can climb up in two ways; pressing the jump button will make him climb in intervals while pressing up will make him climb continuously.</p>\n<p>After jumping, you can press jump again and float. While you can't fly upwards, you can move left and right as well as press down to move downwards.</p>\n<p>You start with just one attack option, the normal acid spit. It's a basic projectile that travels across the screen. As you beat bosses/midbosses you will get more attacks, as well as health and power pickups. In the demo, you can unlock the acid mine by defeating the boss. You can then replay the level with the new acid mine attack power. You can switch attacks with a button press. See button layout image for reference.</p>\n<p>You will gain health and force power upgrades as you play. Your max force power will decide how many player projectiles you can have on screen at once. </p>\n<p>There are several potion types. How they work haven't been fully realized yet, but the concept for them is; Health potion gives you back 3 pips of your health, Force potion gives you extra force shots for a limited amount of time, Miracle potion refills your health to max, and Death potion will wipe out basic enemies on the screen and do some damage to bosses.</p>\n\n<p>all music in the game is made by NewAgeRetroFly(NARF for short) a twitch streamer who normally plays games. From time to time he plays music on his keyboard. His favorite game is Street Fighter 4 Ultimate Championship Arcade Edition, and he plays that guy who lubes up before matches. You can join his discord here.<br/></p>\n<br/>\n<p>Download the demo here. \u00a0It can also be found on my website here<br/></p>\n\n<p>There will also be a kickstarter page soon. It's in the works. Once it's up, it'll be linked here.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T08:33:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a9/8a9129ad02ac987c4264c7cb2e58d121.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["goblinspire"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
