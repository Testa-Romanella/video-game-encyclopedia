I chose to recreate the game Farkle. The first submission was made Visual Studio and played in the console. For the refinements, I remade the game in GameMaker Studio 2 to give it a user interface.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Farkle Rules</strong></p>\n<p>____________________________________________________</p>\n<p>Start:</p>\n<p>The first player rolls all six dice at the same time and sets aside any \"point dice\" (1's, 5's, or three of a kind) that appear. At this point, the player has the option to continue to roll the remaining dice to collect even more points, or stop and keep any points acquired.</p>\n<p>Farkle!:</p>\n<p>A Farkle occurs when the dice are rolled and no point dice appear. At this point the player loses all the point dice they have collected during that turn, and the play passes to the player to the left. No points are recorded for that player's turn.</p>\n<p>If a player decides not to risk rolling a Farkle then they can stop rolling and the play passes to the player to the left. Any points collected during that turn are then recorded. </p>\n<p>If, in the course of one turn, all six dice become point dice and are set aside, the player must roll all six dice at least one more time, before stopping and keeping the points collected.</p>\n<p>Points:</p>\n<p>1's = 100 points</p>\n<p>5's = 50 points</p>\n<p>Triple 1's = 1000 points</p>\n<p>Triple of the same side = Side value x100. </p>\n<p>Entering the Game:</p>\n<p>In order for a player to initially enter the game, (and record points), they must continue to roll until at least 1,000 points are collected during one turn. Once the player officially enters the game, the points are recorded and that player may stop rolling at any time during future turns. Sometimes it might take many turns before a player can get started. </p>\n<p>Winning:</p>\n<p>In order to win, a player must get 10,000 points recorded</p>\n<p>After a player gets over 10,000, each of the other players get one turn to try to beat the first player who goes out. If none of them beat his or her score, then he or she is declared the winner. If someone beats his or her score then that new player wins the game.</p>\n<p>____________________________________________________</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T13:34:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f0c/f0c972c913094ccb5558320e1bece088.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Magical-pal"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
