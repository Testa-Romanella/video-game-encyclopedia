Type words quickly to zap hungry sharks and piranhas before they attack your submarine. The deeper you dive, the harder it is to escape. Watch for the electric eel, giant squid and the boss shark. They cast out multiple words all at once, repeatedly! Be ready to type all the words before they collide  with your submarine, or you will lose a life. Earn points by successfully typing all of the characters, and advancing to the next level of play, deeper down into the depths of the sea.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T02:25:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/266/266a154ab497b097a2da113973ca4078.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Individual Software"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Individual Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
