However, you don't have any fuel, and thus you must burn your cargo to keep moving. Cargo is not an appropriate fuel, so your engine's pipe gets clogged  \u2014 that's why you need cleaning gel.</p>\n<p>Manage your gel and cargo reserves to make it to the final station  \u2014 and don't forget to avoid meteors, which keep crushing into your ship!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T09:19:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00b/00b7b34f6b1cf70b4388449808c5ecf5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tkachov"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
