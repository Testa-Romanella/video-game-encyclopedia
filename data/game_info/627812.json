I decided to create a monster spawner that will only spawn a new monster when the last spawned monster invokes an event. Requests to spawn monsters are triggered by UI events, if the spawner is not ready to spawn a new monster any spawn requests are held in a queue to be processed in the order they were received.</p>\n<p>Link to source code:\u00a0\u00a0https://github.com/TangledWires94/Event-Queue-Queued-Monster-Spawner<br/></p>\n<p>The project uses assets from the Unity Asset store;</p>\n<ul><li>Inferno VFX by Mirza Beig</li><li>Ultimate Low Poly Dungeon by Broken Vector</li><li>RPG Monster Partners PBR Polyart by Dungeon Mason</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T05:12:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/791/79102acbf3cb7e1534da478614ff47ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tangled Wire Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
