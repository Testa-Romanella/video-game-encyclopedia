With a card configuration that enhances mobility, the exhilaration of moving this map endlessly can not be experienced in other games.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T02:58:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08f/08fb8914e26d5228fc0485a29c82eb3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 314, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kentaro"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Kentaro"], "esrb_rating": null}
