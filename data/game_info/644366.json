You can adjust the size of the window and the color of your player in the settings menu. Download the four files into a single folder and then run the main.py script to play the game.\u00a0This is my first game so leave any comments, suggestions, or criticism below. I am still working on adding features and levels so there will be updates.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T07:49:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3da/3da577e993d0274852f90d51db4342fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["arosso17"], "genres": ["Racing", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
