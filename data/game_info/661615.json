Save the ship before the sea monsters take control over it!</p>\n<p>Pirate Codex can be a challengeful singleplayer or a fun\u00a0co-op game with your friends. Fight against monsters while moving your characters\u00a0together.<br/></p>\n<p>The two character has a rope between them and they are trying to catch the monsters with it, but be careful, if the characters are too far away from eachother the rope breaks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are bosses, upgrades, potions and abilities!</p>\n<p><strong>Use WASD and Arrows to control the two character. 1-4 numbers are for potions and abilities and T button is the pause. Thats all :D<br/></strong><strong>The game has controller support so you can play with controllers too!</strong></p>\n\n<p>I'm planning to release an online coop version too but I am really new so it will take some time. However, you can play online coop with the help of\u00a0Parsec.</p>\n<p>I am really curious about the community's opinion about my first game, I hope you have a great time with this game. Ideas and critics are appreciated, I would love to hear them both to make the game better :)</p>\n<p><strong>This is only the BETA version of the game.
