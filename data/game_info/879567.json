It&#39;s time to get the gang back together and help a ghoul in need in this LGBTQ+ Visual Novel DLC. Step back into the shoes of the Hunter and investigate a haunting happening in the Lunarian woodland with your colleagues August and Piper and get some help from the resident creatures of the night in a comedic mini-tale created over the course of just four weeks!
