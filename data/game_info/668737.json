This is a demo, a very, very rough one.\u00a0</p><p>SIDE NOTE: Yes, I realized I left in the instakill move, no I'm not going to remove it. There are 2 fights in this game and they suck so it doesn't matter.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T07:39:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/967/967fde78d42a70d0233103317b5922aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["holidayhollowout"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
