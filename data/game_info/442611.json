My initial goal was to target my 386dx DOS PC and try to make the blobs as fast as possible (when there are few blobs in the screen it might even play smoothly on 386sx, under that is not gonna run at all\u00a0because of 32bit oriented code). I think 2MB of Ram will be enough (but I haven't tested for that amount of memory\u00a0besides in Dosbox, my 386 has at least 4MBs or more).</p>\n<p>You can play with arrow keys/space or alternatively mouse if you run a mouse drive like ctmouse or other. It's just 5 levels and a secret 6 level (with 2 huge blobs). There are a lot of things to improve and maybe adding sound and fixing some bugs, but I am out of time right now.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T06:00:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6f/b6f9b5509f4bb4c0384cf26a11a4ea78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Optimus6128"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
