Can you guide it?</strong><br/></p><p>A game for Ludum Dare 38 Compo.</p><p>Controls: click to move, press buttons 1-4 to choose.</p><p>You can also use WASD/Arrows to move, but the axes are a bit... weird. Or you can use a controller for movement and choices.</p><p>Music from Jukedeck - create your own at http://jukedeck.com<br/></p><p><strong>Bugfix Info</strong>: This version fixes some issues with events happening constantly or not frequently enough. No new content or mechanics have been added, so this is basically the Compo version minus some annoyances. I will probably also do a proper post-compo version with more significant improvements and additions to the story.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c3/7c31d956b3c2cb0f3e9d3938b480df07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Zarkonnen"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
