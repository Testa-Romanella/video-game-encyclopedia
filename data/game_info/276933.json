{"id": 276933, "slug": "squared-number-sliding", "name": "SquaRED - Number Sliding", "name_original": "SquaRED - Number Sliding", "description": "SquaRED puts a spin on the classic number pairing game. Whether you\u2019re a beginner (yes, I\u2019m talking about you) or a pro (hmm, debatable), the variety of game modes will challenge you. Play with varying grid sizes, and with a timer if you want to challenge yourself further too. You won\u2019t win.<br/><br/>It is as beautiful as it is witty, and minimalistic as it is fun. The animations and ticking timer keep you on edge, and the wonderful haptics keep you engaged.<br/><br/>This is a classic like you\u2019ve always known it, but better, way better. I hope you enjoy SquaRED as much as I enjoyed making it!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:35:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d93/d9393a64755d59b69b901da286c59a40_Th9BscC.jpg", "website": "http://thebluebird.app", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Shihab Mehboob"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Shihab Mehboob"], "esrb_rating": null}
