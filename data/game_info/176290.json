Only you can protect the glorious motherland from her enemies. Enemies that are plotting to take the power that is rightfully yours.</p><p>Each player takes on the role of a member of the Politburo. They must negotiate the support of other players to gain power - but they can never know whether they will be betrayed.</p><p>Each turn, all players negotiate with each other for support, lock in their decisions, then resolve them. First, players can move some of their followers between the seven committees of the Supreme Soviet. Then, players vote on the agenda of each committee. The number of followers determines the number of votes. Whoever gets the most votes gains a follower with special powers.</p><p>The game lasts seven turns. Each player has a secret agenda which determines their scoring at the end of the game.</p><p>The game can be played in real-time or asynchronously, online or face-to-face. Played real-time, it should take around 80 minutes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79c/79c1d9e24acd3fe59d935e599ca18e6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zakharov"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
