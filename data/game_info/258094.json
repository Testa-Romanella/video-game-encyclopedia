{"id": 258094, "slug": "castle-conquest", "name": "Castle Conquest", "name_original": "Castle Conquest", "description": "<p>The board game, Castle Conquest, was the Czechoslovak board game from 80' years.\u00a0You can select 3 levels of difficulty. It is possible to turn off the weather in the game\u2019s menu or even set a stronger element of choice. The bottom-up panel in the middle is informational only and has no effect on gameplay.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Rules:</strong><br/>The aim of the game is to conquer the opponent\u2019s inner castle. (e.g. capturing the opponent\u2019s keys).</p>\n<p>Default Situation:<br/>At the beginning of the game, the knights are at the top of their castles.</p>\n<p><strong>Game:</strong><br/>The first move is yellow and the players continue to rotate regularly. A trap player may move any of his or her knights to one or more free fields orthogonally (that is, the same as the tower in chess, not so obliquely). \u00a0In the same way, knights can move around the walls. If a player wants to ascend on the walls, or descend, they can move the knight only one field. The knight must not enter the inner field of its own castle (that is, the field in the center which has the key), nor go through it.</p>\n<p>If the knight ends the move in the field in which an opponent\u2019s knight occupies, he is remove from the board. Skipping knights (both your own and foreign) is not allowed.</p>\n<p><strong>Channels:</strong><br/>The castle can be freely accessed through the canals. However, the number of passes through the channels is limited by:</p>\n<p>level 1 =&gt; 8 passes<br/>level 2 =&gt; 7 passes<br/>level 3 =&gt; 6 passes</p>\n<p>The remaining number of passes is shown in the top left bar for each player. Once this number has been depleted, he can no longer pass through the canals and must go to the castle through the wall.<br/>When passing a knight across the skull (placed somewhere randomly in the middle of the field), one pass is also subtracted.</p>\n<p><strong>Game Over:</strong><br/>1. The game ends when a field with the key is occupied by a player and the castle is captured.<br/>2. The game ends when one of the players comes down to all the knights.<br/>A draw is not possible, someone is always able to conquer the castle.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/849/849a2d8e444d3400b829a6dde2f5612a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["zxretrosoft"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
