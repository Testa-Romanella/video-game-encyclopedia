I did this by\u00a0introducing different environments, types of enemies, types of pickups, checkpoints,\u00a0overall difficulty increase, and differences in look/feel of level. I also really focused on player progression organizing the level so that the player would begin with easier task that force the player to learn about the basics of the game\u00a0and then as each level goes by the player will use the knowledge previously learned to complete the level.</p>\n<p>Changes in main menu and title screen of game\u00a0font also edited to fit into boxes so that it is easier to read.\r\n</p>\n<p>small changes in enemy speed/health, and multiple additions of platforms that are static and moving.</p>\n<p>Credits: MSU CAS117 2Dplatformer tutorial\u00a0</p>\n<p>Side note:\r\n</p>\n<p>Going into the second project I now know my own capabilities and took this opportunity to focus on my game design and how to create logical progression. I drew out the levels before constructing them in unity and I found this to be very helpful in creating the logical progression that I was going for.</p>\n<p>Created by: Charles Morris\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T23:08:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d6/0d671c13223874aec61d7bd69553509e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["DeVaudreeMorris"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
