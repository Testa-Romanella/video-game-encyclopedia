I made it a couple years back and wanted to finally make what I had publicly playable.</p><p>THE FRIEND SHIP is an (eventually) deckbuilding (then eventually after that) rogue-lite based on friendships aboard a starship on a special mission. You are an intern on the starship with, at least to you, a boring job: use your Tele-empathic abilities to observe the crew and occasionally help them with emotional issues. You long to use your abilities for something more \"meaningful.\" But what if the friends we made along the way are the most important part of the mission, and what if your ability to help the crew work together, despite all their various personalities, is the only way they can truly succeed?</p>\n<p>The Friend Ship is controlled primarily via click/touchable UI buttons and does not require any special controls.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T12:42:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4db/4dbfe407c294923afe07f92a7230bbf0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["lopar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
