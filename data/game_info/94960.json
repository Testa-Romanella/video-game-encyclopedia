Please enjoy the game.</p>\n<p><strong>[This game is for mature audiences only. Contains violence, sex, and references to self-injury among other things.]</strong></p>\n<p>\r\n\tThere's no way around it. This is a dark, weird, kinky game. You play the role of some poor damned soul who must either please their new demon master/mistress (which appears is up to you, as are your gender and sexual orientation) by doing... something unpleasant... or face eternity as the plaything of their older and more sadistic brother. Or perhaps an even <em>worse</em> fate. Along the way, you may need to replenish your strength, but don't worry: that's part of the fun.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMade with Twine. Features a good <strong>soundtrack</strong>, a fair amount of original <strong>artwork</strong>, and a decidedly <strong>dark atmosphere</strong>. It also has <strong>more than one ending</strong>.</p>\n<p>\n<em>My Website</em>: Gaming Pixie's Games</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0e/a0e472d295bf91b823d7fd8848e30adf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Rochelle"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
