Eat your meds for health.<br/></p>\n<p>Inspired by the QTE system in RPGs like Paper Mario, and Bug Fables.</p>\n<p>Bonus point for anybody who know what My Eldritch Leg is referencing (hint: it's a real world injury)</p>\n<p>Note: WebGL release is broken, will fix eventually.<br/></p>\n<p>Personal Note: Been busy with work (and lazy), I barely have any time to develop the game. I realized on the last day that the \"combat\" \u00a0component is severely lacking. I originally wanted the moves/items to be used during the chase, but there is nothing stopping the player from spamming items at the very start of the round. More robust mechanisms are probably needed for this concept to realize it's potential.</p>\n<p>Also, this is extremely over-scoped, lol, what am I doing, should have stuck with simple stuff. I did learn quite a bit though.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T04:31:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0d/d0dd9c9b0441ff8ba07b1f51887389ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["TheCakeConsortium"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
