The two of us are both Amateur Game-Designers, but we learned a lot from this. Multiple redirections and pivots occurred during production. There were a LOT of unpolished elements, but we still gave it out best. We finished exporting the project minutes ago, and the deadline is 35 minutes away. Hope you enjoy our game!<br/><br/>Controls can be found within the Game Help Screen.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T06:52:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a18/a18bed5a3ac2143db9adae44be19290d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["lettucepie", "Houndfall"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
