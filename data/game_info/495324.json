After returning from a long trip, she found out that some losers are making game about her, and was invited to participate in its test. Too bad she didn't know that such a horrible fate awaits her...<br/><br/>A version you're playing right now is just a short demo\u00a0of a future game. However, I still have plans to make a couple of updates for the demo, such as introducing gamepad support, tweaking balance\u00a0and finishing some cut-out content. I hope you'll enjoy\u00a0the game!<br/><br/>Join our discord channel:\u00a0https://discord.gg/ZRqTKr4</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T05:43:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/725/725fe1a0bf235c9a46959ee58260068e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DoctorHummer"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
