You will play as Clara, a young woman who has lost both of her parents. You'll help her start a long awaited journey and meet characters who need her help to cope with their past.<br/><br/><strong>To ensure the best experience wear headphones and interact with lots of stuff!\u00a0\u00a0 </strong><br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 Working primarily to enter the illustration field, I created this game as a senior project. After owning RPGMaker VX Ace for years, I realized I now had the opportunity to really use it. I wanted to share a story but needed more of a backbone for it's purpose. Losing my dad in 2018 was the first death to really impact me, it was after that I started realizing how the coping mechanisms interested me in how there was no right or wrong way to feel and that they were different for each person. <br/>\u00a0 \u00a0Each main character in this game is a representation of the different coping stages, but I'll let you figure out each one by playing!<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Personal Website - Game Discord - Game Page (contains spoilers) <br/></p>\n<p>All in game illustrations, pixel art, characters, and plot created by me \u2764<br/>Includes a total of 26 Full Illustrations you can receive with 8 extra images also created (title, credits, etc)</p>\n<p>Note: To get one of the in game illustrations you'll have to <em>pay</em> for it!<br/>(this can be accomplished in Clara's childhood home)<br/>Can't get it?
