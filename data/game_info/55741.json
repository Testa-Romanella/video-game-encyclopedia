During gameplay there are a number of little alien allies that aid the player and protect the ship. If the player gets hit by an enemy or projectile, the ship sprite will reflect the damage: it can lose the laser tip and the engine before the last hit. There is a bonus level hidden inside the game where the player can earn high scores by destroying the faces of the game's creators.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1989-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:00:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bda/bda85c6f5be789e06076758ce1bf9f63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 257, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Atari Lynx"], "developers": ["Epyx"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Atari"], "esrb_rating": null}
