It was made for the Myst Jam.<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThere is no story, no meaning behind objects and places. I just picked random stuffs at my reach. I wish I had time to prepare a consistent story and believable characters, build more mechanics and enigmas, but it will be for another time, another project.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tMy goals was to learn skills with the \r\n\tBlender Cycles render engine. Use home-made 360 panoramas captured with a smartphone. And then just having fun with effects by using shaders.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tApp used for 360 panoramas : Google Street View (Android) (iPhone)\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSince I work at a company where I make virtual reality with the Oculus Samsung Gear VR for big brands, I sometimes feel constraint and can't go crazy on the shader side. Well, \r\n\tMyst Jam was there at the right time and I just went completely obsessed and possessed about the project. I barely slept during one week but I guess it worth the effort.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tDefinitively going further with the engine, with the help of people, to make great projects like biographic interactive films, or imaginary lands from a \r\n\tMoebius universe.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tI have plenty of things to do before, but I'll write some documentations about equirectangular textures and shader transitions.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tSince the compressed file size of the game is about 700MB, it would be fun to print the game on a CD and distribute it like an old school PC game with a pretty cover.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tMac build very soon ... !!\r\n\t\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIf you need a quality VR app, you can contact the company I work : \r\n\tDVMobile\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThey can also make 4K 360 videos : \r\n\tDVRig<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tUnity3D project code sources (project generation will take a long time)\r\n</p><p>Voice : \r\n\t<strong>Melanie Bonsens </strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tMusic : \r\n\t<strong>Gregory Semah </strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tPanorama 360 Voyages : \r\n\t<strong>Benjamin Vedrenne </strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tPanorama 360 Fractals :\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\thttp://picssr.com/photos/103444278@N03/interesting?nsid=103444278@N03<br/>\r\n\thttps://www.flickr.com/photos/rantz/16524228531<br/>\r\n\thttps://www.flickr.com/photos/krofeilz/15265120282<br/>\r\n\thttp://www.deviantart.com/art/GravingYards-Pano-535765449<br/>\r\n\thttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAhN7CLLn4\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tCode :\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tScript for a sphere with perfect UV : <strong>Olivier Nemoz</strong><br/>\r\n\tEquirectangular projection : https://gist.github.com/Farfarer/5664694<br/>\r\n\tStereographic projection : https://github.com/notlion/streetview-stereographic<br/>\r\n\tGLSL utils : https://github.com/i-saint/RaymarchingOnUnity5\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94d/94d5fe49a1ac4c51d1f6d4181f742a3a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Leon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
