Combining elements of rhythm based games we've come to know and love, with the idea of beatmixing entire tracks together: Fader isn't just about hitting the right timings on specific instruments, it's about matching the entire song until you get a \"perfect mix\".</p><p>A perfect mix occurs when you have scores of 100's on all three tracks.  Each side of the game level is a seperate track: right, middle and left.  The score is the volume of that particular track, when all three are maxed out at 100, all three are playing at full volume.  The longer you stay on a track and the more boxes you collect, the higher the score/volume gets.  Avoid the bombs!</p><p><strong>Controls</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>A, D </strong>: Move left or right</li><li><strong>Q,W,E</strong>: Deploy powerup on left, middle, right lane respectively</li></ul><p><strong>Powerups</strong>: </p><ul><li><strong>FREEZE</strong>: freezes volume of that track for a while</li><li><strong>MAX</strong>: maxes out volume of that track</li><li><strong>Accelerate</strong>: speeds up the volume ramp up.</li></ul><p><strong>Credits</strong>:</p><p><em>Developed by Norm Nazaroff, Ben Geisler; Art by Curtis (Zeus) Zuehls, Mac Diedrich; Support by Eric Robinson with special thanks to Koreographer</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/703/703d73753dbcf98c0fc05565f30717e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["mechanodroid"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
