In the game, you will control a tambourine instead of a snake and eat glue instead of an apple. I also added one extra feature, where you must dodge or destroy melons.</p>\n<p>TambourineSSS does not require any installation since it is playable on both mobile and desktop browsers. This game is also free, so you can try and play it to your heart\u2019s content.</p><p><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Guide the tambourine towards the glue to grow and gain points. You can also attain additional points if you successfully crash the melon into the tambourine\u2019s body. <br/></p><p>The game will end once there is no more space left on the map. Or if the tambourine\u2019s front or side face crashes on a melon or it\u2019s own body.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Keyboard</strong><br/>Move Up: W or Up Arrow Key<br/>Move Down: S or Down Arrow Key<br/>Move Left: A or Left Arrow Key<br/>Move Right: D or Right Arrow Key</p>\n<p><strong>Touch</strong><br/>Move Up: Swipe Up<br/>Move Down: Swipe Down<br/>Move Left: Swipe Left<br/>Move Right: Swipe Right</p>\n<p><strong>TOOLS</strong></p>\n<p>Audacity<br/>Gimp<br/>Inkscape Studio<br/>Kdenlive<br/>LMMS<br/>OBS<br/>Godot<br/>VLC</p>\n<p><strong>SOUND EFFECTS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>PewDiePie a.k.a.
