{"id": 54896, "slug": "shamus-1982", "name": "Shamus (1982)", "name_original": "Shamus (1982)", "description": "<p>Shamus is a flip screen action adventure game written by William Mataga (now Cathryn Mataga) and published by Synapse Software. Originally released for the Atari 8-bit computers in 1982, it was ported to the VIC-20, Commodore 64, TRS-80 Color Computer, TI-99/4A, and IBM PC. Several of these ports were made by Atarisoft. Ihor Wolosenko, co-founder of Synapse, noted that it was Shamus that really put the company on the map by giving it a reputation for quality. It was followed by a sequel, Shamus: Case II, with the same characters but different gameplay.</p>\n<p>Mataga's original version was 16K in size and released on disk and tape for the Atari 8-bit family, and later sold by Atari on cartridge following the launch of the Atari XEGS in 1987. The VIC-20 port was 8K and contained only 32 levels (unlike the 128 in every other version). In 1999, Mataga developed a remake for the Game Boy Color, and later, both Shamus and Shamus: Case II for iOS.</p>\n<p>Funeral March of a Marionette, the theme song from Alfred Hitchcock Presents, plays on the title screen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1982-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:26:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddf/ddf16d2ed623349bb8ee5edfb23dac32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 256, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Apple II", "Atari 8-bit", "Game Boy Color", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Synapse Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
