Friendly clouds will give you a gust of downward wind if you press the space bar, storm clouds will pop the balloon, so avoid them and make your way safely skyward.</p>\n<p>This game was created for Trijam#149 -- the theme is flipped. My take on that is flipped gravity, in that you're being pulled upward. It's also a bit of a flipped take on a traditional 2d platformer, in that it's a vertical scroll instead of horizontal.</p>\n<p>This is my first game, my first completed Godot project, and my first ever game jam!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T11:46:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d32/d3209a4204d4d2e789802875e64eb8be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["chickentotts"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
