When making a Slots/RPG hybrid in the game, I wondered what that would look like in real life and thus King Cashing was born.<br/><br/>In the making for 8 months, King Cashing 2 brings the whole idea to a new level, both for new and veteran players of King Cashing. I really hope you'll enjoy the game! Thanks for playing!<br/><br/>-Nicholas<br/><br/>*** WARNING *** If you play on a non-retina device like the iPhone 3GS or iPod 3, some graphical elements will look blurry or chunky depending on the case.
