{"id": 364134, "slug": "colorfold-2", "name": "ColorFold 2", "name_original": "ColorFold 2", "description": "ColorFold 2 is a relaxing puzzle game that's all about folding and moving colored ribbons - sounds easy, right?<br/><br/>The basic principle sounds simple: move the ribbons and fill all checkpoints with the right colors. <br/>But it's not that easy, I promise.<br/><br/>150 brand-new handcrafted levels and tons of new gameplay mechanics await you.<br/>Use the new color-switches to change a ribbon's color, use the new jump-token to cross gaps or push boxes around to open gates - these are just a few of the mechanics that you'll have to use to solve all puzzles.<br/><br/>All of your solutions are stored and synced across all of your iOS devices once you solve a puzzle - that means that you automatically play right where you left off on all of your iOS devices, but also that you can take another look and inspect your puzzle solutions whenever you want to.<br/><br/>You're stuck and need a hint? Well, there are three hints per level, which should give you a nice push in the right direction. You can use as many hints as you want - there's no arbitrary limitation. Just do yourself a favor and use them as a last resort.<br/><br/>There are 150 levels in total, split into 9 acts. Each act introduces and teaches you new gameplay mechanics.<br/>There's also one extra hard level per act, called the star-level, which has to be solved without any hints. After solving a star-level, you'll be rewarded for your valiant effort with a new color-theme.<br/><br/>Solve the first 8 star-levels to unlock act 9, where nothing's quite the same anymore... but I don't want to spoil it all. See for yourself!<br/><br/><br/>Long story short:<br/>\u2022 150 handcrafted, brain-teasing levels<br/>\u2022 Tons of exciting gameplay mechanics<br/>\u2022 Universal app with iCloud sync<br/>\u2022 Taptic Engine support<br/>\u2022 No ads<br/>\u2022 No microtransactions<br/>\u2022 Beautiful dark mode<br/>\u2022 9 unlockable themes &amp; app icons<br/><br/><br/>Happy folding, times two!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-12T03:22:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e8/1e837ac7896844ba2a8be93f901920cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Martin Pluisch"], "genres": ["Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Martin Pluisch"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
