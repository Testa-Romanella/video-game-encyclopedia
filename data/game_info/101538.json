It's not meant to be realistic, and I don't really even have a plan for where this game is going.  I just wanted a playground where I could be a kid again and fly cool airplanes around :) So if you're having a bad day or feeling a little off, I hope this game helps you like it helps me.</p><p>CONTROLS:<br/></p><p>W/S - Pitch up/down</p><p>A/D - Roll left/right</p><p>I/K - Increase/decrease speed</p><p>J/L - Yaw left/right</p><p>(Arrow keys also work instead of WASD)</p><p>F- Smoke trail</p><p>Escape - Change airplane</p><p>Press and hold Left mouse button for free-look mode</p><p>Also, run in window since I haven't put in a quit button yet</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3dd/3ddcb6d1e89e6bbbb81a12c2b00c8a1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Studio Bump Check"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
