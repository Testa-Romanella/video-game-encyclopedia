It turned out awesome! It has its issues, and it's far from perfect, but I think there's still a lot of fun to be had. Somebody on TIGSource referred to me as \"the illegitimate son of Jeff Minter and Kenta Cho\" - an absolute honor! Got picked up by Rock, Paper, Shotgun and IndieGames.com as well.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is simple: dash! It's a mouse-driven game where you click to zip around the screen and collect gems, chaining them together for ridiculous bonuses, and using purple gems to clean the playing field. The bosses are randomly mashed together pieces which have their own properties regarding their movement and projectiles. It has plenty of pretty colors, flashy things, and an impossibly twitchy vibe.<br/></p>\n<p>The online score table for this one doesn't exist any more, sadly. Post some good plays on YouTube or something, like the one attached to this page!</p>EXE created 2012.08.20", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b9/3b98c325198752c6369a8db357cd6b54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MuleNgine"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
