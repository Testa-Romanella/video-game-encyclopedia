I hope to create a\u00a0 expandable framework through which queer people can discover terms and gauge their own identity in relation to the terms in question.</p><p>---<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>A game created by Oliver Page</p>\n<p>Project Consultant: Josh Kinchen</p>\n<p>Many thanks to\u00a0George Mason University LGBTQ Resources for their support of this project</p>\n<p>If you would like to give feedback, you can do so here!
