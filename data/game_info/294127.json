The last real job they had involved bubbling up a 100 foot Marshmallow man and blowing the top three floors off an up-town high rise for which they were sued. The citizens of New York believing as time passed that they had been victims of a colossal hoax.</p>\n<p>The Ghostbusters team now earn their living hiring themselves at parties, running occult bookshops and appearing on seedy occult TV programmes.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s winter time and the New Year is just around the corner. Dana Barrett has returned to live in the city with her baby son Oscar. The city seems even more paranoid than she remembers it. She is returning from the store laden with groceries when the buggy Oscar is travelling in begins to jolt forward. The brakes unlock themselves. She reaches towards the handlebars, but the buggy rolls forward just out of her reach and stops. Surprised by the movement she reaches for the handlebar again, but this time the buggy rolls even further away. Alarmed now, Dana hurries after it, but the buggy keeps rolling down the street at ever increasing speed.</p>\n<p>Dana chases the buggy down the street, shouting to passing pedestrians for help, but everytime someone reaches out to stop it, the buggy swerves and continues unchecked.</p>\n<p>It comes to a dead stop in the middle of the street, a bus narrowly missing it by inches. Cars and trucks swerve and hit the brakes as Dana runs to the intersection and snatches up the baby. She hugs him close, deeply relieved, then looks at the buggy with the dawning awareness that the supernatural hasre-entered her life.</p>\n<p>When there&#39;s something strange in your neighbourhood, who you gonna call? GHOSTBUSTERS!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1989-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-15T18:49:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/964/964f41e0c8a6a808ea131327450b8df5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 5, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 212, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "NES", "Game Boy", "Atari 2600"], "developers": ["Activision", "Dynamix"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Arcade", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Activision Blizzard", "Dynamix"], "esrb_rating": null}
