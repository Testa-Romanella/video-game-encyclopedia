The inhabitants have no idea why. All they know is that ever since the so-called \"Contingency,\" planes no longer fly overhead, strange creatures have been glimpsed beyond the perimeter, and large mechanical towers will gun down anyone who tries to escape. As Sheriff Erika Wright searches for the truth, she must listen to the advice of a serial killer, mingle with extreme conspiracy theorists, and negotiate with vampires.<br/></p>\n\n<em>Choose a Partner</em>\n<p>As Erika struggles to maintain order in Bataille, she uncovers startling secrets and makes unlikely alliances. Eventually, she must choose a partner in her quest to find the truth. The story will have four completely unique story branches depending on Erika's partner, each of which reveals a new secret and a chance for Erika to find romance.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Adopted by the Bataille family at a young age, <strong>Liam Bataille</strong> has always struggled to feel like he fits in with the family. He\u2019s easily the nicest member of the Batailles with an optimistic attitude, and he regularly urges to Erika to relax and have fun. But his loyalty is frequently torn between his personal virtue and his desire to please Julian and Charlotte.</p>\n\n<p>Before the towers rose, <strong>August Flynn</strong> was a philosophy professor accused of 7 murders, coined the \u201cHeartbreaker\u201d for removing the victims\u2019 hearts. Erika doesn\u2019t believe his claims of innocence, but she might need his expertise against darker forces.</p>\n<p>Growing up as a lesbian in a conservative, rural town often made Maddy feel like an outsider in her own home. The Batailles were the only people who fully accepted her, so she feels loyal to them. But as she learns the real truth of the Batailles, she\u2019ll have to fight for the greater good.</p>\n<p><strong>Julian Bataille</strong> seems calm, polite, and practical on the surface. He claims to maintain order in Bataille with his wealth and influence. He does like to maintain order and peace. But is he actually manipulating everyone for his own personal gain?<br/></p>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-15T04:02:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/635/635e0f9f501cb7fb710d5ca00c80c506.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Woodsy Studio"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
