In this episode, Rosie, the queen of Francium, wakes up in a strange green world where her friends are dumb. She investigates to understand why she's here and what she can do to improve the situation ...\"</em>\n</p>\n<p>I developed it in 2 weeks, based on existing assets from my game Boinihi: The K'i Codex, and the robots from previous Francium episodes. Made with 3dsmax, Unity and Adventure Creator. \r\n    </p>\r\nGameplay info:      \r\n<ul><li>Move with keyboard (zqsd or wasd, or arrows) \r\n</li><li>Use or talk with left click.  \r\n</li><li>Open or close inventory with right click.  \r\n</li><li>Show options menu with Escape.  \r\n</li></ul>\r\nKnown issues:\r\n<p><em>- <strong>Save system </strong>should work, but could result in various issues (used items are back, things like that...). It is recommended to play without saving if you have the possibility.</em></p>\n<p><em>- <strong>Cameras</strong> did not follow Rosie: it is a Jam project and it has been made in a very short amount of time. Sometimes the camera doesn't follow Rosie as it is supposed to. If you lose Rosie out of the field of view, you can get focus on her again either by trying to move to another area around the lake, or by talking to a nearby character.</em><br/></p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Created by <strong>Simon Mesnard</strong>\u00a0 www.simonmesnard.fr <br/></p>\n<p>Special thanks to The Icehouse collective.\r\n    </p>\n<p>Music by <strong>Eric Matyas</strong>\u00a0 www.soundimage.org      </p>\n<p>Francium robots 3d models from <strong>Francium</strong> (previous episodes) by Simon Mesnard,\u00a0\r\n<strong>Black Cube games</strong> models by Simon Mesnard.\r\n    </p>\n<p>External additional assets: Yughues Free Bushes by Nobiax</p>\r\n In the same series:\u00a0      \r\n<p>Episode 1, A Museum for Robots: https://the-icehouse.itch.io/francium \r\n\r\n    </p>\n<p>Episode 2, The King Returns: https://the-icehouse.itch.io/the-king-returns-francium-chapter-2\r\n    </p>\n<p>Episode 3, At the Zoo: \u00a0https://the-icehouse.itch.io/francium3<br/></p>\n<p>Episode 4,\u00a0At\u00a0the\u00a0Golden\u00a0Saucer:\u00a0https://the-icehouse.itch.io/francium4\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T13:48:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9f/c9f3fa55ed0e24193dd49dd1a063eb4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 351, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Icehouse"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
