In single player mode, you control both ships - the controls are linked. You can only decouple the ship controls for a short time. <br/></p>\n<p>The two ships depend on each other for their success: pickups grabbed by one ship are power ups for the other ship. How much risk will you take to help the other player?</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Programming, game design and sounds: Paul Bonsma</p>\n<p>Art and font: www.kenney.nl</p>\n<p>music: Hitctrl ( www.opengameart.org )<br/></p>\n<p>Space background: Soluna software ( www.opengameart.org )<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T13:19:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4e/d4e8ab4f3cd898da0fc10fe1a45b9ab1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PaulsGames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
