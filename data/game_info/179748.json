The Vincent story was interesting to study, but I want to talk about different things. I will use Vincent aesthetics and will rethink it. I will change the story for the one more important for me and, maybe, for others.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This project was more or less personal and I conveyed things that were important for me at the moment. It was my\u00a0first app, that I tested on the phone, so it is very important for me. Many great people helped me with the test and I even went to the conference with it. Now I know what I to do next and how I can use this experience. Thanks for the support!\u00a0</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Fixed the bug, when same colors didn't flashed. Changed the platform - now it is a mobile game and I will continue making it mobile. Presented that version on White Nights Conference in Moscow, got a lot of useful feedback and understood, how I can significantly upgrade the game. The main focus will stay the same, but I will change game mechanics to a simplier one.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/653/6538c3c012e511baf9e80812929d20ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gordost"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
