Obviously things are not that simple, so our hero winds up in a mess and needs to fight for his life. Who does an Orc fight though? Knights and archers, of course!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis game swaps the traditional rolls of games. Instead of playing the knight in shining armor who is attacking the orcish horde, you are playing a loan warrior from the Orcish horde who is attacking an army of knights and archers. Why are you doing this and where are all of these soldiers from the land of men coming from? You will have to play to find out!\r\n</p>\r\nUpdate Guarantee \r\n<p>\r\n\tWith the purchase of this game, you are getting access to life time updates.
