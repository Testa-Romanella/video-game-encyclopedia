Release the left click to drop it. You must drop the frog in the lake corresponding to its color.\r\n</p>\r\nTrijam\r\n<p>This game was made for the\u00a0Trijam #150. The theme was\u00a0<strong>Grouping</strong>. There was a 3 hour limit to play games but I went over and it took me a little over 3 hours to make.\u00a0</p>\r\nIdea\r\n<p>I was inspired by a mini game in a mario game where you have to sort the bombs before they explode. You must group the frogs in the body corresponding to their color\r\n</p>\r\nArt\r\n<p>I used the\u00a0Tiny Bundle\u00a0pack made by\u00a0Vryell. All the visuals were taken in this pack. No art were made during the game jam. Go take a look at\u00a0Vryell's\u00a0work it's amazing!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T04:42:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b3/5b3b9f3c8470d34caaa59ddcfe9b3531.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LouShunt"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
