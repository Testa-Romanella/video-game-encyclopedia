You get 5!)</li><li><strong>Hard mode</strong> (play it with the lowest number of cells possible. Still 100%\u00a0beatable)</li><li><strong>Highlight lowest cards</strong> (option in menu)</li><li><strong>Highlight next highest cards on drag</strong> (option in menu)</li><li><strong>Dim unmovable cards</strong> (option in menu)</li><li><strong>Path to 32,000</strong>: relive the wild west of the 90s, when people didn't know whether all 32,000 Microsoft deals were solvable. They weren't, but now they are! Play each deal in order.</li></ul>\n<p>Along with that, it has all the common sense features every FreeCell game should have:</p>\n<ul><li>Automatically move safe cards to foundation (option in menu)</li><li>Hints</li><li>Undos</li><li>Tap to move (or select to move, or drag only)</li><li>Drag to move</li><li>Stats!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T06:39:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26c/26ced87dec0da1c4704bb319e033f544.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kevin Hutchins"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
