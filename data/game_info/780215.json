The player will have to navigate through multiple terrains with one being a forested area, walking between trees, going up hills, and jumping over dangerous gaps. There is also a level that takes place in a city and the final level takes place in a castle. The game will focus heavily on platforming with a secondary focus on movement and exploration. Players may need to backtrack to find coins or move blocks into place to advance. Shortcuts and special collectibles will also be hidden around the levels to encourage exploration.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong></p>\n\n<p>A first-person, 3D platformer with collectibles, multiple levels, and score. High emphasis on movement. The player has a total of 3 lives and can collects gold coins for 200 points and silver coins for 100.\u00a0At the end of each level there is a golden jewel that serves as a bank to store your coins and move on the next level. You must obtain at least ten coins to move on to the next level.</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>WASD for movement\r\n</li><li>Space for jump\r\n</li><li>Mouse to move the camera around\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Collectibles/Powerups:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Power-Ups and Coins can be picked up just by running over them</li><li>Press E while touching the Coin Bank to use it</li><li>Examples:\r\n</li><ul><li>Glide: Hold the space bar\r\n</li><li>Grapple Hook: Left-Click\r\n</li><li>Climb: Right-Click\r\n</li></ul></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Post-Mortem</strong></p>\n\n<p>What went right?</p>\n<p>Everyone was participating and fulfilling their assigned roles and tasks well and worked hard on them, while we did have a rough start, our group managed to turn stuff around pretty well in the later half of the project.\r\n</p>\n<p>What went wrong?</p>\n<p>Major communication issues within the team at the beginning, and GitHub issues since we were inexperienced with using it. Lots of coding being overwritten and having to redo a lot of components multiple times.</p>\n<p>How did you overcome those problems?\r\n</p>\n<p>For GitHub, we met with the TA in their office hours to fix our repository. We solved our communication issues by holding meetings to assign tasks to one another so everyone knew what they had to get done.\r\n</p>\n<p>What changes were made and why?\r\n</p>\n<p>Went from a linear platformer to a more open exploration and coin collecting platformer. This was due to the way the levels were designed, made the game feel a little more exploration based then we had initially intended.\u00a0Changed one of our core movement mechanics from double jump to a glide because it fit the styles of the levels more. Decided to not include any puzzles into the game because there was not enough time.</p>\n<p>What did we learn?</p>\n<p>Communication and creating a team early is very important, since our team was randomized late, it made it hard to get a hold of all the random teammates in the limited time we had. Meetings being held are not only important for communication, but they also help understand the role that everyone has within the group.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T09:33:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d6/5d676f8232133dde5f7acf39fc99937d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["CurlyFriesCA"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
