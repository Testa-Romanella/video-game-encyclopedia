The players are free to explore the open world or just complete the missions. There are several game modes in Crash Time 2: a plain race, a pursuit, escort, shadowing, and navigation. The game&#39;s story is divided into 5 distinct cases with 10 missions to complete in each. The game features three difficulty modes which affect the amount of damage that can be taken by the player&#39;s vehicle. </p>\n<p>The developers put a heavy emphasis on the vehicle damage model and slow-motion effects that are present in the game. An overhead map was featured in the game for the first time in the series.</p>\n<p>Before the release of the game, developers advertised a feature where the players can drive out to a plain field and run into cows, which will plow into T-Bone steaks in a cartoony fashion.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-12T08:21:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/358/358ff8862f5896fc991a493ee6406d81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.32, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 63, "owned": 1658, "beaten": 19, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 46}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 110, "suggestions_count": 491, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 110, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RTL interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Meridian4", "Immanitas Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
