You had no idea what this project was all about, but you certainly didn't sign up for a total overrun of the facilities by alien looking monstrosities.</p>\n<p>Looks like you're doing overtime today. Grab your trusty knife and your standard issue SMG and send these abominations back to hell where they belong.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>EXTRANE\u00dcM is a brutal, fast-paced old-school first person shooter with an emphasis on exploration and secret hunting. Shoot monsters and find upgrades as you progress through the laboratories of Project EXTRANE\u00dcM in search for the truth... and a way to put an end to it all.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>This game is currently in development, but a free alpha demo is already available for download, which includes most of the features that will appear in the final game.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to see more, please consider donating- even a dollar can go a long way in keeping me afloat while I finish the game! :)</p>\n<p>Leave a comment and rate the game if you enjoyed it.
