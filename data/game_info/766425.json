This game uses original pixel art, animations, sound effects and music that was created solely for this game jam within the timeframe. However, there are a few temporary assets in the game that are borrowed from an asset store that we were not able to replace in time. We intended to keep the game as close to the theme as possible with the \u201cinevitable\u201d aspect being that Sparkboy ceases to exist whether he wins or loses. We hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T16:16:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d07/d0768cb93427bc2decc4707dff6de7dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FALLENxGaLaXie5"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
