We all had about 6-7 hours to develop our games. It was great!</p>\n\n<p>The theme was \"Break the Mechanic\".</p>\n<p>The first thought that popped into MissPi's head was the Street Fighter II bonus stage of breaking the car. We thought of throwing a mechanic as an opponent (a second player), trying to fix the car as it is being destroyed. Someone at the jam suggested we should use Dance Dance Revolution as the fighting mechanic, and that's exactly what we have here.<br/></p>\n<p>Also, there is a little secret to be found.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>ParanoidBigfoot - Programming</p>\n<p>Miss Pi - Idea, Producer, Art Gathering</p>\n<p>Eitan Medina\u00a0- Audio<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T12:09:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc8/fc83f6fec469ce590c9e77a403b5ea24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Miss Pi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
