{"id": 216231, "slug": "homos-save-the-world", "name": "Homos Save the World", "name_original": "Homos Save the World", "description": "<p>The world population is growing rapidly, and our little lovely planet is running out of space! All this disaster is due to those heterosexual people who have strong sexual desires, as they have born a lot of children that make our world so crowded!</p>\n<p>Therefore, to solve this population crisis we need to control the birth rate, and we can achieve this goal by highly (or even forcefully) promoting homosexuality and reducing as much as possible the number of heterosexuals, which is essentially what you would do in this game.</p>\n<p>In this game, you are endowed with the power of changing people\u2019s genders, and your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to make people\u2019s genders as unified as possible. You can choose to make our planet either a gay planet or a lesbian one. Once you manage to make all people in the world have the same gender, everybody would be forced to be homosexual and no one would be able to bear more children to deteriorate the population issue any more.</p>\n<p>Now come to try my game and use your gender transformation ability to prevent our world from running out of space!</p>\n\r\nOperation Instructions and Guide\r\n<p>* Press W and S Keys to move forward and backward.<br/>* Press D and A Keys to move rightward and leftward.<br/>* Move Mouse for Yaw and Pitch rotation, which help you aim at people.\u00a0<br/>* Press Left Mouse Button to change the aimed person's gender.<br/>* Press F1 and F2 Keys to trigger skills.<br/>* Press ESC Key to quit the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill 1 - Condom Giveaway:</strong> Give away condoms to every man and prevent any couple from producing children for a while.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill 2 - One-Child Policy:</strong> Implement the One-Child Policy so that every couple can only produce one child for a while.</p>\n<p><strong>Winning Condition:</strong> All people on the planet get the same gender and they begin their happy homosexual lives ever after.</p>\n<p><strong>Losing Condition:</strong> The population reaches the maximum and the planet becomes out of space.</p>\n\r\nTips:\r\n<p>1. \"Condom Giveaway\" can buy you some time while \"One-Child Policy\" can reduce the population. You'd better use them as often as you can but you shouldn't use them at the same time.</p>\n<p>2. The start of the game is crucial. You'd better apply \"One-Child Policy\" before the first \"baby boom\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6b/f6bd7f7df7cf0b1db554869b2562050d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["atom0520"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
