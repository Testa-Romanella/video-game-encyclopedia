I learned so much during the jam. I had to constantly cut Ideas I had and make new solutions to certain problems (that I'm sure there are better ways to solve). I was feeling burned out towards the end trying to make the file and project as small and compact and understandable as possible.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Lessons to take away</p>\n<ul><li>Use what you know not what you want to learn.\u00a0</li><li>learn to make asset packs for I'm not copying and pasting. That inflates the files size.\u00a0</li><li>Think small like 1 player, 1 boss, 1 level starting out.</li><li>focus on an emotion and take away between the\u00a01\u00a0player, 1 boss, 1\u00a0level.</li><li>Make the replay fun with dynamic elements such as time or ranking because after a while it was tiring playtesting the single level over and over.\u00a0</li></ul>\n\n<p>Licenses:</p>\n<p>Cold Funk by Kevin MacLeod\r\n</p>\n<p>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3522-cold-funk\r\n</p>\n<p>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>\n<p>\"Angel Share\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\r\n</p>\n<p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License\r\n</p>\n<p>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p>\"Exotic Battle\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\r\n</p>\n<p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License\r\n</p>\n<p>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T03:50:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2d/c2d2f193ca76b5e3b989cb1e6ef08eda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Treven"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
