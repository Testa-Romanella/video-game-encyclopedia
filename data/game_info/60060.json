Sai-Corp developed new weapons that'll soon phase you out. And then what? Do they throw you away? Do they keep you as an experiment? No, don't let them choose for you like they always have. It's time to stand against Sai-Corp and earn the freedom they stole from you. <br/><br/>Pandora is a third-person action-adventure hack n slash game that combines teleportation and combat abilities. Take on the role of Phase, a cyber-enhanced super-soldier detained by their creator, Sai-Corp. Escape the orbital testing facility and earn the freedom they stole from you long ago. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Fluid Movement: Use Phase\u2019s training and cyber-teleportation abilities to experience an engaging move set. A merge of basic and complex movement abilities that give you options when avoiding attacks from enemies or when traversing the broken facility.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Advanced Combat: Building on the fluid movement, the game gives Phase his favorite weapons, a katana, and his teleportation dagger. Combine Phase\u2019s move set with his sword-slashing abilities to defeat anyone trying to stop you. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Enticing Environment: Utilize the different abilities while traversing the destroyed Sai-Corp Orbital Testing Facility and discover the environment that imprisoned Phase for so long.<br/><br/><br/><strong>development Team: </strong><br/>Ben Dookram - Sound Designer<br/>Hamzah Kashmiri - Programmer<br/>Kevin Kulendran - UX/UI Designer<br/>Hayder Mahamood - 3D Artist/Co-Manager<br/>John Muia - Project Manager<br/>Thomas Soares - Level Designer<br/><br/><strong>Music Team:</strong><br/>Anthony Kubelka - Composer<br/>Jake Robertson - SFX Artist<br/>Harris the First - Voice Coordinator<br/>Yiyang Zhou - Music Coordinator<br/><br/><strong>VA Team:</strong><br/>Atlin Hofer - Voice of Phase / Co-Scriptwriter", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-18T04:24:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5c/b5c5fbab9f967a9c1222eb13b6a47de1.jpg", "website": "https://www.pandorathevideogame.co.uk", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 340, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Party Llama Games", "hurakan", "Sucurema", "Sunset Script", "Hamzah Kashmiri", "Kevin Kulendran", "John Muia", "Thomas Soares", "Ben Dookram", "Hayder Mahmood"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Party Llama Games", "hurakan", "Sucurema", "Sunset Script", "SixGuys"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
