It's called Urgon The Demon Within and this Ren'py visual novel is a short story about a demon called Urgon that tries to keep the player in his void to extract fear from the player. This fear is needed to sustain the existence of Hell.</p>\n<p>Since this game was just a learning experience, I use a bunch of assets that are not mine. So I will just credit what I use in here:</p>\n<p>- The street music is the \"Play with me\" song from Doki Doki.</p>\n<p>- The void music is the main menu music from UCN.</p>\n<p>- Urgon 's avatar was created on a website called \"Picrew.me\"</p>\n<p>- And the sounds Urgon makes when he speaks was Midas from Fortnite slowed down (no joke!)</p>\n<p>Also there are four endings! Try to get them all!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T05:30:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/722/722da55e0a4cafb4825cbca67344f0cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Emricx"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
