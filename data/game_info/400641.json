It's a warm, \"ho ho ho!\" kind of laugh. You walk outside of your cabin and notice there's presents scattered everywhere. Someone wishes you happy holidays!</em><br/></p>\n<p>Holiday Present Hunt is a small game where you walk around a wintery forest, looking for presents. You have to collect 15 presents to win the game.</p>\n<p>Present spawns are always random so if you want to play again, the experience should be slightly different!</p>\n<p>Keys:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD: Movement</li><li>Space: Jump</li><li>Mouse: Look around</li></ul>\n<p>Presents are picked up by simply walking into them.</p>\n<p>Have fun!<br/></p>\n<p>I made this game for fun in about a day. I just wanted to create something simple for people to play while waiting for holidays. :) Consider it as a little holiday gift!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T20:10:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2cf/2cfda2d89491fdb79c4f6a6b12ed0977.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Akselmo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
