I'm developing this prototype in my free time.</p>\n<p>With this prototype I'm trying to achieve 2D sprites affected by 3D lights in a 3D world and trying to mix both worlds. My idea is to do all the characters in 2D while the enviroment\u00a0is in 3D.</p>\n<p>The demo is just 1 level with some basic mechanics and 5 different enemies.\u00a0If you wanna try it I would appreciate any kind of feedback\u00a0so I can keep developing it and make sure I'm in the right direction.</p>\n<p>All the sprites found in the demo are from itch.io and I don't own them in any way,\u00a0shape or form, this is just a prototype to test the idea, so thank you to all the awesome artists of itch.io that publish those masterpieces for free! Big thanks :)</p>\n<p>You can use mouse/keyboard or any type of controller to play.</p>\n<p>Follow me on Instagram @onetradegames to see almost daily updates.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your time!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T03:11:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4be/4be317f3baef2091c05f877c57523e3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OneTradeGames"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
