But don't think it will be easy just because you are the <strong>Iloopnati</strong>!</p>\n<p>------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Game Jam notes:</strong></p>\n<p>- I wasn't able to implement some game feel in the game, if I continue to work in this game in the future it will be the first thing I will do!</p>\n<p>- Until making the levels I wasn't very sure if the game mechanic was good that is why there isn't much more elements to interact with. This is one of things in the \"to do list\" if I keep working in this project.</p>\n<p>- The art was my favorite part of this jam, absolutely! I loved the limitation, I made very very simple art for every thing, using only 3 sprites per animation, but I really loved the result.</p>\n<p>- Even with some points of \"things that I would do if I keep working on it\" I think the best part of this jam was the challenge element, I love to create platformers, so I create some twists in the code (like the loop itself) that made my life a code chaos this week, but was a real good learning, and even if I not come back to work on this game (which is probably what is gonna happen) is 100% sure that I'm gonna use everything that I learned here in my future projects.</p>\n<p>- I really liked this Jam, and hope all of you appreciate the game :)</p>\n<p>------------------------------\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Softwares used:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Engine: Unity\r\n</p>\n<p>Coding: Visual Studio (C#)\r\n</p>\n<p>Art: Procreate, Photoshop, illustrator</p>\n<p>Music: Garage Band for Ipad (using apple loops)</p>\n<p>Font: Iloopfont (made using\u00a0Calligraphr and\u00a0Procreate)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T16:06:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d62/d62f4c34357aec275c7b815948499606.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Bruno Gat Car"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
