It's extremely challenging if you love the challenge. First 10 people to finish the game and send a screenshot will be included in the game extras as a bonus.<br/><br/>This project took me awhile and i'd love to share it with everyone.\u00a0 Made with Unreal Engine 4. I've shared the beta version with my friends and they had a blast playing it. I know you will too.</p>\n<p>if you have any questions feel free to contact me @ brandonbishopcontact@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-06T03:07:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82c/82c493a11baa3da7034ff7f23a08295b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brandon Bishop"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
