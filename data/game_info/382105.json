Thanks!</strong></p>\n\n\n<p>Welcome to \"Slimy Dungeon\"!</p>\n<p>(Ludum\u00a0Dare 45 Entry by dodori &amp; DC_Thunder)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Slimy Dungeon</strong> was made in 72 hours for the Ludum\u00a0Dare 45 Game Jam.<br/>All the art, sounds and code were made by us.</p>\n<p><strong>Story</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You are a small slime, outcast by your slime family.\u00a0On the search for a new place to live, you find a dungeon guarded by Rock Crabs.<br/></p>\n<p>You make it your goal to explore the WHOLE dungeon, in hopes of finding new cool things to keep, to replace the belongings-shaped hole in your slimy heart, caused by leaving all your belongings at home.</p>\n<p>(Too bad the dungeon is endless!)</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>WASD </strong>or <strong>ARROW KEYS</strong> to move.<br/>Aim with your mouse, and <strong>LEFT CLICK or LEFT-CTRL\u00a0</strong>to shoot!</p>\n<p>You could <em>technically\u00a0</em>use a controller for the movement, but none of us had a working controller at hand, so we didn't implement the shooting mechanic for it. (Sorry :/)</p>\n<p>The dungeon is\u00a0generated at runtime, and items drop randomly. Feel free to share your highest floor scores, or test out how the items stack!</p>\n\n<p>This is both mine and DC_Thunder's very first Ludum Dare Entry, and of course we had to choose a Randomly-Generated Rogue Like... Sorry for the spare item and enemy variety.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T08:47:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfb/dfbc4c7b432eec00c23149a9247ca941.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dodori"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
