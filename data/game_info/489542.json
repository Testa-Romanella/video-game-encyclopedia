That being said, if there are a few downloads and comments then you can expect to see things along the line of big fixes, new content such as maps, obstacles and so on, and even a fully developed game, provided Urban Flirbin gets enough attention here on itch.io. You can also expect a browser and mobile port under the fact Urban Flirbin does well enough to see a budget. Until then, feel free to comment any ideas you want to see and critique the game!
