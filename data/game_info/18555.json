You will have to ensure that they have a constant supply of oxygen, food and water to stay alive.<br />\nYou will get them to collect energy, extract water, mine metal, grow food, manufacture bots, and build a fully self-sufficient base in a harsh environment, where you are always one step away from total failure.<br />\nEven if the game is not intended to be a simulator, all the mechanics are plausible, and based on what the expected challenges of establishing a colony in an new planet would be.Features:<br />\nFour different planets with different conditions and increasing difficulty.<br />\nHarness solar and wind energy (if available) in order to power the base&#39;s structures.<br />\nGrow hydroponic Vegetables and synthesize Vitromeat to feed your population.<br />\nMine and produce raw resources, process them, manufacture goods, and establish a production chain.<br />\nCarefully manage the colonist immigration flow to ensure you have the people with the right skills.<br />\nSurvive disasters like meteors, sandstorms or solar flares and defend your base from intruders.<br />\nMechanize your base by creating your own bots that will help with the more arduous tasks.<br />\nGrow your colony from a few initial pioneers to a vibrant planetbase with hundreds of colonists.</p>", "metacritic": 70, "released": "2015-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-15T23:53:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/617/617a8ba98a12763772ad6abac8deb57a.jpg", "website": "http://planetbase.madrugaworks.com", "rating": 3.35, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 15, "owned": 315, "beaten": 13, "toplay": 9, "dropped": 25, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 91, "ratings_count": 48, "suggestions_count": 461, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 48, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "macOS", "PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["Madruga Works"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Madruga Works"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
