The Danganronpa series is owned by Spike Chunsoft. Please support the official release.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Virgin Krzak Adventures - The Quest for Jelly Beans</strong><strong>\n<br/></strong><strong>an Ougoku RPG Maker Fangame</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>~ Story\r\n~</strong><br/>Gonta is woken up in his lab by Kokichi, who's yelling about jelly beans, which are in the gym, and that they need to go get them NOW. The school building they find themselves in seems largely the same as they remember it... not accounting for all the smartly dressed horses and supersized ladybugs running around. Also, what is Angie trying to do with all of those wooden frames? Why is Kaito running around the basement like a madman? Why is there a blue-haired kid in Himiko's lab asking for a bagel? And most of all, why is Shuichi crying?\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>~ About ~</strong>\n<br/>This was supposed to be a 20-minute long parody project for me and my friends made just for laughs, based on some dreams we had. It somehow expanded into 25k words of script that I ended up writing and coding around the span of 5 months, involving not only lots of cracky humor, but also referencing the plot of V3, essentially becoming a continuation of sorts...\r\n</p>\n<p>...with Gonta and Kokichi in the middle of it all.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game has a focus on Ougoku (Kokichi/Gonta), but it also has multiple side pairings, like Saimatsu (Shuichi/Kaede) and Harukaito (Maki/Kaito). The whole V3 cast appears in this game, as well as two characters from SDR2, and another two from UDG.\r\n</p>\n<p>There are major spoilers for Danganronpa V3 and Ultra Despair Girls.\r\n</p>\n<p>Estimated rating: 16+ for strong language and suggestive themes.\r\n<br/>Miu's in this game. That should say enough.\r\n</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that there may be bugs in this game, as it's been scarcely beta-tested despite its scope. If you spot a character somewhere, it's better to talk to them before wandering off somewhere ahead of the designated route. Be sure to save frequently just in case.\r\n</p>\n<p>PS. This game contains a very minuscule (like 0,5%) amount of Polish language. Just Google Translate it.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T06:40:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/567/567749e4abcdbc76f264e706ece1b917.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 272, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JellyBeanBagel"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
