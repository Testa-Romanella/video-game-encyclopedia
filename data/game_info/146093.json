Take your time and calculate \r\nyour jumps.</p><p>This game was created as my final (solo) project for my bachelor's in Design and Multimedia Communication, at ESAP in Porto, Portugal.<br/>\r\nI started out this project knowing close to nothing regarding practical \r\ngame programming knowledge. A lot of theoretical knowledge from years \r\nand years of playing and studying games, but nothing else. While I'm \r\ncontent with the result, even if I would still like to fix some issues \r\nhere and there, I've already spent way to much hours and brain cells \r\nthan I probably should on this, and its time to move on to new ventures.<br/>\r\nFrom the start it was meant to be a very short, condensed experience \r\nthat one could finish in minutes, so I could not only be able to finish \r\non the time frame it was given, but also to be more easily digestible \r\nfor the player. This will probably take 5 minutes of your day, more or \r\nless.</p><p>A huge thank you to all my family and friends that helped me from \r\nstart to end, as well as the users over at Kotaku, Penny Arcade and \r\nFlixel forums.\r\nAlso a big thanks to Flixel, Photon Storm, DAME, and FlashDevelop for \r\nproviding great free software and documentation.</p><p>Thanks for playing!</p><p>(Originally posted on NEWGROUNDS.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:28:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/429/429c71dede8250b0f3632e7abf839198.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gazp"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
