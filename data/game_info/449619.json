Inspired by several arcade classics the game features a unique low poly art style.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>\n<p>I am a conviced arcade fan, i like the kind of game where you can directly jump into and addictively play them again and again trying to crush the leaders highscore. I also really like the simpe low poly art style which perfectly matches for arcade games. Unfortunately these kind of games are not very widely published these days. I am working on an arcade style physics engine for several years now in my spare time and feeling ready to use it in an arcade game.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Custom physics engine designed for simple controlling scheme (no drift buttons) but still challenging gameplay.</li><li>Low Poly Arcade Style</li></ul>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Upcoming Features</strong></p>\n<p>- Online Leaderboard (SteamWorks Integration)</p>\n<p>- Multiplayer Mode</p>\n<p>- MODs ...</p>\n<p><strong>MODS (Upcoming)</strong></p>\n<p>I am currently working on a way to enable Mods. My goal is to build a community-space\u00a0 with an endless growing number of levels.\u00a0 This means that players will be able to build custom levels within the Unity-Editor\u00a0- with all the freedom that comes with it (due the construct of exportable Asset Bundles - which may be loaded at runtime from the game).\u00a0</p>\n<p>I am also working on a mod starter set to ease the level building. In short word this is the way i built the first level:</p>\n<p>- Building the road by modelling a spline</p>\n<p>- Procedural\u00a0terrain forming along road (flattening the road)</p>\n<p>- Procedural terrain painting on road area</p>\n<p>- Procedural aligning of obstacle objects along the road</p>\n<p>- Procedural generation of trees and grass on non-road terrain locations</p>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-01T03:50:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/728/728ebf9626524d3abb8143b5036442c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 299, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bernhard534"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
