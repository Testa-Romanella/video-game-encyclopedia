I was inspired by domino tiles so my mind went immediatly to the beautiful Playstation game \"<em>No One Can Stop Mr. Domino!</em>\" and the cute domino tiles design. I also imagined how their houses would look and for the first time I drew the map outside of Bitsy with Pixelorama which was a huge step for me. It's game very similar to who ate all the fish in which you just explore a small \"jrpg\" town and get to know all the various NPCs.\u00a0</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Music by Wandering Artist (me) (soon available on my bandcamp)<br/>Additional text by Daizo and Gardiz<br/>Testing and logic consultant OctaviaPone</p>\n<p>Art was made with Pixelorama and implemented to bitsy via Pixsy by Ruin<br/>Music added with Bitsymuse hack by David Mowatt<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T16:47:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c22/c22a2057e1aac81db25374fd1876410b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wandering Artist"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
