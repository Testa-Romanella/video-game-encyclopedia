Probably the people who know about Unity won't be surprised, or maybe none will be surprised, I don't know. But that is my intention. The game is not complex: you will appear in a zone and the only thing you can do is to walk while you listen to the music. As simple as that.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>If I have to ask you for something...</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tI would like that if you felt something with this game you write it in comments. I don't mean if you liked or not, if you are going to comment saying this game is too simple, well, that's the intention. The idea is to make people feel things with the music while they walk in the maps. If you felt something, please add it in comments, that would mean a lot for me :)\r\n\t\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Buy the Soundtrack</strong><br/>\n</p><p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a40/a40c0c849536804fa30d0b3325af7744.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fegefeueranilmathiel"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
