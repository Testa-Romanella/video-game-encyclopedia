Welcome to my game for the GMTK Game Jam 2021!</p><p>The theme was \"Joined Together\", so this game is about a small human boy and his fire sprite friend, joined together in their quest to get back home safely, despite being lost... out in the cold.<br/>The game was inspired by the fact that I\u00a0got my second dose of the Covid vaccine the day before the jam started, so when the theme was announced, and I was trying to come up with ideas, I was feeling heavy symptoms of a fever. I\u00a0felt like I was melting and freezing at the same time, and that inspired this game about a fire sprite in the middle of a snowstorm.<br/>I wasn't sure I\u00a0was going to be able to complete the project with those symptoms, but I managed to pull it together, somehow!<br/><br/>Also, all the art is completely made by myself (even the sound icon, heh), and was made during the jam. The music (the two tracks) were also made during the jam. The only thing not made during the jam were a couple of sound effects!\u00a0<br/><br/>Sorry for no HTML5 upload to play in browser, but doing that absolutely ruins the music and sound effects (and also messed with the particles, thanks Godot!) - so I felt like the best choice was to make this a downloadable only game.<br/><br/>I really loved making this game, and I'm really proud of it. I hope you have a good time with it as well! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T12:48:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb2/cb2dc179cb57d0e91ab7d4a6b7d5c61f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Shovel"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
