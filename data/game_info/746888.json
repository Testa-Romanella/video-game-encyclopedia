{"id": 746888, "slug": "ishskwaday-state-park", "name": "Ishskwaday State Park", "name_original": "Ishskwaday State Park", "description": "A submission for \"Brackeys Game Jam 2022.1\" made with Bitsy\r\n\r\nContent Warning: Occasional moments of cosmic/cryptid related horror\r\nControls: WASD or Arrow Keys\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Pitch:</em></strong>\n<p>You're Reginald, a fancy cat with a tendency for going where he shouldn't\u00a0in the famous Ishskwaday State Park, in Little Rock, Michigan. Everytime it storms you sneak out past Mama, to head into the woods, past the RV park, Bee\u00a0Exhibits and Redwood Cabins, to find Meriwether, a local cryptid quietly known by few as, \"The Mothwoman\". Tonight is just like any other night out exploring, except something or someone is watching, always watching.. Will you find it or will it find you?\r\n</p>\n<em>Light hearted for the most part with some spookier elements sprinkled into this narrative heavy, exploration and puzzle-lite adventure prequal to\u00a0Little Rock,\u00a0MI.</em>\n<p>So go ahead and take a shot at it, this was an absolute blast and labor of love and I know I came into this 7-day jam 2.5 days late but it's been well worth the journey.\u00a0<br/></p>\r\n\"I wanted you to know, that I love you.\"\r\n\n<p>Fun fact if you made it this far: 5\u00a0(Closed at 6am EST)\u00a0hours before the deadline closed, my tire popped on the road back home and (no joke) a car went flying and barreling over a curb right at me at a local gas station\u00a0as I was attempting to change the tire (Thank god it didn't hit me or my car but it was within feet of me, I was still stepping over debris). So consider the dedication of me calling for help with the words, \"My car is fucked but I spent way too much time on this game jam just to not upload it in time. Please pick me up, I love you.\" as a totally reasonable thing to say to a friend whilst in need. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3</p>\n<em>The Developers:</em>\n<p><em>Ashley Weymers\u00a0~ art, design, music &amp; writing</em></p>\n<p>Special thanks to Overnight! by Exhausted Boi Studios for the heavy inspiration of how to implement a menu/help menu into a bitsy game!
