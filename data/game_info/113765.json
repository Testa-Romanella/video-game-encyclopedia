All that stands between you and freedom is hordes of renegade robots.  With no pistol or shotgun in sight, you pick up a welding gun off the factory floor.  Time for some robots to meet their maker!\r\n</p>Robokiller has the following awesome features:<ul>\n<li>Fun, fast-paced drawing action!</li>\n<li>Numerous challenging puzzles!</li>\n<li>Each enemy has a unique weakness for you to discover!</li>\n<li>Over 7 unique environments: factory, office, ice, foundry, and more!</li><li>Large, sprawling levels!</li>\n<li>Awesome retro soundtrack!</li>\n<li>Short but sweet experience (~70-90 minutes) - won't waste your time with dozens of repetitive levels, something new around every corner</li>\n<li>Not a \"episode one\" or \"early access\" - just a short game with a satisfying beginning, middle and end!</li>\n<li>Secrets, including a whole secret level!</li>\n<li>Built-in automap saves you from getting lost</li>\n<li>Pure old-school software renderer built from scratch - no OpenGL or DirectX used here!</li>\n</ul>A few notes on System Requirements:<ul>\n<li>Robokiller does not need a good graphics card, but it does need a decent CPU for best performance.</li>\n<li>Playing this with a trackpad may make the game harder; I recommend using a real mouse if you have one.  If you use a trackpad the \"classic\" control scheme may work better for your than the default \"modern\" one.</li>\n<li>I have tested this on Windows (7 &amp; 10), Mac (OS X Yosemite), and Linux (Fedora 22 x64) systems.  I believe it should work just fine on other 64-bit Linux distros, and slightly older versions of Windows and Mac OS.  I currently do not have access to a 32-bit Linux machine to test on, but other users have confirmed this version works fine. </li>\n</ul><p>\n<em>Epilepsy Warning:  Certain sections of the game contain rapidly flashing lights.</em>\n</p><p>\r\n\tCurrent version: 1.020</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e40/e4044177e4230b9373a15057984d3eac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["2point5D"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
