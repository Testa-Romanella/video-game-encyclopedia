This project is a school project given by e-artsup. The subject was to build a platformer from scratch on Construct 3 in 2 months.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>We decided to create a project that can represent our skills in game creation. Kevin was mostly on the Game Art aspect and Tim\u00e9o on Narrative Design, Game Design and Game Development.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Because it\u2019s impossible to create an entire game in only 2 months, we had to use references and sometimes make difficult decisions. All the stuff used here is not free to use. We know... But this project is still a school project. We'll never sell it or anything else. It\u2019s a demonstration made by students, not a commercial use.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Thank you for your comprehension.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-28T04:32:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe8/fe884a21f01e528986a2c78c1b2126cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kevin Coutand"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
