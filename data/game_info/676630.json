The price of the beer changes every 5 seconds. Don't hesitate to rip the patrons off with high prices, this is a business after all.</p>\n<p>But be careful. If they wait for a long time, they will leave the bar. Or they can do worse than leaving the bar.</p>\n<p>You are fired if no patron is left. Also, we have only 10 glasses of beer, so don't serve beers when they are cheap.</p>\n<p>Good luck! This is a work of luck. <br/></p><p><strong>The Windows build is the post-jam version.
