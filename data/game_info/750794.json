You must switch between the two robots to stay alive.</p>\n<p>Made for Trijam 159 in 3 hours &amp; 10 minutes. This is the second game jam I have participated in. I exceeded the 3 hour time limit for the jam by 10 minutes due to overscoping for the very short time frame.</p>\n<p>All of the assets (Code, Art, Sound) were made by me during the jam.<br/>I used the Metallic\u00a0GB pallette from Lospec for all of the art.</p>\r\nControls + How To Play\r\n<p>You can only control either Boxy or Fishie at a time<br/> Press <strong>F</strong> to switch between them<br/>Control them using\u00a0<strong>WASD</strong>Aim at the enemy robots with a\u00a0<strong>Mouse</strong> and use\u00a0<strong>Left Click</strong> to fire<br/>Boxy and Fishie share health, but will slowly regenerate it over time<br/>Enemies only attack whichever robot is deactivated</p>\r\nNote\r\n<p>The balancing of the game may be a bit off (either too hard or too easy) since I've never made a game like this and it was made in such a short timespan. There are probably also a load of bugs and glitches for the same reason.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T05:08:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc9/dc92af5e18fd5f038ed04a7dd853aca4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dindotjs"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
