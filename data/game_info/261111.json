Now you are being punished for it by being trapped within space and time itself. Time is frozen and your job is to fix it and return it to normal. To do this you must complete trials by traveling between multiple similar worlds to show your worth and satisfy the god of space and time. Whilst playing the game the npc god of space and time, Derrek will explain most of this. Our game is also based of the many worlds interpretation which states that for there are infinite timelines and infinite possibilities, not just one history. With this idea we take two very similar worlds and give you the ability to travel between the worlds to solve puzzles and complete trials</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/996/996266c4a48305293bb3d17b1282a60c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dannypoke03"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
