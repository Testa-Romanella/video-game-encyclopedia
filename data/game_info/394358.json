You have built done your best to build a space worthy fighter (inspired by human films Mouse archaelogists found) out of scrap the Cats left behind when they started to colonize the Stars. The Space Cats arrive in their grotesque landing crafts, giddy with anticipation for the moment the giant metal jaws open up, letting them spill forth and decimate the defenseless Mice.\u00a0<br/>But not this time, you say as you grab the controls and head towards certain death, hoping to bloody the Space Cats' nose sufficiently so they reconsider their Harvest schedule.</p>\n<p>You steer with the left and right analogue sticks, boost with the left trigger, shoot with the right trigger and you can switch camera by pressing the (Y) button on the gamepad.</p>\n<p>Left Stick: Pitch(inverted)/Yaw<br/>Right Stick: Throttle/Roll<br/>Left Trigger: Boost<br/>Right Trigger: Shoot<br/>(Y): Switch Camera<br/></p><p>Alt+F4 to quit\u00a0(sorry, no time for menu)</p>\n<p>You lose if a transport comes through, or if you are hit too often. Luckily destroying transports alleviates both these concerns as dead Space Cats can't get down to earth and instead get broken down to nanites to heal your ship (not pictured).</p>\n<p>There is no \"win\" state in the game, the waves (should) be endless. This could be adressed with more time probably (a saving Cosmic Dog fleet come to mind).</p>\n<p>I had a lot of fun with this second \"serious\" Unreal project, the engine keeps on getting more and more powerful (judging by my limited view of it).\u00a0<br/>Michael Klenk (c) 2019</p>\n<p>All assets were either created by me during the jam or taken from the \"Starter Content\" in the \"Flying Blueprint\" project folder (for example I used a lamp texture as the console inside the ship). Sadly this time I had no time left for making my own music. I imagine it would work well with the soundtrack of a certain saga of warring stars.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-25T05:40:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4d/e4dbbd8a271339c959cfb0a9073cf160.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mklenk"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
