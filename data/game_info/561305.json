Slimes can be moved around the level to move boxes and pressure plates. You can merge slimes together to make them stronger.\u00a0Only stronger slimes can push large crates and use large pressure plates, but you will need to split your slimes to fit through small gaps. Each puzzle will give you a score when completed based on how many actions you used to solve the puzzle and how long it took you to solve it.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T05:39:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5a/e5a9847afd527f20db05e563c4f189e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Eric Sexton", "Joshua Hovis", "BigSpence", "Jamac"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
