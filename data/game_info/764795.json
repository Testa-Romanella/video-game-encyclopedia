After you have tried the game, please take some time to fill out the feedback forms below ;)</p>\n\n<p>Army's Heaven is an online multiplayer first-person shooter, where the player can participate in online matches with up to 8 players. The goal is to kill every enemy on sight and try to either reach the target kill or keep the first position on the leaderboard until the time is over. The guns available are the rifle, handgun, and a small knife. The guns have their own spray while shooting without aiming, so don't hold the trigger too much!</p>\n<p>You will also be able to test the multiple guns in a single player shooting range. The player can initiate a countdown which will spawn targets (dummies) one after another. Try to get the best score and remember, accuracy is key!</p>\n\n<p>//Google forms:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Feedback Form:\u00a0\u00a0https://forms.gle/rbEXhoMgsYxonHGKA</p>\n<p>Bug Report:\u00a0https://forms.gle/QwMepUT5eKa4dvj57</p>\n<p>Polish Ideas:\u00a0https://forms.gle/LmHfiCyXvzgiK7Cg6<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-05T09:17:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e30/e30c46b6d60c117fa3272484bf5b49af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SalvG"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
