(For the RemakeJam 2)", "description": "<p>Story: During your shopping spree, you had to run to the bathroom to take a \r\nmassive dump. But little did you know, that by the time you were done, \r\nit would be midnight and that means, closing time. Now the powers gone off and the whole store has turned alive, even the new hot selling stuffed animal, Berry The Bear. Will you be able to escape this haunted General Store?</p>\n<p>This game was made for the RemakeJam 2 GameJam. A GameJam that's about recreating your first game with your new found skills. I took this opportunity to  finally get around to remastering the old Shopping Nightmare game of mine. I'm very happy about how it turned out, especially since it only took me four days to make. Now of course the game may not be as good as my previous titles (especially the AI) but what can you do when you're rushed to finish a GameJam game on time, y'know.</p>\n\n<p>Well, I hope you enjoy it!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57d/57d42be8180d47d5c7480bef5f8d512b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dave Microwaves Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
