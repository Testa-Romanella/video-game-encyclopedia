Thanks for hosting the jam KB:</p><p>Played dodgeball in school? Lets see if you can dodgeballs here.</p>\n<p>Ready yourself to be bombarded with dodgeballs.</p>\n<p>Each ball will have a random character from a device, based on the mode you choose.</p>\n<p>The game has 4 modes to choose from. Press the correct key, and dodge the ball.</p>\n<p>The game starts off with only 1 opponent chucking balls at you frequently. This frequency increases with time upto a certain threshold.</p>\n<p>As time goes on, the number of opponents also increases, and you're bombarded with even more.</p>\n<p>When a ball reaches close enough, it will slow the game, so that you have some time to react. After that, BAM!!! You take the ball to the face.</p>\n<p>4 Game Modes are as follows:</p>\n<p>1. Keyboard only: Randoms between A-Z and 0-9</p>\n<p>2. Left Keyboard Right Gamepad: Randoms between Keyboard's A-G, Q-T, V-Z, 1-6 and</p>\n<p>XBox Controller's A, X, B, Y, Right Stick Press, Right Trigger, Right Shoulder, Start.</p>\n<p>3. Right Keyboard Left Gamepad: Randoms between Keyboard's H-P, U, 7-0 and</p>\n<p>XBox Controller's D-Pad Up/Down/Left/Right, Left Stick Press, Left Trigger,LeftShoulder, Select.</p>\n<p>4. Gamepad only: Randoms between XBox Controller's buttons.</p>\n<p>Note: NumPad not allowed. Dodging gives 12/15/15/10 points based on selected mode, due to device's complexity.</p>\n\n\n<p>Resources used:</p>\n<p>1.\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/keyboard</p>\n<p>2. https://pixabay.com/vectors/xbox-kontroller-gaming-controller-5162428/</p>\n<p>3. https://youtu.be/JBsk2HCyrOI</p>\n<p>4.
