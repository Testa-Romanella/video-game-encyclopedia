None of his friends could find him.<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0You follow the story from his point of view when he recovers conscience and finds himself on a remote tropical island trying to meditate, so he could remember and understand what happened to him, but things don't go as expected and tense situations start to escalate...</p>\n\n<p>Talk to people, explore the hotel and the island, solve puzzles and more!</p>\n<p>This is the introduction chapter, featuring the full intro and some Puzzles and Events that take place on the first day in the island.
