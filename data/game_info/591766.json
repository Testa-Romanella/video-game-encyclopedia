In this early edition, you will enjoy a discretionary peek into the world that the Lampward Enclave has left behind. A man, whose memories are uncertain, finds himself in those lands of misty swamps and oppressive moors which folk say the Lampward once protected and illuminated.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>A NOTE ON MOON LOGIC: Old fashioned adventure games often had bizarre puzzles with solutions that could not be easily ascertained; instead, through trial and error, and a sense of discovery, players would eventually figure out how these strange worlds were connected to understand them. This is currently a game with small stages, and if you know RPGM you understand how simple the variables involved are: you can move, you can interact, and you have an inventory. This is not a game to test your wits but a place to dwell in, a world to ruminate over. Some things are best considered rather than acted upon.</p>\n<p>The ARROW KEYS will move you.</p>\n<p>The ENTER key is your interact button.</p>\n<p>By pressing ESC, you will enter the Menu: this is an RPGMaker game which comes with a preset Menu. You need only concern yourself, for now, with the INVENTORY.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T06:40:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5d/c5ddc02520fc15ee323224c02eda5187.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lonernight"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
