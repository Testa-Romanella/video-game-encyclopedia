In order to avoid the enemies crashing into you,<br/>four different spells exist, which allows you to destroy the enemies and stop them from building up to a critical mass. <br/>The game uses a modernized and stylized version of classic arcade graphics and effects to give the look and feel of old school arcade games.<h3>Spells</h3><ul><li>\tImmiediatley create a large explosion at your location, instantly killing all enemies within it.<br/></li><li>\tFirst create an electro-magnetic pulse at your location, killing enemies instantly. Second, leave behind a bomb on the ground which will emmit another electro-magnetic pulse after 3 seconds.<br/></li><li>\tInstantly teleport to your current cursor location, destroying nearby enemies as you arrive.<br/></li><li>\tRemove all spell cooldowns for 10 seconds.</li></ul><h3>Enemy Types</h3><ul><li>\tA slow moving spacecraft.<br/></li><li>\tA fast moving spacraft.<br/></li><li>\tA fast moving spacecraft that will dash quickly at your ship once it gets in range.<br/></li><li>\tA very fast moving spacecraft that turns into a bomb once it gets close to the player.
