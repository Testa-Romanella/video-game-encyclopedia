Or it's a game about somebody doodling on a piece of paper pretending to be knocking planets into a black hole. It isn't really clear.<br/><br/>The mechanics are pretty simple. Use the mouse to aim the red planet, and try to knock the other planets into the center black hole. Dotted lines will show up to predict the path of the planets for some time in the future. If the red planet lands in the black hole, you lose the game. Getting more than one planet into the black hole in one turn will give you point bonuses. If you don't get any in the black hole on a given turn, you lose some points.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/440/44085b20ee3346cf4f236e6d545eafb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Benjamin-L"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
