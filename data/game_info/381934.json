However, this time, I started really late (~Sunday afternoon), after not doing any gamedev for.. pretty much since LD43!</p>\n<p>It was a blast, this is my first 2D game in Unity and I gotta say, as 2D newbie, the 2D workflow that Unity offers is pretty cool and easy to understand (the basics, at least!). I\u2019m really sorry that there are no sound effects in the game, and that the \u201cstory\u201d is short (I wanted player to be able to marry a wife, have kids, invest into fantasy stocks), but time was, in fact, the enemy. (Planescape: Torment anyone?)</p>\n<p>I hope you\u2019ll like it anyway.. I\u2019ll reserve more time for LD46, that\u2019s for sure!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD for movement SPACE for attack ENTER to interract with sign</p>\n<p>PS: Will be donating to the sprite authors! Believe it or not, these sprites can be downloaded for free\u00a0https://pipoya.itch.io/pipoya-rpg-tileset-32x32\u00a0.
