If you guard right before an attack, you will reverse all damage back to the enemy, and will be immediately able to counter attack. However, if you fail, you will receive significant knockback. By learning the enemy's attack pattern, you can deal maximum damage by parrying to their rhythm.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Compromising:<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>\n</strong>\r\n    After a death, you have the choice to compromise.
