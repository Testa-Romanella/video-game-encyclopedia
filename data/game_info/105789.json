Maybe you'll receive a message today. Or you can transmit a message and hope someone out there will find it some day. There's got to be someone else out there, right? In the meantime, at least you get some stations clearly on the radio!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\tHOW TO PLAY\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\tUse only your mouse to play.\r\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click the periscope, then a star, then leave the periscope view.</li>\n<li>Click the computer terminal, then scan the star. If there's a message, it'll appear.</li>\n<li>If there's a message, the computer will display it, but it probably won't be anything recognizable.</li>\n<li>If the computer can translate a letter, it will, and any time you get that letter in the future, the computer will automatically translate it.</li>\n<li>If you want, you can send a message to the selected star by building a sentence from lists of words in different categories, but the transmitter is very old and takes some time to recharge between sending messages.</li>\n<li>You can't receive messages that you've sent yourself.</li>\n<li>If you'd like (and we encourage you to do so), you can listen to one (or all) of the radio stations that your bunker can receive.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\r\n\tYou can control the volume for all sounds and music from the radio volume knob.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tYou can quit the game with Esc or by choosing Close Game from the credits screen (the question mark in the bottom left corner).\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tVolume, notes, and translated letters save from session to session, so if you get all the letters, you'll be able to see any messages you find right away.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tA major graphical update may be coming in the future, so keep your eyes peeled for that!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAlso, Paws Menu, the musician and designer of this game, also made a game for the Fermi Jam called Fermiphonic, so go check it out and leave a comment!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f75/f7564c0fefc3ed7137f0ad8c9b581ab6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Alamantus GameDev"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
