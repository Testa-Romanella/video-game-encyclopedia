This clich-ing will stop , once they start to uncover together the mysteries of\u00a0 his house.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><strong>Third Year of keeping the tradition up.</strong></p>\n<p>If you never heard of something called \"New Gen\" perhaps you won't like this game as much as the ones who did live through a particular journey , but of course you can play it,</p>\n<p>This game is a puzzle game , that contains a story , i am happy that i did it , and managed to finish it , and it seems polished enough.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In any case , this one is way smaller then the ones i made before , BUT , unlike the others , this one is a click and point , story puzzle game soooo progress , progress..</p>\n<p>middle ps (IK THOSE DON'T EXIST BUT THEY DO<strong> IN MY</strong> DESCRIPTION) : anyway , use doors to go into an area or another , or if there is not any door , click the corner of your screens on the left to go back ,\u00a0 the only exception would be the first pic , where you have to click somewhere near the house , not on it. And in the third pic where you click the stairs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>back to the description :\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>I felt like i wanted to do something and i did . I think the puzzle is pretty hard but hey maybe i am wrong , i left lots of hints .\u00a0</p>\n<p>Just FYI , the game is click and point , which means you gotta click many different things to get new knowledge about the story/puzzle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I also left one small easter egg for the\u00a0 ones who know me personally , well , probably more then one.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I certainly added the torture device that is \"aha\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alongside other things obviously.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finally , give it a try maybe , this game is in no shape or form designed to be top level puzzle game , but still , it's something that i am proud of.\u00a0 Oh and i might , just MIGHT do a small video where i explain how to uncover the puzzle , if i will I'll put the link here. Unless laziness gets the better of me.\u00a0 if i don't and the puzzle is overly hard , text me on Discord if you want , here's my tag :\u00a0 Knightwatcher#3889\u00a0</p>\n<p>The credits are right here, thank you for every music and picture, all of whom were taken from the website Pixabay (no copyrighted pics or audio)\u00a0 :\u00a0https://pixabay.com/</p>\n<p>the editing software i used is PicsArt, Background eraser, Photo &amp; Picture Resizer.</p>\n<p>Pictures :\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>https://pixabay.com/vectors/silhouette-isolated-man-people-3069733/\u00a0by\u00a0mohamed_hassan</p>\n<p>https://pixabay.com/vectors/desperate-stress-stressed-problem-2676556/\u00a0by\u00a0BedexpStock</p>\n<p>https://pixabay.com/vectors/boy-couple-female-girl-love-male-2023214/\u00a0by\u00a0OpenClipart-Vectors\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://pixabay.com/vectors/silhouette-woman-landscape-nature-1781585/\u00a0by\u00a0GDJ</p>\n<p>https://pixabay.com/illustrations/girl-woman-female-silhouette-young-4064549/\u00a0by\u00a0Merio</p>\n<p>https://pixabay.com/photos/summit-castle-castle-ruins-ruin-3160924/\u00a0by\u00a0anaterate</p>\n<p>https://pixabay.com/photos/villa-entrance-mansion-estate-door-4873346/\u00a0by\u00a0Tama66\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://pixabay.com/photos/villa-house-stairwell-lost-places-4873343/\u00a0by\u00a0Tama66</p>\n<p>\u00a0https://pixabay.com/photos/pforphoto-library-left-house-6578797/\u00a0by\u00a0\u00a0Tama66</p>\n<p>https://pixabay.com/photos/room-fortress-fort-building-6137966/\u00a0by\u00a0ncsmnd<br/></p>\n\n<p>Audio :\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0https://pixabay.com/music/beats-ghastly-castle-111bpm-cm-loopable-10016/</p>\n<p>\u00a0https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/wolf-howl-6310/</p>\n<p>https://pixabay.com/music/beats-thoughtful-night-15477/</p>\n<p>https://pixabay.com/music/acoustic-group-nightlife-michael-kobrin-95bpm-3783/</p>\n<p>https://pixabay.com/photos/brainwash-program-mask-propaganda-5038521/</p>\n<p>https://pixabay.com/music/beats-morning-dance-18313/</p>\n<p>https://pixabay.com/music/beats-second-wind-13465/</p>\n<p>direct downloads audio (didn't note the links) :</p>\n<p>https://cdn.pixabay.com/download/audio/2022/02/10/audio_fc48af67b2.mp3?filename=...</p>\n<p>https://cdn.pixabay.com/download/audio/2021/12/11/audio_f710b27dd1.mp3?filename=...<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>thank you\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Kw\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T04:23:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d86/d869b4033bec16daa4223f6447de1b93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Cedario"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
