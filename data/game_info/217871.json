Your job is to unload the containers onto the waiting trucks. You'll get extra points for matching the colored box to the corresponding lorry, but its not necessary.<br/><br/>You'll start small, but each level will bring more &amp; more cargo to unload. You get bonus time and points for matching the containers to the correct lorry<br/><br/>This is more of a quick arcade game then a simulator. The crane is very easy to control but you'll need to judge distance accurately. To get big scores you'll also need manual dexterity, good timing and perhaps a little luck.<br/><br/>Download  \"The Unloader\" now, you know you've always wanted to drive a crane.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T15:28:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/108/108828990d087eef6ae41b4d7b56908a_lntkg8R.jpg", "website": "http://galaticdroids.com/theunloader.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Galatic Droids"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Gold 5"], "esrb_rating": null}
