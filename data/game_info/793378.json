The troupe of adventurers marched onward, talking of loot and boasting of the victory that they would share once they returned back to civilization with packs full of plunder. Jovial conversation halted when the\u00a0earth shook and the stone around them began to shatter and collapse. Rushing forward to escape certain death, one of the wizards hastily cast a cantrip of light, revealing just how hopelessly trapped they were. Sounds of movement and the plodding of heavy feet began to stir deeper in the caverns. With only one way to go, the group pressed forward, hoping they could find an exit before they were slain by whatever horrors lurked before them.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Currently Unnamed Dungeon Crawler (CUDCrawler for short) is a turn-based dungeon crawler with gameplay based around classic hack-and-slash crawlers like Might &amp; Magic 3/4/5 and Wizardy 6/7. <br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0While certainly taking inspiration from these classic games, I very much want to introduce modern features that most expect from their RPGs (tooltips, mostly non-obfuscated gameplay mechanics) while still keeping the old school style of gameplay and challenge. Expect a long, perilous crawl through a dungeon teeming with things that would be more than happy to separate your characters from their lives.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0I expect the primary game to revolve around consistent pushes deeper and deeper into a dungeon of substantial size. The player will need to manage limited resources and use whatever navigational options are at their disposal (flight magic, teleportation, portals, and so on) to make forays deeper into the dungeon less of an immediate resource drain before once more returning to town laden with loot and the bodies of fallen comrades needed to be returned to life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Outside of the primary dungeon, which will be mostly focused around fast-paced hack-and-slash gameplay, I intend to also offer separate quests which feature smaller locales which will be designed more around storytelling and occasional puzzles (along the lines of what you'd see in Dungeon Master, Eye of the Beholder, or similar classics). <br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Be sure to check out the Frequently Asked Questions post to further illustrate general gameplay information.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>What to Expect Currently:</strong><br/>\u00a0\u00a0 - Explore a cavern, trying to escape to the surface before lurking monsters inevitably wear down the party and slay all of its members.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 - Wield weapon and spell to defeat enemies in turn-based combat.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 - High Quality Programmer Art\u2122.<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0- No sound effects or music (sound will come in A2, music in A3).<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Currently Known Issues:<br/></strong>\u00a0 \u00a0- Tooltips don't properly resize themselves vertically.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T19:50:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6dc/6dc0da8866a017d37b7ae80d0db1498e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GHostLPs"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
