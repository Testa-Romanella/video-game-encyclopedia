After each guess, mark the difference between the answer and the color of the stroke.<br/><br/>If the words and answers are exactly the same, they will be marked with a green background.<br/><br/>If the word is wrong, but the stroke is the same as that of the correct answer, the correct stroke will be displayed in green.<br/><br/>If the word is wrong, the stroke is not exactly the same as that of the correct answer, but it is very similar. This stroke will be displayed in black and gray - the darker the color, the more similar the answer.<br/><br/><strong>Story</strong><br/>It was the third day of the third month of the ninth year of Yonghe, the beginning of spring.<br/>Wang Xizhi, who was then the internal historian of Huiji, invited you and forty-one other literati to gather at the Lanting Pavilion in the shade of the Huiji Mountains to drink wine and make poems.<br/><br/>When the people were drunk on the aroma of wine and poetry, Xie Wan proposed a game to help them enjoy it!<br/>Wang Xizhi clapped his hands and said, \"I have an idea for a game called \"Chinese Wordle\".\"<br/><br/>He turned his back on the crowd and wrote some words on the scroll. Then Wang Xizhi turned around and hid the scroll behind him, and he smiled at the crowd and said.<br/>\"Gentlemen, it is well known that the beauty of Chinese characters lies in their form. On this scroll, I have written a four-character idiom, you can guess what I have written. It doesn't matter if you get it wrong, I will tell you the resemblance, which is called \"Chinese Wordle\".\"<br/><br/>You can also play this game in WeChay by scanning the QR code!\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-19T04:00:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/458/458a236de8071864d53a55e43152f31d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Surprising Studio"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Surprising Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
