So if you have a controller plugged in. It \"might\" work, no guarantee.<br/></p>\n<p>Story:</p>\n<p>There's trouble a-brewin' at the old North Pole! It's even worse than the time Santa's Monkey Bongo got into the medicine cabinet.\u00a0 This time\u00a0Santa's been kidnapped by some kind of Machine-Slime Hybrid Army.\u00a0 Thankfully the Elves have gathered enough cash to hire an ex-blackwater mercenary to get the job done.\u00a0 (That's you)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now travel up the mountain, there's no time to lose!</p>\n<p><strong>*NOTE*</strong>This time around.\u00a0I had very little time to work on the jam entry. Couldn't even get the Easter egg in there :-(<br/></p>\n<p>So there is no balance or polish. Some glitchy animation issues with some enemies. AI stuff. no UI etc.</p>\n<p>But I wanted to at least submit it and make sure it was\u00a0it fully beatable. So you have infinite lives to reach the end.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I do record how many times you die...\u00a0 incase you wanted to challenge yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Controls are customizable from the main menu only.<br/></p>\n<p>Default:\r\n</p>\n<p>Walk left and Right is A and D\r\n</p>\n<p>Look up is W\r\n</p>\n<p>Crouch is S\r\n</p>\n<p>Fire is K\r\n</p>\n<p>Jump is Space</p>\n<p>You will find Gifts scattered throughout the game and Enemies have a chance to drop them as well. Slimes have some of the highest chance for drops.\r\n</p>\n<p>Green Gift = Increase your Rate of Fire( can stack A LOT)\r\n</p>\n<p>Red Gift = Weapon Upgrade, (2 upgrades in total, rarest chance to drop)\r\n</p>\n<p>Blue Gift = Heal 1 Health\u00a0\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Also, apologies for the late entry!</p>\n\n<p>Assets Used:\r\n</p>\n<p>Music -\u00a0https://sidearm-studios.itch.io/ultimate-music-bundle\r\n</p>\n<p>Space Marine and Effects -\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/super-dead-space-gunner-merc-redux-platform-shmu...</p>\n<p>Enemy Machines -https://opengameart.org/content/super-dead-gunner-platform-shmup-enemies</p>\n<p>Sprite Edits - Me</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T13:18:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5df/5dfa17a750405a187bdc10c2377e7fa0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BobIsHere"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
