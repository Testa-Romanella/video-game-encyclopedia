Eventually, at least for me, it all culminated in a genuine attachment to the concept and characters, and a desire to make them into something tangible. This short game is effectively a dumping ground for a few of these ideas, as well as a way to experiment with the cast and world and how they might function in a real piece of media.<br/>Also there's this whole thing where the non-Sal characters are actually from a \"dream world\" that somehow leaked out into 'our' world and represent dreams that human beings have had previously, but while the game references that, it doesn't give any real explanation as to how it works so if you're going in expecting some context, you'll probably be disappointed.
