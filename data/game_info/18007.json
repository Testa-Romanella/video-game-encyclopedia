Designed for the WonderSwan Color, Judgement Silversword has the unique distinction of being one of the few shooting games designed for a handheld console, and it's also one of the best!  Destroying enemies as quickly as possible is essential to scoring in Judgement Silversword, giving the game a ruthless tempo.  One of indie developer M-KAI's first games, it can be seen as the inspiration and predecessor to the gameplay ideas in Eschatos.<br/><br/>Cardinal Sins puts an interesting twist on shoot 'em up gameplay with a score trial marathon spanning 7 different areas, each with a unique objective themed around the 7 Deadly Sins.  Collect lives in Sloth, Hoard enemy data in Greed, and avoid Destruction at the hands of Wrath.  Mastering the different objectives gives the game a great sense of variety.  Getting an S rank in every trial is very challenging!<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Key Features:</strong><br/><ul><li>Two different games!  Includes both Judgement Silversword and it's sequel, Cardinal Sins.<br/></li><li>Relentless shmup gameplay.  Use your three weapons efficiently to rack up a high multiplier.  However, your multiplier will drop quickly, so wipe out the enemies as fast as you can!  <br/></li><li>Varied challenges and a deep scoring system create strong replay value.<br/></li><li>A faithful port of hard-to-find WonderSwan Color games.<br/></li><li>See where the legend began!  Play the games that inspired Eschatos.<br/></li><li>Steam achievements are supported.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:10:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5db/5dba0665f64b55de62b8cbda201c573b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 15, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 18, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Qute"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Degica"], "esrb_rating": null}
