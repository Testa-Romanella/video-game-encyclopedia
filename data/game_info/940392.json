You can use it to boost results when shooting and evade lethal hits. If it reaches 5, you are not able to evade anymore and any additional point of OD has a 50% chance of you going\u00a0<em>boom</em>.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>You need to equip any weapons you have in the start of the mission, no auto equip even if they were equipped in the last run.</p>\n<p>Five wounds equals death. If you're bleeding, you have 20 turns to live unless you use Nanofix or Bandages to stop the bleeding.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD/Arrows/Left\u00a0Stick/D-Pad: Move</p>\n<p>Space/South Button: Fire, select</p>\n<p>Z/Esc/East Button: Cancel</p>\n<p>I/North Button: Inventory</p>\n<p>E/Q/Shoulders: Cycle target</p>\n\n<p>Music:\u00a0https://rustedstudio.itch.io/cybertracks-volume-1</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T08:41:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/252/2529ee87160266e7962506dff4254bfe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Arto Koistinen"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
