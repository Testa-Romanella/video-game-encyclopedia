This is a patrol of the area, air battles with enemy fighters, escort of Allied bombers,\u00a0protection of maritime convoys, search for enemy submarines, protection of cities from bombing by enemy aircraft, attack of the Vargate ships, destruction of FAA missiles and more.\u00a0Some missions can take more than one hour to complete.</p>\n<p>There are three levels of difficulty. I recommend you start the game on a real difficulty level.\u00a0At other levels of difficulty, enemies can use fighter jets. With a small level of experience it will be very difficult to resist such enemies.<br/>On the average difficulty level, I was able to get through the game only half.</p>\n<p>I wish you good luck in a dogfight.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b9/2b9f34b1ada458377d65e6ccc92ce7ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GeoGames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
