So I'm giving them a shout-out right here and I updated the credits to link the blog as well!</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Welcome to MOOD (Modern Opus Of Demon-hunting), ALPHA version!</p>\n<p>MOOD is a text-based homage to first-person demon-murderizing shooters of yore. It is, right now, completely playable, but incomplete. You should hopefully not run into any dead-ends (if you do, let me know!). You might get to shoot a gun! At a monster! Maybe!?</p>\n<p>This is my first game, and my first Game Jam, and I'm extremely grateful for the Goblin Bunker gang for the experience, support and encouragement.</p>\n<p>Also big ups to ID Software, Carmack, Romero, etc, for the inspiration for this LEGALLY DISTINCT TEXT ADVENTURE. Also also, cheers Tim Rogers for your fantastic review of DOOM.</p><p><em>Title image made uses the font Amazdoom by AmazingMax,\u00a0is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 Unported (CC BY-NC 3.0) license.</em></p>\n<p>Created for the Goblin Bunker Game Jam 2020!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T07:41:22", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["fuchs1a"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
