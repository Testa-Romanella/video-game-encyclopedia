During these levels the cube will move forward and its stop is stopped.</p>\n<p>In the \"small maze\" levels, a maze will be placed on a platform through which you will have to guide the cube through the maze, now this time you can go in all directions without moving alone as in the previous levels, to reach the end.</p>\n<p>In this game we want to improve both in terms of gameplay experience and the interface of this game.</p>\n<p>Our \"To Do\" list for the next versions:</p>\n<p>~ Improving the game interface both as an environment (through graphics and audio elements) and through menus and mini-menus</p>\n<p>~ Adding new levels and game types</p>\n<p>~ Adding new concepts in the game such as life,\u00a0skins, tests allowed on one level, etc. (the addition is made constantly through future versions)</p>\n<p>~ Troubleshooting</p>\n<p>~ Adding community ideas to the game\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>~ in first type of levels : \"A\" and \"D\" or arrow left and arrow right for move cube left and right</p>\n<p>~ in second type of levels : \"W,\"A\",\"S\" and \"D\" or arrowUP, arrowDown, arrowLeft and arrowRight for move cube in all directions\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T07:40:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67a/67a51e821fcf7758224833607adf1072.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AnoDev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
