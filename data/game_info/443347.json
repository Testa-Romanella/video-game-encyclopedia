Join Wendy Martin, national award-winning science teacher, to guide you through two separate, but related virtual reality dissections: a squid and a sea star.\u00a0Learn the fundamentals of invertebrate anatomy and their respective systems in our fully immersive VR experience using Carolina Biological\u2019s expert curricula and process.<br/>Maximize student learning through this self-paced, teacher-facilitated dissection procedure with formative assessments throughout that check for understanding. This true-to-life experience thoroughly covers each step of the science procedure typically used in real classroom dissections. Guiding learners through each anatomical system, our digitized science teacher walks students through the process, while talking about the structure and function of organs and systems.<br/>This program is aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)\u2014America\u2019s framework for science learning. Using original to-scale models of organs and specimens, learners get a first class dissection experience at their own pace, and without the safety or ethical implications. VR is an incredible way to learn\u2014fun, focused, and distraction-free!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T04:05:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d4/4d40f73e018e73b18ed64d80437d0c3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["VictoryXR"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
