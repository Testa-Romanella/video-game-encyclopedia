It is a 2-D narrative experience focused on visuals and story in a familiar setting. \u00c9ric Chahi's games (Another World and Heart of Darkness) greatly influenced the production and visuals of One Last Night.<br/></p>\n<p>If you like the game, show support by spreading the word and leaving your feedback. Obviously the reception of Act 1 will be extremely important in consideration of making a part 2. So, if you like it and want to see the story continue, let me know!</p>\n<p>The main goals of the project were to learn how to make a basic 2-D game for PC, produce illustrations in Photoshop, and create detailed rotoscope animations. All artwork in the game came from reference images and videos. Backgrounds and animations were made by drawing over still images and video frames.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/277/27773a90d46508f77d88b446bcc74d2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jonah Lovell"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
