They just\u00a0<em>had</em> to ask right before one of the largest duststorms since 21XX, but you're cool with it. Your shitty Debulon Model S speedster can easily beat this storm, provided its engine doesn't fall out. But hey, no biggie, right? She's been through worse than a few cacti, some hills, a few rolling stones, and a freakin space laser. Worse yet, the Debulon wasn't built for longer distances, it was mostly built for drag races, so refueling is a must.\u00a0Goddamnit, you don't even know if this beer is gonna be cold by the time you get there.</p>\n\n<p>This game was built exclusively for a flight-stick,\u00a0 currently. This may change in the future, but for now it's pretty hard to play.</p>\n<p>You use the left stick to turn, and the trigger under that stick to bank by going hard left or right. The compass on the left side tells you if you're on course to the next station, so keep it red and not gray. \u00a0The red stripped button activates a speedboat that drains health in exchange for speed.\u00a0The rest of the controls have some explanation in game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T11:24:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/316/31636ad4ce659a44da454bba9d5b9477.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wobbled"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
