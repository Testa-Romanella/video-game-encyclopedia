Play as many times as you want, \u00a0whenever you want. A game for life.</p>\n<p>A classic game with the purpose of getting your best score and having your name show up for everyone to see. There are 50 levels with each level becoming increasingly harder as you go. During the game there are extra lives (Hearts) that will pop up for you to grab. You may think there are many but I suggest you get as many as you can because you will need them to get pass the bonus levels. There is a bonus level after every 5th\u00a0level and the ball is faster, so watch out.</p>\n<p>If you want to have a challenging game without the interruptions of ads or time go ahead and play Brick! Bang!! Boom!!! and get your highest score. I am anxious to see if you can reach Level 50. Drop me a line.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-12T05:06:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/992/9924af6bb133370998237a799fc60298.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["On The 9th Apps!"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
