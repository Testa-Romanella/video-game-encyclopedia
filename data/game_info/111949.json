The backgrounds for Kunkun's<br/>bedroom have not been credited yet. I was unable to<br/>find the artist because the site i got it from has <br/>been taken down. Reason being that it was inactive<br/>for a year. But that is just what I've heard.<br/>If you are the artist, then please reach out to me<br/>by sending a message on itch.io or if you know the<br/>artist then please message me as well.My account <br/>name is MegaSaberEXE. After i have evidence that <br/>you are the real artist, then i will credit you as <br/>soon as possible. Also the sunset has not <br/>been credited either. </p>\n<p>UPDATED: I just found the artist for kunkun's room, his or her name is lesleigh63. I will add their name to the list and game as soon as possible.<br/></p>\n<p>Warning:Bad cliches, Bad plot, Bad puns, and old memes</p>\n<p>P.S.
