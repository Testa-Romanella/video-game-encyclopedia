I do hope it scares you though.\u00a0This was made for a game jam, and it\u00a0takes 5-10 minutes\u00a0to play. There are two endings.</p>\r\nGame controls\r\n<p>Keyboard and mouse.</p>\n<strong>Walk</strong>\r\nWASD or Arrows\r\n<strong>Run</strong>\r\nShift (Left or Right)\r\n<strong>Crouch</strong>\r\nControl (Left or Right)\r\n<strong>Jump</strong>\r\nSpace\r\n<strong>Interact</strong>\r\nE\r\n\r\n<strong>Flashlight</strong>F\r\nAbout the project\r\n<p>This was made over two weeks\u00a0as part of the\u00a0Matt Aspland\u00a0Enigma Game Jam. The theme was supernatural, and\u00a0I had already been thinking about making a ghost story. So the stars aligned and I dove in. Two weeks isn't a long time, but I'm happy with what I came\u00a0up with. I'm excited about the ideas here\u00a0and am considering turning this into a longer game.\r\n</p>\n<p>I\u00a0made this game with Unreal Engine 5.1.1. This was my first time making something tangible with it, and I\u00a0ran into a lot of\u00a0performance issues due to Lumen. People with 4090s and 3090s experienced super low frame rates. So I ended up disabling Lumen, and its related features, and reverting to a traditional baked lighting approach. This resulted in a much better experience overall.</p>\r\nYouTube\r\n<p>I've recently started posting regular videos on\u00a0my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/geoffalday.\u00a0I've made a few small horror games in the past. Now I'm working on a longer one that I plan to publish on Steam. Follow along as I make the journey from game idea to launch!<br/></p>\r\nThanks!\r\n<p>Thanks to the following kind people for testing out early versions of this game.
