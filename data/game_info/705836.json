Two unique and complete levels. The main menu was changed as well.</p>\n<p>2.\u00a0 I changed the UI backdrop and buttons.</p>\n\n\n<p>3. I have three different mixed looped tracks I made using Garageband's loop track options. I arranged each track with a type of beat or multiple types of beats and paired it with\u00a0piano to try to create soundtracks that had movement but give off a calm feeling for the main menu and first level. The second level has a more panicked feeling to it. I also have a scrapped main menu soundtrack I didn't use because it didn't match the feeling of the other tracks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>4. I made an icon for my game as well.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Created by Rachel Tiv with assets from Michigan State University and Garageband.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T13:20:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba7/ba710096540787e1fcb68bb1cf278498.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Rachel Tiv"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
