{"id": 482315, "slug": "ahmmits-gate", "name": "Ahmmit's Gate", "name_original": "Ahmmit's Gate", "description": "<p>Ahmmit\u2019s Gate is a single-player, reverse-horror game where you play as Ahmmit, a blind monster from an ancient time that survives off the fear of humans. Her eggs have been stolen, so she has torn her way into this dimension to recover her kin. With a deadly sensitivity to light, Ahmmit can\u2019t stay in this world for long, so you must track down your eggs and return to the gate before you perish. Echolocate, crawl, and pounce your way through a museum while smashing objects and disabling security lasers. But be sure to keep Ahmmit from falling weak! Stick to the shadows and terrify the pesky guards so that you can harvest their tasty fear through predatory assassination!</p>\n<p>Playable with <strong>Mouse/Keyboard</strong> or <strong>PS4/Xbox One</strong> controller on PC.</p>\n<p>This is a demo-like experience, representing a vertical slice of what could potentially be a full-fledged release.
