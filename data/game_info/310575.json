Please share it with your friends! It was developed from scratch in Klik &amp; Play during the late 90s and has been resurrected. This is not your run of the mill platform game! Smiley is based on Pac-Land and Super ZZT Land among others. Features include parallax scrolling frontwards and backwards, elegant collision detection, re-purposed arcade-style graphics and a full size course with room to spare! The project aims to push KNP's limits with only minor adjustments in Fusion for the WIN32 and HTML5 builds. Support the development of this game by donating.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-19T06:22:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e89/e89f0194f97323cc663e0283aadafbbd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nanoco"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
