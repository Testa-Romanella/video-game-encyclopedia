We distributed the tasks among ourselves to create this game.</p>\n<p>The game has the player control Chi who wants to see the heavens and Ao who wishes to climb the waterfall to become a dragon. The two work together to try and brave the waters and face off demons to achieve their dreams. As the player, you try to score as much as you can without getting hit. If you do, it's game over.</p>\n<p>The player sprite was created by myself.</p>\n<p>The enemy sprite was created by https://chriscomixportfolio.weebly.com/.<br/></p>\n<p>The menu UI and game background was created by https://maxprediger.wordpress.com/?frame-nonce=90b75fced1.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T02:15:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd3/dd397240803819f95fc833d2ddc9f29b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["polygonsummoner"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
