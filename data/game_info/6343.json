To get it back, you must use your skill at opening treasure chests, to, well... open treasure chests. Open the chest, get loot, and equip it to increase your odds of getting even better loot.  Grind until you get the best loot!<br/><br/>- Over 1400 pieces of loot to collect!<br/>- 7 levels of loot rarity to grind!<br/>- Endless chests to open!<br/><br/>Amazing Loot Grind is an experiment.  The game attempts to strip the loot mechanic of the RPG genre to its bones, while still creating an engaging and enjoyable gameplay experience.  Further, Amazing Loot Grind subtly forces players to reexamine what exactly they are doing as they pour hours into the slot machine mechanics that have come to represent the apex gameplay experience of our favorite games.  Why play that fantasy MMO or that space shooter/RPG hybrid when you could get the same endgame experience with a few taps on your phone?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:28:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1fc/1fc0948b0f31cf112d9d2dc09700aa0e.jpeg", "website": "http://www.starpenguingames.com/#amazinglootgrind", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Michael T Astolfi"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Michael T Astolfi"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
