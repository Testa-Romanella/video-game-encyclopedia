They require no recognition, no rewards and no fame. This epic story follows this type of hero. For he is an assassin in the darkness, the light in the shadows and the guardian of the world! Everybody knows of his existence, but only a select few know his true name. His name is not important, what is important is the fact that he always wanted to be an assassin, worthy of the title \"Hero\"!</p>\n<p>Play as an unnamed assassin as he tries to prevent a great evil from being awakened, but ultimately fails. The only way for him to correct this mistake is to go back in time, to the point in time in which the gears of the akashic records started to turn for the worse! After going back in time the assassin realizes that he is significantly weakened and is no longer capable of changing the gears of the akashic records, and must once again assemble a team to help him fight against the never ending turning of the gears of fate. So now I welcome you, the player, for you are about to embark on an epic odyssey to correct the future, to help save the future from a great evil!
