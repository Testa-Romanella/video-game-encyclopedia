Your objective is to search the house for 6 assorted body parts while evading and cleansing the unholy, demonic spirits that creep inside the house. Armed with your flashlight and crucifix, you search the house for these severed body parts. The more body parts you cleanse, the angrier the spirits get, and the more likely you will not get out alive.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T03:30:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d13/d13b07f26cedab0c6df4bdc6083d5040.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Drew Parmelee"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Drew Parmelee"], "esrb_rating": null}
