Our hero Serge must rescue Sergette from the clutches of nasty monsters that came from the shadow. But who is this strange fish following him? Will you be able to save Sergette? And above all, will you be able to see beyond the window?</p>\n<p>This project was made as part of the SI28 teaching unit at the Universit\u00e9 de Technologie de Compi\u00e8gne, with the goal of creating a game with an interesting take on the existing video game genres and how computers change how we approach narration. We thank our professor Serge Bouchardon for his enthusiasm, guidance and advice!</p>\n<p>Made by :<br/></p>\n<p>Arthur Wacquez<br/>Augustin Pitr\u00e9<br/>Hugo Bulte<br/>Yann Boucher<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T07:38:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b9/9b97039741dc141e4f1b2daa9c25cdb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stellaris"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
