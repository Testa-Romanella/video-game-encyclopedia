(Jenkins, 2003)\u00a0(Mates &amp; Stern, 2006)</p>\n<p><strong>Experience design &amp;\u00a0Space/gameworld</strong></p>\n<p>The player experience is essential for our game world to be a safe space. As a result, the colour palette, primarily consisting\u00a0of blue, brown and green, is intended to bring forth\u00a0a calm and natural environment that invites exploration and curiosity. The player will not have to\u00a0worry about dying in the game due to the fact that we want to provide safety for the players to take action and in this way be stimulated to return to their lives and not spike any anxiety levels. The more minimalistic approach highlighted in the game's low poly art style is based on the idea that putting too much detail and story into an object can make it difficult for the player to\u00a0construct their own story in a given\u00a0situation. The more simplistic low-poly art accordingly\u00a0aid us in making the player tell their story and form their own unique experience.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>We integrated our core values\u00a0into Haven Isles by constructing a gameworld localized on an island where players get the opportunity to create their own small space that can function as their\u00a0safe space.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nature elements like grass, trees, mountains and of course the surrounding ocean in the game are familiar to the player. This should prove more relatable to the player, provide a realism factor(Witmer &amp; Singer, 1998), and\u00a0in\u00a0that way not make the player feel overwhelmed, but rather provide them a sense of\u00a0feeling in control in a more familiar setting.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Tools/tech/platform:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Haven Isles\u00a0runs on the Unity Engine.</p>\n<p>The mood board for the game\u00a0is based on the values listed above with calming colours and pleasurable environments. Here we started by including design elements fitting our vision for the theoretical framework and later in proces trying to define a colour palette we wanted to display in the game.\u00a0</p><p>As for the story board, we started by drawing sketches of activities we wanted to take place in the game, as seen above. This sketch was also what we originally imagined as the task for our testers during our playtest, but incorporating a fishing mechanic proved difficult enough that we eventually decided to task the player to find an axe, chop wood and collect it. As for the narrative in this, we wanted to portray an emergent narrative(Jenkins, 2003) in that the player makes the choice to do activities such as these and how this impacts the game world. In this case chopping down and removing a tree from the game world, which hopefully also reminds the player\u00a0of topics such as\u00a0consumerism and sustainability.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We want the player to experience freedom of movement and agency which is the reason\u00a0behind the\u00a0interactive player-driven world where the mechanics and rules are simple. (Jenkins, 1998) The technical skills required from the player are also minimal, since our game is played on a browser with only the mousepad and few keyboard keys. The player is able to move around and impact their own gameworld where they can create their own narrative story.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Theme/context</strong></p>\n<p>General anxiety and anxiety disorder is not a new phenomenon, it has been around for a while. Recently over the last decade we\u2019ve seen a significant rise in people with anxiety. According to (McCarthy, 2019) nearly 1 out 3 free teenage children will experience some form of anxiety disorder. In addition, we\u2019ve seen these numbers increase steadily just a few years ago, where the number of children with anxiety disorder have risen by 20% from 2007-2012. Now in 2020, with the current Covid-19 pandemic looming in the shadows in our daily life, more people than ever are experiencing stress, fear and increased anxiety symptoms. Feeling overwhelmed, angry, sad and helpless are just some of the verbs used to describe the situation many people are experiencing during the pandemic, according to experts. (Murray &amp; Sherwood, 2020)\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>As a result of this, the purpose of our game is particularly to provide a game space to escape into for anxious people who during the Covid-19 situation have experienced an increase of anxiety.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Playtesting:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>We tested Haven Isles with four\u00a0playtesters, two female and two male testers respectively. In\u00a0each playtest, stretching about 10 minutes, we tried not helping the players too much by sitting them down, placing the game in front of them and then giving them a task.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Task for our playtester:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>The task consisted of (1) finding an axe (2) using the axe\u00a0to chop down a random tree. Furthermore, we asked the testers\u00a0to Think Aloud to provide us with their immediate thoughts\u00a0as well as to\u00a0got as close to a\u00a0full player experience as possible.</p><p><strong>Our playtesters</strong><br/></p><p>Player 1: S\u00f8ren</p>\n<p>Player 2: Thea</p>\n<p>Player 3: Rasmus</p><p>Player 4:\u00a0Mathilde</p>\n<p><strong>Feedback:</strong></p>\n<p>1. First we noticed the difference between testers and their technical skills, since two players immediately used the arrow keys to move the player. However, for the other two it took a while to realize. Also, they all pointed out that it was impossible to walk straight and very hard to control the character as highlighted by player 1:\u00a0\u201cI'm turning when I try to walk straight ahead. It is hard to control.\u201d.</p>\n<p>2. Several testers mentioned that the graphics of the game were \"nice\" and two highlighted the music as fitting to the nature theme. One asked about the music: \"Have you chosen this music yourself? It's very meditative\" (Player 4), while another\u00a0felt that the music\u00a0encouraged a sense of mindfulness:\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe music fits very well to the nature theme. It promotes mindfulness\u201d (Player 1)\u00a0Another tester brought up that the music helped them focus on the game world:\u00a0\u201cI think the music is very calm and relaxing, so I can focus on my game\u201d (Player 2).\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was exactly our idea to give the player a relaxing experience of being in their own space. Likewise, players expressed that the island world worked well. Through observation we quickly sensed that we had to give more direction to the player and that they had to use an axe to cut the tree, which could indicate might indicate was distracted by the world due to the fact that this was specifically one of the tasks. Before that, all the players quickly started to walk around and explore. This was our vision, but we also wanted the tester to complete the task they were given.</p>\n<p>3. Three\u00a0of the four players noted that the camera angle should be a bit higher so that the game view did not get occupied by treetops when in a forest. In relation to this, player 3 noted that \"If this was not a playtest, I would probably\u00a0have quit the game\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Game fixes based on the provided feedback</strong><strong>:\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>1. We have adjusted the player controls sensitivity. Now the controls should be more responsive and significantly easier to control. The\u00a0players are actually in control of their actions now.</p>\n<p>2.\u00a0To make possible actions clearer for the player, we made a small path from where the character starts by the house to the trees we asked them to cut down. In addition to this, we placed the axe in a more open spot closer to the player spawn making the task more obvious.</p>\n<p>3. We have fixed this issue in that now\u00a0the camera is always on top of the items in the gameworld.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>References:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Iten, G. H., Steinemann, S.
