{"id": 22513, "slug": "uncharted-2-among-thieves", "name": "Uncharted 2: Among Thieves", "name_original": "Uncharted 2: Among Thieves", "description": "<p>In Uncharted 2, as in the other Uncharted games, the hero is the adventurer and hidden treasure seeker Nathan Drake. Riddles are no less important part of the gameplay than fights, chases and travels through exotic landscapes and hard-to-reach places.<br />\nDrake is well prepared for all this. He is provided with ammunition - he picks them up from the corpses of killed enemies, ably uses shelters, can run, climb, jump, kill with one blow and fight in hand-to-hand combat.<br />\nIn Uncharted 2 you can find 101 treasures. Some treasures lie almost in sight, others will have to run. Treasures can be sold, and money can be spent on bonus content. Multiplayer mode allows you to play up to 3 people at a time - this is if players follow the adventure story of the game and solve problems together. There are also battle modes, where up to 10 people can participate simultaneously. There are several combat modes, they differ in their objectives and in some ways.</p>", "metacritic": 96, "released": "2009-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-18T21:11:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/74b/74b239f6ef0216a2f66e652d54abb2e6.jpg", "website": "http://www.unchartedps3.com", "rating": 4.39, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 126, "owned": 1409, "beaten": 2064, "toplay": 166, "dropped": 71, "playing": 37}, "playtime": 13, "achievements_count": 71, "ratings_count": 1712, "suggestions_count": 650, "game_series_count": 7, "reviews_count": 1731, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Naughty Dog"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
