On this jam, me and ninjabuilder, used the <strong>same asset pack</strong> and whoever made the best game in 24 hours, wins! You can play his game here:\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/dagamecompany-vs-ninjabuilder</p>\n<p>On this game\u00a0 you control a character with WASD or Arrow keys, shoots with LMB and try to survive as long as possible. To survive you simply clear the room full of enemies, but every time you clear the room, the level will reload with +1 enemies, until it's pretty much impossible to beat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Made by:\u00a0https://dagamecompany.itch.io<br/>Art Pack:\u00a0https://scut.itch.io/7drl-tileset-2018<br/>Music: https://evokemusic.ai/find/results?q=8bit&amp;slug=wqRggvorpm4F8&amp;sorting=newest</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T02:07:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0d/e0d70d9acb3cc009d0fe3a80b479a04a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DaGameCompany"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
