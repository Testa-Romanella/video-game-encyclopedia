Controls updated on suggestion so we'll see how it goes, I think it feels better comparatively. Crates can be pushed around by walking into them but that's pretty much it for this update.</p><p>1.1.8: Lighting is fully functional, nothing really new other than that. Optimization is going to happen before continuing progress though outside of level design.</p><p>1.1.7: Backgrounds added to all levels most of which are placeholder for now. Shadow blocks are more visible search lights have colors to them. Kicking is a thing press C to kick! Levels remastered.</p><p>1.1.5-6  apparently I just forgot to update the changelog for these updates, some things happened.</p><p>1.1.4: Started making things prettyful. At least the first 3 levels have backgrounds to them. But other wall tiles have new icons on them describing the conditions they require (warning: ugly). Pausing is a thing as well as returning to the hub/main menu.  There is a pseudo save system implemented. (to unlock all of the stages type: unlock all). The ability to kick things is in, because why not. Crashing bugs mostly squashed but report any if you find any.</p><p>1.1.3: lost in translation</p><p>1.1.2: Apparently I had broken something that made all of the levels in world 1 accessible, that's fixed now sorry.</p><p>1.1.1: 27 levels of shadowy goodness, flash lights, toy cars, the whole shibang. Including a boss fight and secret message for having all of the stages unlocked.</p><p>1.1: [REDACTED]<br/></p><p>1.0.6: Fixed a bug that would crash the game if you had the flashlight on and moved between rooms, also included the instructions on how to interact with levers. Sorry.</p><p>1.0.5: Added 13 more levels and made a reminder to never push builds at 6 am.</p><p>1.0.4: Fixed a bug where you'd be stuck under the floor in the bedroom if you reset at the end of the game (spoiler alert: you can play the game again if you finish) Inadvertently removed 13 levels from the game. Download if you want the express experience.<br/></p><p>1.0.3: HP bar added not that you really need it currently unless you keep getting hit, changed the way you can \"sink\" into the floor*<br/></p><p>1.0.2: Forgot to remove some debugger text and adjust some things<br/></p><p>*sidenote: it's there for unstucking purposes and nothing else and will be removed permanently once I can get some better collisions working<br/></p><p>Also if anyone  wants I can make some more levels.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/312/312d48bd90f2b63259fb22546f8ca1b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ShadowDev"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
