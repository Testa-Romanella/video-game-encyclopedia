That's what we all want, right?</p>\n<p>This is a big social experiment. Hahaha. It may not work at all. Thank you for checking it out. Just reading this (long) description means you're a nice person!</p>\n\r\nYou're NOT alone.\r\n<p>Seriously, doing game jams can feel\u00a0<strong>SCARY AND LONELY</strong>, especially during the rating period. We all want our games to do well, but we also want to encourage others, make connections, and <strong>LEARN</strong>.</p>\n<p>The best way to do all of those is to play and rate as many games as we can. The problem with large jams like Brackeys is there are <strong>JUST TOO MANY GAMES</strong>\u00a0to get to. Maybe adding some silly teams will help us stay motivated, and\u00a0form<strong>\u00a0LOVELY, SURPRISING FRIENDSHIPS.</strong></p>\n<p>Even if you didn't participate in the Jam, you can still get in on the <strong>GROUP HUG</strong>. Your comments are as valuable as anyone's.\r\n</p>\n<p>Let's make this Jam<strong> THE MOST RATED JAM EVER!</strong></p>\n\r\nHow this works\r\n<p>Right. So itch.io is amazing. When you comment on stuff, it gets posted publicly. That means anyone (including this game) can verify when players make comments on other games. Bingo.\u00a0By telling the game your itch.io username, you will <strong>EARN POINTS\u00a0</strong>when you post stuff.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>The game\u00a0can't tell when you've <em>rated</em> a game, because as far as I know that info is not public. But honestly I\u00a0prefer comments to just ratings. <strong>COMMENTS ARE LOVED BY EVERYONE</strong>.
