With every room the stats of the protagonist and the enemies are randomly increased - the harder the level, the higher the chance to roll higher and higher stat increases. The room you land in is randomly decided every time you enter a new one.\u00a0The stage ends with the final room, number 6 inside an enormous boss!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Important!!! (BUGS)</strong><br/>Dying Sound is very bit loud so please care for your ears!\u00a0 We suggest you turn down the volume to about 10% in your Windows Audio Mixer.\u00a0<br/>In order for your shots to actually go where you are aiming - press shift to dash at the start of the first level. This should resolve the issue.<br/>Sometimes the portals won't teleport you anywhere and simply increase your stats every time you overlap them.\u00a0We don't really know what causes this bug. Restarting the game should resolve the issue.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>WASD - Moving</p>\n<p>Left Click - Shooting</p>\n<p>Left Shift - Dash<br/></p>\n<p>Wanna spice things up?
