Escher, and Oskar Reutersvard. Build mind-bending structures and populate them with interesting embellishments, one side at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can aim for a high score by placing details next to those of a similar type or just sit back and make a masterwork of twisting perception. The sandbox of Architect is yours to explore and transform. In a way, you could think of it like a tool to make your own desktop backgrounds, miniature worlds, or even art prints!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nArchitect is meant to be played as a slow paced, meditative, and artistic experience. Your only goal is to construct a space that defies the expectations of our reality.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T03:23:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a6/3a6e12fccdc65b2154b9fd08fb24aec7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Aleph Null"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Aleph Null"], "esrb_rating": null}
