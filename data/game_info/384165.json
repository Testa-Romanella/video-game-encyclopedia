The original was always one of my favourites in terms of playability, but I always felt that the graphics did not do the game, or the legend, any kind of justice. Hopefully this modest update\u00a0 goes some way to change that. More information about the update and how it came about, as well as credits, are included in a text file.<br/><br/>As the original game is widely available for download, the full game is provided here.\u00a0 If it turns out distribution is not permitted, I will replace the download with a patch that will not contain any of the original code.<br/><br/>This game is free, but a lot of time went into making it so donations to encourage further updates and other projects are always warmly appreciated.\u00a0 However, if you are an active member of the community in terms of writing games or making content, you may consider it a gift from me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-18T05:43:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25f/25f1b1cb04e2e494d42ff3cb8c1b2573.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["highriser"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
