{"id": 337081, "slug": "rain-sfml-student-project", "name": "RAIN [SFML Student Project]", "name_original": "RAIN [SFML Student Project]", "description": "<p>RAIN is a megaman inspired platformer shooter where you control Rain as he dispatches the city of robots that have gone rogue and are a threat to society.</p>\n<p>Rain is unique in the way you shoot and jump: you must use your trusty companion drone to use it as moving platform and shoot from it instead of your character! The drone follows your mouse and can be positioned anywhere to shoot from any angle. This opens many creative ways to aproach platforming and combat.</p>\n<p>The game features a vertical slice of a would-be level including:</p>\n<p>- Platforms and pitfalls.</p>\n<p>- Patroling shooting robots</p>\n<p>- Deadly spikes</p>\n<p>- Coins to gather</p>\n<p>- A final boss and an unlockable secondary skin for the main character upon the boss' defeat</p>\n<p>I hope you like my project as it is an IP I held dear as it is the first character I\u00a0created for a game. Good luck with the level boss!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2b/f2bcdeb7e7b1a84da9b4a2cd28efe388.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JuanluMorales"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
