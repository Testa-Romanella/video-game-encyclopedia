There are a few bugs/oddities. Here is a list of known ones:</p>\n<p>Enemy spawners may respawn enemies if you've activated a textbox/paused.<br/>NPCs may teleport to a building if spoken to while running for safety at dusk.<br/>Respawning inside of the mansion may cause spawners to not trigger when you first appear, leaving the current room\u00a0void of candles/enemies.<br/>Items not normally accessible in the demo without the use of a name entry cheat may not function as intended/are a WIP.\u00a0The Fishing Rod for example still needs work.<br/>For some users, activating a textbox or pausing may create some sprite ghosts for any active objects for a couple of frames.\u00a0<br/>Options menu, and Map menu\u00a0does nothing at the moment.<br/>In the Spirit Woods, there are some menu related exploits that will be corrected.<br/>Some music tracks loop strangely. Easy fix, just haven't prioritized it.<br/>Enemy money drops are higher than intended, but I\u00a0don't have a proper drop randomizer implemented yet.<br/>Mansions are harder when you enter them at night. The current result isn't as I intend it, but I'm indecisive if I want to turn that into a feature or not.<br/>Some background elements don't function as intended yet. For example,\u00a0the moon may jump positions, or not appear at all.<br/>Lugosi Path is unfinished, but I had a basic framework that I wanted to implement anyway.</p>\n<p>It's important to remember that everything in this demo is a <strong>work in progress</strong> and is <strong>subject to change</strong>!\u00a0 Some areas are blocked off, and some features are enabled by default\u00a0for demonstration purposes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is controller support, however if you're using a keyboard this is the layout:</p>\n<p>A = Start<br/>\r\nS = Select<br/>D = A<br/>F = B<br/>Up, Down, Left, Right = Dpad</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T11:31:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/018/0182cef8b40bf979d78e1b299e543568.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 293, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Programancer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
