I\u2019d know better than anyone. Its eyes are red, and it stinks like death. Recently, a friend discovered an old tome detailing the location of a sealed horror. A black pit at the bottom of an old mine. Some previous group had tried to set it free, leaving its seal cracked and weak. I sought to lead a small group down into the depths to repair it, but it was no easy task. Purple miasma leaked into the mine, an ambient ringing, like a beating heart, threatened to drive us insane. I decided we needed more help. I gathered all the help I could find and created a makeshift camp at the edge of the mine. . . With all of our resources, I hope to get this job done quickly. Maybe it\u2019s the quiet muttering, or the stench of rot and blood in the air. . . But something tells me this won\u2019t be so easy.\u201d<br/>- High Archivist Sol\r\n<p>Unbeknownst\u00a0to the ambitious wizards led by Sol, the abyssal rift drains life force from all that is in its vicinity. Slowly, like a growing cancer, the rift will take everything and leave behind only fear and hopelessness. Can you keep the morale of your task force\u00a0high? Can you\u00a0repair the abyssal rift that is threatening to unleash the elder evil slumbering within it?<br/></p>\n<p>This game was developed in 10 days for the VimJam2 game jam.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\r\nPause0Speed (1x)1Speed (3x)2Speed (5x)3ReloadRExitEscape\r\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Game Design and\u00a0Programming:\u00a0Red Salmon\r\n</p>\n<p>Artist:\u00a0wrabbit\u00a0(instagram\u00a0//\u00a0twitter\u00a0//\u00a0website\u00a0)\r\n</p>\n<p>Sound design:\u00a0Ulu\u00e7 Kaymak</p>\n<p>Story and Voice Acting: Jules</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T08:30:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ead/ead3097ca98a5412bb48c7a4ffa6a7f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Red Salmon"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
