The interpretation was that player movement/keybinds are out of the player's control. Every time you load a level your controls will be shuffled. Try to beat the levels as fast as you can and get the highest score!</p>\n<p>The other interpretation that was absolutely not intended was that very early on it became apparent that the game could not be tested by the developer as it was intended to be played. The developer cannot beat this game. <br/></p>\n<p>A friend played the game and gave feedback on controls and levels. They beat the game. Therefore at least 1 person can finish this game. Cons of being unable to test your own game:</p>\n<ul><li>All the levels were designed to be beatable using NORMAL controls and no timer. True difficulty of levels was unknown until friend played.</li><li>Development of the game is based on friend's schedule who was never intending to help out with the jam. i.e. short window to get feedback</li><li>All feedback on controls and game feel is based on what they said.</li><li>The game was basically designed for 1 person alone. Hopefully others are like this person and can beat it.</li></ul>\r\nOther Notes\r\n<p>The title may sound like clickbait but the developer of the game actually cannot beat it because:</p>\n<ol><li>They don't play platformers</li><li>Therefore they are very bad at platformers to begin with</li><li>They don't have good hand-eye coordination with a keyboard</li><li>With the keys shifting every level they can't get past the third one</li><li>They are an idiot sandwich</li></ol>\n<p>Also you are a cube because its funny to keep it that way. It also may or may not help with judging distances.</p>\n<p>Warning: This game might be incredibly frustrating for people like me.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>They will shuffle while you play. The valid keys are:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Left Arrow</li><li>Right Arrow</li><li>Up Arrow</li><li>Down Arrow</li><li>Space Bar</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Developer: https://twitter.com/paigemarincak/</li><li>Tester: My friend Jessica</li><li>Special Thanks: Ben &amp; Cie for letting me bounce ideas off of them</li></ul>\r\nAssets Used\r\n<ul><li>Tileset: https://s4m-ur4i.itch.io/huge-pixelart-asset-pack</li><li>Fonts: https://twitter.com/castpixel</li><li>SFX: https://jdwasabi.itch.io/8-bit-16-bit-sound-effects-pack</li><li>BGM: https://dos88.itch.io/dos-88-music-library</li></ul>\r\nTools\r\n<ul><li>Game Engine: Game Maker Studio 2</li></ul>Scoring<p>Score is determined by:\r\n</p><p>(Seconds given to complete the level - Seconds taken to complete the level) * 2</p>\n<p>Then clamped to positive values only.</p>\n<p>Note: Seconds taken to complete includes when the level reset.
