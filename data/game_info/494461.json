It tests your ability to combine hands and eyes. When you are bored to rest, it will bring you a pleasant and relaxing experience. In every round, you have to use humans reasonably to deal with aggressive monsters. There are at most five levels for each human or monster, which are-common, advanced, legend, antiquity, and creation.<h3>Unit Characteristics</h3><br/>Each kind of human or monster has very distinctive characteristics; as the unit is upgraded, the characteristics will be strengthened; players need to prescribe the right medicine to win each round very easily.<h3>Randomness</h3>In each round, monsters will be generated on random roads at random times. Sometimes monsters swept in before you had a reaction. Sometimes, you have carefully laid out the monsters, but the monsters have been slow to show up; therefore, it makes you unpredictable, which adds fun.<br/><br/>After passing 4-9, the monster will hide its characteristics, and every round will be a random level, which is the ultimate test for you!<h3>Freedom</h3><br/>After passing 4-9, you can freely assemble units, and human units will add new features of superior strikes. Therefore, if you correctly assemble the units, it is the only way to deal with random levels!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T02:26:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70d/70d25858632702e796425bf3c9f246a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 223, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZPFGAME"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ZPFGAME"], "esrb_rating": null}
