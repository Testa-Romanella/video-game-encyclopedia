This is a topdown adventure game, where your goal is to find a purple gem and to shatter it; but to be able to damage it, you first have to slay 30 skeletons. Sounds like a lot, huh ? Don't worry too much about this, you'll find a lot of them on your way.</p><p>However the graveyard containing the gem is cursed : as soon as you set foot on its evil ground, a totally spooky ghost will come to haunt and chase you ! <br/></p><p>The map opens up once you clear the opening area, so you'll have to explore the graveyard to find clues as to where that gem could be. Good luck !<br/></p>\r\nControls :\r\n<p>Arrow Keys - Move</p>\n<p>X - Attack</p>\n<p>F - Fullscreen</p>Credits<p>Game - TaliOS</p><p>Rain + thunder ambiance - https://opengameart.org/content/rain-and-thunders</p><p>Scream sound effect (when the player dies) - https://opengameart.org/content/512-sound-effects-8-bit-style</p><p>Pretty much everything else - Kenney, of course !<br/></p>\r\nThanks for playing !", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T04:22:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb7/eb715808e3f5be13d9d6e591152d8df6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TaliOS"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
