Murdered by the bastard Edward Green. Taking up the way of the revolver, you swore to make your old companion\u00a0pay for what he did to you.</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>Six years have passed but you've finally tracked him down. He's hiding somewhere in Slate City, a ruined town you once called home.\u00a0You'll find him, by God, and so long as you've a single bullet in your chamber and a breath in your chest he won't be leaving this town alive.</em></p>\n<p><em>And if you run out of bullets? Well, maybe you can just chuck your gun at his head.</em></p>\n\r\nDescription\r\n<p>Six Shots is a Twine-based text-adventure game with a focus on player choice and branching narrative paths. Your cowboy or cowgirl comes equipped with a revolver that can be fired on almost any screen in the game. It's up to you to decide whether to conserve your bullets and aid the denizens of\u00a0Slate City\u00a0or blast\u00a0anything that crosses your path. Perhaps your vengeance will be realized... or perhaps you'll just end up in cowboy hell.</p>\n\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>A good lot of text</li><li>Weird characters, most of whom are old, insane, or old and insane</li><li>More cowboy-ese than you could ever want or need</li><li>Some darn swell audio</li><li>The ability to murder your horse and anything else that happens to cross your path</li><li>Wind sounds</li></ul>\n\r\nPersonal Note\r\n<p><strong>Hey!
