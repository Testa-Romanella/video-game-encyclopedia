Huntober was made in one month for Devtober 2018! Not everything was implemented into the game due to important personal stuff coming up that required me to take a break from the project. It was fun making this game and I learned a lot from it. Special thanks to @ThisIsEllian(Twitter) for making the devtober tweet. I know the thanks isn't needed but if I didn't see it the game wouldn't exist and I would have learned nothing this month haha.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca2/ca29797d4dbd89dc2ad2064b6b390683.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WarticWare"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
