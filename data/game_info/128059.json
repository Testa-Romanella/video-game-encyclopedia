You must shoot down the other ships before they shoot you, but the black hole will affect everyone's shot trajectory. Be the first to get to 10 kills and you win!</p>\n<p>This game was made as part of a weekend game jam in June 2017, and was cleaned up over the following weeks to be featured in a cash tournament at ReplayFX, a gaming convention in Pittsburgh, PA.\u00a0https://replayfx.org/<br/><br/><strong>Note:\u00a0</strong>The game is <strong>local multiplayer only</strong> - there is no single-player mode. It also requires each player to have an <strong>Xbox 360 controller</strong>, as it uses XboxCtrlrInput for input - <strong>other controllers are not supported natively, and a controller is required to play</strong>. An Xbox 360 controller emulator such as x360ce may work but has not been tested.\u00a0<br/>See https://github.com/x360ce/x360ce#readme\u00a0(x360ce) and\u00a0https://github.com/JISyed/Unity-XboxCtrlrInput\u00a0(XboxCtrlrInput)\u00a0for details.</p>\n<p>View and play more games at www.ironpencil.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca7/ca74e71fafe069e462d4ac867299ef75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ironpencil"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
