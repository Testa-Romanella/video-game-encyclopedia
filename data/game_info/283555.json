Make sure to share your thoughts on my stuff (games etc), by rating it and writing a comment to help me improve my work, so that I can become more successful. I use Aseprite for my pixel art. I usually do 16 by 16 pixels when I do my pixelated tilesets. Aseprite's a great way to make tilesets, characters or sprites, or just pixel art in any form.</p><p>Follow my Facebook page!:\u00a0 \u00a0 (https://www.facebook.com/GonsoGames-775323316155965/?modal=admin_todo_tour)</p><p>Follow my Twitter!:  (https://twitter.com/GonsoGames)<br/></p>\n\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/335/335cb2c8b743661ab2c80e05ee215423.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gonso Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
