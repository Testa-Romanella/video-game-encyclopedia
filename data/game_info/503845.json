Academy which travel both Space and Time. Unfortunately your buddy cannot push a button any further than his gigantic \"nose\"... Damn, these arms are so short... So now you're lost somewhere, someday or any combination of these. The only thing you can be sure is that's not the first time you are reviving this moment. Instead of complaining yourself try leveraging your memories of the past future to do better this future time. <br/></p>\n<p>Try solving the puzzle by leveraging your past dead versions of yourself. Once a level is solved, just try doing better and beat the highest scores which in fact are the smallest number of steps. Just move your Dino's character with [ZQSD or WASD or Arrows] and interact with your environment. Pay attention to any trap that can occur including the copies of your past lives.</p>\r\nControls\r\nKeyboard\r\n<p>Movements : ZQSD/WASD/Arrows</p>\r\nTeam\r\n<ul><li>Fran\u00e7ois Mauge</li>\n<li>Vincent Schneider</li>\n<li>Nyckos</li>\n<li>Fabien Kalinowski</li>\n<li>Quentin Chevalier</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T09:07:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/126/126489db24b831cc922a7b996b2a5ebd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["hadesfury"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
