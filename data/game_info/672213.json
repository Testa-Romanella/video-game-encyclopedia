In my project I thought of a way to make sharing knowledge a core mechanic of the game. </p>\n<p>The game-play consists of two stages: map preparation and exploration. To best experience the game play with your friend. You should swap roles of the mapmaker and the explorer every level. The role of the mapmaker is to select information in such way, so that the explorer may escape the invisible maze. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Key rules of the game:</strong><br/>1. Select the tiles you want to keep visible.<br/>2. Other tiles disappear when you hit the \"let's go!\" button.<br/>3. Now, let your friend navigate through this invisible maze. (Move with <strong>WSAD</strong>)<br/>4. They can only see the tiles you've selected.<br/>5. You <strong>earn a point</strong> if your friend manages to reach <strong>one of the crowns</strong>.<br/>6. Keep away from: <strong>Skulls</strong> and<strong> Fires</strong>. Stay close to <strong>Hearts</strong>.</p>\n<p>Music, design, UI and code done by me, third party assets used under appropriate licenses.<br/></p>\n<p>My Backtrace Instance: https://share.backtrace.io/api/share/LiMJBszdwMsI7grlcuHQT3</p>\n<p>My details: Solo dev - Micha\u0142 \u015alusarski (afterlato), 21, email: mslusarski2@gmail.com<br/></p>\n<p>Gameplay: </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T09:10:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb1/bb1440c3283bf96d8bfd8028e8584de3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["afterlato"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
