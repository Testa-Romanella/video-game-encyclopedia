You can pick up shotgun shells by touching them with your character and pressing space to load shells individually. In the top right of your screen is a series of numbers, two side by side and one below. The number below is your score, each killed zombie adds 10 points. Side by side, the left number is what is in the chamber of your shotgun. Your shotgun holds a maximum of 8 shells, and on the right of that number is your total shells in which you can load into your gun by pressing space.</p>\n<p>Any questions you have feel free and comment below!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/091/091aaa9cbad801e5ffe4b1dddda9a3f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wenchunable"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
