It features a full set of different weapons and some can be upgraded to perform better. Kill enemies by moving around the map with right click and attacking them with right click. Go to the shop to buy new weapons with your hard earned cash to defeat the current hive and move onto the next one. Each colour represents a different enemy type with a different behaviour and stats.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-28T04:11:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24a/24a091c9b24d6a230adeab9450ea69d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wesleystander"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
