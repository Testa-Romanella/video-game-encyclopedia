Those days, and those people,\u00a0have long passed. Malevolent forces laid siege to the colony, and now the only things that live there are the combat drones left behind to defend what is left of their home.\r\nYou are an autonomous combat android, sent into Vesta with one purpose: destroy all the hostile machines and make Vesta a safe haven again.</p>\n<p><em>Vesta: Absolution</em>\u00a0offers two approaches to combat. Run and gun in the ranged stance to take down foes from a distance, or go head-on in the melee stance to stagger enemies and lock them in a deadly combo. Switch between stances at will to suit your surroundings!</p>\r\nOur Team\r\n<p><strong>Brian Patterson</strong><br/><strong>Austin Huffman</strong><br/><strong>Chris Budden</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-25T06:24:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea6/ea6aceae09bfb0d61aea3f142e915eb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Christopher Budden"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
