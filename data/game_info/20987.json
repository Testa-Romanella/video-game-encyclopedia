The game thrusts players into a world of freelance space hunters in the XXI-XXII century A.D. during a time of political crisis for the all-powerful Empire and the three mega-corporations that control all the known worlds. Corruption prospers planet-side and only space can give a man his freedom, but not without a cost: space is not a safe place anymore. Human space pirates, rogue AI computers that rebelled against humanity and empire patrol ships roam space in search of easy prey.<br />\nPlayers begin the game as a bounty hunter with little more than an old, run-down space fighter and a dream, but as they advance in the game and prosper, their piloting and battle skills improve, allowing access to more advance spacecraft. Players can control a party of up to six bounty hunters, each possessing different skills, abilities and personality.<br />\nTeam tactics give players vast opportunities in battles when shear fire power isn&#39;t enough. Tactical ruses, planning and executing ambushes or deploying spaceships&#39; special abilities provide cunning commanders the ability to crush enemies according to their style of play.<br />\nSpectacular 3D real-time battle system<br />\nOriginal blend of tactical and action game play<br />\nVariety of missions and mission-types including stealth, hit and run and assault missions<br />\nNon-linear storyline and game play<br />\nSecondary and secret quests along with primary missions<br />\nOver 25 space fighters<br />\nDozens of energy and missile weapons<br />\nOver 40 missions<br />\nA choice of eight game characters, both male and female, to form your party<br />\nOriginal RPG system</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2005-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-24T12:11:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f3/6f35b76899916d3a1d240216f60bedff.jpg", "website": "http://www.1cpublishing.eu/game/star-wolves/overview", "rating": 4.0, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 26, "owned": 622, "beaten": 20, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 5, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 36, "suggestions_count": 342, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 36, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["X-Bow Software"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["1C-SoftClub", "1C Company"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
