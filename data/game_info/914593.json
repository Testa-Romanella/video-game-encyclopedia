In ancient Egypt, the solar boat of Ra is overturned during the night, plunging the world into an imperishable night. Different Egyptian gods will then help each other and defeat hordes of enemies. The armies of Apophis will do anything to prevent you from bringing the Sun back to life.</p>\n<p>The USP is the use of the Hieroglyphs: the player can set up to five Hieroglyphs to get various power ups. Since hieroglyphs each have their own meaning, combining some of them will give the player powerful additional bonuses. It's up to the player to find the combinations and experiment with different gameplay guided by these power ups.</p>\n<p>|</p>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>Only mouse.<br/>You just need to move your character, all shots are automatic.<br/>Kill enemies and collect souls to level up.<br/>Double click on the screen when your character is on a pressure plate to trigger the traps.</p>\n<p>|</p>\n<p>Our 2 months team:</p>\n<p>Director artist: <strong>Mathias Jouffre</strong><br/>2D/UI artist: <strong>Marie Najean</strong><br/>Character artist: <strong>Hugo Mathieu</strong><br/>Character artist: <strong>Margaux Fleur-Bontout</strong><br/>Producer/Dev: <strong>Maxence Rerat</strong><br/>Lead GD/Dev: <strong>Alexandre Chateau</strong><br/>Game designer: <strong>Alexandre Mitranescu</strong><br/>Lead level designer: <strong>Kilyan Fernandez</strong><br/>Level designer: <strong>Thibaud Bailly</strong><br/>Narrative designer: <strong>Charles de Launay</strong></p>\n<p>PS: The game music is\u00a0<em>Kingdom of Nasrad</em> from <em>Skies of Arcadia</em>\u00a0(game by Overworks, 2000)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T14:46:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdc/bdc56fef5ad7b2fb1bb7d540735174a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rerat Maxence"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
