The theme was \"roots\". The object is\u00a0to destroy the evil tree monster\u00a0that is taking over the woods. You have to burn down the roots that grow up from the ground with your torches, before they take over the whole place. You'll need to pick up a torch and light it from the campfire, and then start burning the evil roots. They take around 3 seconds each to light and your torch only lasts a minute before you'll need to relight it. Also, a new root grows every 20 seconds, so there's no time to lose. (This was started with the intent of it becoming a multiplayer VR game, but the networking stuff got broken along the way. It still works in a single player mode. I may fix this in a future update.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-18T00:05:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22f/22f244546b0add28eafa12a3fb9dff9c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Greg Squire"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
