It's a work in progress project. I decided to upload it to Itch to get some opinions form other users.</p>\n<p>For now it's endless game without storyline. You start the game near a temple which holds a hatch\u00a0\u00a0to the maze. The big square in the sky is the map for the first level generated. Blue color is just regular maze, orange is a special room, green and purple are secret smaller maze which are empty at the moment but can provide a shortcut. White color for now\u00a0is an empty inaccessible place.</p>\n<p>You start with a 3x3 maze and every time you go deeper it increases maze size by 1 to a max size of 10x10. From level 5 and above a dungeon will spawn.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of each level there is a machine that summarizes Your progress in current level.</p>\n<p>If you stumble across a stone in a wall, that will be a button for a secret passage to smaller maze.</p>\n<p>To help You go through the maze You can leave marks on sand patches while having an empty hand. While running you will leave footprints on the sand.\u00a0You can leave scratch marks on other floors but you have to have an item equipped. With a torch in your hand You can light other light sources by pressing right mouse button.</p>\n<p>In the maze and in the dungeon You can find places to mine and dig for different resources. For the moment the are 12 ores, 15 items that can be found while digging or destroying stone veins. A dig area can have a treasure buried.\u00a0\u00a0If a treasure is spawned a map to this\u00a0also will be generated. Note that the X on the map only shows the entrance to the dig area not the position of the treasure. The treasure chests are empty at the moment. There are 7 chest, 2 creates and one barrel to dig out. To dig or mine just press and hold \"LMB\" for 2-3 seconds to do one swing or hold RMB constantly while aiming at an ore, rock or dirt vein.</p>\n<p>Dig area, ore veins and rock veins are generated using 3d peril noise and build using Marching Cubes algorithm.</p>\n<p>In the game You can interact with almost every item. With an empty hand you can move and drag items.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is an inventory in the game but it's made inaccessible on purpose. But there is an option to retrieve last item put in the inventory. Just press \"Q\". You also have a belt but for now You cannot equip anything to it. There are 4 items assigned by default. A pickaxe for mining ores and stone veins. Shovel for digging in the dirt. Torch for a light source and one candle that can be placed while digging in a dark place\u00a0:).</p>\n<p>The color of the crosshair indicates what can You do with an item. Brown is digging, grey and light blue is mining, yellow is writing on sand, green is interaction. Dark blue means yo can move and drag object. And few other indicating different hand actions like grabbing placing.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>Arrow keys, \"WASD\" - to move</p>\n<p>\"LSHIFT\" - run</p>\n<p>\"SPACE\" - jump</p>\n<p>Mouse to look around, \"LMB\" - to use item, interact with objects, \"RMB\" - is used to cancel item placement or throwing.
