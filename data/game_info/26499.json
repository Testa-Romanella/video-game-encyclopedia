Simply set \n      up your personal profile and then start entering events. Adding events \n      is easy: Choose a date for the event, decide whether it will be an open \n      event (which you name yourself) or a set event (chosen from the School, \n      Work or General Events categories), and select an icon from the wide \n      variety of available options. If necessary, you can set the recurrence \n      of the event or even move the event to the Hidden Events List. From \n      there, the calendar does the rest - just watch the days count down! On \n      subsequent visits to the application, you may see special greetings or \n      suggested seasonal events you can choose to add to your calendar. All \n      events added to the calendar are displayed chronologically, so you can \n      quickly view all of your upcoming events in one place.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea3/ea3b65b1093fa3252f0c41aefd8b3997.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Pixel Federation"], "esrb_rating": null}
