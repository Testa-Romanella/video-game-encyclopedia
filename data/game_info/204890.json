There won't be a block in its more developed stages, I just wanted to get the prototype out there for testing to see if you like the coin and weird additions to it.\u00a0</p><p>Controls are simple:</p><p>Space to jump\u00a0and R to restart - that is all you really need to know.</p><p>If you want to see this game get better, consider leaving a comment to encourage me. I often give up because of the lack of encouragement so if you want to help me even more\u00a0 please consider given me a few cents. It is not much but it will be the only way to trick my brain into thinking that I could make a living off of programming games.</p><p>If you have downloaded the game, thanks :).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34f/34f6b7cede934d34dc48a5f2ec2dd08b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CrazygamingfabGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
