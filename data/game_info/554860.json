If you have the opportunity to (safely) gather some friends around the couch to try it out, I'd be grateful for any feedback!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T03:14:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c7/6c72b693039f8beaebc6e444c99b72a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ian Magenta"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
