This pioneering work is a very early example of vertical scrolling in a videogame. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn this maze game, you must guide Alice to the top of the building before her oxygen supply runs out and without being caught by the vicious Space Mice! Power-ups allow her to punch through brick walls and send those interstellar vermin flying!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis simple, but deep gameplay still keeps players coming back for more, core qualities common to any classic and hasn\u2019t faded even after 35 years. We hope you will enjoy Space Mouse for many years to come!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd5/cd5da43d4f895ff5d64e89f9f46524bb.jpg", "website": "http://www.pinball.co.jp/games/SpaceMouse/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 18, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mindware Co.,Ltd."], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mindware Co.,Ltd."], "esrb_rating": null}
