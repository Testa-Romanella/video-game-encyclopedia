The purpose of creating Doodle Defenders was for my application to the Laguna College of Art and Design for their Art of Game Design MFA program. The entire game was created in Unity 3D by myself in seven months (approximately 250 hours) while working and attending school full time. During development, I learned more about sprite animation, pathfinding, and procedural generation.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e6/7e6682dabf46a8d8e63582c8e308dee3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brandon Cluff"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
