The goal is to get them all into the laserbeam of the spaceship, where they will be beamed up (and get teleported to another planet).</p><p>The player is not supposed to put a predator in with a herbivore. This will deduct points from the players score. Due to lack of time, there is no feedback to the player about this, nor is there a button to teleport currently held dinosaurs... </p><p>Made in Unity as a 2 day project at SPLASH jam 2016.</p><p>Credits:</p><p>Josh Naylor - Programmer (and our Unity expert)</p><p>Kristine Jorskogen - Programmer</p><p>Dragica Kahlina - Music and sound</p><p>Karoline O.
