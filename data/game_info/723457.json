Even if you don't like beans, this game is still fun!</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>BeansGame.io is a game of red light, beans light. Collect as many beans as possible to get the most points out of 5 players, and win! (multiplayer not yet tested.)</p>\r\nSource code\r\n<p>You may use the source code as long as you credit me. The file is an sb3, so if you want to make a mod, you'll need to use Scratch.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T06:18:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/108/10847641d5c2b58c438df5bd155b9ce6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kawaii-Kowai Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
