Z to restart from the game over screen.</p>Commentary<p>Quick thing I banged out for #7DRL, sadly in the same week my own dog died. Guide the roguelike dog through the rooms and floors of this dungeon, which get ever more dangerous each floor. How far can you make it?</p><p>The main actors are:</p><p>Dogue: Move with arrow keys, in rogue-like fashion. Wait as long as you like between moves.</p><p>Skeletons: Creep up to you and damage you if you're next to them. Move into them to kill them.</p><p>Meat: Pick up to replenish moves. You only have so many before you die of exhaustion!</p><p>Hearts: Pick up to replenish lives. You need these for when skeletons attack!</p><p>It's that simple. Hope you enjoy!</p><p>I won't be mad if you mute the music, I spent about 10 minutes on it.</p><p>Lexaloffle BBS thread: here.</p><p>#1GAM March 2017.</p><p>#7DRL March 2017.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cec/cec3a998942436c5ed0a048552304f26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PROGRAM_IX"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
