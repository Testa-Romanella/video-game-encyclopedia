The Unity game engine was used to develop a Universal Render Pipeline project, sample scene GameObjects were removed, and then the project was compiled for play. The resultant WebGL build\u00a0and\u00a0downloadable\u00a0Win10\u00a0build are then capable of rendering Unity's interpretation of the void.</p>\n<p>Please note that the downloadable version of <strong>\"Void: A non-interactive art installation\"</strong> is licensed for personal use only.
