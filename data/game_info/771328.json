However, not all is as it seems as characters are wrought with personal conflicts and biases. Three years prior to the beginning of the game, Ari abandoned the family pursuing their own interests, burdening all of the Kinzo\u2019s expectations onto their younger sibling Ferris. Due to a tragedy revolving around Os Kinzo, the mother of the siblings, Ari returns to ensure that the forge does not succumb to financial ruin. Now the siblings must decide if they are able to work together to support the forge and perhaps even re-establish the relationship they lost.\r\n</p>\n<p>In the game, the player is able to forge various items commissioned by the residents of Bisport as well as merchants from all over the region. Additionally, the player is able to complete puzzles that incrementally become harder in order to enchant the commissions with useful stats such as an increase in durability. The player is able to buy their materials from vendors across the town of Bisport but be sure to carefully manage your finances as a tax is collected every night.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Become a part of the family business and we hope you enjoy On A Wire.\r\n</p><p>The Team,</p><p>Danice Pe Benito, Aria Maghsoodlou, Ryan Chan, Laura Fleming, Jon Lafuente, Alex Akopyan, Mark Haddleton, Josh Haddleton, Joseph Wolf<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T04:15:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e65/e65bb256380df90712557c45db26bf4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ArcaneAnvilStudios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
