The theme was \"Don't Give Up!\".<br/><br/>You have one minute to complete the tiny rally! Driving through checkpoints will give you extra time to reach the finish line. Drive through the rings on the course to score points! If you don't make it to the end, you'll still earn points as long as you don't give up prematurely. Your points\u00a0can be used to purchase cosmetics and an extra car with different handling.<br/><br/>Can you make it to the end?<br/><br/>Credits:<br/><br/>Iain MacQuarrie (Programming, Game Design, Level Design, Logo)<br/>-\u00a0https://twitter.com/IainMacQuarrie<br/><br/>Cynabun (3D Art, Textures)<br/>-\u00a0https://twitter.com/CynabunEralyn</p>\n<p>Gasparatus (Music)<br/>-\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/gasparatus<br/></p>\n<p>Selena (SFX)<br/>-\u00a0https://twitter.com/dreiko_2000</p>\n<p>Special thanks to the following people, without which we would have never made it in time:<br/>JohannesMP<br/>-\u00a0https://github.com/JohannesMP</p>\n<p>Andr\u00e9 Cardoso<br/>-\u00a0https://twitter.com/andre_mc</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T02:31:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34b/34bfa1b6475bd0903e13cf4658344296.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["imacquarrie"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
