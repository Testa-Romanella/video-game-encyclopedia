The player has to create sound vibration by shooting on \"sound generators\" around the level, to progress in his environment. <br/><br/>This game was created during the Global Game Jam 2017, and a bit improved since.<br/><br/>Our main inspirations were Portal, and Quantum Conundrum too. Thanks for cheking it out, and don't hesitate to leave a feedback ! :D<br/><br/></p><p>Credits: </p><p>Project manager :</p><ul><li>Nicolas Leal</li></ul><p>Game &amp; Level Designers :</p><ul><li>Thomas Teply</li><li>Martin Defosse</li><li>Nicolas Leal</li><li>Alexandre Rogier</li><li>Valentin Cl\u00e9ment</li></ul><p>Technical Game Designers :</p><ul><li>Thomas Teply</li><li>Martin Defosse</li><li>Valentin Cl\u00e9ment</li></ul><p>3D Artist :</p><ul><li>Quentin Valenti</li></ul><p>Sound Designer :</p><ul><li>Maia Steinberg</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a6/3a652ceb83c8124da0d447de9d634362.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Revan76"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
