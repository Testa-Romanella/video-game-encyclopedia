The village is filled with all sorts of colourful characters to meet and befriend. Sure, they might have some favours to ask of you, but helping them out might bring unexpected rewards! When you\u2019re not hanging out with the villagers or working on the farm, you could be pursuing a new hobby, completing one of many collections, spending your hard earned money in the local stores, or working on improvements to the village. Your new neighbors would certainly appreciate your help!<br />\nNurture Your Farm<br />\nPut down your roots and settle into your life as the village\u2019s new farmer. Starting out with an old, run-down home and farmland reclaimed by the wilderness, it\u2019s up to you to turn this place around. Plant seeds, carefully tend to your crops, take care of your animals, and build improvements to your farm. Don\u2019t forget\u2010if you look after your farm it will look after you!<br />\nCustomise Your Sandbox<br />\nStaxel is set in a voxel-based sandbox world. You can alter your surroundings in any way you like, and with a rich selection of in-game materials and a simple, easy-to-use approach to modding, you really can create your own unique world within the game. Will you grow the village while keeping its rustic charm, or take it in an entirely new direction? Perhaps you\u2019d rather leave the village and focus on your own projects? It\u2019s all up to you, and your creativity is just the tool for the job!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-08T20:26:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/747/74721edfb9995d8748b46cec37115e52.jpg", "website": "http://playstaxel.com/", "rating": 2.86, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 68, "owned": 768, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 11, "dropped": 29, "playing": 5}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 28, "ratings_count": 44, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 44, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Plukit"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Humble Bundle"], "esrb_rating": null}
