Following a devastating, apocalyptic event, the world is filled with garbage, abandoned structures and angry robot turrets and it is your mission to clean it from this dusty mess.<br/><br/>The gameplay revolves around the player-controlled Round Thingy of Destruction that you have a full 360-degree control over, making smashing the iron ball so much more satisfying. But you must remember not to lose your ball. Behind you there\u2019s a metal grinder in each level ready to consume all of the balls (stop giggling, Gregg) you are too slow to repel.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But <strong>DESTRUCTURE</strong> is no ordinary arkanoid-like game, because the levels fight back! Destroy enough structures and you will alert some bloodthirsty turrets, and trust us, they are definitely not happy to see you. Using all your finesse, you must dodge their bullets, missiles, lasers and other looming dangers and the more you destroy, the more you have to dodge. Bullet hell aficionados rejoice!<br/><br/>If you\u2019re lucky you might stumble upon mighty weapons and power ups to use in the spur of the moment. It\u2019s like finding a nickel on the side-walk, but the nickel is a rocket launcher or a laser gun and the side-walk is the debris of a structure that once had some semblance of purpose.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Progressing through the world of <strong>DESTRUCTURE</strong> is a tough and unforgiving job. For one, there are evil robots trying to murder you and the environments are filled with various hazards. That\u2019s why your benefactors have provided you with a wide array of unlockable tools, upgrades and perks that should provide enough leverage to give you a fighting chance. They\u2019re not free though, so remember to collect Blue Stuff (whatever it is) that your benefactors will use for very important deeds no one really knows or indeed cares about. You\u2019d be best suited collecting as much as you possibly can. That is, if you don\u2019t get shot while you\u2019re at it! <br/><br/>With this Blue Stuff you can purchase exciting new toys like \u201cZeus\u2019 Blessing\u201d, \u201cSuicidal Turrets\u201c or just some good old \u201cNapalm Rain\u201c to ascend the ranks of ordinary, trash-fighting Round Thingys of Destruction! and become the ultimate destroyer of what remains of the dusty, barren worlds of <strong>DESTRUCTURE</strong>.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T03:42:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/473/473239e3dc3f5247de4c4e66d3613d9f.jpg", "website": "https://rockgame.pl", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 31, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 290, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team Instant Defeat"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["RockGame"], "esrb_rating": null}
