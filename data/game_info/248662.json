The people that are interested in caving are usually in a good physical condition since the caves are not easily reachable so they ask for some effort if you like to get to one. The proper physical preparation is also needed for surviving in the cave. The person that does that should be prepared for proper breathing; should have the right equipment\u2026 Accidents happen but if the person is prepared enough, he/she is safe to get anywhere.<br/><br/>However, there is one particular cave that seems to be under a bad reputation, and that is completely justified. Lori and Adam are leaders of an expedition that has intention to explore that particular cave. Many people that have entered into this cave in order to see what is hiding there never came out so this cave is called the cave of the death.<br/><br/>Adam and Lori lead this expedition so they feel a huge responsibility about the whole thing. They have been to numerous places, climbed numerous high mountains and visited many caves but this situation is unique. It seems as this place doesn't like any visitors and the ones that were brave enough to come there, never came out. At the moment they are at the precise location, together with their group so it is time the research to begin.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:12:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd0/fd01c285d17708e99e0a8672d853ac21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 299, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["wang kai"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["wang kai"], "esrb_rating": null}
