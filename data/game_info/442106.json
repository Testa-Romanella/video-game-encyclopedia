Made in Unity.</p>\n<p><strong>THEME: Orange Expansion<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>You play as an orange, competing with the other fruits on the farm for fertile land. Be first to conquer 9 fields to win the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We wanted to add multiplayer\u00a0but didn't have the time nor enough knowledge of unity networking, so you have to play against our mediocre bots instead.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Move your mouse to steer your orange. The faster you move the bigger you get. If you are big enough compared to another fruit you can smash it by running it over. Plays kinda like agar.io.<br/></p>\n<p>github link<br/></p>\n<p>Made by Frans &amp; Isak</p>\n<p>Art by Jottis</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T03:44:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1aa/1aa1b7b7c5bc6e3335a2fca1a184d448.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["pyrbin"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
