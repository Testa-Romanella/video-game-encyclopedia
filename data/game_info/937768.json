You will be on a timer, and you can compete with other people by putting your times in the comment section of the game. Your goal is to reach to the portal located somewhere within the maze as fast as possible. There is always going to be 1 path that can reach the goal.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>GOAL</strong><br/>As a player, every time you hit a dead-end in the maze, the dead-end will become your new start. The maze will slightly adapt around you to narrow down the possible routes to the goal. Even though the maze will be updating, there will always be 1 goal and 1 path to reach it. The goal may move further away from you (according to your new starting position) but a portion of the maze will be removed narrowing your choices every time you hit a dead end. Unlike most maze running games where reaching dead ends wastes time, you have to think and strategize carefully and choose which dead ends you want to meet, or should I say, new beginnings you want to start at.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/>Movement:<br/>W = Forward<br/>A = Left<br/>S = Backward<br/>D = Right<br/>Space = Jump</p>\n<p>Utility:<br/>Escape = Pause/Unpause<br/>Reload Button = Regenerates the maze and resets your positions<br/>Teleport Button = Teleports you back to the beginning (last dead end) you reached<br/><br/>Made by BooleanCube :]<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T19:17:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/147/147964ccfe5beba5a8a30ea47371c33a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["BooleanCube"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
