Adventure through endless dungeons, fight monsters and defeat bosses!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe dungeons are procedurally generated in a cute low-poly style and the gameplay has a challenging but fun feel to match. The current build is pre-alpha and is little more than a demonstration of combat and terrain generation. In time a wide range of enemy types and multiplayer game modes will be introduced. There may be a Kickstarter campaign later in the year, so keep an eye out for it!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWebsite | Twitter | Facebook\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd7/cd7fe0c1af5026411a24ebe4eaae5edc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["8-Bit Ape"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
