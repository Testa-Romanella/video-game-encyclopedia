{"id": 693732, "slug": "komorebi-klace", "name": "Komorebi (Klace)", "name_original": "Komorebi (Klace)", "description": "<p>Klace returns with a third story, set on an Earth governed by fate and social discord. The year is 2041, and Komorebi dominates the world. A phenomenon that eludes understanding, causing people to regularly experience a vision of their future. The world is obsessed with \u201cfate\u201d. Obsessed with Komorebi; a word used to describe sunlight as it filters through the branches of trees. It's a simple and poetic metaphor for the visions filtering into this reality.\u00a0When the phenomenon began, the world was never the same.</p>\n<p>If Winds of Change was a story about how one person with visions (The Seer) can change the world, Komorebi is a story about how a world of visions can change one person on an intimate, personal level. A coming-of-age/slice of life story about a group of friends finding their way in a life that they believe may already be predetermined. Please note that while this world and the phenomenon of Komorebi are rather abstract, they allow for a realistic exploration into mental health topics that some may find distressing.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>JerryBerry and Nineki99 deliver stunning Environment and Character art.</p>\n<p>The game will be FULLY voice acted, by the following incredible cast.
