By sticking the sword in the ground, you're able to jump higher, but you become unable to attack. Many of the puzzles revolve around sticking the sword into interactive objects that transport it around the room to areas you wouldn't have been able to reach while holding it. With cataclysm on the horizon, it's up to you to ascend the ancient tower and recover the God Crystal, Gnosis.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For those of you who played last year's demo, most of the content here should feel familiar.\u00a0 However, there are a <strong>ton</strong> of new features included in this demo, such as:</p>\n<p>-Map Screen: The game now has a map screen!\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Redesigned Areas: Both the Outskirts and the Monastery feature new tilesets, background art, and re-designed layouts!</p>\n<p>-New enemies: Face off against fearsome foes! Many of the other enemies have improved AI as well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Health Upgrades: Collect all five emerald feathers and offer them to any save point to increase your maximum health!</p>\n<p>-Sword Upgrades: Use the Ore you collect from enemies and chests to unlock new attacks! In this demo, you can unlock Crawling Spark; a ranged attack that fires from the sword when your health is full.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p><strong>(On Keyboard)</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Move = Arrow Keys\r\n</p>\n<p>Jump = Space\r\n</p>\n<p>Attack = C\r\n</p>\n<p>Dodge = X\r\n</p>\n<p>Drop Sword = Z\r\n</p>\n<p>Map = M</p>\n<p><strong>(On Controller)</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Move = Left Joystick\r\n</p>\n<p>Jump = A (on xbox gamepad)\r\n</p>\n<p>Attack = X (on xbox gamepad)\r\n</p>\n<p>Dodge = Left Bumper\r\n</p>\n<p>Drop Sword = Y (on xbox gamepad)\r\n</p>\n<p>Map = Select</p>\n\n<p>Also, you can press f11 to change the window size.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you all so much</strong> for following me on this journey.
