Clean water and sanitation</li><li>13. Climate Action</li><li>14. Life below water</li><li>15. Life on Land</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>\n<p>RecycleAR is a fun little AR game reminiscent of \"pokemon go\" in which the player must fling the correct type of waste into the correct recycling bins.</p>\n<p>The player uses their mobile device to create an area of virtual land and trees on any flat surface, and is then tasked with keeping it alive as litter is constantly being dropped. If the land is left to fill up with rubbish or the incorrect bins are used then the virtual world will slowly degrade and die.</p>\n<p>Due to the AR nature of the game it is expected and encouraged for children to walk around their whole room in search of the dropped litter, flinging it into the stationary bins from any angle.</p>\n<p>There is no win state however, as taking care of the planet is a necessary and endless struggle, and it is impossible to keep our ecosystem healthy through solely reactive measures. The player will eventually be overrun with litter and experience first-hand how the the climate and land is changed due to excessive waste.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How To Set Up</strong>:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Scanning will begin on starting the game, move around your area and fully fill the surface you wish to play on with grass.</li><li>When you are happy with the coverage, tap on the grass where you would like to place the bins.</li><li>You can manipulate\u00a0the rotation and scale of the scene at this stage to provide the best game experience, then tap the \"Confirm\" button. The world will populate with trees and litter will\u00a0 be dropped.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p><strong>How To Play:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>You can pick up litter by tapping on it, and can then fling it by swiping.</li><li>When the correct type of waste is put in the correct bin the state of the world will be maintained or improved.</li><li>If the wrong waste is put in the wrong bin, or rubbish is left on the ground then the ecosystem will be negatively affected.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Development Team:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Krzysztof P\u0142awski</li><li>Adam Williamson</li><li>Meggan Gumbrell</li><li>B\u0142a\u017cej P\u0142awski</li><li>Adam Tunnicliffe</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T03:11:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbf/bbf89ace73d7a2073e6709ee937b49ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Parse(Nips);"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
