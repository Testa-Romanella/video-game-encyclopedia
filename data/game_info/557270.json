This one questions how we talk about how we feel/what we feel. And in it, there is a box that is labled to contain a beetle. If everyone got one box and everyone had a different thing inside, we would still call that thing a beetle since that is the word given to us to describe it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is not about knowing what the other's boxes contain, it is about recognising that it may differ from what I have in my box aka that other people's experiences may be fundamentally unlike mine. I cannot, just by considering my own beetle, make adequate conclusions about your beetle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I have been reading too much philosophy in the past three weeks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can also just throw the lid around, go live your best life.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T09:08:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/451/451b6bba52f2954a027da2d9d9fdccf4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["singingstranger"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
