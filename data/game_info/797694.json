This game is called \"Police Runner\" where you are a police officer running around in the city . I made a rage game to be specific.</p>\n<p>You basically need to avoid obstacles by collecting stars and the same level loops again as the theme was \" death is only the beginning\" so I decided to make a Rogue-like endless runner with one level which loops itself untill the player dies , the goal of the player is to collect as many stars as possible , This game can be used to compete with friends and see how far you get or how more or less stars you and your friends collect .\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>I had fun creating this game , it is not the best I can do OBVIOUSLY! But it was a great experience in programming and making game assets all by myself excluding the buildings as buildings were\u00a0\u00a0stolen......I mean taken from kenny assets\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Here is the link to those assets :-\u00a0https://kenney.nl/assets/city-kit-commercial\u00a0</p>\n<p>and Here is the link to my source code :-\u00a0<strong>https://github.com/Jai-Khatri/GameDev.tv-Game-Jam-PoliceRunner-Code</strong></p>\n<p>A huge thank you to GameDev.TV for hosting this game jam as it improved my game development skills overall .</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for reading till the end!\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T22:31:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd6/fd600628b471e9ad9be7a2a0b39b9c4f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ELLEP"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
