I may have gone a little wide with the idea, but when I heard the theme of the contest was \"Obey,\" it made me think of Soldiers. And from there, I worked the idea until it became a little turn based strategy engine.<br/><br/>The thing about this genre though, is that it doesn't lend itself well to being developed quickly. So I had to think about what that meant. And I decided: I'd make the maps really, really small. Comically small. And I'd make the missions overly-directly and kind of silly. Unfortunately... even then, the time constraint took its toll on me. I only really had time to develop two of the classes that I had in mind (Soldier, and Magician).<br/><br/>Still, I'm kind of happy with how it came out. Don't take it too seriously. Just check it out and grind some levels! There's no real end goal in the game as offered, aside from increasing your stats and putting out bigger numbers.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/502/502b53e345ea3a7734cd723f3627df01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Reversed2"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
