You can shoot using \"left mouse click\"<br/>The Game is pretty simple, you just have to shoot or dodge the \"Red Spikes\",<br/>but if the number of the red spike increases and you're\u00a0 unable to handle it any more, you can seek help from your \"AI Friend\" which can be brought instantly at your desired position by pressing \"Space\" or \"Enter\". They are pretty strong and will help you shoot\u00a0 the spikes. But , Alas!\u00a0 You cannot trust them all the time because the longer they live the chance of them turning against you increases. <br/></p>\n<p>Now that's why I would say \"Be careful when forging your AI Friend\". Do not trust anyone.</p>\n<p>This game was made in 3 days for BenBonk Game Jam#1.</p>\n<p>I would recommend you to Download the game, because the game isn't optimized for browser usage, you might feel the game is a bit slow and lagging.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Special thanks to Kenney.com for providing the arts and sound.</p>\n<p>The game is made using Godot game engine.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T06:05:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a3/2a38d7522d4a76578e71ee445f2f2a72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Darkest Lab"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
