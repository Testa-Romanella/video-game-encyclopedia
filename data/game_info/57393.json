Two years later, Nintendo released another game featuring Griffey, Major League Baseball Featuring Ken Griffey Jr., for the Nintendo 64.<br />\nThe game&#39;s title is derived from the final play of the 1995 American League Division Series featuring the Seattle Mariners and New York Yankees. On a play that is sometimes credited with &quot;saving baseball in Seattle,&quot; Griffey scored the game&#39;s winning run all the way from first base, on a close play in the bottom of the 11th inning.<br />\nDue to the lack of a Major League Baseball Players&#39; Association license, Griffey is the only player in the game to use his actual name.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-24T16:58:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/280/28008069f4cd1d77524f4aa8a50f0eae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 280, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["SNES"], "developers": ["Rare"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
