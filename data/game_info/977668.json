{"id": 977668, "slug": "psycholog", "name": "Psycholog", "name_original": "Psycholog", "description": "Step into the shoes of a psychologist at a small firm, specializing in treating various phobias. Managing your clients is hard enough. Vera Mills won't look at herself in the mirror. Jaden Thompson's social life suffers because of his fear of heights. And Ashley Taylor is obsessed with the thought that she's psychotic like her mother.<br/><br/>But the real ordeal starts when your clients come under attack. You are gradually alienated from your colleagues as the police find only one link: you. Who is attacking your clients one by one, in gruesomely ironic ways? Eventually, it's up to you to solve the chilling mystery and unmask the serial killer.<br/><br/><br/>PSYCHOLOG melds the storytelling of visual novels with the interactive elements of first-person point-and-click games. Engage in thought-provoking dialogue, make critical choices, and get to know your clients and their fears by using your empathy, finesse, and manipulation skills. Keep the trust of friends and colleagues.<br/><br/>Your choice of words during therapy sessions influences the narrative, leading to one of several distinct endings.<br/><br/><br/>The story unfolds in an oppressive urban setting where the sky is rarely visible, and a backrooms aesthetic permeates the bleak interiors.<br/><br/>The relentless onslaught of the game's stylized visuals amplifies the pressure and stress as those you're meant to help succumb to their worst nightmares.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-01T07:11:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aba/abaf67794103d405f72bba2fb9a62f43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 283, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nimavoha Interactive"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Nimavoha Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
