Using what tools he finds around him, the protagonist has to fight against rock monsters inhabiting the recesses of the cavern. The game encourages quick thinking, with fighting hinged on using weapons found around the environment and using materials to upgrade the player\u2019s abilities to assist in combating the creatures of the depths. The flashlight is the most important tool in the player\u2019s arsenal, being the main way to view and traverse the level, and importantly, visibly see enemies through the darkness. Dusk Hollow features multiple levels with unique themes and mechanics that challenges the player\u2019s use of both combat and flashlight mechanics.<br/><br/>This game was made in 4 months by a team of 5 designers, and 3 artists.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T04:54:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/321/32186c1c6b7dd4538ab3ee91a05c8992.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 452, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ryan (Gray) Nobles", "Gabe Colon", "David Sokolow", "Maliq Brown", "Shawn Singh"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BTTOT"], "esrb_rating": null}
