A handful of mighty Spartan warriors are ready to fight and stop the fierce enemies.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWarrior Next is a simple and intuitive action game with gameplay that takes seconds to figure out. Hordes of enemies will come from everywhere and you will need to level up as much as possible before going hunting for the mythological beast. Move your Spartans in 8 directions. Your attacks will be automatic so you'll only have to worry about avoiding enemies and carefully choosing which weapon and skill you want to upgrade.  Be careful because once you lose all your Spartans the game is over and you will have to restart the level from the beginning!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCONTROLS:<br/>\r\n- \"WASD\" to move.<br/>\r\n- \"ENTER\" to confirm the selections.<br/>\r\n- \"P\" to pause the game.<br/>\r\n- \"ESC\" to quit.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSTARTER TIPS:<br/>\r\n- Find more Spartans as soon as possible! They have been taken prisoner, free them!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Defeat the weakest enemies first!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- On the sides of the level there are very dangerous enemies. Leave the center part of the map when you are strong enough!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-16T08:21:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a36/a3643bd34d9d78022a1b56dcdac484a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Elder Leaf Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Elder Leaf Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
