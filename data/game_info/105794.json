A rebuild is being done.</p>\n<p>NOTE: The Demo game posted is not a teaser, like most demos. It is not a Beta of the game and not even an Alpha. It's whatever is before that.\u00a0The Gamma maybe? The Epsilon? Choose a greek letter you like and run with that.<br/>It's just something for other players to enjoy and give their input as the game is being built and evolves until Alpha/Beta stages are posted.<br/>The storyline will remain unchanged, though character appearances and music may change as the game is built.<br/>Any saved game of the\u00a0previous versions (v3.0 and below) must be deleted as they will not function properly (or at all) with the current version.</p>\n<p>========================================================<br/><br/>Have you ever wished to be in another world?</p>\n<p>Maybe you want to be part of a video game world.</p>\n<p>Maybe you want to be in the movie you just watched.</p>\n<p>Maybe you want to be with the heroes of your favorite book.</p>\n<p>We all wish to be part of a different world.</p>\n<p>Something exciting!</p>\n<p>Something thrilling!</p>\n<p>Something adventurous!</p>\n<p>Something better than the boring one we live in, at the very least.</p>\n<p>It's just a whimsical thought.
