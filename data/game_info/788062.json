{"id": 788062, "slug": "stress-less", "name": "Stress Less", "name_original": "Stress Less", "description": "<p>My entry for DeepWell DTX + Global Game Jam - May Day Mental Health Jam</p>\n<p>I present a game where you tackle Anxiety, the monster head-on. Draw random cards that either increase your anxiety or decrease. The game is endless, unless your Anxiety meter reaches 100%, where you would otherwise lose and be treated for medical care.</p>\n<p>Anxiety is tough to deal with for many. I myself have been diagnosed with General Anxiety. It is crazy how little stresses pile up and if left unattended can become extremely overwhelming. Doing things you enjoy and openly communicating about how you feel with someone really helps it feel like you never had anything to begin with. Don't let these times beat you up. Be productive and engaging, and let's please make it through another year with more joys in our lives. Be safe and happy, that's what matters most and the idea I'd like to communicate with this game!</p>\n<p>Be well. \u2764<br/></p>\n<p>~ BurterButterBeans Studio 5/19/2022<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T12:30:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0dc/0dc0a08b76cb8035b7cfa396ae5b6d10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["BurterButterBeans Studio"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
