I mean, the way back to town is pretty straightforward.\u201d<br/>...<br/><br/>Welcome to Hope, where most of the residents ironically don't have high hopes for their future.<br/><br/>The player plays as John Doe, just another life in the little town of Hope whose luck has hit rock bottom.

Or not.<br/><br/>Save money. Go broke paying rent.<br/><br/>Find love. Or be alone.<br/><br/>Buy a house and nice furniture. Or dream about it.<br/><br/>Help John reach his full potential.  Or give up on John forever.<br/><br/>Happiness can be found right around the corner. If John only knows where to look (or have someone point it out to him).
