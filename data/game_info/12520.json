Carlos (a programmer) and Max (an artist) share a love for simulation games and classic play -- which heavily influenced The Spatials, their first project. Inspired by the great classic sim games of the '90s, The Spatials combined classic base-building gameplay (based on isometric tile room building) with a real-time combat system and an exploration campaign. The Spatials was released on Steam in March 2015 and took off! Thanks to its success and growing fan base, The Spatials spawned a sequel -- The Spatials: Galactology, which updates the original concept with deeper gameplay and a whole new take on the space station management business.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-10T14:38:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a8/0a8910075f07bb31e1a1d453495b8935.jpg", "website": "http://thespatials.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 59, "dropped": 4, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 18, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 473, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Weird and Wry"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Weird and Wry"], "esrb_rating": null}
