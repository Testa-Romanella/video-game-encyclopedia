Speaking to certain characters will give you hints on what to do next. Clicking around at things that haven't been clickable before helps too. Realize that this game is mostly surrounded by one character. Remember to test different combinations of things and end the day to see results. There are 5 different things you'll see after ending a day. Crack the code on how it is determined... What would lead to a different ending? That's your job as a detective in this psychological mystery.. This is as much as I can tell you.\r\nGame Version Updated to 1.1 to include bug fixes and changes such as:<ul><li>Minor single line grammar fix.</li><li>Major bug fix which included certain end day phases to NOT work which made the game impossible to progress.</li><li>Changed it so you won't require to re-see the first \"ending\" to complete the game.
