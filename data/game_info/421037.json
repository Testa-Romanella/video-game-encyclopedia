If you're too scared/smart to go out and participate in the madness this game can help you experience it from home. Your goal is to collect 35 rolls of toilet paper, why, why not?! As far as you know this is the end. Be careful though, getting too rough with the other customers will set the cops on you. Run from them for about 15 seconds to get off the hook. Seems short, it's because they really don't want to touch you. As you play, the price of toilet paper will increase because this store is of the price gouging type. Since we're all quarantined, give this game a download to stimulate your mind and anger your soul.</p>\n\n<p>Note: Covid-19 is a serious thing and should be handled so.
