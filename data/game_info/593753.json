I am back with another game!</p>\n<p>I always wanted to make a neon-themed game so here it is. A remake of the classic block breaker. I am still a beginner learning unity, and while following up with an Udemy course, learners were\u00a0supposed to tweak the game and upload it online.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I spent way too much time tweaking it according to the way I wanted and gave it a complete makeover. I think I did justice to my idea.\u00a0 Also,\u00a0\u00a0learnt loads of stuff along the way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you guys enjoy it. :)</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing :)</p>\n<p><strong>Developer - Sahil Sharma</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>P.S</strong> - This is not a complete game. I have just established a foundation and will further develop it as I learn more about Unity game development. But until then, I hope you find this enjoyable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits :\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Music :\u00a0</p>\n<p>Free NCS Vaporwave trap beat by Karl Markus Hanevik<br/></p>\n<p>Jorge Hernandez - Chopsticks (NCS 8 bit music)<br/></p>\n<p>The Whole Other - 8-bit Dreamscape (NCS 8-bit music)<br/></p>\n<p>Home - We're Finally Landing [Synthwave]<br/></p>\n<p>EVA - \u5931\u671b\u3057\u305f  [Synthwave]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T06:28:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/098/098616c928ce62bb7061adbb7034bb91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["SnooRegrets"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
