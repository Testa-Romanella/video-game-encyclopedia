It is conventional to keep watch over groundhogs. If a groundhog steps out from its hole and sees its shadow, then it hides in the hole, the spring will come not earlier than in 6 weeks. If a groundhog doesn\u2019t notice its shadow and calmly steps out from its hole, the spring is coming.<br/><br/>\u2026Freddy the Groundhog have been sleeping in his hole. He has hoped to sleep as long as possible, but precisely on the 2nd of February he has been awaked by people who desire to know when the spring comes. Viciously yawning, Freddy rushes outside at the highest possible speed (considering his tubby figure, of course) to hunt away troublemakers and\u2026 also unintentionally predict the upcoming weather.<br/><br/>However, even the groundhog\u2019s hole may have too much light. Help the rodent reach the exit without seeing its shadow and scaring of it! Pass over light sources or move so that light falls on the groundhog in the front.<br/><br/><ul><li>Light sources may be moving and motionless - find a way to successfully pass over both types.<br/></li><li>Use the cunning, solve puzzles<br/></li><li>Complete all levels and prove that your groundhog is the smartest here!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:50:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e8/8e8ccef164c1c4e72a06bf873cb32bd6.jpg", "website": "http://wonderboxgames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Wonderbox Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Wonderbox Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
