This game is Neon themed so that all asset components in it are neon themed.<br/></p>\n<p>There are 3 modes in this game:</p>\n<ul><li>Player vs Player</li><li>Player vs AI</li><li>Expert Mode</li></ul>\n\n<p>In expert mode AI is made that is slightly more difficult to defeat, the difference between Player vs AI mode and Expert Mode is in the ball detection distance in the x axis and offset of the reflection of the ball. In \"Player vs. AI\" mode it will reflect the ball always right in the middle of the paddle, giving rise to straight momentum. While in \"Expert Mode\" there will be a random value to determine the offset of the paddle hit, so that it will allow the paddle hit ball not in the middle position but along the paddle. So that there will be a corner of the ball formed.</p>\n<p>In Super Pong Neon it also adds 4 types of skills to be used by the player to make it easier to enter the ball or prevent the ball from entering the wall point. 4 These types of skills are:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Resize Ball (Make the ball more larger)</li><li>Resize Paddle (Make the paddle more longer)</li><li>Speed Up Ball (Make the ball more faster)</li><li>Slow Down Ball\u00a0 (Make the ball slower from its normal speed)</li></ul>\n<p>Each skill has durability, the skill will not function again if the durability runs out. Each player is only allowed to use 1 skill until the durability is used up. There is a stack system for the skills obtained, each player is only able to have 3 skills, the rest will be discarded the lowest stack skill. To get the skill there will be a random spawn item that will come out in the middle of the map, so that players can get it. The status that gets the skill is the paddle that last touched the ball.</p>\n\n<p>How to Play</p>\n<p>Player 1 :</p>\n<ul><li>W : Move Up</li><li>S : Move Down</li><li>X : Use Skill</li></ul>\n<p>Player 2 :</p>\n<ul><li>I: Move Up</li><li>K : Move Down</li><li>M : Use Skill</li></ul>\n<p>Note : Player 2 Controller only can be used if using\u00a0\"Player vs Player\" mode.</p>\n<p>Win Condition : 20 score</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-05T06:10:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/745/745bf169f9c64b7fdfb041041a578d0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["penguin55"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
