Must be in 5 minutes to your wedding? Play it. You already play it? Play it. More.</p>\n\n<p>Hi there!</p>\n<p>We present you the hyper/super/duper/x-tra game, the boredom killer and the mental pain maker, Space Bounce.</p>\n<p>It's a simple game, with simple mechanics and a simple purpose: to score the highest score. All you have to do is to dodge the asteroids and the planets, and if you hit them, you will lose some hp (which is in the left of the screen).</p>\n<p>The \"walking\" mechanic works like the arrow when it's shot by a bow: you pull in the opposite direction where you want to guide the asteroid.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Your hp is made from two components: shields and hearts. The shields are regenerable and if you succed to stay out of \"combat\" you will gain hp back; also you will see how the exterior of the asteroid starts to fly randomly on the screen because you've broken the player (sadly). Hearts are meant to be nonregenerable parts and if you aproach so much to death, the screen will start to be red (warning you that you have to be carefull). If you succed to survive, you won't gain any heart, but shields and you will be able to score more points. Also, at the contact with \"enemies\" your phone will vibrate.</p>\n<p>Also, we have some cute menus for social and sounds, but there is some more to do in order to finnish it. :D</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>And yes. The game is still buggy, but we will try to deal with them as soon as possible and make a more enjoyable game. it is pretty hard for us to work, because we are students and the Universities don't offer us verry much free time (sadly).</p>\n<p>Updates? Yes. Skins for the main character, collectibles, other obstacles, power-ups and many more.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Alexandru Naiman (Programming, Design)</p>\n<p>Arin Luca (Testing, Programming)</p>\n<p>Irinel Cristea (Game&amp;Concept Artist)</p>\n\n<p>We'll be waiting for your opinions, tips and feedback. Just write to us.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c69/c69a99f24ca8e4ebdf5e01b76fca9dd4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Sapphire Devils"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
