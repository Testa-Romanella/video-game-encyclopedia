All the crops will disappear in a blink of an eye!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEliminate the incoming slimes with the water gun!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHandling the water gun can be quite tricky... Aim the controller holding the water gun and pull the trigger!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUse the rocket skill to blow away clustered slimes in one shot!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOh no! Those slimes are ruining the crops!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEven if you're a skilled marksman, when slimes swarm in, the crops are bound to suffer.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGrab the drone control stick and maneuver the drone to heal the damaged crops.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI can't take it anymore!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEven in moments of crisis, don't worry! Simply turn your head slightly and use your hand to hit the skill buttons that you can see.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHit the shield button to deploy a shield that protects the crops temporarily from all damage.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHit the drone enhancement button to temporarily increase the drone's speed and healing capabilities.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFinally! Sweet harvest time!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCrops are automatically harvested when their growth time is over.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHarvested crops are settled for money, and you can purchase upgrades at the shop that opens right away.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDefend your fields from the increasingly powerful slime horde by purchasing upgrades!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAdvance through stages to unlock hidden elements!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nChallenge impressive records as you face quite challenging bosses!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-03T17:19:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca4/ca42091145bd445d75a1318aef67b6eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HelloVR"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["HelloVR"], "esrb_rating": null}
