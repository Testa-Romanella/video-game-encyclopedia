They burned, killed, plundered and committed all manners of crimes! Although you and your people stubbornly resisted external invasion, you were still outnumbered and failed. As a last resort, you and a few of your friends fled their homes with great sadness and stumbled into an unknown forest. Yet the sense of despair persisted, and the breath of death filled the forest.       Suddenly a woman appeared in front of you. She pointed to a hut not far away and said it would provide you with food and water, and let your team go in and rest. But when you pushed the door into the room, you realized that this is not the case. This woman's help came at a price. The hut was just the entrance to a cave, and the woman wanted you to find a villainous eroded dragon knight, Sowen, who had a magic weapon that is able to open the gates of hell in this bottomless cave. If you did not get the magic weapon, Sowen would chant a mantra at the time of the apocalypse and opened the gates of hell through it, and then the world would be gone.
