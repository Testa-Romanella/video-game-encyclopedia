You\u2019ll love it!\" \u2014 Gameographics <br/><br/><br/>What the people say about 'Who Is The Killer?' game series:<br/><br/>'Best investigation game I've played so far! Feels so real!' (Tia00)<br/><br/>'It's not like those one way stories, it really gives you the freedom to investigate by yourself!' (abighoul)<br/><br/>'Just when you think you know who the killer is, your suspect is found dead!' (Moonwave2315)<br/><br/>'A really unique game which gives you a real sense of deduction!' (nicholas derecourt)<br/><br/><br/>Welcome to the much anticipated Second Episode, it won't be possible not to release it after success of the first part.<br/><br/>Description of Episode II in comparison with the first part:<br/><br/> -The plot is more complicated. Everything is not so obvious now.<br/> -Some parallel stories, but only one will lead to the killer.<br/> -Pictures from the scene, can be studied with a magnifying glass. This is not a standard game \"find the hidden object\", each piece of evidence is important for further investigation.<br/> -The main game with words is changed, because many players found it boring.<br/>- Two beautiful melodies and the rain outside, reinforce oppressive atmosphere.<br/><br/>This original game is based on classical english detective rules in the tradition of Sherlock Holmes. Everyday someone dies and you need to figure out who is the killer using the logic. Everybody has a common mystery story of the past. Everybody could have a motive to do this. And you have only seven days to stop the murderer. <br/><br/>It is not a generic adventure game \u2014 there is no happy end in this scenario, you can either win or lose the game (if everybody dies). <br/><br/>Speak with characters, investigate crime scenes, guess who lies, look at your dreams to find clues and try to arrest the killer and send him to jail before it\u2019s too late. <br/><br/>\u2014 A new murder every day <br/>\u2014 Several original mini-games and puzzles<br/>\u2014 Old mystery background story <br/>\u2014 Original gameplay for those who like to think. <br/><br/>Game page on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/WhoIsTheKiller <br/><br/>Visit it to find how to gain additional Energy in game every day.<br/><br/><br/>IMPORTANT NOTES!<br/><br/>1.
