This Suite of 16 small games will hopefully show you how a solo developer such as myself was able to grow over the first 4 years of game development. These were all made anywhere from 2011-2014 when I\u00a0was 14-17.\u00a0 It's obvious how many bugs and other game design quirks that don't make any sense, but these games taught me a lot about how to complete a game. Albeit very small games that aren't very good, but games nonetheless.\u00a0</p>\n<p>P.S. Don't worry about Galactic Fighters 4 The Before\u00a0Episode 1. It's just absolutely awful. Play it on easy and get it over with if you really want to know the badly put together story.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T03:17:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b67/b673fa0d7a2c0a0b27365f7679440d97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DashiellR"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
