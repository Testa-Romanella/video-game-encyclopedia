However, though I love playing platformers, I don't find them as creatively enabling as I would like, so I don't think I am going to expand on this game (though I did add the functionality to do so), as I feel like I enjoy making other kinds of games more.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'm definitely looking at more projects in the future and I already know what I want to do for my next one. I want to focus more on improving my art skills, music skills and 3D skills so look out for those in projects in the future.</p>\n<p>The art I used in this game was from Pixel Adventure 1 and 2, great free assets on the asset store. I highly reccomend them for prototypes.</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing, any feedback would be appreciated!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T07:06:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b3/9b35a8fa33a58e0ee3a016254b89b62f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lexloug"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
