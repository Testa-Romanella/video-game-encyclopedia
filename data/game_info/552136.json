IOS is more complex to reach, so that will be whenever it can be achieved.<br/><em>However I have another high-score puzzly game along the lines of board game roll-and-writes I want to release here and on mobile first soon.</em><br/>When this reaches mobile it will be just as you see here, free without ads.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n|| GAME JAM ||\r\n<p>\n<em>This was developed for the Blackthronprod Game Jam #3 -\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/blackthornprod-game-jam-3 - with the theme <strong>\"Less is more\".<br/></strong></em><em>This theme gave me the perfect opportunity to enter, as for me I layered it into the design in multiple ways from scope to presentation.</em><br/>As a result, this theme is naturally everywhere. a board less than 10 squares wide with 8 block types of 5 colors, practically just cubes, just mouse control.<br/>Your goal is to have the least points that's achieved by taking less turns to have less blocks on the board remaining.<br/>However with less blocks each turn becomes exponentially more meaningful and tough. And the decision to take more turns to try and get less points becomes more risky, which you need to balance. Sometimes less turns is the best option.<br/>And scope/design wise I wanted to do the most with the least, I wanted to get a compact design that felt absolutely complete-you didn't want more, because the less it had felt like more. No post-jam additions or feature creep, but not so little here that it backfired and felt lacking.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T12:47:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7a/f7af6568a01cc4e43072835dad8d7e03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Swift Illusion"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
