Except for industry, of course; there's\r\nnot much stopping the enterprising fellows who recently discovered this stuff\r\nthey call \"coal,\" which seems to be quite useful for powering\r\neverything. They keep requesting grants to develop more uses for it in the name\r\nof science. Sounds great!\u00a0 </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your <strong><em>Funds </em></strong>come from\r\ntaxes on industry.</p>\n<p>Industry powers civilization's growth, but those factories also\u00a0produce lots of nasty smoke!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Education</strong>\n</em>is key to a great workforce; <em>every field\u00a0</em>in today's economy requires it! It might take most of your budget at first, but an educated workforce makes for a <em>wealthy society</em>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Science</em></strong>, while a key\r\ndriving force behind industrial growth and increasing the world's <em>carrying\r\ncapacity</em>,\u00a0 is also fundamental to\r\nimproving medical and conservation efforts. Scientific progress is\r\ncumulative, meaning past progress is still\u00a0useful even if we have to cut\r\nfunding sometimes. With enough research, we might just discover something even <em>better than coal</em>\u2026</p>\n<p><em><strong>Healthcare</strong> </em>reduces\r\nmortality (during crises and in general), which also brings down birth rates,\r\nslowing the growing need for energy.</p>\n<p><strong><em>CO2 Capture\u00a0</em></strong>involves afforestation (planting trees) and carbon capture technologies to\r\nreverse global warming.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sounds complicated? Can't make sense of the data?\u00a0Don't worry, you work in government; you\u00a0don't need to be an expert to make sure everyone's needs are met!</p>\n\r\nWhy are people\r\ndying?\r\n<p><strong><em>Insufficient\r\nHealthcare (duh):</em></strong>\u00a0Healthcare\r\nreduces mortality, but also serves as population control by lowering birth\r\nrates. A crowded planet that has\r\noutgrown its carrying capacity will suffer when sea levels rise.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Insufficient\r\nScience:</strong>\u00a0</em>Technological\r\nstagnation can get ugly. Industry can only provide for so many people; if the\r\npopulation outgrows the world's carrying capacity, competition for resources\r\nwill arise.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Overspending:</em></strong>\u00a0Taxes\r\non industry are where your funds comes from, and those taxpayers don't tolerate fiscal\r\nincompetence . Blow your budget, and you'll have a violent uprising\u00a0on your hands!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Music by So Lush Music</strong></p>\n<p>Created for Ludum Dare 46 Jam.
