{"id": 474317, "slug": "wizard-of-dzap", "name": "Wizard of Dzap", "name_original": "Wizard of Dzap", "description": "<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>move - left/right arrows</p>\n<p>jump - up arrow</p>\n<p>fall through platforms\u00a0 - down arrow</p>\n<p>restart - r</p>\n<p>shoot - spacebar</p>\n<p>This is a game made in 3 days for the Pixel Game Jam. The idea was to make a puzzle platformer type of game.</p>\n<p>The main mechanic of the game is that you can shoot a zap, and that will keep a button pressed. However, you can only have one zap at a time, so when you shoot again, the last button will become unpressed.</p>\n<p>Short time limit and me being very very new to Godot\u00a0proved to result in making a lot less than I had originally planned. There are also quite a few bugs I don't know how to fix (if the missile hits a button, which gets unpresses after a while, just shoot from a different position; it will work after a try or two).</p>\n<p>The theme for the game was \"elctronic\". That's\u00a0what made me think of the idea, tbh, though - like I\u00a0said -\u00a0I didn't get to implement a lot of stuff. Generally, you play as\u00a0a wizard who uses electricity to affect the environment.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T05:28:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/430/4304ae8484a4e661a4ffe6155611d53d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["pawles22"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
