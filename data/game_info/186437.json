The game will start with an animation of the projectile being fired. The view will be third person, and the game will be 3D following a one-point perspective. The game difficulty will progress with each level. The customizations are earned after each level. The gamer can revert the customizations just in case the player feels they picked the wrong ones or something they do not enjoy. These customizations can help the player break through obstacles, move faster, and look good while doing it.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc0/cc0b0361cfe1ebbef0bd169c80c7a2f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Elijah Kotey", "VicSparks", "Battlesack", "Slowforu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
