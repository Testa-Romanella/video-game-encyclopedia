And the flashbulbs go LIGHT! It's a very peacefull and relaxing process. You enjoy the picture as you dive deeper into the waves of mesmerizing lights. Until you realize that you have only couple of moves left and that THOSE UGLY STUPID SHAPES DON'T FIT! The level restarts. Now it's all calm, peacefull and quiet again.\r\n </p>\n<p>Lumini Zen is built on a simple concept but it takes some good planning to complete all the levels. The shapes you get from the game are generated randomly. It means that a level that you've once completed easily might seen unbeatable to you on the next run. And every time you play a level you play it differently.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to our volunteer translators the game is available in English, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Portuguese (Brasil), Italian, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional),\u00a0Polish and Turkish.</p>\n\n<p>The DEMO VERSION is available for free. It has 24 Easy and 12 Hard levels.\r\n </p>\n<p>The FULL VERSION has 72 Easy and 48 Hard levels. It also has Zen mode where you play auto-generated levels for as long as you wish without any limits. It can be played literally forever.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Take and move shapes - Left mouse button<br/>Rotate shapes - Right mouse button</p>\r\nUseful Tips\r\n<p>Filling in a level is the hardest when you are near the end. You'll notice it on a bigger levels. So pick up an area with the most space - this will be your Last Stand Sector. Now start filling in every other sector piece by piece. You move from the edges to your Last Stand Sector. Slowly but surely.</p>\n<p>Plan ahead. Keep in mind the next shape (you can see what shape is coming next in the right slot). Some times you might want to turn off couple bulbs with your current shape to fit in the next shape.</p>\n<p>If you place your shape to the Reserve Slot (the most leftt one) you can take it back later when you need it. You can also see the second next shape this way (one nice little trick for you).</p>\n<p>Don't try to understand a bulb. Be a bulb! Adapt, improvise and shine.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any questions or need help or just feel like - here is our small Discord server: Join Lumini Zen Discord</p>\n\r\nTeam &amp; Credits\r\n<p>Design and programming: Bot Heartless<br/>Music: Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</p>\n<p>Beautifull people who helped hugely with the translations:</p>\n<p>halil - Turkish language<br/>jellyfishyishy - French &amp; Korean languages<br/>GabsBoo - Portuguese and Chinese languages<br/>Dermir - Italian language</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T12:29:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/419/4192c46baba361f46d41f6936703b7f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Bot Heartless"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
