The game's concept is, you're a bartender in a popular pixel nightclub. Customers will approach the bar with specific drink orders, it is then up to you as the bartender to navigate the bar and grab the appropriate ingredients to make said customer's drinks. As you successfully serve drinks to customers, you will get more time in-game via the Club Meter that measures how successful you're in serving. But if you take too long to serve a drink, or if you make the wrong drink, you will lose Club Meter. Once the Club Meter runs out, game over. The team behind Mix, is comprised of 5 people.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c98/c984945301fbb1657519d328eb0b9747.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nickleffler"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
