He is faced with a treacherous desert which distorts his surrounding with strong mirages.</p>\n<p>We interpreted the theme by creating a game with\u00a0visual deception. The objects of interest have similar\u00a0colors as the monsters lurking the desert. From far you will have difficulty making the difference... You cannot defend yourself so if you see a monster ... RUN!</p>\n<p>Make sure to find all the missing objects\u00a0AND fix the ship before you run out of stamina! You can eat some cactus fruit to regain stamina.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Use the mouse to look around and the WASD keys to move. Click with the mouse to interact with objects.</p>\n<p>Made by:</p>\n<p>Santiago Rubio (Sangemdoko) : Coding and Unity stuff\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eduardo Rubio (@Wardl_) : Animation + Art</p>\n<p>Mae (@MouevaArt) : 3D + Art</p>\n<p>Theo Gonzalez (NEWOOL) : Music + Sounds\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://sleepingpenguinz.com/<br/></p>\n<p>PS: Juggling between the jam and work was an experience. I was to busy to do anything else. Even the though this was a week long jam I think we spent just as much time on it as other jams... considering we started on Monday. But even though we actively worked the same amount as usual I think the additional thinking time was very beneficial. Especially to work out the intricate parts like the mirages and the infinite terrain.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T08:27:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a3/5a353b24c95c0fcef6f053fe9fb44fe2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sangemdoko"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
