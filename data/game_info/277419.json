The perfect\u00a0<strong>immersive space sim</strong>, where you can go anywhere, do anything, become anyone.<br/><br/>I started RODINA because I suspected that no company could ever achieve this dream in a AAA way. I thought that perhaps a single developer, working over a long time frame, could eventually build something great.<br/><br/>Join me on this adventure -\u00a0<strong>try the DEMO</strong>\u00a0and consider supporting further development!<br/><br/>Rodina is made mostly by a single, obsessed developer - a 10-year veteran of the games industry who previously worked at\u00a0<strong>Bethesda Softworks</strong>\u00a0on\u00a0<strong>Oblivion</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>Fallout 3</strong>. You can always contact me at\u00a0brendan@elliptic-games.com<br/></p>\n\r\nCurrent Features:\r\n<ul><li><em>Full-scale, completely seamless procedural solar system</em><br/>4 full-size planets, 50 randomized major asteroids, something like 45,000 minor asteroids, and one enormous star!</li><li><em>Xeno Bases</em><br/>Discover the Xeno Bases and Mines \u2013 interior spaces that are laid out, constructed, and decorated completely procedurally.</li><li><em>FPS Combat</em><br/>Use your blaster, missiles, or powerups to handle half a dozen Xeno aliens</li><li><em>Combat with alien ships</em><br/>Several different alien ship types, and 5 different weapon types, including heat-seeking missiles</li><li><em>Customizable ship interiors</em><br/>Easily personalize your ship\u2019s layout and share your design with other players</li><li><em>A Story and Background fiction</em><br/>As told through books, emails, and logs\u00a0</li><li><em>Dynamic Soundtrack</em><br/>Over an hour of music, written by award-winning composer John Robert Matz</li><li><em>Mod Support</em><br/>An open scripting system allows for mods that are simple to create, install and remove</li></ul>\n\r\nFuture Vision:\r\n<p>Over time, I intend to work on Rodina towards the direction of\u00a0<strong>\"Daggerfall in Space\"</strong>\u00a0- a seamless procedurally-generated space RPG on a massive scale.<br/><br/>Frankly, this is crazy! I can't make any promises about where or how long Rodina will go (and I ask you to buy only based on what you see here now), but I\u00a0<em>can</em>\u00a0promise to keep working on Rodina for as long as I'm able to. I'm committed to making Rodina great, and I hope that what's already released shows that I'm capable of delivering something\u00a0<strong>different, vital, and fun</strong>.<br/><br/>Please\u00a0<strong>try the demo</strong>, and if you like what you see and pick up the full game, all your money will go towards Rodina's future development!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d6/2d674b9567174ba9362b0c3d60525545.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Raptormeat"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
