This is one of my\u00a0<em><strong>first attempts\u00a0</strong></em>at making a game with unity, so\u00a0<strong>no\u00a0</strong>criticism. In this game, you are trying to buy the new Dell StupidPlex 1000 PC from the nearby computer and electronic store, Best Worst (In absolutely no affiliation with Best\u00a0Buy). Explore the town, and see how completely typical this game is. Also, I would highly recommend downloading this because the downloaded version is updated more and the browser version lags a lot.</p>\n<p>(also sorry linux and mac people im too lazy to build unity on linux and mac but support may come in the future)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T08:40:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05d/05d0ad91f69eaf9bd569d18fbb8f5cc8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["somerandombaddeveloper"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
