There's only 1 course with 4 holes so far, but should be enough for a taster :) ps. theres no dang sound yet.</p><p>So, I haven't made any games 'just for fun' in ages, with my job and life taking up lots of time. Here is my first try at doing something I actually enjoy. If other people enjoy it i'll be adding more courses and fun stuff to it. </p><p>I have a little roadmap about possible additions so 'hopefully' I won't be making it up as I go along. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9a/b9a74128e0aade2f9dab200fcc4b285a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["morsky"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
