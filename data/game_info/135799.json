It's open to everyone no matter what skill level you are on, you can win if you keep trying. </strong></p><p><strong><br/><br/>I found this game to be great fun, and also very addictive. I told one other person about this game, and after they tried it they won it before turning it off. </strong></p><p><strong><br/><br/>So give it a try and see how much you enjoy it, you might find a great deal of fun with this one. </strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sunrisekingdom"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
