It is a collection of poems that describe moments in time relating to different parts of the body. The left side is about unrequited love with a woman. The right side is about being in love with a man. Both sides deal with the struggle of accepting your sexuality and the shame that comes with identifying yourself one way and finding out that you don't fit neatly in that little box. The parts in the center relate to gender identity and feeling like you don't fit perfectly into one category or another.</p>\n<p><em>regardless, i love you\u00a0</em>is a queer game. It is a game riddled with questions that never provides a solid answer. It is a game that fails to be a game, in that its choices are arbitrary and that it doesn't have pictures and that it lacks meaning to anyone else besides myself. It is a game in which time is meaningless, and the past and present fuse into one beautiful mess. It is a game I made to remind myself that I deserve love too.</p>\n<p>Although I made this game as a love letter to myself, and it can be confusing to others who play it, I hope that by the end of it you at least learn to love yourself a little more too. :-) &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-15T04:58:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b8/0b84048a6260f552c576afcfa27adbd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Asterranaut"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
