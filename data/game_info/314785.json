In your way are different kinds of obstacles and enemies trying to ruin your day.</p>\n<p>This is my 2nd ever Ludum Dare game and my first ever platformer so I apologize for all the bugs and jankyness of the game. I ran into a lot of issues while making it. I still hope that you can get some joy out of it!</p>\n\n<p>Feel free to leave any feedback here in the comments or over on ldjam.com<br/></p>\n<p>I would appreciate every critique you could offer!</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p><ul><li>Made using Unity 2019.1</li><li>Font is Munro by tenbytwenty</li><li>Sound effects made in Bfxrw</li></ul>\n<p>P.S. As for the bugs, unsure when, if ever I'm going to fix them. It would require me to redo the whole project as it's just a total mess. It is a project that I might expand on later if I get to it. As this was more of a proof of concept and a learning experience than a true competitor in the jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/669/66930488bad8ce927e67ce7c7d31deb1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lame_een"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
