Thank you.<br/></p>\n<p>This is a test for pre-loading assets in JavaScript and smoothly starting a game.</p><p>It loads a title screen and plays a sound as a test.<br/></p>\n<p>In my last project I had a problem in that textures were loading after the gameplay had started. Here I have set out a method of pre-loading assets and starting WebGL when everything is ready to be displayed properly.</p>\n<p>I think the audio api I use isn't compatible with every browser, but it is compatible with everything I have tested it on.</p>\n<p>I also implemented resize detection so WebGL will adjust things for different screen sizes automatically. It works on my mobile phone as well. I just need to implement mobile controls so my games can work on mobile also.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T05:48:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37b/37b0bfa21338865799c8335b0871dbf0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cup Puppy Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
