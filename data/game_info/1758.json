While being not so demanding on a software side, it was released on the mobile platforms as well as on the big consoles. Such variety of platforms, however, limits the gameplay peculiarities that can be featured within a game. <br />\nThe player takes a role of one of four characters on the Belgian, American, French and German side of the Great War conflict \u2014 World War I. During the game they need to solve puzzles, watch animated cutscenes, fight enemies and do military races. <br />\nValiant Hearts is thus telling four stories simultaneously and ties them up in the end and throughout a fabula, while being historically correct when it is crucial. The game has received the Best Narrative awards and the Games for Change awards for such a plot-twists.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2014-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-22T22:13:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/39a/39a8aa7798b685f9625e857bc394259d.jpg", "website": "http://valianthearts.ubi.com/", "rating": 4.36, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 211, "owned": 2615, "beaten": 1220, "toplay": 215, "dropped": 313, "playing": 36}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 74, "ratings_count": 1303, "suggestions_count": 517, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 1317, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "Nintendo Switch", "PC", "iOS", "Android", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Ubisoft Montpellier"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Ubisoft Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
