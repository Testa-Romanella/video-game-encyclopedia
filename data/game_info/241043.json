{"id": 241043, "slug": "mortal-kombat-shaolin-monks", "name": "Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks", "name_original": "Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks", "description": "<p>Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks is an Action/Adventure title driven by both intense single and multi-player action. Similar to &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception,&quot; background interactions (i.e., acid pits, living trees, spiked ceilings, etc.), multiple new fatalities, and action-based puzzles also play an important role in the player&#39;s quest for an &quot;outstanding&quot; victory. Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks features an impressive line-up of Mortal Kombat characters, as well, that make frequent appearances as enemies, in boss battles and during several additional in-game interactions. For the first time ever, Mortal Kombat fanatics can explore all the mythos and rumors of the Mortal Kombat universe from an entirely new perspective. Action/Adventure fans will be blown away by the intuitive kombat system, puzzle solving and epic storyline that can be experienced in either the single player mode or through co-op play.
