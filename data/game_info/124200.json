In this state the game isn't quite playable, you can have a grasp of the gameplay. I uploaded because I force myself to send my submissions to jams even if I couldn't finish on time.<p>Things that work:<br/></p><ul><li>Click the Essence Egg on the right to earn essence points.</li><li>Essence points are converted into eggs by the factories (the only thing on the board at the beginning).</li><li>Eggs score points while they're on the board.</li><li>The player earn these points as money when an egg is destroyed by either going off the map or bumping into another egg.</li><li>Eggs often loot items when they get destroyed.
