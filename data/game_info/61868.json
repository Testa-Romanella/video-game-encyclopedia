Hire your first stuff, provide yourself with machines and do not forget about recipes, you will need them for production.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAt first, it may seem that the market economy is playing dirty tricks with you, but as soon as you become more experienced entrepreneur, you will have to play by its rules and hammer such simple terms as \"demand\" and \"offer\" into your head<br/>\n<br/>\r\nChoose your own way of technology development. Potentially, your small nail factory can grow into a large carmaker or even a factory where modern satellites are manufactured.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs you work hard your qualification and your stuff experience will grow. Labor veterans are capable of much more than green newcomers. Use their experience for the benefit of your own business.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBe prepared for surprises: your machines can fail at the most unfortunate moment, the market conditions can change tremendously in a matter of days, and banks can refuse to lend on acceptable terms. In bad times quality management is the only way to  save the company.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8a/c8ad670bcae9ccf5d1459a9e002be515.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StainlessHeart"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["StainlessHeart"], "esrb_rating": null}
