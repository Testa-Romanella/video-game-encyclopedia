Had a lot of fun time creating this game. It's not finished, but we're happy with it. In Nightmares, you play as the dream incarnate of a little boy lost in his dreams. The dream is starting to collapse, you must get out. Use your only tool, the flashlight, to illuminate your path. But just like anything else in a dream, there are two sides, one seen, and one hidden. The flashlight will illuminate the platforms in front, but will hid those which you can already see. Use it sparingly, the batteries run out.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>If the level seems unfair, we used procedural platform generation (made by us, so not very good) , we like to think that this adds into the difficulty of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T02:11:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e51/e51e7da2308ce97eeefe99110541897e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["David Ilie"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
