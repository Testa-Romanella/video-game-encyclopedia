Your customers will place pizza orders that you must build and serve before the time runs out. Use ingredients to build the perfect pizzas and get paid money by your happy clients! Finish the pizzas and earn enough money to move on to the next day. Fail, and you lose your job!<br/><br/>In Pizza Chef, there are three modes of play: Career Mode, Time Attack, and Freestyle. In Career Mode, you must earn one hundred dollars each day in order to progress on to the next day. As you progress, the levels become harder as more ingredients are added to the pizzas, and the orders start to get more and more out of control. Keep your customers happy! Career Mode contains a total of 50 levels for non stop fun and family friendly action.<br/><br/>Time Attack mode is unlocked by reaching day 10 in Career Mode. In Time Attack mode you are given 20 seconds to build as many pizzas as you can. Each time you complete an order, you get 10 more seconds added to the clock. Pound out pizzas as fast as you can and see how much money you can make!<br/><br/>Pizza Chef is an entertaining game of skill, wit, reflexes, memorization, and time management. It is a fun game for kids and adults of all ages. I am always improving my games and looking to add more content, so please leave me suggestions on how I can make the game better! This game is for you guys, so help me make Pizza Chef the best it can be!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:00:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab8/ab8a23aee677cd34ee76be2872e3c501.jpg", "website": "http://apps.ape-apps.com/pizza-chef/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Ape Apps"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Family"], "publishers": ["Brandon Stecklein"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
