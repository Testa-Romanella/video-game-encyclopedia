As your racers loop around the track they are pelted by spikeballs from the cannons lining the track, trying to put them out of commission. You get money for each half-lap that your cars complete, and that amount increases as they complete more without breaking down, so upgrade them as they go to reach the end of round ten and win the golden cup.</p>\n<p>This is a game for Ludum Dare 47, so it was created from scratch in 48 hours by me alone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Created in Unity, using Aseprite for the art and Audacity for sound effects. Fonts used are Laila and World Conflict, free fonts I got from 1001freefonts.com. Unfortunately I did not get around to making background music for this Jam, the art continues to always take more time then I expect it to.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was a nice chill jam for me, it seems that I am finally figuring out how to scope a project that I can complete in the time. I still would have liked to add different cars and some background music, but I am happy with how this came out considering that I did not spend every waking moment on this over the weekend.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T02:44:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c5/7c51ab6e82338545f50940b3d625af4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["smilewood"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
