That the first impression can be deceptive. <br/>That you can't reach the tip of your tongue to the tip of your nose. That if you throw a stone in the water, the circles will go. <br/>Is it true? I don't know. But I know. <br/>Phoenixxx Games has done the impossible, and literally broke through the ceiling, setting a new bar in the quality of furious action \"Underwater affect\". <br/>As the name implies, we have to go down into the ocean depths, where after a planetary cataclysm there are only two-dimensional forms of life. <br/>And it's really scary, especially in full screen mode. <br/>Sometimes you have to persuade yourself not to close this game.<br/><br/>The game is a shooter with a side view. The character you control with the arrow keys is in the center of the screen, he has a gun. During the game, you will need to walk and perform various tasks and defend against monsters, <br/>which will need to kill with a gun (left mouse button).<br/><br/>The main character, a pink-cheeked shameless man in a seductively tight latex, catches a distress signal and, without much bothering his brain, comes to the rescue. <br/>And it is worth it to cross the threshold of the sinister underwater station, as soon as it becomes clear - it is not loved here. <br/>And before he gets to (spoiler alert: the game has a plot). <br/>However, you will see everything yourself - believe me, your expectations and monotonous murders, giving the Hero a complex personality with a dark past, still justify themselves. <br/>Not this one, next time for sure.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:50:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78c/78c81e7fd49c5faccf758f8561b5c334.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Phoenixxx Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Enjoy Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
