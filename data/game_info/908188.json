Again, this isn't 100% functional in the browser, since it's a third-person 3D game, but I\u00a0guess it's still playable. I'm including builds for Windows, Linux, and Mac anyway.</p>\n<p>Latch locked themselves out of their dungeon, and needs the help of Hickory to get back in! Latch will guide you through their own dungeon, and you'll help them get through safely. There are plenty of traps to avoid and disarm.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WSAD - Move</li><li>Space - Jump/Advance text</li><li>Move mouse - Look around</li><li>Shift - Sprint</li><li>F - Throw fireball (once you get them)</li><li>LMB - Use keypad</li><li>T - Skip dialogue</li><li>Esc - Quit</li></ul>\n<p>Note: The game may crash when starting dialogue, for me it worked fine the second time. Also,\u00a0I have not tested the linux or mac builds, sorry.</p>\n<p>Funny enough, when I\u00a0went to upload this game,\u00a0I realized it wasn't finished; completing the dungeon just sent you to the test level. The win screen is new.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T10:02:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c8/2c889caa1e2793b2dc75eda316d01007.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Airtoum"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
