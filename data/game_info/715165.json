Has an arrangement of music based on the Toy Day theme by Manaka Kataoka. Released as CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you look up \"demo\" on youtube you expect amazing graphics pushing the machine to its limits etc, etc but it's just a cute little visualization with some music we did to learn how to make games/demos on the NES for a nice holiday project. This is just my way to upload it somewhere I suppose.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T06:21:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a0/6a0d0cc52c7abef8519fe58fc63086a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["noobermin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
