This is our second game. We had thought of this game about a year ago and at the time I was very bad at programming. I finally figured that I might as well make it now considering I have a lot of time available to me and I am far, far better at programming than before. </p>\n<p>Anyway, you play as the Temmy in the painting in Tem Village and you create the rich history of Tem. You have to fight through a lot of Undertale characters' armies and then you take them on in a 1 - 1 battle Undertale style (this isn't complete yet). </p>\n<p>Next Update will include;</p>\n<ul><li>Ranged units</li><li>Buffs and Nerfs accordingly</li><li>Better sprites</li><li>Better enemy spawning AI</li><li>a tutorial (hopefully anyway)</li></ul>\n<p>This update should come within the next 1 - 2 weeks or less.</p><p><strong><em>*This project has been cancelled.
