Prime-Time, kidnaps many children to make them act in a strange play.\u00a0\r\nIn this play, the children should never betray 3 <strong>absolute rules :</strong>\r\n\r\nHow to play :\r\nThe best way to enjoy Dog Pound Theater is to play with a friend in local multiplayer! However, you can always play alone against bots!\r\nAt the beginning of the game, find yourself in the sheep crowd without being seen by other player! Indeed, at the start, all players and bots wear a sheep mask! :\u00a0\r\n\r\nThen, thanks to the wolf mask, tear off the sheep masks of the others without DR. Prime-Time seeing you ! (His look is represented by spotlights!)\u00a0 Indeed, if you go through the spotlight without a mask or\u00a0with a wolf mask, you'll be eliminated !\r\n\r\nFinally, Try to be the last actor of the play! Other player (and some bots in advanced levels) can also tear off your own mask if they use wolf mask. You can still recover a mask if you get a \"rabbit item\"\r\n\r\nSummary of the masks :\r\nSheep Mask :\r\nAt the start, all players/bots wear a sheep mask. It's the only mask that allows to survive to the spotlights.\r\n\r\nWolf Mask :\r\nIt's the only one that allows to tear off the masks of the others. If seen by the spotlights, it's eliminated.\r\n\r\nWithout Mask :\u00a0\r\nYou are in this state when another player/bot with a wolf mask touchs you. If you're seen by the spotlights in this state, you're eliminated.\r\nRabbit Item :\r\nAllows players/bots to recover a mask if they are in the state \"Without Mask\".\r\n\r\nControllers/Controls :\r\nYou must use Xbox One/360 or PlayStation 4 controllers for optimal game comfort!\r\nInputs are really simple!\u00a0 You move your character with the left joystick, and you switch over Wolf mask/Sheep mask with the A button for Xbox controllers and the X button for PlayStation 4 controller, that's it !\r\nWARNING :\r\nIf you use 2 \"Xbox\" controllers, please connect the 2nd Xbox controller once you are in the game menu; not before. Thank you!
