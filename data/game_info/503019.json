It was released on the GameMaker Sandbox back in 2006 and and it got a few thousand downloads. \u00a0Unfortunately, the gamemaker sandbox\u00a0 shut down years ago and some people were asking me where they could find this game, so I thought I would release it here!</p>\n<p>The old soundtrack was just a few repetitive 6 second loops, so I decided to replace all the music in this version. \u00a0The new soundtrack is \u00a0made up of songs that I made when I was learning music composition back in\u00a0 2012. These songs were mainly created for practice, but I figured that this was a great opportunity to  actually release them out into the wild.<br/></p>\n<p>This version has a few changes from the old version:</p>\n<p>-All new music<br/></p>\n<p>-A new music room where you can listen to songs from the new and classic soundtrack<br/></p>\n<p>-Added options to mute the music and sound effects<br/></p>\n<p>-Slightly changed a few \u00a0levels and boss battles \u00a0for convenience reasons</p>\n\n<p>Working with my old code that I wrote when I was a teenager was a fun, yet horrifying experience! There are probably a bunch of spelling mistakes in the dialogue, but I\u00a0 won't be fixing them.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T06:08:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69e/69e7a026c2ffd6e16f7f515049524c6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Veyerals"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
