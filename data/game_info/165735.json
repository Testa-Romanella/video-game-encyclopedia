There's the dog, the kids, the bad guys (only the ones who were also kinda like kids as well), and they get into one big mess, oh, let me tell you! Turns out there was a murder, not their usual kind of mess, but bear with me; There was as murder, so the gang has to figure out what the hell happened, making this their final challenge, the One Last Mystery they need to solve.</p><p> In this absurd not-really-a-game, you will be part of the tale by means of playing the role of multiple characters, jumping from one to another like it ain't no thing, and also through time, while having absolutely no control over the plot or how you silently observe it.</p><p> Honestly, what's the point of a visual novel? It's such a limiting medium! Then, there's the ones in which you, the player, can't even do anything (such as this one). Why the hell are they even still a thing?!</p><p> </p><p><strong>The Art</strong><br/>All of the art in Scooby-Doo: One Last Mystery is either shamelessly traced over pictures, or somewhat shamefully traced over drawings. </p><p> Does that mean I (the creator of this game) don't really own the art I'm using? Let me answer your question with another question, so I can make myself sound smarter:<br/>Do you think I own anything at all in this game?<br/>See what I did there? I've made your question sound stupid by owning up to my own copyright infringement crimes. Of course I don't own anything in this game: Scooby Doo and it's associated trademarks are all currently owned by Warner Bros; the art I've traced over belongs to a bunch of people I'm not keeping track of. If anyone asks, it's a new level of digital collage.</p><p> Since I feel sorry about making you sound stupid, I'll claim rights to all the writing in the game. Now THAT makes me sound like an asshole.</p><p><strong>The creator</strong><br/>Scooby-Doo: One Last Mystery was made with the Ren'Py SDK by Brazilian game developer Virgula; as a side project, allegedly for the \"shits\" and the \"giggles\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e0/0e0c4e325b7c455007063c16776802b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Virgula"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
