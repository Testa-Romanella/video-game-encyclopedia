Changing Seasons</p>\n<p>This game was a simple starting dip into game design using Processing 3. You get yelled at to change the season of the show you're watching with the only character in the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Simply click to progress through the various screens.</p>\n<p>2. Space</p>\n<p>This game was based around the concept of personal space. Click and hold your mouse down to drag your character out of the ever-persistent path of the ragdoll. Fail to avoid him and suffer the\u00a0consequences.</p>\n<p>3. Endless Runner with Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment</p>\n<p>This game is based around the revenge story of a toilet roll! Pursue your father's killer and avoid his \"obstacles\" as your pace increases and the difficulty rises!</p>\n<p>Simply press \"space\" to jump!</p>\n<p>4. Tangible and Interactive Media</p>\n<p>I took this opporunity of interactivety to create a mobile game even I would love. Based around the ever-popular \"Dungeons and Dragons\" tabletop game, Dungeons and Chickens puts you in the place of three chickens on their quest to save their eggs from the tyrannous Farmer!</p>\n<p>Tap the \"fight\" button and you'll be able to choose your attack, but remember all of your attacks come down to the roll of a dice so anything can happen!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-11T04:43:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/070/070ab71e880e40ed37629a0d37ca2ef1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Experimental Game Design"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
