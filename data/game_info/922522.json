Although the project took four months, I'm satisfied with the result. It was a lot of fun improving the visuals(and my craft), getting new skills, and returning to an old project. Thank God that this project is done, and I hope I can do more projects like this. <br/></p>\n<p>The game was developed in Unity and rendered with the Unity URP. <br/></p>\n<p>Models were made in Maya, and high poly meshes were made in Zbrush, later baked into the low poly meshes in Substance Painter. Textures were all made in Substance Painter, while alphas/symbols/logos are done in Photoshop. <br/></p>\n<p>Music is made by: David Fesliyan <br/></p>\n<p>Wizard Voice by: Isaiah Villar</p>\n<p>Special Thanks to everyone on the Norco GameDev Discord and my brothers for feedback and advice. <br/></p>\n<p>See the Old Version here:\u00a0 </p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T07:35:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/609/6093642ecae2e26f3bb00f6ebc79c819.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 261, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MortyJHin"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
