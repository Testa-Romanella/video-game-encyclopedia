{"id": 438555, "slug": "i-love-you-lola", "name": "I Love You, Lola!", "name_original": "I Love You, Lola!", "description": "<p>This is a story of how Penelope- a homesick and depressed college student- found love and hope through her furry friend, Lola. Penelope found Lola on the streets and from then on took care of her. Not only did Lola begin to feel happy again, but so did Penelope! Lola's presence brightened and changed her life for the better. They became like family.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As a past pet owner myself, I chose the human-animal bond theme\u00a0because I have experience from pets giving me a sense of love/responsibility. With my game, I want to spread the importance of the human-animal bond.</p>\n<p>For more information on the human-animal bond, visit\u00a0https://www.annenbergpetspace.org/</p>\n<p>To play the game, click buttons to move through the story. You are Lola, and will help guide Penelope on your daily walk. Hold down the left and right arrow keys in order to move.\u00a0The player collects hearts and biscuits in the game, which show the love both Penelope and Lola receive from each other. </p>\n<p>Note: After you press the \"play again!\" button,\u00a0please refresh the page! This restarts your score count.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please also note that Unity is not supported on\u00a0mobile devices. For the best experience, please open the game on a laptop or computer (pc).\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T08:00:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7d/f7d52826494ea600336d2b854e0a5926.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Isabella Ho"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
