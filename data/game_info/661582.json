You have to wait 5 seconds before spawning a clone in again. Every time you push a clone into the hole, you will gain a point. There will also be gems that will fall from the sky. If you collect a certain amount of gems, the amount of time for you to spawn a clone will decrease. Pushing a clone into lava will give you 2 points and pushing a clone into water will decrease your score by one.\u00a0\u00a0Have Fun!</p>\n<p>This game was made with Natan, Selina, Anna, and Chris.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T23:47:54", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Blinkiscoding"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
