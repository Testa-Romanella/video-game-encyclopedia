There are no enemies but there are holes to jump over and try not to fall in. Moving blocks still move even when you are on them so you have to move with them. Make it to the door at the end and jump to the next level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efe/efedbd4113254c990047a5bb23cb6664.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Maker School"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
