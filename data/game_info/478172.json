(UI, level design etc.). \u00a0You start the game at peace in your sanctuary but that peace is ripped from you by an external force. Does it matter what caused this? The pain you feel is real and your target needs to pay... <br/></p>\n<p>Revenge dictates that they, and everyone in your way, must be destroyed in order for you to return to a state of peace... To what degree this is true is for you to discover.<br/></p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>The following people need attribution for the work which I basically stole. Without their effort the game would have straight up not been made. I would have thrown together some rubbish and then reasoned that it was terrible and then just not released it. So a big thank you goes out to the following people/groups that allow their work to be used freely.<br/></p>\n\r\nGraphics\r\n<ul><li>Adwit Rahman - @adwitr</li>Health and rage UI sprites<br/></ul>\n<ul><li>Callum - @CalciumTrice</li>Red Minataur sprite and animations with a red recolour by Merry Dream Games<br/></ul>\n<ul><li>ETTiNGRiNDER</li>Scenery sprites for the boss room</ul>\n<ul><li>Inanzen</li>control icons for the main menu</ul>\n<ul><li>Luis Zuno - @ anismuz</li>All the backgrounds and the \"living tissue\" tileset<br/></ul>\n<ul><li>unTied Games - @untiedgames</li>The main grassland tileset</ul>\n<ul><li>Vander Silvio da Silva Jr\u00a0</li>Player and NPC sprites<br/><br/></ul>\r\nMusic\r\n<ul><li>Cleyton Kauffman</li>\"Superhero\" (music for the main \"action\" segment) <br/></ul>\n<ul><li>Michael Lancaster</li>\"The Desecrated Temple\" (music after you defeat the \"boss\")</ul>\n<ul><li>MikeeUSA</li>\"Pwr Chord Anthem SC\" used the start of this underneath the heartbeat.<br/></ul>\n<ul><li>Nick Janssen</li>\"Dark Intro\" (music as you approach the boss room)</ul>\n<ul><li>FoxSynergy - @ foxsynergy</li>\"Lunar Joyride\" (music in the credits scene)</ul>\n<ul><li>Spring</li>\"The Final Boss\" (music for boss room and main menu\"</ul>\n<ul><li>TheoJT</li>provided the nice calm music right at the start of the game.</ul>\r\nSound Effects\r\n<ul><li>andersmmg</li>UI beeping sound.<br/></ul>\n<ul><li>Kiniton</li>First half of the firework sound.<br/></ul>\n<ul><li>Mderr</li>The sound I used to indicate clarity.<br/></ul>\n<ul><li>Michalg</li>Player hurt sound<br/></ul>\n<ul><li>Michel Baradari</li>Minataur yell/exhale<br/></ul>\n<ul><li>Nicolas Martigne - http://nicolas-martigne.info/</li>This sound is that uh...
