Let's see where this journey will take you! (Or something)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>\n<p>The image(kernel+ramdisk) was build using Buildroot. It features a recent kernel, and most importantly, the dependencies for the game.

That's 14M for a complete Linux distribution, including my game, and the required libraries. No content is downloaded etc.</p>\n<p>This is my first game jam ever! (And first real game I've programmed ever, and also the first engine I've programmed ever :P.)</p>\n<p>Control using arrow keys, space, and f.</p>\n<p>All assets etc. in this game were made by me.
