A miserable little pile of secrets!</p><p>The Strawberry Mongeese want revenge, but all you want to do is enjoy a chalice of strawberry wine (that you happened to steal from them). Good thing that you're covered in sneks that are sworn to protect your castle... and modesty.</p><p>Punish waves of enemies using a wide range of snek-based maneuvers, and buy upgrades from the traveling merchant/exhibitionist.</p><p><em>(This game was made for Strawberry Jam, a month-long jam, but I started 3 weeks late, so I barely had time to finish, let alone test the game. There will likely be patches - please notify me of any glaring bugs in the comments, and I'll be sure to wrap a snek around them and stomp 'em out.)</em></p><p>Music and sound effects by Tim Schrock.<br/></p><p><strong>3/11/17 Patch Details:</strong></p><ul><li>Added a third mongoose palette swap</li><li>Adjusted mongoose logic/hitboxes/frequency - later waves no longer have 100% flying mongeese!</li><li>Fixed bug that prevents spawning if a mongoose is knocked off-screen</li><li>Adjusted orb drop rates, special move costs, and item prices</li><li>Whip snek now has a sound effect</li><li>There's a new game over screen that displays random gameplay tips</li><li>Added pause screen that displays instructions</li><li>The wave number is now displayed, so you can actually tell how far you've gotten!
