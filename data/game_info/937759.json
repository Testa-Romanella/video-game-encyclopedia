Large terrain added to try and define the scope of the level at some point.\u00a0</li><li>Week 6: Added health for the player and improved AI so that they now follow the player at a reasonable distance. Text was added for when the game starts, as well as basic information such as how many bullets the player has left and how much time has passed. More sound effects were added for the guns, and HP packs were put around the map to help the player heal throughout the level.</li><li>Week 7: Began work on the second level for the game and found terrains to add to the design of the level. Added a new shotgun enemy and a level requirements system that stops the end zone from working until it is satisfied. Added a menu and a hype system to incentivize the player to actually kill the enemies instead of just avoiding them. Also, added a crosshair to make aiming easier for the player. The bullets now go more towards the middle of the screen when fired.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T19:14:59", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["darowolo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
