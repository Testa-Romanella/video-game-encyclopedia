{"id": 884202, "slug": "descry", "name": "Descry", "name_original": "Descry", "description": "<p>Descry is a short objective based horror experience.</p>\n<p>You have been sent to an isolated island to discover the fate of the researchers that have gone missing there and recover their data. Unfortunately, you are not alone.</p>\n\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n\r\nRun and loot\r\n<p>Something is out there... and it's coming for you. Descry is not littered with jumpscares. Instead you will be seen and you will be chased. There is <strong>no second chances</strong> if you are caught. I find the best horror is when something is out there and even if it sees you, it doesn't mean that you can see it.</p>\n\r\nLoot to survive\r\n<p>You can't fight. Instead you should run. In Descry, find crates and drawers to find items that may help you escape the entity hunting you. Please be aware that this is a very early in development build of the game and so there's not a ton of loot available.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Controls are all available to view in game at any time under Help &amp; Guides. However, here are some of the basic controls:</p>\n<p><strong>WASD</strong> to Move &amp;\u00a0<strong>Mouse</strong> to Look</p>\n<p><strong>Q</strong> to look behind you</p>\n<p><strong>LMB</strong> to use held item</p>\n<p><strong>E</strong> to interact</p>\n<p><strong>Left Shift</strong> to sprint</p>\n<p><strong>Left Control</strong> to crouch</p>\n<p><strong>Spacebar</strong> to jump</p>\n\n<p>Got stuck? Objectives are always visible on the map [M].</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>Update v.0.1.1</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Optimization fixes</li><li>Inventory bug fix</li><li>Improved lighting</li><li>Pause menu bug fixes</li><li>Dialogue volume setting added</li><li>Grass fix</li><li>Increased entity search radius</li></ul>\n\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\r\nMore information\r\n<ul><li>This game is early development. Don't be surprised to find bugs!</li><li>Build is only for Windows right now - no build dedicated available for Mac/Linux.</li><li>Descry was build in Unity using the High Definition Render Pipeline.</li></ul>\n<p>In January 2021, I made a short horror game with a friend called Wendigo. It was made for a game jam over the course of a week, and boy does it show. Now, almost 2 years later I thought I'd challenge myself to recreate that same game but better.</p>\n<p>Over the course of a week I had off from my day job, I built the majority of Descry. Only a few extra days were needed for UI and the build. I think Descry has potential considering it was put together in less than a fortnight.\u00a0While this current version of Descry is built as a homage to a previous project, the future is likely to look very different.</p>\n<p>The future of Descry is likely to take a horror, rogue-like approach. I'm excited to share more but it's one that's going to be a bigger project, with this version of the game as a base.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I've really enjoyed working on Descry and look forward to a more fleshed out release in the future.\u00a0Thanks for playing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T14:11:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/164/164e5acbd71b46b996d763a503cc7542.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adam Wom"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
