Your task is to expand and grow all the while managing the most important resource:\u00a0Energy.<br/><br/>You do this by sending Harvester ships out from your home star to collect it's energy. Stars only have so much energy so you must also expand out through the star system to get a better reach at the stars with the most energy by sending out Mother Ships. Once a Mother Ship reaches it's destination star it will deem it a \"home star\" and you then have another star to send ships from.<br/><br/>So really just harvest and expand because you're running out of power!<br/><br/>I\u00a0have a couple of ideas that would make this a slightly better game in terms of balancing but nothing really exciting enough to implement right now. If I\u00a0think of enough things I may release a patch or post-compo version.\u00a0Let me know if you have any cool ideas. Again, if\u00a0I have enough suggestions I\u00a0may release a new version.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e43/e430a678155d1ebcbc857a9dd3cd889f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheOddPotion"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
