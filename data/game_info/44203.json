He woke up in the jungle full of dinosaurs after his plane crashed. Is he the only one that survived the crash? What is this place?<br />\nThe most important gameplay elements are hunting and sneaking. Dinosaurs can see you, can smell you, can attack you or run away when hurt. You will find many weapons, puzzles, and clues.<br />\nHunger is a very important issue in the game. You can hunt or grab some dinosaur\u2019s eggs to eat and restore energy. To cook dinosaur meat, you must make a fire camp in safe place.<br />\nThis is an Indie production made by one single person, but it has been polished and designed with care. This is the first episode to a story of survival in a world that falls apart.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/079/079eebf39855cde828febeddad08f348.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 18, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 20, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 442, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Corpix Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Corpix Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
