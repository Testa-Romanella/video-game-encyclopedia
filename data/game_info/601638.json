The place where you think you will be happy - a dream to be far off civilization and away from worries, fears or pressure...How selfish should dreams be? What would you be willing to give up to be in your happy place, to be in solitude? How selfish can dreams be?</p>\n<p>Enjoy a 2 min narrative about a character who has everything in his life to be happy - but isn't.\u00a0\u00a0He faces his own thoughts about dreams and nigthmares and begins to question the validity of his dream.<br/></p>\n<p>How does this game reflect the\u00a0theme \"outer edge\"? The story literally takes you to the edge of the world - the cold, lonely North. Somewhere in Norway, close to the polar circle - 100km away from the next neighbor.</p>\n<p>Though it is very short story, this jam helped me to set-up a project using Inky, which will come in handy for future games where I need a more complex story line with branching dialogues and alternative endings. The core idea of this story is what got me started into doing game devs as a hobby. I still don't know what the best \"genre\" for building upon the core idea of the story is, so I see this as an experiment, nothing else. Will the story continue? Will the underlying concept of seeking a place far off mankind to live a different live continue? Maybe.\u00a0\u00a0I like to believe :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T06:20:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff8/ff831a2d9d9fc253b293e24cfc347ec7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["misterG420"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
