You control a robot tasked with traversing the planet's surface, as well as installing and collecting data from a number of research probes. <em>XENOPULSE\u00a0</em>was\u00a0inspired by the 1981 game\u00a0<em>Sokoban</em> (\"warehouse keeper\" in Japanese) by\u00a0Hiroyuki Imabayashi, in which you push around boxes in a warehouse and try to get every box into its proper place. As such, this game involves a lot of pushing, but the variety comes from all of the different elements of this alien world that you interact with\u00a0(and which interact with each other).</p>\n<p>Also, there is a\u00a0<strong>lot</strong> of time travel.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c2/7c284de8fe3752aeb82e0448a579ad51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xan Collins"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
