An endless series of waves of 3/4 different enemy types. The game is inspired by Call of Duty zombies with the possibility to upgrade your weapon, use a teleporter but also has unique mechanics such as a handblast, dashing and a special ability to wipe out a large amount of enemies at once. I challenged myself to make the game under 4 weeks from scratch so the tutorial is a bit rough and there may be some bugs, however, I had fun creating this game and hope you guys enjoy playing it :)</p>\n\n<p>The following sounds were used for my project through ZapSplat:</p>\n<p>- Designed punch 1<br/>- Designed punch 2<br/>- Designed punch 3<br/>-Heavy single body punch 1<br/>- Heavy single body punch 3<br/>-Alien clicking vocalisation 1<br/>-Alien clicking vocalisation 2<br/>-Alien clicking vocalisation 3<br/>-Science fiction reload<br/>-Shotgun reload<br/>- Alien vocalisation1<br/>-Alien vocalisation2<br/>-alien vocalisation3<br/>-Alien vocalisation4<br/>-AlienScream 1<br/></p>\n<p>All other sounds were free to use and were found through FreeSound and OpenGameArt.<br/></p>\n<p>For those that want to jump right in:</p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>SPACE - Jump</p>\n<p>TAB - Pause</p>\n<p>LEFT MOUSE BUTTON - Shoot</p>\n<p>RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON (HOLD) - Aim</p>\n<p>E - Handblast</p>\n<p>C - Special ability Requires Full Power (100)</p>\n<p>F - Dash</p>\n<p>R-Reload<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T05:23:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/614/614bb9b00823c2689faf526cd5d61bb4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Josh Hardy"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
