By using gates, they can also send soldiers and resources to other players. <br/><br/>The game was inspired by multiplayer Tetris, where players have their own game but can affect others by throwing special blocks into their game. <br/><br/>In this game, if you're not one of the top ten players, you can't be targeted by others. However, there's no limit to the number of players who can join the game.<br/><br/><strong>Development process</strong><br/>I created this game together with my four-year-old son. He contributed some of the graphics using Paint and came up with all the prompts for the Midjourney images. <br/><br/>We spent a lot of time brainstorming ideas on our living room floor, using crayons and toys, and his input was invaluable. <br/><br/>He has also been my most honest tester, providing feedback on what features were becoming too complex or frustrating. <br/><br/>It has been an amazing process, and I am proud to say that I could not have made this game without him.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-08T02:54:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bfb/bfb988d2cb1b9b1af5b946698c780972.jpg", "website": "http://ravendeer.dk/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Antonio Teyken"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Antonio Teyken"], "esrb_rating": null}
