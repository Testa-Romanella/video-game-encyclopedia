Catch the juices in space for a boost. Work-in-progress: double-spread banana gun, triple-spread banana gun, reinforcement monkeys, special monkey ships, more progress in optimization and run-time. Seeking to make it like the 2-D shooter minigame in Ape Escape classic but with more action. Will port it to a game engine but unsure which one yet, still doing research.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbc/dbc7e2766755477091f31a7d71b85a2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["msaleeb"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
