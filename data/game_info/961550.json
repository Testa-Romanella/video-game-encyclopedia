Gather resources to make fighting weapons and survival tools. You must find and send a rescue signal at the end of your desperate survival.<h3>Feel the void and abandoned highrise building</h3><br/>Prior to this apocalyptic era, facilities such as shopping malls, offices, and residences, which were previously crowded with people, were very familiar and friendly spaces to us. But, now, they will inspire fear in a sense of emptiness and heterogeneity that no one can find. Furthermore, it is a space created by inspiring real skyscrapers, and the space that is vacated or omitted has been minimized. Players will feel that every floor and facility in the building will have the appearance of a very real space.<h3>SHHH! Beware of noise caused by carelessness.</h3><br/>The monster sniffers responsible for humanity's extinction have a highly developed sense of hearing and smell. They can detect even the smallest movements, coughs, and gurgling sounds from your stomach. Moreover, if there is a loud noise, such as glass breaking or falling from a great height, the sniffers will rush to the player.<h3>GO DOWN AND DOWN! Find out more and better resources.</h3><br/>To avoid the monster sniffers, the last survivor stayed near the top floor of a building. The player used to be a linker, connecting these survivors to the food court in the building's basement. Use this knowledge to your advantage. The lower floors you go, the more resources you have and the more efficient you are. However, as they get closer to the ground, the monsters become more powerful and the number of monsters increases. But you never know; you may find any hints to help you escape from the downstairs.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong><h3>KEY FEATURES</h3></strong><br/><br/>* Hunger and thirst must be controlled. However, be cautious of food poisoning. Food poisoning survivors are likely to be pursued by sniffers.<br/><br/>* You can obtain resources by destroying most of the building's furniture. For a much more efficient acquisition, use tools that are specific to the material of each piece of furniture. <br/><br/>* Make and install the tools required for survival. You can carry a still to purify dirty water, a cooktop to boil food, and a workbench to craft survival tools.<br/><br/>* You can avoid monsters by sneaking between them, but you can also create weapons to fight them. Crafting each appropriate tool and weapon for combat and infiltration allows you to work more efficiently. <br/><br/>* A ventilation system connects all of the building's floors and rooms. This is the only safe zone from the group of monsters, and it is entirely up to the player. Remember the layout and flow of this area.<br/><br/>*A total of six playable characters are available. Each has unique stats, passive skills, and a unique history. All characters can be unlocked by playing the game.<br/><br/>* There are single player and multiplayer modes for up to three players. The amount of resources available in multiplayer will be adjusted based on the number of players. <br/><br/>* There will be a sandbox mode and a survival mode available. In the sandbox mode, you will have infinite lives and get your resources back. However, in that survival mode, you can enjoy the high-rise game more concentrating with limited resources and only one life, so you can feel the true value of the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-02T02:52:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1be/1bea644c6c7047d77542a5f39c2d1aef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 360, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Studio Hatch Co"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Studio Hatch Co"], "esrb_rating": null}
