So she and her friends started a gift-opening war.</p>\n<p>Game objective: protect the cake for as long as possible by accumulating two types of currency under the attack of the uncanny gift box and the flying greeting card.</p><p>Currency of Joy: Produced by cakes over time and can be obtained by killing enemies, mainly for using the four atmosphere effects on the left side of the game.\u00a0</p><p>Currency of gold coin: \u00a0Can be exchanged for the first atmosphere effect, can be obtained by killing enemies and can also be obtained by building piggy banks, mainly for building defence towers.</p><p>As to why two currencies are used: firstly, to allow players to weigh the production, conversion and consumption of the two currencies, being the game more business-like and strategic; secondly, to be more realistic, i.e. cakes do not generate money in reality, while the help of friends requires more friendship and atmosphere; and thirdly, the red envelope of elders as the only setting in this game with a Chinese background, reminding us to thank our parents for their first investment in us.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls \u2013\u00a0Use the mouse to play, clicking on the floor to set up turrets to attack flying enemy items to protect the cake.</strong></p>\n<p>_________________________________</p>\n<p>I was actually inspired to make this game by myself, 28 Apr is my birthday and my initial inspiration was to create a light-hearted and cheerful tower defence game about birthdays.The four function keys in the game represent the support of elders (it is often customary in China to give children red envelopes on Chinese New Year's Day or birthday or any other festival); the help of classmates or colleagues; the company of close friends; and the good wishes made from the birthday girl.</p>\n<p>I wanted to create a game that would give the players a relaxing and beautiful experience, but also a game where they would experience the constant help of people around them during the battles and recall some good memories about them, which is a very beautiful and happy thing.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T13:50:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/483/483268854a13a38b4272dcd0189adc4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Qingyang Ding"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
