Further settings are available to help increase the actual experience. This trainer features sounds and motions typical of the starting line that help simulate the various distractions and gain the attention required to cut a perfect light. The standard version is a great trainer that can easily be used anywhere at any time. For the full experience, the VR trainer will put you in the cock pit of the car to allow your senses to grow as if you were really at the starting line of a real race.
