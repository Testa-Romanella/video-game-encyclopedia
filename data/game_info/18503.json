This power must, however, be honed through dedicated training.<br/><br/>This place is all you know. The power is all you crave.<br/><br/>Are you a test subject? A weapon?<br/><br/>Seemingly trapped, all that matters now is growing your power.<br/><br/>Learn to catch rockets. Learn to throw cars. Learn to throw yourself through the air. <br/><br/>Learn to use your mind anew.<br/><br/>A wave based game, but definitely not a shooter, MOVRM offers a unique and replayable experience.<br/><br/><strong>Game Modes:</strong><br/><br/>Battle hordes of oncoming drones in <strong>Waves (Stationary)</strong>. Control dozens of objects at once or go for style points and use one or two at a time. Bonus points are awarded for destroying drones faster and with fewer objects controlled by a hand.<br/><br/>Test your agility by battling drones while throwing yourself around in <strong>Waves (Mobile)</strong>. This mode is not for those susceptible to motion sickness.<br/><br/>Will you defeat <strong>The Golem</strong>?<br/><br/><strong>Timed</strong> modes (Mobile and Stationary) are also available - see how many drones you can destroy before the time is up.<br/><br/>Or wield <strong>The Blade</strong> in your off-hand if you prefer to get up-close and personal when fighting (available in both mobile and stationary modes).<br/><br/>Now also available is <strong>The City</strong>, a vast area created from suggestions from the community. Battle robots and throw cars - this area includes all new enemies and challenges to face. Unleash your inner superhero.<br/><br/>Finally, relax in <strong>The Playground</strong> and experiment with your abilities in a comfortable setting where nothing is trying to kill you. Have a friend take control of Drones here using a mouse and keyboard.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/979/979b3c09ff6a33465cf349dd14695562.jpg", "website": "http://robotswilldestroyus.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 24}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joe Chatfield"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Joe Chatfield"], "esrb_rating": null}
