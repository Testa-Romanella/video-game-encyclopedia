These stones contain incredible powers that, once harnessed, provide the energy necessary to fuel our Magic-Punk society, a Steampunk-inspired environment powered by magic. While the world's inhabitants cannot tap into these powers on their own, they must channel them through special weapons. Some inhabitants seek to use these powers to protect their homelands, while others seek only chaos. Will you choose to defend your home from malicious forces, or let chaos overrun?</p><p>This project was developed by VGDC members between 2015 and 2018.</p>\r\nGame Instructions\r\n<ul><li>Left mouse to select stones and turn option.</li><li>Hold + drag right mouse to pan around the map.</li><li>Mouse wheel - zoom in and out of map.</li><li>Esc - adjust settings.</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li><strong>Lead Producer:</strong> David Anampa</li><li><strong>Creative Director:</strong> Austin Crismore</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Lead Programmer:</strong> Joshua Good</li><li><strong>UI Programmer:</strong> Andrew Karcher</li><li><strong>Gameplay Programmer:</strong> Jacob Stone</li><li><strong>Gameplay Programmer:</strong> Alex Sawicki</li><li><strong>Combat/AI/Graphics Programmer:</strong> Matthew Meeks</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Lead Designer:</strong> Manaka Green</li><li><strong>Level/Combat Designer:</strong> Will Payne</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Lead Artist:</strong> Kimberly Ramos</li><li><strong>Animator/Environment Artist:</strong> Jennifer Liu</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T04:15:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9bc/9bc7c36942bc7d0ab2e4b2a084760e3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VGDC@NCSU"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
