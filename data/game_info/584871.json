This game is like Super Mario 3D World, but it's 2D. When you get a Super Star, run into anything except goombas to kill them.\u00a0 When you get a Fire Flower, press Z to shoot fireballs. Arrow keys to move Mario. Up arrow to jump. There are 8 levels, and you might find new enemies along the way! I am new to programming so it might not be the best. I don't own Nintendo or any of their games/characters. This is a fan game. I did this just for fun. So Nintendo, please don't sue me. NOTE: PUT IN FULLSCREEN! The game runs in only one corner in full screen, but don't hate it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T06:18:15", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FireyMan2300"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
