With this being my first Game Jam, I decided to go with a simple idea and just see what I could learn, as I want to get better at Game Dev. I learned quite alot, and also reiterated stuff I already knew, which is how I learn properly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is a very simple concept. You play as a swarm of bees and you have to attack the evil beekeepers who are coming to destroy you.</p>\n<p>Be sure to let me know of any feedback or suggestions you have for the game.</p>\n<p>Links to all assets used:<br/></p>\n<p>https://nimblebeastscollective.itch.io/magosfonts\r\n</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/zelda-like-tilesets-and-sprites\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://superdark.itch.io/enchanted-forest-characters\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T07:21:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/191/1910d481b8b5d342b80125abc9190d58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Arcane Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
