Greye and\u00a0programmed by Malcolm Evans, GB Monster Maze is an interpretation of what I believe the game would look like, had it been adapted and released for the Nintendo Game Boy.</p>\n<p>There are two gameplay modes: Modern and Classic, the latter of which is essentially a direct port of the original. The former, however, has been achieved through basic raycasting, the same method used to create games such as Wolfenstein 3D.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n\n<p>Up arrow: Move forward, Change selection (on menu)</p>\n<p>Down arrow: Move back, Change selection (on menu)</p>\n<p>Left/Right arrows: Turn</p>\n<p>Z/Enter: Skip text, Select (on menu)</p>\n<p>Space: Change selection (On menu)</p>\n<p>If the default colour palette is unpleasant for you, there are alternate palettes that can be accessed by using the arrow keys on the startup screen,</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T04:55:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/284/284dc24be6a5159270a5f02521ebba5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spagev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
