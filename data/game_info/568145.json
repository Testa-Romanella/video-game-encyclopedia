Get out while you still can!</p>\n<p>This platformer will have you putting yourself against commonly deadly obstacles, such as slimes, spikes, lava, and bullets, in order to run away from an explosive (cause the explosive is worse somehow?)</p>\n<p>This game has the goal of going away from a point using obstacles in your way, rather than most common platformer's win condition of going to a point and lose condition of hitting obstacles too much. Failing is also progress, since getting hit by enemies, spikes, lava, etc. is commonly considered as \"failing\" but is actually progress in this game.</p>\n<p>It's very short, much shorter than I really wanted it to be. But it was submitted for the WOWIE Game Jam, so I hope you have fun!</p>\n<p>Big thanks to VGComposer for music, Tiny Worlds for font, Dustyroom and Little Robot Sound Factory for the sound effects, and you for playing the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T12:37:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2e/f2e128ff4b4fa8c085bebc9679bc53dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ThatANonoWord"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
