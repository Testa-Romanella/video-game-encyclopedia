You can terraform the surface, creating dozens of different biomes and climates. You can also customize the alien creatures that inhabit the world in an editor similar to The Sims, making them suitable for different temperatures. The future of this fledgling planet is yours in Genesis, the ultimate god game!</p>\n<p>I tried to make this game as intuitive as possible, if you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask. This game is in development, this is not the final version.<br/></p>\n<ul>Soundtrack<li>Claire de Lune by Claude Debussy</li><li>Death of Ase by Edvard Grieg</li><li>Die Moldau by Bedrich Smetana</li><li>Gnosienne by Erik Satie</li><li>Gymnopedie by Erik Satie</li><li>Jupiter Bringer of Jollity by Gustav Holst</li><li>Let All Mortal Flesh Keep Silence by Gerard Moultrie</li><li>Passepied by Claude Debussy</li><li>Pavane by Gabriel Faure</li><li>Piano Concerto In A Minor by Edvard Grieg</li><li>Salvator Mundi by Thomas Tallis</li><li>Sicilienne by Gabriel Faure</li><li>Solveig's Song by Edvard Grieg</li><li>Une Barque sur L'Ocean by Maurice Ravel</li><li>Veni Veni Emmanuel by John Mason Neal &amp; Henry Sloane Coffin</li><li>Waltz No. 2 by Dmitri Shostakovich</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T06:06:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/463/4635e401cf83ec34455edd098c38fff3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ROSSCOGames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
