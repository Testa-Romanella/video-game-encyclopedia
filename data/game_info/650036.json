It combines parkour and shooting to make a fast-paced fun game. There are 3 levels. I created it in a week so it isn't the best. I am terrible at music so there isn't any.\u00a0 Hope you enjoy</p>\n<p>I created 95% of the assets myself. I entered on the submission that I didn't make the assets myself. Sooo...\u00a0I am so bad at making music so I didn't create any. To be honest no music would sound better! Lol</p>\n<p>If you want to see the behind the scenes of making this game check out my youtube channel (If you want, you don't have it :)</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCnkScP4WZVrsNWH6FWf6Eg</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T07:29:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23a/23a18834fe0903dc986265d2448730bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["BezioYT"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
