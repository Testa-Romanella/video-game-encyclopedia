{"id": 919983, "slug": "of-bark-and-beetles", "name": "Of Bark and Beetles", "name_original": "Of Bark and Beetles", "description": "<p>Of Bark and Beetles is a Tower Defense game where you must defend a tree from the hordes of beetles that are trying to eat it. Choose from a wide selection of 4 towers that are geared towards offense and defense (we had to cut a few towers). Advance through waves of increasing difficulty where more enemies show up and they hit the gym more often. Making your way to Wave 10 (if you can) will anger the beetles enough to call in their boss, the Boss Beetle. This game is endless, so the goal is to just make it as far as you can! Hope you have fun playing this game for a few minutes or a few hours!</p>\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Programmers:\u00a0Jacob Hoge, Zach Dufek, Casey Schriever, Ethan Reichel</p>\n<p>Tower Logic/ Enemy Logic:\u00a0Ethan Reichel<br/>Tower Placement:\u00a0Zach Dufek<br/>Enemy Placement:\u00a0Casey Schriever<br/>UI Coding: Jacob Hoge\r\n</p>\n<p>Artists: Jacob Hoge, Daniel Wurzburger\r\n</p>\n<p>3D Artists:\u00a0Jacob Hoge, Daniel Wurzburger<br/>2D Artist:\u00a0Daniel Wurzburger<br/>UI Design: Jacob Hoge\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T07:06:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43d/43daf6d56fb4b8d111979f25759460b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team BillWilldered"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
