{"id": 784495, "slug": "starfall-secret-of-tyurma", "name": "Starfall: Secret of Tyur'ma", "name_original": "Starfall: Secret of Tyur'ma", "description": "<p><strong>Story Summary:</strong></p>\n<p>A long long time ago, an alien race was forced to use all of their magical energy to create a barrier deep within the core of the planet. This barrier was to keep an old, evil corruption from reaching the surface and threatening all living things on the planet. Any magic use now draws energy from this barrier, and if weakened enough in one area, some of the corruption is able to seep through and wreak havoc. It's for this reason that magic is feared on the planet. This same planet is now the last hope for humanity, as Earth has become nothing more than a war for what little resources are left. The relationship between the colonists and the natives has been troubled, if not worse. This tension is because the natives think that the technology the colonists use draws from the magical energy of the barrier. Will the colonists and natives learn to work together to fight against the evil corruption or will the last hope for both finally be extinguished?\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Game Flow Outline:\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p>StarFall is a turn based rpg with a heavy focus on the story and characters. The player is responsible for making sure that the colonists complete their mission to find a suitable planet for a human colony, either through dialogue or through more violent measures. The player will have to traverse the alien and sometimes hostile landscape of VMK-102. Not every tribe will be welcoming to the colonists, so it's going to take expert social skills to ensure the colonists don\u2019t end up roasting on a tribe's next campfire. The natives won\u2019t be the only thing to worry about though. There is an evil, dark corruption lurking in every corner of the world, and one misstep could spell the end for humanity\u2019s last hope. Knowing what to say could give the colonist the edge they need in fights, or it could make the situation worse and give them a disadvantage before a fight even starts, so the player will have to be careful with what they say.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The player will only control either the main character or the scouting caravan as a whole, both of which follow the same controls:\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Move: </strong>use the WASD keys on the keyboard to move the character up, down, left, and right on the screen.
