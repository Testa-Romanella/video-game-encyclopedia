I wrote this game in Clojure to learn the language.</p><p>This is my first roguelike and my first 7drl. A lot of features I wanted did not quite make it into the game as I ran out of time. The stuff that I actually got going though is pretty cool.</p><p>I managed to get random level generation and A*-pathfinding going which I'm quite pleased about.</p><p>So about the game:</p><p>The idea is this rogue character is stuck in a loop of a functional program (most probably a lisp dialect). The enemy (A) is immutable, can't be killed and just respawns.</p><p>The only way out is to kill S-expressions by taking out pairs of parens. On each level you need to look for the pair of parens before you can use the exit `% `. When you enter the next form (level) you get some health back.</p><p>Ultimately you're looking for the backquote character to escape evaluation.</p><p>Keys:</p><ul><li>h  left</li><li>u  up-left</li><li>n  down-left</li><li>l   right</li><li>i   up-right</li><li>m down-right</li><li>j   down</li><li>k  up </li><li>&gt;  exit to next level</li><li>q  quit</li></ul><p>Enjoy!</p><p>AM</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c15/c1577c007ce5057a3da45241deb9fb1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["n6replicant"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
