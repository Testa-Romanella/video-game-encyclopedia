Then, you will <strong>start the next level with nothing again</strong>.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Move</strong>: WASD/ZQSD/ArrowKeys</li>\n<li><strong>Orientation</strong>: Mouse</li>\n<li><strong>Mace</strong>: Left click</li>\n<li><strong>Bow attack</strong>: Right click</li><li>Show Experience: Tab key</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Made with love, beers and pizza by the GDPOP team.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T08:03:57", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["GDPOP"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
