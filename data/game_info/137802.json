In this game, players can play as one of the protagonists and fight it out with the rest to become The One Destined for Great Things!</p>\n<p>There's a catch though - due to the wacky laws of the universe, you will only see the environment and yourself.</p>\n<p>Feeling up to the challenge? Play our game and strive to be The Chosen One today!</p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>\n<p>Since this game is a starter project, we are currently using Unity's servers for free, <em>which only allows our game to have 20 players playing at a time (this translates to 5 game rooms of 4 players)</em>. Therefore, if you find yourself unable to play the game, you may have to wait for an existing player to leave before you can play.</p>\n<p>This game minimally requires 2 players in a game room.</p>\n<p><strong>Future Development</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Should we continue to work on this project, we will consider migrating to another system that does not impose a cap on server usage limit. Thus, do bear with us for now.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27c/27cd98aca89b684871ffd073ac1e4f16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Tay Guo Qiang"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
