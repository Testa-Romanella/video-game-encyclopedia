Behold: Centi-Snake, a hybrid between Snake and Centipede. Like Snake, you eat things to grow larger. Like Centipede, there's enemies trying to kill you.</p><p>The controls are simple (and two-button):</p><p>Left - Turn Left</p><p>Right - Turn Right</p><p>Eating food helps you grow or heal from damage. Moving slowly uses up health, starting from your tail and moving forward. Getting hit by bullets deals damage to the part that it hits. The head of your snake has 100 hitpoints, so make sure you don't get hit there too many times, or go too long without eating.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66e/66e9666953b831af7eb01e6066b4f7c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["utoxin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
