The galaxy once again finds itself culled and utterly in ruins. Guide a band of scientists through the ultimate test of survival and restore hope to the galaxy... one world at a time.  Play small maps casually, while pausing and issuing orders. Alternately, play massive maps in real-time with full save support.  The choice is yours.  Play the story missions, the community crafted missions, or use the built in mission generator for infinite possibilities.  Use the map editor to make your own maps for fun and sharing.  Create custom units, or even custom game play modes, and share those as well.Features<ul><li> 3D Terrain with numerous strategic options.<br/></li><li> Enhanced graphics<br/></li><li> Physics-based flowing 'Creeper' enemy with wave mechanics.<br/></li><li> Land, Air, and Orbital weapons.<br/></li><li> Custom unit support with scripting.<br/></li><li> Online map database.<br/></li><li> Story/Campaign missions.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-03T09:00:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a6/2a606c89d64b67a4043905f752ff1274.jpg", "website": "http://knucklecracker.com", "rating": 4.21, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 110, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 5, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 8, "achievements_count": 29, "ratings_count": 14, "suggestions_count": 509, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 14, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Knuckle Cracker"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Knuckle Cracker"], "esrb_rating": null}
