You have a selection of drills you can send down, with different effects. Your goal is to surviva as many turns as possible. <br/></p>\r\n- Controls\r\n<p><strong>Mouse </strong>- main interactions</p>\n<p><strong>P</strong> - Toggle fullscreen<br/></p>\r\n- Tutorial\r\n<p>Yes, i did not have time to make a full on tutorial. So here is the gist of it. <br/></p>\n<p>You select a drill from the cards to the right and drop them down on the window to the right. The drill will drop down and do their thing. You can hover over the cards to see what each drill does.<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\r\nGameplay with captions\r\n<p>Each turn, you get 3 resources. These are what you need to use a certain drill, their cost in displayed on the cards. You can also get ore from mining ore. <br/></p>\n<p>Most drills break if they try to drill trough rock. Certain drill can still drill trough them, and they are destroyed by explosions.<br/></p>\n<p>When you press \"text turn\" the ground moves upwards a bit. If any blocks reach the top of the screen you lose. <br/></p>\r\n- Developers note:\r\n<p>There is no set endpoint programmed into the game. Just dig down as far as you can. And see how many turns you live for. If you reach the bottom it is indicated by a floor of rock. If you manage to empty out the entire screen you have won the as much as is possible.</p>\n<p>You can turn off the music with the downward arrow key, wasn't very happy with the music i managed to make in the short time i gave myself, so added the feature if you don't like it. <br/></p>\n<p>Procedual generation was planned, but due to the limit of 2 days, it is just a single self made level. <br/></p>\n<p>There were some bugs introduced at the very end of development that mixed up some sound effects for some reason, thus not all sfx in the game are pressent of correct, but i managed to make it pretty decent.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>-Hope you enjoy the game :)<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T05:18:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ab/9abd43b243d812f447dc75db88899c09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PhilipL"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
