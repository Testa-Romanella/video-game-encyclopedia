It\u2019s a simple visual novel about a computer that tries to shut down, but the red button is to darn shiny not to press. It\u2019s really short, about 4-5 minutes with some light humor.</p>\n<p>Share your highscore if you ever reach one :)</p>\n<p>Also, don\u2019t forget to extract the zip before launching the .exe!
