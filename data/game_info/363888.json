And she uses only one spear which she knows how to throw it very well.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>The goal in the game is to survive as long as possible using only one weapon - a spear. Which you can only throw into your enemies and each time you do this, you lose it and should get the spear back yourself.</p>\n<p>------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>-\u00a0WASD for movement;</p>\n<p>- LMB for shooting (hold to charge);</p>\n<p>------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I didn't have any time and power to work on sounds. As a result, the game doesn't have any sound. However, I hope you will enjoy the game.</p>\n<p>------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>Art by 0x72, you can download it <strong>here</strong>.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/528/528bbaae6fd3fa772322b47f2ae26058.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tricky_Fat_Cat"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
