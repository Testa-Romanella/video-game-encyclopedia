He must play either the next card in sequential order or a wild '*' card, using either cards in hand, the top card of his stock pile, or the top card of any of his four discard piles. If the player can play all five cards from hand, he draws five more and continues playing. When no more plays are available, the player discards one card to either an empty discard pile or on top of an existing one and play passes to the next player. When a build pile reaches 12, it is removed from the board and that space becomes empty for another pile to be started; play continues until one player has played his final start card.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-29T14:47:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e8/0e89bad537e879ea0d5ba403b45eaa30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Paul Burlov"], "genres": ["Card"], "publishers": ["Paul Burlov"], "esrb_rating": null}
