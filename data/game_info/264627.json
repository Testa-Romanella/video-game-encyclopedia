Made in Processing.</p><p><strong>Prototype 2: Gravity<br/></strong></p><p>You play as a planet that can change its own gravitational pull. Using this ability you must pull in any passerby objects to collect points whilst also avoiding the aliens that take away points. Collect as many points before the time limit.</p><p><strong>Prototype 3: Revenge Racing</strong></p><p>Originally supposed to be a split screen multiplayer game where you both have your own ping pong tables, racket and ball and you must make sure it doesn't go past you whilst aiming for 50 consecutive hits. Had some major programming issues that made the game unplayable and I couldn't finish it in time. I elaborate more in the ISSUES pause menu in the game. Press ESC to access the menu.</p><p><strong>Prototype 4: Embodied Interaction<br/></strong></p><p>Endless climber game where you must use the voice command \"Jump\" to make your player jump and the A and D keys to make him move. You must see how far you can make it into the sky whilst also avoiding any enemies you see. Was originally going to add webcam movement but ran out of time.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aed/aed3892e71e83425fcfb15eef4deb1b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Experimental Game Design"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
