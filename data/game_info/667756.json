The day before she is to host a tea party at her house, she realizes she is completely out of tea, and thus must venture into the woods around her to find the herbs she needs to restock her pantry.<br />\nYou are free to tackle the list of ingredients Teacup must gather in any order you wish. Find your own path through the world of Little Pond.<br />\nDuring your adventure you will meet the charming inhabitants of the forest. Some are talkative, some are grumpy, but all of them will lend you an ear on your adventure.<br />\nMost of the animals you meet will be glad to help Teacup\u2026 in exchange for a small favor or some help. Organize a (oddly shaped) market stall, win an underwater race and more!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-11T17:27:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/94a/94ace7d9110920cf01c346c1f07c63b0.jpg", "website": "https://smarto.club/", "rating": 3.43, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 7, "owned": 54, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 28, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["PlayStation 5", "PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "PC", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Smarto Club"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Whitethorn Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
