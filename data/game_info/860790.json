When playing in any other resolution, the UI may appear somewhat out of place + parts of the image will be cut off. If you are playing in anything other than 16:9 or 16:10, during one particular scene, you will not be able to click on 3 objects to examine them (as the resolution will mean they are cut off of the edge of the screen). 1 of those objects unlocks a CG.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Please note that the game was designed to be played with head/earphones on and all audio turned on. Some of the SFX are timed with the voice acting, so if you change the text reveal speed or skip through text, SFX may play slightly out of time.</strong></p>\n\r\n- Controls -\r\n<p><strong>Advance Text - Left mouse click, mouse scroll wheel down, spacebar\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rewind Text - Mouse scroll wheel up, left arrow key\u00a0<br/></strong><strong><em>(text cannot be rewound after making a choice, so please save the game if you want to pick a different choice faster)</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Skip Mode (fast) - Up arrow key</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Skip Mode (toggle) - Right arrow key\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Auto Mode - Down arrow key</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0Open Backlog - B key\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Toggle/Hide UI - H key</strong></p>\n<p><strong>If you need help with anything, enjoyed the game and want to talk about it, or just want to tell me something in general, please either use the comments section (and don't forget to rate and review the game too if you had fun because it helps a lot :3) or feel free to message me here:<br/><em>melancholicmarionette@gmail.com</em></strong>\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dawn of the Damned was made in under 1 month for Spooktober VN Jam 2022</strong>\n</p>\r\n- Written &amp; Created by -\r\n<p><strong>\u00a0Melancholy Marionette\u00a0<br/></strong><strong>(using Naninovel x Unity)<br/>\u00a0</strong><strong>@Marionette_Mask</strong></p>\r\n- CG Art -\r\n<p><strong>Tsukihowl &amp; JamilSlut (TrashMomAru)<br/></strong><strong>@Tsukihowl - itchio\u00a0-\u00a0</strong><strong>@JamilSlut</strong></p>\r\n- Additional CGs Line Art -\r\n<p><strong>LazyCrocodile<br/>@MrsLaziness0\u00a0-\u00a0</strong><strong>tumblr</strong>\n</p>\r\n- Additional CGs Colouring -\r\n<p><strong>sophrossynes<br/>@sophrossynes\u00a0-\u00a0Instagram\u00a0-\u00a0</strong><strong>tumblr</strong>\n</p>\r\n- OST -\r\n<p><strong>Melancholy Marionette</strong></p>\r\n- CAST -\u00a0\r\n\r\nMorgenr\u00f6te\r\n<p><strong>JJWalker</strong></p>\r\nD\u00e4mmerung\r\n<p><strong>Jerron Bacat\u00a0-\u00a0</strong><strong>@JerronBacat</strong></p>\r\nSchrat\r\n<p><strong>Lauren Kong -\u00a0</strong><strong>@LaurenK_VA</strong></p>\r\nAurora\r\n<p><strong><strong>Beck</strong></strong></p>\r\n- Additional Assets Used -\u00a0\r\n\r\n<p><strong>- Sprite Art - <br/>sasAIchi (edited by Melancholy Marionette)<br/>Schrat Sprite - Yukino Nanami's Atelier (edited by Melancholy Marionette)<br/><br/>- Mansion Backgrounds - <br/>Background material shop\u00a0(edited by Melancholy Marionette)<br/>\n<br/>- Additional Background Art -<br/>Minikle (some of which edited by Melancholy Marionette)<br/> <br/>- UI Art Elements -\u00a0<br/> UI design by Melancholy Marionette, created with the following assets:<br/>Yukino Nanami's Atelier\u00a0(edited by Melancholy Marionette)<br/>otohimenohanagasa (edited by Melancholy Marionette)<br/>Mori no oku no kakurezato (edited by Melancholy Marionette)<br/>Eclair Apple Tea (for blood spatter on 1 sprite + on the camera)<br/><br/>- SFX -<br/>Mainly from freesfx.co.uk (edited by Melancholy Marionette)<br/><br/>- Additional SFX -<br/>Sidearm Studios (edited by Melancholy Marionette)\r\n<br/>pigmyon studio (edited by Melancholy Marionette)<br/><br/>- UI\u00a0 SFX -<br/>GameDev Market Sellers Epicstockmedia &amp; TomWinandySFX</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>- Voice FX -\u00a0<br/>Created by Melancholy Marionette using a mixture of Audacity and FLstudio</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Loops from the following\u00a0looperman\u00a0users were used to compose parts of the OST:\u00a0<br/></strong>Sushilbawa, LMGStudio, VIVEK, maciek09, xen0s, Makalo, diamondwavcom, issa-knife, JuLeeBeats,\u00a0TheLostPoet28, bladersbeats, mctinna, BeatsByXero, UndercoverProdigy, honeybeats1, w1ndbeatz,\u00a0MrRivus,treasbeats, ISLA1, ChrisNeal, d3w</p>\n<p><strong>Other loops and samples used to compose parts of the OST came from Laniakea and Prime Loops (Producer Loops) - purchased from Humble Bundle Music Producer Asset Bundles</strong></p>\n<p>Dawn of the Damned is a spinoff/standalone backstory that will eventually be related\u00a0to one of my main projects, Darling Duality.
