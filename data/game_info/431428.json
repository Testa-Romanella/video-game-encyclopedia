Probably not for small children(death, violence).<br/></p>\n<p>It is opening day in your brand new Tiger Zoo. But wait there are no tigers, no staff and no customers. Time to get to work...</p>\n<p> How to play: The game is over after 20 rounds or if you have 5 police tokens. You will need to buy cards from your hand and place them on the buildings. End turn to activate the cards effects and get a new hand.</p>\n<p> Some cards only activate when other cards are in the same building. For example: You need a keeper, tiger and a customer together in a building to earn money of the customer.</p>\n<p> Play multiple times and find all synergies and combinations.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T09:15:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab6/ab6f34e18bc23e7abd706f097c7b77bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["headchant"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
