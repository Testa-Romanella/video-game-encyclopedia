Its key difference being that the remaining suits pullable from each round's deck are revealed to you ahead of time; use that information however your liking.<br/></p>\n<p>There's also some health management and extra difficulty you've got to contend with. The dealer can deduct quite large sums of money from you if\u00a0they happen to get a good hand. I hope you don't find it too daunting... The game will end in your defeat if you run out of either cash or hearts! Please be careful.\u00a0</p>\n<p>At least if you lose you can post your highest score that game onto the leaderboards. Oh! But <strong>only on the downloaded version.</strong> I suppose I should have mentioned that somewhere sooner.<br/></p>\n<p>I've been working on this on/off for awhile now. It's the first game I collaborated with other people on for additional resources like art and music, so it finally getting finished is a decently big deal to me despite its small-scale. Such wonderful people involved include:</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 PaperDawN</strong> for Art<br/></p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Random-storykeeper</strong>\u00a0for\u00a0Music</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Adi Keltsh</strong> for Sound Effects<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T05:13:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/399/399026d0c56730cec700adb6e312c4a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["tonyfinale", "Random-StoryKeeper", "Adi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
