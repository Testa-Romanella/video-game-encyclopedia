There are areas of interactive experience of elements, such as lawn, tree, bamboo forest, bamboo leaf, etc. in virtual scenes, players can move and walk in the virtual scene, and instantly move to the designated locations in virtual scenes. The player touches objects or models in the virtual scene, and when the handle is touched, the handle will vibrate and pick up the virtual objects (bamboo, bamboo leaves) and feed the pandas. In the virtual scene, virtual objects are used to interact with pandas. There are different sizes of pandas in the scene. Each panda has its own AI behavior and can interact. It enables players to observe the panda better and interact with them. With the deepening of interaction, we can unlock more new interactive modes while increasing intimacy.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:55:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c24/c24c49a2c03aa27271900218e1f5d218.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 378, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u6210\u90fd\u73af\u5a31\u4e92\u52a8\u79d1\u6280\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["\u6210\u90fd\u73af\u5a31\u4e92\u52a8\u79d1\u6280\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8"], "esrb_rating": null}
