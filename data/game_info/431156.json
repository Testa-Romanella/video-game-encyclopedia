Even though I had planned using some different development systems for each jams, after announcement of theme I decided to develop a hyper-casual game. I wanted to extend it to a casual but that will be on full release I think.</p>\n<p>Game is simple, you are trying to protect animals gathered at the center of the screen. There are some alien ships who want to destroy animals. Your goal is preventing aliens as long as possible while not letting animals die from hunger. I am thinking adding some powerups to give some variety to gameplay and maybe a different part to see gathered animals (this is supported in this version to but I did not finished implementation). If you can give me ideas about gameplay that will be very helpfull.</p>\n<p>I codded whole game by myself there is only free LeanTween library in addition to my codes. I developed game in Unity. At the start my goal was participating in Jam but whole game finished yesterday so I decided to run for compo. I tried to try out some different tools and styles for graphics and I am aware that neither graphics not musics are good. I don't have a sense of art I think.</p>\n<p>Anyway time to make a game for Jam this time. Enjoy Precious Animals and keep them safe as long as possible for me please.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T08:10:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab9/ab970f72d8747b3fe96072cd0acc419d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["despdair"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
