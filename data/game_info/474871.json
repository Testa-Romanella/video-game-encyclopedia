This presentation is simple and only covers situations where one car is chasing one other car, but in playtesting so far it's proven enjoyable as a standalone game. You can play out one chase in 5 to 10 minutes once you get the hang of it, and kids as young as 5 can enjoy it too, though grownups may have to help them a little when things get tactical.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>SEEING &amp; BEING SEEN / STEALTH MODE</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A single-page subsystem, ripped from context, but it should make sense. In\u00a0<em>Revolution Comes to the Kingdom</em>, the cut and thrust of uncertain action revolves not around fights per se (those are over pretty quickly)\u00a0but\u00a0around distance, cover, and who can see whom. This sometimes functions like a stealth game in the vein of <em>Splinter Cell</em> or <em>Thief</em>. At other times, it\u2019s something more like the historical wargames of 20th-century conflict that focus on \u2018target acquisition\u2019 between small armed units. Not exactly about ninja-style sneaking but more concealment and camouflage.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anyway, this is a sample of that. I've also thrown in some GM notes on setting up the kind of situations where these rules come into play.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This issue is 12 pages long.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T07:37:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/801/801eccdcbd62fe93cd70bfd3af58d3e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Porcupine"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
