{"id": 418808, "slug": "hyperspace-liquidators", "name": "Hyperspace Liquidators", "name_original": "Hyperspace Liquidators", "description": "<p>Hyperspace Liquidators is an Islanders inspired puzzle game in which you try to restore the collapsed ecosystem of a once inhabited planets. You place buildings to change tile stats and gain points, which gets you access to new buildings. Eventually, you might turn parts of the poisoned, burning and eroded wasteland into flourishing plains. But most likely you just dump tons of sci-fi tech on a planet in an ill fated attempt to restore a system that is too complicated to be fixed properly. Pretty stupid of the locals to fuck up their planet this badly, right?</p>\n\n<p>The game was made in 48 hours for Global Game Jam 2020 using GDevelop. While playable, its also pretty broken and outright unfair in some places. I still liked the visuals too much for not uploading though. But I don't think it's particularly good and its definitely badly balanced, inaccessible and way too confusing.</p>\n<p>Feature List:</p>\n<p>- The game procedural generates a planet and crudely simulates various eco system interactions, featuring in temperature, erosion, soil quality, pollution and the overall geography of land masses. <br/></p>\n<p>-11 building types that affect local and global properties of tiles or even the entire planet. Most only work on specific tile types or only grant points for tiles with specific stats. They also come with  different effects ranges.  <br/></p>\n<p>-5 tile types that you need to adapt your strategy to. Mountains and Deserts aren't conductive to eco restorations. The oceans can be used to gain points, but don't contribute towards your goal of restoring the continental wasteland. Plains are valuable real estate for your buildings, but can suffer a wide array of detriments.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Also I later learned that Terra Nil exists, which basically is a game about the same topic that does everything better. So maybe  go play that instead. Peace. :p<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-13T03:18:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/603/60350aa18053d6ab34bdbc4548e9e8aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sleeper_games"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
