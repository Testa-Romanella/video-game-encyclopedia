In this high-score based game.</p><p>This game was made as a submission for the Mini Jam 36 themed\u00a0Nature.</p>\n<p>At first I wanted to make the game fully coloured, I also wanted to make the trees fade as their hp got low. My ideas lived in harmony, then the limitation attacked.</p><p>The game's art has only 3 colours as a limitation by the jam. The colours I used were inspired by the classic GameBoy colour palette.</p>\n<p>The game was not made with any particular forest in mind.</p>\n<p>If you find any bugs or have any kind of feedback either post it in the comments or tweet me\u00a0@MohammedShwarib. all feedback is welcome.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-09T07:01:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8a/b8a2d5ae513dde6d425c38c559187d74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MoonMoth"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
