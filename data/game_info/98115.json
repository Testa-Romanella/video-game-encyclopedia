We imagine it as the spiritual successor to Shufflepuck Caf\u00e9 with a dark side. The goal is simple, score more points than your opponent. You can unlock powers and collect them, you can play alone (against the A.I. in the story mode, or match by match in Arcade), online (against other players from around the world), or as several players on the same screen (at home or at a friend\u2019s home).</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022\tUNIQUE ARTSTYLE</strong>\u00a0\u2013 Inspired by popular 80s and 90s media, AcidSoul brings air hockey back to the gaming world. Fall into the world of AcidSoul and save the world, one puck at a time.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022\t17+ LEVEL (so far)</strong>\u00a0\u2013 Every level is its own universe. Every playable level has its own story and unique characteristics that affect the gameplay. If we meet our stretch goal we hope to double the number of playable levels.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022\tHAND-DESIGN LEVELS</strong>\u00a0\u2013 Nearly everything is hand-drawn, from the characters to animations, the sets and even the underpants on the clothesline that swing in the wind.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022\tHYPER DYNAMIC GAMEPLAY</strong>\u00a0\u2013 The gameplay is very fast paced. Add in powers and unique environmental elements and the game becomes even faster.
