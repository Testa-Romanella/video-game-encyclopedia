{"id": 569516, "slug": "super-mama-world", "name": "Super Mama World", "name_original": "Super Mama World", "description": "<p>This is a small 3D platformer featuring Mama (from\u00a0Don't Call Me Mama But Yes I Am Your Mama). It was made as a way to say thank you and\u00a0look back on Kyle Bosman's four years with Easy Allies, specifically his late night solo streams.<br/></p>\n<p>Gameplay wise, it is inspired heavily by games like Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie, some of my favorite games and platformers from when I\u00a0was a kid. There's also an inventory system that was designed specifically to work like the one from Resident Evil 4.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This does contain some copyrighted music and images\u00a0from other games, so it is not downloadable and there will never be a way to support this project financially. I\u00a0am looking to take that stuff out so that it can be made public, hopefully I'll find the time to do that soon. In the meantime, if you're interested, please check out the brief walkthrough video linked on this page.</p>\n<p>**Known Issue: The game will every once in a while/rarely run into a fatal error and crash when launched. It seems to maybe be an engine or DirectX issue. Relaunching fixes it, at least for me (unknown if permanently\u00a0or not).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T06:08:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04c/04c2d2ea3b4ae34a881747abfa17cddc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WordsAndDreams"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
