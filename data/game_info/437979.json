I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>-----<br/></p>\n<p>Beatrix is used to being misunderstood by her fellow peers. With her sharp eyes, tall height, and ringlets, she looks like the mean villain straight from a novel. Thus, she decided that if she was forever going to be seen as the mean bully, she might as well reside herself to the role. However, things change when she becomes fast friends with the new commoner transfer student, to everyone\u2019s surprise including her own. And more weirdly, how this new transfer student can seem to understand her better than anyone else and can see her for her true self rather than the part she had been reluctantly forced to play!</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Beatrix Clermont, </strong>our easily misunderstood narrator. Has only one friend. Current concern is her height.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Lily\u00a0Abbot</strong>, Beatrix's best and only friend.
