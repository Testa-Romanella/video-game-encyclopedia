Check his channel out for Unity Tutorials. This was only my second Unity project, I am mostly uploading it to figure out how building works and how to upload to itch.io. I (hopefully) removed a bug in the tutorial that allowed apples to spawn on the snake's tail, and I added a mechanic to increase the player speed as the game progresses. All simple stuff but hey I'm proud of myself, I haven't touched C# (or like any language) in a couple years so I'm easin' back into it.</p>\n<p>The in-browser WebGL build does not run well with post-processing so I added a download for a windows build</p>\n<p>Also credit to Concerned Ape for the Stardew font</p>\n<p>I like giving credit</p>\n<p>Addicted to it, even</p>\n<p>Aroused by it</p>\n<p>Also I'm the guy with the 10 followers on YouTube:\u00a0youtube.com/channel/UCB6l8iha0ZjxnTB6RtVj-Iw/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T06:13:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f25/f255cccc9fc51c2cee08f17029325a42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["BakeFynn"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
