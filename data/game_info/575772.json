It's a car game that I've been programming for 3 years. I focus on physics and complex systems like complete fuel management, engine heating, damage ... Today on BetaTest 2 is available and I invite you to try it out and tell me what you think about it on Itch.io and GameJolt or Youtube. You can also follow the progress of the game on Youtube on video or follow the progress of the game on GameJolt. Today on my BetaTest 2 you can go to the Monza circuit to try to break time records! We can also find the usual FreeZone. You can also choose 6 cars from different ranges, choose the quantity of fuel you want in your car, the temperature of the track ... And many other things !! So don't hesitate any longer! Play !</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nBeta Test 2 is paying ( 4.99 \u20ac\u00a0 ~\u00a0 6.00 $ ) because in its future development the game will need some important updates . And also it allows me to see if you like this project! and it makes me happy!\r\n\n<p><strong>Controls :</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>System Requirements :</strong></p>\n<p><strong>64 bit Version only !</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Minimum :</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Processor:</strong>\u00a0Intel Core i5-650 / AMD FX-63000 or equivalent</li>\n<li><strong>Memory:\u00a0</strong>6GB RAM</li>\n<li><strong>Graphics:</strong>\u00a0NVIDIA GeForce GTX 750ti with 2 GB VRAM or more / AMD Radeon RX 550</li>\n<li><strong>DirectX:</strong>\u00a0Version 11</li>\n<li><strong>Storage:</strong>\u00a0149 Mo available space</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Recommended :</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Processor:</strong>\u00a0Intel Core i7- 4790 / AMD Ryzen 5 3600 or equivalent</li>\n<li><strong>Memory:\u00a0</strong>8GB RAM</li>\n<li><strong>Graphics:</strong>\u00a0NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 with 2 GB VRAM or more / AMD Radeon RX 580</li>\n<li><strong>DirectX:</strong>\u00a0Version 11</li>\n<li><strong>Storage:</strong>\u00a0149 Mo available space</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My Youtube Channel :\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/BullsFurious</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T07:14:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd0/cd0ce300546d4713ae0f50a72d430a3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 204, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BullsFurious"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
