Years upon years of bloodshed and tears stain every part of our beloved country now. I stand now on the precipice of it all coming to an end. I do not write this down for any to see, but to have a listen into my thoughts. See through my eyes as I travel with my friend, Pinkie Pie, into the Everfree. There I will conquer the mission set out to me by Princess Luna. If I fail, the war continues, and harmony will disappear for years to come.</p><p>Also in Chinnesse and Russian language!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/901/90190437dfdc858fcbafbf843d5acc51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 328, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Marshal Ruffy"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
