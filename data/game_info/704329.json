But sadly the ocean got filled by lots of trash and every few seconds, more trash appears. <br/></p>\n<p>Clean all the trash up, by moving the boat with <strong>WASD or the arrow keys</strong>. <br/>You can <strong>push the trash</strong> in the direction the boat is moving. Like this,<strong> connect three pieces</strong> of trash or more and they will disappear.<br/></p>\n<p>But be careful, there is also<strong> nuclear waste</strong> in the ocean. After a given time those barrels will <strong>turn into toxic splashes</strong>. And those can\u00b4t be moved! <br/>Luckily you only need to connect <strong>two of them</strong>.<br/><br/><br/>Music: Acoustic Breeze\u00a0from Bensound.com<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T13:24:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/675/67550099ba15f101ffbbff158088cb36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["MoGamer09", "M_DC"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
