This super short docu-narrative experience\u00a0explores this through VR.</p>\n<p>Created for VR Jam 2021, adhering to the theme \"small world\", <em>For Sore Eyes</em> explores a theme which we have all become ever more aware of through the pandemic.</p>\n<p>As my first attempt at a VR title, the game is certainly very rough around the edges. However, if you stay on track, the key narrative should be experienced with no problem. Please do let me know if there are any gamebreaking bugs.</p>\n<p>The experience of making this game was great--another experience starting out with the endless question of \"how am I going to do this\" ending with \"wow, I can't believe I achieved that in three days\". <br/></p>\n<p>I wish I could have included far more interactions (doors, grabbing clutter, etc) alas I ran into some pretty major issues with the physics which sent me flying into the abyss... So that, as well as polish, animated hands and a whole lot more fell into the pile of problems for future me to figure out.</p>\n<p>Feedback would be much appreciated.</p>\n\r\nCompatibility\u00a0\r\n<p>Made and tested on Oculus Rift S.</p>\n<p>Should work with other Oculus devices.</p>\n<p>Untested elsewhere.<br/></p>\r\nAssets/Materials\r\n<p>Much code was sourced from Unity's XR Toolkit, while bits and bobs were written by me [occasionally with Bolt].<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Items\r\n<ul><li>\"Too Many Items\" furuniture packs - Asset Store</li><li>Extras provided in Unity's \"Crease with VR\" course.</li><li>Some made by me!</li></ul></li><li>Sound<ul><li>Sourced from Freesound.</li></ul></li><li>Music<ul><li>Julian Winter - Home</li><li>Vagia Papapostolou - So Many Lonely Nights</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li><p>Video</p><ul><li>March of Time Report (Public Domain)</li><li>Randy Rides Alone (Public Domain)</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>Fonts<ul><li>Free to use from DaFont.com.</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T03:22:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d5/9d5b549b27781d818dd84e322b11d7bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CinemaLeo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
