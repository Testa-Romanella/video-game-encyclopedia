Let's find out with Tetra and her friends Zitta (Z.), Ella (E.), Rona (R.) and Ooo (O.)! The game's source code is available on GitHub. This my first game made in libGDX and my first game :)</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Click anywhere or press any key to start the game.</li><li>\"W\", \"S\", \"A\", \"D\" to move the block up, down, left or right.</li><li>\"Q\" and \"E\" to rotate block counterclockwise or clockwise.</li><li>The game currently doesn't support mobile or touch inputs.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Filling in a rectangle\u00a0of any shape with an area of at least 12 squares cancels the blocks in the rectangular area.</li><li>Upon canceling, if there is a single color that covers more than 50% of the canceled area, the game\u00a0spawns a special power block of that color next turn.</li><li>Special power blocks:<ul><li>Pink: When stopped, becomes a normal pink block and then turns all existing pink blocks into the majority color counted\u00a0among all existing non-pink blocks.</li><li>All other colors: When stopped, self-destruct and\u00a0destroy the blocks in the 8 x 8 surrounding area.</li></ul></li><li>Blocks spawn with random shapes and orientations. Pink blocks spawn with a 80% probability, all other blocks each spawns with a 5% probability.</li><li>The default block speed accelerates over time. For each spawned block, it speeds up every time you change its speed or orientation.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Acknowledgement</strong></p>\n<p>Some background tiles are taken from Solaria and\u00a0Pixel Button Prompts.\u00a0The background music is taken from Snabisch and the sound effects are taken from rubberduck.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T07:17:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94f/94f4e22cb889ef51fce064551bd6fb87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ainpuw"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
