The game is a simple arcade-style game.</p>\n<p>The year is 1730 and you\u2019re the captain of the HMS Oceanic. Your majesty and kingdom have just\u00a0 made a deal with the French to place primitive dad-gathering buoys in different coves throughout\u00a0 the English Channel. These buoys will be used to gather weather information important to\u00a0 research in war-ship design over the next few decades. However, the buoys will need to be\u00a0 placed in dangerous areas populated by nothing more than mines and kraken-like octopi. You,\u00a0 the captain of the HMS Oceanic is tasked with pushing these buoys into place throughout the\u00a0 Channel. Each mission will be met with challenges navigating the tight passages of the coves or\u00a0 deploying buoys in octopi-infested waters. There are extra buoys in some areas so don\u2019t be\u00a0 afraid to ram the mines with them; just make sure you have enough left to complete the mission!\u00a0 The octopi are only dangerous if you get caught in their tentacles, SO BE CAREFUL. Good luck,\u00a0 and fair seas Captain.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e6/2e6bde99314a203d222f4d5e028c3aa2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Breton Ballas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
