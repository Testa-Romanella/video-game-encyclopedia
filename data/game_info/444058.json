Starting in my former room layout, you are free to explore the rooms as you see fit.\u00a0 From there, there is a doorway to alternative versions of the space. These doorways lead to more rooms, filled with a mixture of me and my friends furniture.\u00a0The four walls may remain the same, yet the\u00a0rooms take on new identity with the objects inside. Even the objects themselves begin to feel refreshed when placed into different corners of the room. As I moved through my space,\u00a0my single room transformed into many.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This movement relieved\u00a0me in a way, and helped me appreciate the space that I already had. I didn't realize how varied my space could be because I had become numb to a single version of it. The digital rearrangement helped me visualize both the possibilities that lay around me and within myself. If my room could change\u00a0to suit me, then I could surely change myself to suit the now hostile world that surrounded me. The things on the inside always have\u00a0potential. It is easy to miss that when the those things\u00a0do not move, when the furniture is static.\u00a0 Fortunately,\u00a0it is just as easy to realize that potential. You just have to begin\u00a0moving. It can be that simple.</p>\n<p>I hope some of that belief and the\u00a0relief it gave me,\u00a0comes\u00a0across as you move through the space yourself. The final state of this remains in the experimental.\u00a0The reality is both our actual and digital spaces take a lot of effort to change. There are\u00a0only so many times I can physically move my bed, shelf, or desk.\u00a0 But at least I can rest assured that\u00a0here in The Room I Wish I Had, our movement is all that we\u00a0need.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The full documentation is here:\u00a0https://medium.com/@jasonzhenli/making-the-room-i-wish-i-had-from-the-room-i-actually-have-bb8fa92fc87c</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>W, A, S, D - move forward, left, right, backward</p>\n<p>Mouse movement - look around</p>\n<p>ESC - Open menu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T06:43:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96b/96b49209c36b5eed47105369d1d974c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jason L"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
