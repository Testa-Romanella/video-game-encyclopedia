I knew he used\u00a0play games like Galaga when he was younger, so that's what the gameplay of this game is supposed to root from.\u00a0Making this was actually quite fun and Im also really excited to finally be able to get one of my game out there. Its obviously not the best game and\u00a0I didn't want to spend too much time on it. Although I think it's still a playable game that some may get somewhat into.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T05:32:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f17/f17a43dec95fd46bc18ac3b995e00d78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LightIceGames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
