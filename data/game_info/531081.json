After walking for a bit, the player discovers a temple far off in the distance, surrounded by a jungle. The moment the player catches sight of the temple, a strange bolt of lightning appears over it. Curious, the player starts to walk towards it and soon finds a magic staff, which appears to be living. The staff tells the player that in order to return home, they will need to find and collect three crystals to destroy the evil lurking above the temple. To pick up objects, collide with them. To move around use W, A S, D. To jump press space bar. Have fun! Press clear on the development console while in fullscreen mode for maximum viewing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T04:43:04", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LJMSTSA2020"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
