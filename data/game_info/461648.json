Each match in Crucible is a fight for survival and control. Not only will you be going toe-to-toe with your fellow competitors, but you\u2019ll have to adapt and overcome all the challenges the planet itself throws your way. You and your teammates will need to work together to take down alien creatures, capture objectives, and pursue your opponents in search of victory.</p>\n<p>HUNT LEVEL ADAPT<br />\nWhether you prefer to bring an axe to a gunfight, think that the best way to solve problems is by lighting them on fire, or want to keep your options open with multiple weapons, there\u2019s a hunter to suit your playstyle. Crucible&#39;s 10 hunters each come with their own unique set of abilities\u2014how you use them is up to you.<br />\nBegin every match on a level playing field. Each hunter has their full array of weapons and abilities at their disposal from the word \u201cgo.\u201d<br />\nBefore each match, you\u2019ll select which upgrades to unlock as you level up. With these upgrades, you can define how your hunter fights. Bring along additional utility and tricks or go all-in on your damage output\u2014it&#39;s up to you.<br />\nEssence is a strange substance with incredible properties, and it&#39;s the object of all the commotion on the planet Crucible. You can get it from opponents and creatures you kill, or by controlling objectives. As you collect Essence, you&#39;ll level up.</p>\n<p>You&#39;ll get access to your pre-selected upgrades with each of your first five levels. After that, more levels mean more power and health.<br />\nUse your abilities and your wits to master the environment and battle conditions around you. Learn the lay of the land and use it to your advantage. Capitalize on events, grab all the Essence you can, hunt down the opposition, and claim victory.</p>\n<p>Heart of the Hives<br />\nHives are lethal drone-spitting terrors that spawn across the battlefield. Capturing the hearts they leave behind as they die is your key to victory. Each match is a four-on-four fight to be the first team to capture three hearts.</p>", "metacritic": 56, "released": "2020-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-23T06:32:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/ff8/ff87cbfdf6a4c39551e2024b1a4ac3e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 1.59, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 273, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 22, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 22, "suggestions_count": 352, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 22, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Relantless Studios", "TriScale"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Amazon Games", "DigiPen Institute of Technology"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
