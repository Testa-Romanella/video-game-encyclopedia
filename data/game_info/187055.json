Collect the orb, get sent to prison, then break back out!</p>\n\n<p>Use WASD to move. Mouse to move torch. Go near doors to open. Go near boxes and lockers to hide. Watch the arrest bar at the top, that is how much progress the police have in taking you down! Look out for small coloured batteries, they will allow you to see more with your torch\u00a0for a short period of time. Look out for the roboguards, they will taze you which will add a lot onto your arrest progress. If movement appears slow or anything appears to lag, make sure that Anti Lag is enabled, this will turn down the light shading.\u00a0Press 'L' in game or use the button in the main menu to toggle anti lag. Use esc to leave and it will save your progress.</p>\n\n<p>See the side of the page for snapshots. Gameplay video coming soon!
