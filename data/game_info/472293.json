Please read the Alpha Tester's Guide if you're looking to help submit some bugs.</strong></p>\r\nCasual but Challenging\r\n<p>Casual in it's approach but punishing in it's execution, IGEO DX is a fun and rewarding Sokoban-style puzzle game. Mechanically simple but challenging, players will\u00a0push and combine like-shapes to solve increasingly complex spatial and logic puzzles.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The goal is simple:\u00a0<strong>clear the board</strong>. To remove shapes from the board players will have to push two of the same shape together. Combining shapes can have different effects and combining unlike shapes results in a\u00a0<em>game over</em>.</p>\n<p>It's not always so simple! With pits and walls, the player must move precisely to keep from falling off the board or trapping a shape in a tough spot.</p>\n\r\nMovement and Logic\r\n<p>IGEO DX thrives on challenging players' abilities to think forward and navigate the steps it will take to clear a level. As the game advances, special tiles and obstacles present additional adversity in moving and completing levels.</p>\n<p>Whether you're slipping on\u00a0<strong>Ice Tiles</strong> or engaging\u00a0<strong>Switches</strong> to power\u00a0<strong>Doors</strong>, you could be\u00a0one move away from victory or failure.</p>\n\r\nBeware the Virus\r\n<p>Some tiles in the game are infected by a dangerous virus. Moving into these tiles will infect the player causing their movement to be capped at 10 tiles before they succumb to the disease and fail the level.</p>\n<p>Good news, though - there are Curing Tiles ready and waiting to remove that dastardly infection and keep you scooting on!</p>\n\r\nBuild Your Own\r\n<p>Upon its full release, IGEO DX will have an in-depth level creation system. This built-in tool will allow players to create any level they can imagine. Players can share their finished levels with anyone over the internet and find others'\u00a0new and challenging levels to play.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T06:51:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04b/04bfda381ba218171df65441982074f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Thought Reactor"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
