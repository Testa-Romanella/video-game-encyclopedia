Use the familar attacks like the karate chop, spin, teleport, and shield as you fight your way through the unknown reaches of space! But the best part? You're not alone! Other robots joined your adventure to bring you some healing items, and you also have the support of some sword shaped aliens (Provided you save them from the ghosts of course)! However, \"not being alone\" unfortunately goes both ways. Not only is there an army of evil ghosts to stop, but the leader brought along his younger brother and... Is... That... An evil robot?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T12:50:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/920/920eafb75bafd9a6791deae9bc668592.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WizBlob"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
