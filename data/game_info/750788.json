Try to avoid mines and if you really want to have fun, spawn 24 mines and try to find the only spot that is not a mine.<br/>Every time you start the game you will have 100 points, if you ran out of points just restart the game. You can use the \"+\" and \"-\" buttons to adjust first the number of bombs and then the bet. For every spot that you click and it's not a mine, you will get some points, but if you click on a mine you lose your bet, so be careful and cashout often and don't risk it, unless you want to have fun.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T05:07:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e1/4e1216d31d2fc83791eb725d03d5499e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cosmin Calian"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
