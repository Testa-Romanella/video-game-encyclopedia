It is a four-player game, with one-button controls.</p><p><strong>How?</strong></p><p>----</p><p>Up to four players can play. Each player can use one joystick with a single button (\"A\" button on an Xbox 360 controller), or use the keyboard with the keys: z, c, b or m.</p><p>Your salmon will always accelerate forward. With the button up, the salmon slowly turns to the left. With the button held doen, the salmon turns sharply to the right. Double-tapping the button shoots the salmon forward quickly.</p><p><strong>Why?</strong></p><p>----</p><p>Endless Swimmer was initially created in 2007 as an entry to a contest to make a game featuring one-button gameplay. After being shelved for years, it was re-conceived as both a relaxing recovery tool for those recovering from trauma and an action game. </p><p><strong>Where?</strong></p><p>------</p><p>This game was initially created at TOJam 10, May 1-3, 2015 at George Brown College in Toronto, Canada.</p><p><strong>Who?</strong></p><p>----</p><p>This game was created by:</p><p>Paul Forest - http://PaulForest.com</p><p>Eric Frech - http://ericfrechart.blogspot.ca/</p><p>Lisa Young - https://lisakyoung.carbonmade.com/</p><p>Andy Frech - https://ca.linkedin.com/pub/andy-frech/30/555/735</p><p>Jeremy Kessler - </p><p>Brian Sinasac - https://ca.linkedin.com/pub/brian-sinasac/1a/2b9/339</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/410/4103adba0fb317b2efe6d78168b27297.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["PaulForest"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
