Choose one of the unique beaver factions and see how long your colony can last!\n\nWet and dry seasons\n\n  \n\n<br/>\n\n\nPrepare your settlement for recurring droughts. Stockpile on food and keep fields and forests alive even after rivers dry up. Rely on both natural water sources and artificial irrigation to keep the land arable.\n\nRiver control\n\n  \n\n<br/>\n\nRedirect rivers, put up dams and dig water canals with explosives \u2013 beavers of the future have millennia of experience in water engineering. But be careful, uncontrolled flooding is as deadly as a dynamite blast!\n\n\nLumberpunk\n\n  \n\n<br/>\n\nTurn timber into sophisticated machinery, buildings, and monuments. Wood is the core resource in Timberborn, but the most advanced structures require metal. To find it, send your scavengers to the ruins of the old world.\n\nVertical architecture\n\n\n  \n\n<br/>\n\nCreate a thriving beaver settlement using a modular, vertical architecture system. Space is limited, so stack lodges and workshops on top of each other, cover hills with fields, and set up a power grid for your growing population.\n\nDay and night cycle\n\n\n  \n\n<br/>\n\nBuild a prosperous city with efficient production chains and beaverish nighttime activities. Follow the lives of individually simulated inhabitants throughout their day and celebrate when the next generation is born!\n\nWellbeing\n\n\n  \n\n\n<br/>\n\nSatisfy the needs of your colonists to extend their lifespan and make them happier. An evolved beaver's lifestyle is not just \"work, sleep and chomp on wood\". Balanced diet, decorations, temples, even carousels \u2013 you take care of it all.\n\nBeaver societies\n\n\n  \n\n<br/>\n\nControl different beaver factions, each with unique style, buildings, and gameplay traits. While some beavers are expert farmers, another family might rely on rapid industrialization. Choose what fits your playstyle!\n\nMap editor\n\n\n  \n\n<br/>\n\n\nPlay on one of the included maps or create your own and share it with the community! With hills of different height, ruins scattered in the desert, and all life depending on access to water, each map poses a different challenge.\n\n...and more!We regularly add new features and iterate, based on the community's feedback. We want to create a city-builder like no other, so stay in the loop and add Timberborn to your wishlist today!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-01T10:09:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/737/7373844d1d45f871d4a2a948bb10bb7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 11, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 455, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Mechanistry"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Mechanistry"], "esrb_rating": null}
