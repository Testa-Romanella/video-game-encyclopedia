{"id": 737287, "slug": "chicken-barbarian", "name": "CHICKEN BARBARIAN", "name_original": "CHICKEN BARBARIAN", "description": "<p>CHICKEN BARBARIAN is a fun little top-down shooter made by me (a. k. a. some student from a higher technical school somewhere in Vienna). It was developed in Unity and it took me almost half a year to make it itch.io-ready. You play the almighty Chickenbarbarian, who has to fight various enemies to survive. Why he does this is up to him and no one else. The only problem is that he has completely messed up his arsenal of weapons.</p>\n<p>So don't be confused when he fires axes and boomerangs one second, only to follow it up with a load of eggs and bombs.</p>\n<p>And feel honored, because you'll officially receive the rank of \"The Gametester\". Your tasks will include reporting bugs and glitches immediately and writing a constructive review after finishing the game.<br/> </p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T08:41:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88d/88d4cb8c0d8f5a376da514a942aea3fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Raphiaffi"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
