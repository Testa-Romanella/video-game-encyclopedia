Use your squad of soldiers to halt the orc advance.  Purchase and equip abilities to counter enemy units and create synergy from simple attacks.  Use the right abilities and turn your squad of soldiers into a powerhouse!\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p>This is a prototype for a game I've been working on myself. The game is playable but it's very much unfinished. I'm mainly uploading it for self-motivation and to get feedback. Be aware there's no sound and I'm not an artist so please excuse my art (I did my best lol).<br/></p>\n<p>There's a small amount of content right now. Currently there's seven abilities, four (player) classes, and a handful of missions with some different enemy classes. I want to add more content and mechanics, but I'm unsure how far I'll take it right now.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Mouse to select and control units.</p>\n<p>Escape to open up the menu and quick guide.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T03:12:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d3/5d3bc73738c2130041bb508f7715651e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Luke Esh"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
