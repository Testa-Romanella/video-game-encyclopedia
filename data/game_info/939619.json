We made this project with 2 more friends, one was in charge of artwork and animation (altough none of us is an artist nor good at it) and the other one helped me program the game itself. We all worked in the game design aspect.</p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Since this was an internal\u00a0learning project, instructions are not built in nor explained inside the game. You move with WASD, sprint with SHIFT, jump with spacebar, shoot fireballs with the left mouse button and grab the leaves to propel yourself in the air with\u00a0the right mouse button *this last action can be cancelled at any time with the same button). But beware! using your abilities will make your vital flame (aka: healthbar) deplete faster!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T20:05:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50a/50adaed3aba092591a79a787bff0554c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Maximo Samperio"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
