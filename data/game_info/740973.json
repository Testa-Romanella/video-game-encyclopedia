The design of the characters is not spectacular, but it sticks to the original characteristics of each of them based on the original game.</p>\n<p>The MOD is full of numerous dialogues between songs that, as we have already mentioned, contain relevant information about the original story, so you have to be careful if you don't want to see spoilers.\u00a0The most innovative detail of the MOD is its last confrontation, in which the perspective of the battle is changed to first person, with only our final rival, Monika, in front of us.</p>\n\n<p>In general, it is a recommended MOD only for those who are fans of DDLC, since others will not find much interest in it, and they have much better options today.\u00a0If you are a fan and can follow the story that is told in the dialogues, then this MOD is perfect for you.\r\n</p>\r\nNew Features of FNF X DDLC MOD\r\n<ul><li>4 new songs.\r\n</li><li>4 new characters: Monika, Natsuki, Sayori and Yuri.\r\n</li><li>New backgrounds and dialogs.\r\n</li><li>Some easter eggs and special cinematics.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T10:00:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a96/a968751229503165dd85f20d167964a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sundayy_xd"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
