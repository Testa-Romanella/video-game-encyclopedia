I found the sound effects online.</p>\n<br/>Plot:\r\n<p>You are a mutated cube that is stuck in a secret lab. You have the ability to freeze time and rewind it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The only thing is that when you rewind time, time freezes as well. Use this ability to your advantage as you try to escape the lab.</p>\n\n<strong>How To Play</strong>\r\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Arrow Keys - Move around.</p>\n<p>R - Rewind time.</p>\n<p>Escape - Pause the game.<br/></p>\r\nGoal:\r\n<p>To win the game, you need to beat all 15 levels.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To open the door (The green portal) you need to stand on a pressure pad. But the only problem is when you step off of a pressure pad, the door closes.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>To fix this problem you can rewind time. When you rewind time, the pressure pad stays pressed and you can also collect keys when you are rewinding.</p>\n<p>You need to rewind right into the door from the pressure pad to complete the level.</p>\n\r\nMore Info:\r\n\n<p>Your levels save. So if you close the game, you will still be on the same level.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>if you want, you can add me on discord. footmama1#1127. I am open for a partner for another jam.</p>\n<p>I'm sorry that the music is kind of repetitive, I didn't have much time to work on it.</p>\n<p>I'm also sorry about the horrible menu. Don't judge a book by it's cover :).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T03:47:05", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frick Ingredients"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
