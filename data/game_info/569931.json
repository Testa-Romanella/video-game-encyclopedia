{"id": 569931, "slug": "prince-of-indiana-3-atari-2600", "name": "Prince of Indiana 3 (Atari 2600)", "name_original": "Prince of Indiana 3 (Atari 2600)", "description": "<p>This is the final chapter of Prince of Indiana trilogy. I merged Indiana Jones, Prince of Persia and Return of the Jedi in this one. In the last chapter, Prince of Indiana in a mine cart ended up aboard a zeppelin of the Multilateral Convention, a neoprogressive organization that functions like\u00a0the nazis in the normal Indiana Jones stories. This organization exhumed the Second Ark of Noah, a relic from Atlantis, in which the stowaway Steve could enter, when any human had forbidden access to this \"all animals except humans\" ark to prevent extinction. The ark ended up in the coasts of Provence, France, where the Priory of Steve was founded. Now Prince of Indiana is prisoner of this shady organization and Sophia and the Rolling Stones are about to rescue him. They have two options, an attack by air, or by land in which case they will deactivate the shields of the zeppelin, something they fail to do. Prince of Indiana has a duel with a Darth Vader kind of villain, a sort of vizier. And once he defeats him he is presented with a choice, what is the metal the grail is made of (by the way stevia is what was formerly known as orichalchum and is very important in the alchemic traditions) This metal is entangled with the metal the ark is made of, so if you choose lead, the ark and the zeppelin will drown. Later they find Prince floating hanging from a balloon when they look for survivors. And the Rolling Stones give medals of honor to both Sophia and Prince, like in Star Wars, Leia does with Han and Luke. And Sophia winks to Keith Richards who acts like he didn't see it, just like Leia. I tried to convey all this in the game, but failed. Strange story, but it was an improvisation, made on the fly, and sometimes retconned here and there.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T07:49:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b5/9b5d2b211501aff2af971401fc55a268.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["mauisland"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
