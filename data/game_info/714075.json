She will have to fight with enemies and solve puzzles to reach her objectives. Through the development of the story, the main character rescues her partner\u2019s souls, who give her their own personal powers. The player will have to change between the power\u2019s stock that give her different benefits.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>BACK STORY:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Outsider is an action/adventure 3D game. It happens in the future, where technological advances replace human actions. That\u2019s how big corporations take advantage of these improvements to develop a union between men and machine, besides potentiating the progress of AI. To accomplish this union, it's required to use people with special abilities, called Outsiders. The player controls Akane, the main character in this story. She is an Outsider who lives with other marginalized group of people that practice and use the same powers she has. During the course of this story, the player can make Akane to explore the city, speak to other citizens and get involved in fights where she can use her abilities. Akane will have to protect her partners while she tries to stop those who are trying to hunt them like rats for their experiments.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n1First Skill\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02Second\u00a0Skill\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a03Third Skill4Fourth skill5N/A6Menu7Character movement8Basic attack9Heavy attack10Special attack11Dash12N/A", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T12:12:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc8/cc839e0b0a0f985116ab97d41e455ed5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matias Milewski"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
