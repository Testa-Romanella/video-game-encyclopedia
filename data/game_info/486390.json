Freely <strong>explore the open-world</strong>, <strong>capturing all the different species of butterflies</strong> for your studies. Visit the different\u00a0 japanse inspired\u00a0<strong>landmarks</strong>\u00a0hand-placed around the map. Go back to your <strong>Base</strong> to relax and <strong>deposit your butterflies</strong>.\u00a0<strong>Discover hidden areas</strong> with even more butterflies to catch !</p>\n<p>This is a demo for a game still <strong>in development</strong> by a team of French game design students. Any and all feedback is welcome !</p>\n<p><strong>Current Features :</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>The Net </strong>:\u00a0 Your trusty net, once you have a butterfly in it, complete the capture challenge to keep in in.</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Capture Challenge</strong> : Once you have a butterfly, capture the spheres that appear in order to confirm the capture.</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Jars</strong> : Once you have completed the challenge, open a jar with the trigger button on the controller and put the butterfly in, it's now ready to be released back at the Base.</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>The Base</strong> : Currently has two Vivariums where you can release your butterflies once you have them in a jar. Visit them anytime you like and admire your collection.</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Movement </strong>: Directly move with the joystick to be stealthy. Press the button on either controller to\u00a0teleport, you move faster but be careful : the further you teleport, the more sound you generate, scaring the butterflies.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Future Content :</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Sound</strong> : Hearing things is good.</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>The Butterfly Index</strong> : Keep track of your collection of butterflies and access the teleport function.</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>The Utility Belt</strong> : A handy way of storing the net and your jars around your waist</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>More of the island</strong> : Currently you can access ~40% of the map. More new species of butterflies await !</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Gameplay changes </strong>: Depending on feedback and our vision, the gameplay is subject to change.</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Bugfixes</strong>\u00a0: Always.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>This game is being actively developed with the Oculus Rift on SteamVR but should be compatible with Valve Index and HTC Vive. No testing with both of those headsets has been done to this date for this game.
