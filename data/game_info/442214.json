Tyler White Vs The World?<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Setting\r\n</strong><br/></p>\n<p>For a long time, magic users and races such as the Orcs and Elves have remained in hiding in fear of what the majority may think of them. That hasn't changed until one day, a few brave warriors revealed themselves.\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p>A boy named Yuuthan and his friends became known to the world as a type of magician called the Element Controllers. Since then,\u00a0 courage and hope began to spread. Those in hiding have been brought to the light once more. And this solidified once Time Controller Enith Bloom briefly led the modern era in a war against the Past and the Future, revealing what the world has been and what it will be. </p>\n<p>But none of that copypasta has anything to do with this game directly either. <br/></p>\n<p>Though, it is thanks to those events that magic is once again a known commodity in the world. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Characters</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Tyler White the Dealer</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>Just an ordinary citizen trying to save the world</em></p>\n<p><strong>Rin Noyozu the Detective</strong></p>\n<p><em>The person who will reach out to the truth<br/></em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Terry Cruise the Assistant</strong></p>\n<p><em>Cheerful helper of the people<br/></em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Edea East the Cook</strong></p>\n<p><em>The innocent drug dealer that will clear his good name<br/></em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Wanda Washington the Commissioner\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><em>The powerful police lead who will bring justice upon the world</em></p>\n<strong>Suki Lunero the Launderer</strong><em>The launderer who is an expert at both worlds<br/><br/><br/></em>\n<p><strong>Features</strong>\n</p>\n<p>~A comedy rpg experience with focus on dialogue !<br/></p>\n<p>~Interacting with things does something!
