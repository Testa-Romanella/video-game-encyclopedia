With this frame work, many kinds of game can be made with new innovation, like sokoban.</p>\n<p>Now there is\u00a0only there scene available, you can select at menu and just walk around with WASD or arrow buttons, press Esc to get back to menu. The maps here are Riemann surface, like\u00a0elliptic curve in complex field.\u00a0 The third map has ground with 4 colors, you can try to find them all.\u00a0</p>\n<p> if you feel confused about the game space, you can watch this video of another non-Euclidean 3D engine to get help to understand what it is.</p>\n<p>I write the game by elm , an interesting functional language for webapp.</p>\n<p>The image resources used come from\u00a0\u00a0https://github.com/Orasund/pixelengine/tree/master/examples/Snake , they may be changed later. Now I change the character to a frog.</p>\n<p>The source code is here\u00a0https://github.com/iamcxds/Monodromy</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-17T04:00:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f94/f944286207250ea86bc8fe14c8b85193.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Poincare"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
