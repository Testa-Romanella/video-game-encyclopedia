{"id": 17094, "slug": "dungeons-of-dredmor", "name": "Dungeons of Dredmor", "name_original": "Dungeons of Dredmor", "description": "<p>Dungeons of Dredmor combines traditional dungeon crawler with rogue-like mechanics. The player controls the only character who enters a dangerous underground maze to find and defeat the evil Lord Dredmor. As you descend deeper into the ground, the difficulty will grow. Each dungeon is generated randomly with each replay. There are three levels of difficulty, and also an option to turn on the permanent death mechanic. If you choose it, the game will leave you with only one save file to overwrite, and no save-scumming. There\u2019s a traditional turn-based combat system and a variety of melee and ranged attacks, as well as magic. When the characters levels up, the player can improve his or her set of seven skills that can allow, among other things, to craft, disarm traps, use spells or wield more powerful weapons. <br />\nThe game is played from the overhead point of view on a map divided into square tiles. The visuals are relatively simple, albeit not as minimalistic as traditional ASCII-based rogue-like games. The imagery is quite cartoonish and ironic, which adds to the game\u2019s self-aware dark humor. The main character will complain about his or her fate, and when he or she dies, which is quite often, the game will \u201ccongratulate\u201d you for each death.</p>", "metacritic": 79, "released": "2011-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T12:37:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd6/bd68435d8cd3dd8d1bed8fc4021602f7.jpg", "website": "http://www.dungeonsofdredmor.com", "rating": 3.44, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 60, "owned": 1688, "beaten": 34, "toplay": 9, "dropped": 71, "playing": 8}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 124, "ratings_count": 143, "suggestions_count": 285, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 143, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Gaslamp Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Gaslamp Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
