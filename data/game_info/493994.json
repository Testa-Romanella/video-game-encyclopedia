If your alignment is true then enjoy the benefits, but game doesn't change too much if your not aligned.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Hay is your money, Neighs are another resource aka experience, together they are used to help upgrade. Happy gaming and hopefully nothing unexpected happens during your play.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This is incomplete work and is a demo, so past lives has nothing to do with mechanics yet. Nor can this game save yet. However I will work on the paid version and add those features and some more in days to come.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-14T03:07:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c9/5c9d2fd97a1dbc8d6e20921aa82101bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sarainia"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
