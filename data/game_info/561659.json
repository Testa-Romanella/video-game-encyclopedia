Not every day will be full of sunshine and that's okay! Don't let others dictate how you should feel. Today might be bad but the future could be better and sometimes you just need a little support from your friends.<br/></p>\r\nGame play:\r\n<p>As a cloud in the sky you must avoid the sunshine trying to get rid of you. As more storm clouds gather the storm grows stronger. <br/></p>\n<p>This is a survival wave-based shooter. Using your rain and lightning aim and take fire (or should I say water?) at the sun shine enemies.</p>\n<p>You have 3 lives so be careful! Some enemies can place areas of effect so make sure you avoid those. (These are the red circles and they take 5 seconds before they damage you.) <br/></p>\n<p>Each time you or your entire team take damage you restart the wave you are currently on. Each new wave will have 4 new enemies spawned in. There are 2 variations of enemies, one just comes towards you and tries to cover over you. The other travels until they are close and effects the area you are currently standing at. Make sure to move out of there! <br/></p>\n<p>Go in solo or take in friends with you. The more friends you have together the more damage you can deal! Having more friends stand in the circles around each other will boost your storm granting you lightning damage!\u00a0</p>\n<p>To join in either use a keyboard and mouse or grab a controller and click the shoot button!<br/></p>\n<p>How many waves can you survive? Remember you are stronger together!<br/>*Please note multiplayer support must be done through the downloaded version*</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\nActionKeyboard/MouseControllerMoveWASDLeft Stick<br/>AttackLeft\u00a0Mouse\u00a0ClickRight Trigger<br/>AimMouse Location<br/>Right Stick<br/>Toggle Music<br/>MD-Pad Down<br/>\n<p>Thanks to my girlfriend for making me art and music.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T07:14:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a2/9a2eacfd38a4209dacd38ac3dc78ec10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["robotmonkey1000"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
