The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden \"mines\" or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.<br/><br/>To win you need to determine the location of all mines.<br/>To achieve this goal, you have to click a square and if it is empty all adjacent empty squares will open up. If you ever click on a box containing a mine, it will explode and you'll lose.<br/> <br/>It is possible to plant a flag to mark the alleged location of a mine, using the button corresponding to the flag.<br/><br/>If the clicked box is empty, all adjacent empty boxes will open recursively.<br/>To win, there must be no mines incorrectly marked with a flag. On the other hand, it is not necessary to mark all the mines to finish; you just need to determine all the empty boxes.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T03:08:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7c/c7c44dafdff4cf6e5fabc9810e5fcd3c.jpg", "website": "http://galsenstd.wixsite.com/walabok", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["WALABOK"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["WALABOK"], "esrb_rating": null}
