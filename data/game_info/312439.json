You can play against a (at the moment weak) CPU player or against a human player.<br/><br/>This is just the basic game, more features might be added as the class progresses.\u00a0</p><p>Controls:<br/>Player 1: arrow keys<br/>Player 2: WASD</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ccd/ccd188edf1809339d75e44f3389154d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hayo"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
