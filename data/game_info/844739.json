Training, working, watching your calorie intake, and doing jobs. Fighting off hooligans and monsters (just hooligans in this demo).</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Solo-RPG: No party. Only you and your fists.</li><li>Condition: Fighting while hungry, exhausted, and generally ailing, means your strikes will be a lot weaker than otherwise. Conversely if you are in top condition, you'll be far stronger too. There is also a big gap between the two if you don't want to bother with being perfectly in balance.</li><li>Training: you don't level up and grow stronger on every field. You have to train, either by practicing your techniques, or training an attribute of yourself.</li></ul>\r\nCombat\r\n<p>There is a part by part tutorial in the game, right in your home. Here is the tl:dr;\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>In essence every fighter has an initiative which decides when it is their turn.</li><li>Every attack costs initiative, and every hit does initiative damage to the target, which are respectively called the Haul and the Shock of the attack. Balancing this is the key.</li><li>Every attack has a height. Figuring out which height your enemy attacks next, enables you to dodge it, evading all damage, shock, and causing large haul penalties for the attacker. Otherwise just block high and mid attacks.</li><li>Don't spam the same attack, as each successive use lowers its efficiency.\u00a0</li></ul>\r\nKnown Bugs\r\n<ul><li>Night cycle is a bit funky, some NPCs don't disappear when the time of the day says so</li><li>Lights have no appreciation for the depth system, thus some of them look weird at night.</li></ul>\r\nAccreditation\r\n<ul><li>Music by Karl Casey, Whitebat Audio</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T08:45:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79b/79b99df10e2fee98e0a86c785e7e0c97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ManusC"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
