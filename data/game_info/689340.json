Main Menu-\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Changed the name of the Game</li><li>Created Menu music with MagixMusicMaker</li><li>Added Sprite Image</li><li>Updated Instructions Page- I watched 2 YouTube videos to get the instructions to scroll! I wrote a manual.\u00a0Click with your mouse and scroll up or down.</li><li>Updated Credits to include music and pixel art.</li></ul>\n<p>2. Created levels 2 and 3</p>\n<ul><li>New level music created using MagixMusicMaker</li><li>New challenging layouts- learned that any image on foreground damaging will hurt the player. That took awhile to find.</li><li>learned how to move way points for the moving platforms and included medium size as well.</li><li>learned from Declan how to add ScorePickup to enemy death effect. Created different points earned for the 3 different enemies used in the game.</li><li>Learned how not to uncheck the background box on text for the next level button.</li></ul>\n<p>3. Finally learned how to make my own pixel art! Ok, this was my first time and I still have a lot to learn. I created separate pixel sheets for Idle, Jump, Run and Die. Falling is similar to Jump, so it doesn't count.\u00a0I\u00a0was able to animate them and change some of the speeds. I\u00a0thought this through and also learned to change the Lives Counter Display image to my new Jump Jack sprite.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T07:04:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6cb/6cb62af9bdbbf2cadb932634026badd6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["SquirrelJ"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
