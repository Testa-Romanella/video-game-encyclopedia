The Ultimate goal of this project would have been to have a music that change with the inputs (like a note at each jump), but that was waaay to complex for a jam. So I went for just 4 differents genre of the same music that switch depending on the current Mode of the player.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately I did not have the time for balancing and level design (and more monsters design). But I will surely finish this game as I started really getting a good feeling at the end.</p>\n\n<p>Enjoy and don't hesitate to make any remarks.<br/></p>\n<p>Android build Incoming later this week</p>\n<p>Thank you</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/006/00670a89b1372c7ee9c1f852f93e4045.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Garazbolg"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
