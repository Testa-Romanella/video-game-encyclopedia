So don't go slashing level 4 or 5 enemy's in the beginning. Your hero will loose the battles then. <br/>Later when you know the game better, you can attack enemy's way higher then your hero and slash them. <br/><br/>Clicking the pixie dust in the inventory restores the hero's health. It will be restored with the amount of health he has left. So 2 health left, gives 2 health restoration. 10 health left will give 10 health restoration. <br/><br/>Scrolls will restore the hero's magic health. Book scrolls will build up the magic strength. <br/><br/>This is the light version of Dungeon Slash 2. <br/><br/>Its in Beta and I would like it a lot when you let me know what you think about it, and what can be improved or altered.\u00a0</p><p>solvius@live.nl<br/><br/>Left click the enemy's to attack them with your sword. <br/>Right click the enemy's to unleash firemagic on them. <br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br/><br/>Enemy and hero sprites made by David Gervais.</p><p>A hero...</p><p>20 dungeon levels.
