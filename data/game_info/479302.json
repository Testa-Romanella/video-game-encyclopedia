Run through the level, dodging obstacles and leaping over falls\u00a0to reach the end, and then watch time rewind and a second robot spawn. Suddenly, time is playing back at you, and you must\u00a0control robot number two and get both robots to the exit. Thinking ahead of time and planning your moves out is your only chance at completing the 15 unique levels that await!</p>\n<p>The game and all its assets were created by Mikael Christodoulides.</p>\n<p>Project completed on 7/8/2020.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T10:15:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea3/ea32acf971963f60c8f3245767d67448.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tirion Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
