Play your cards right. Make alliances.Break alliances. Betray sworn allies at the worst possible time and leave them to get eaten by the hordes. It's up to you how you play it, just make sure you get out of the city with enough resources to survive!<br/><br/>Of course, you don't have to murder everyone in sight. You could play cooperatively and try to make sure everyone gets out alive. Or you can play on your own in solitaire mode which has plenty of settings for a casual quick game or an intense skin of your teeth undead fest. It's really up to you.<br/><br/>Features<br/><br/><ul><li>Original card mechanic with multi function, two sided cards.
