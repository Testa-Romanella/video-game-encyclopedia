{"id": 821960, "slug": "lucky-platformer", "name": "Lucky Platformer", "name_original": "Lucky Platformer", "description": "<p><strong>Lucky Platformer</strong> is a frustrating platform game made in less than 48 hours for the sixth annual GMTK game jam with the theme \"Roll of the Dice.\" There are 10 levels with a boss at the end.<br/></p>\n<p><em>This game is not only a test of your patience and skill, but also of your <strong>luck</strong>!</em><br/></p>\n<p>The game is heavily inspired by rage games like <em>The World's Hardest Game</em>. Imagine all the annoying things about these games, but worse. The controls are weird, the physics are all over the place, the level design is non-existent and the graphics are bad, but what can you do in 48 hours?<br/></p>\n<p>Each level is scattered with <strong>Lucky Blocks</strong>, (inspired by the Minecraft mod), which will give you random status effects and will edit the level at random.</p>\n<p><strong>Lucky Platformer</strong> is completely\u00a0programmed in Java using the LibGDX framework with my custom implementation called MagmaEngine slapped on top. If you're interested, check out my website brambasiel.xyz. The source code of this game can be found at https://github.com/bramtechs/libgdx-lucky-platformer.<br/></p>\n<p>This is my first game-jam submission ever. Even though it falls short in many areas, I had a lot of fun making the game!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure to disable browser extensions like Vimium, so your keybindings don't get remapped. <strong>Click the button above to play!<br/></strong><strong><br/>Music used:</strong><br/>Free Music - Adhesive Wombat - Nightshade<br/>TeknoAXE's Royalty Free Music - Revenge of the Atari Overlords<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T12:37:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cf/9cfa4cd02ec381f75fb523a98c19978a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["brambasiel"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
