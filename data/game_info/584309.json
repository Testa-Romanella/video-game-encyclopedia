The game highlights the abiltity to develop and edit C# scripts, being able to build a 3D terrain using the brush and 3D terrain options in Unity, and showcases different enemies and their abilities as well as a Boss enemy with a visible health bar.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Modifications:</strong></p>\n<p>1.\u00a0 There is a full and complete level 3 that is different than the other levels</p>\n<p>2.\u00a0 There is a full and complete level 4 that is different than the other levels</p>\n<p>3. I messed around with the player controller script that made the player float down slower and jump higher, allowing the player to hop over walls or hop onto ledges such as there are in level4 on some of the terrain. The player can jump and shoot enemies below and only have to deal with getting hit by flying enemies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>4. Each level has its own music.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Tyler Gyulveszi</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T03:34:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbf/fbf9517b80d4542bd499ea0cae3328ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["gyulves1"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
