As of now, the story can play out in over 200 different ways, with eight separate endings\u2014and with the current structure of the game, we could easily add to this. Aside from some UI elements, all of the art assets were painted by us during the game jam, which allowed for a lot of control with art direction. <br/><br/>The theme \u201cPacifist\u201d inspired us to examine consequence and morality. Your choices in the game influence your stats- which ultimately define the style of your ending. Working on a set of axes, the game measures your behavior along the spectrums of violence versus pacifism and apathy versus empathy. \u00a0We wanted to explore a grey zone of morality and none of these traits are written as completely good or bad, but all give a variety of consequences that you might not foresee. <br/><br/></p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy creating your own dark fairytale as much as we enjoyed working on it.</p>\n<p>Alec Garibay @dream_tempo</p>\n<p>Tasha Chopine @tashachopine</p>\n<p>Light Bates @LightDiscordant</p>\n<p>Sam Wilson @TopHatting</p>\n<p>Suzee Goodman @nobleseascallop</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90d/90d32f0c26758a62600d77528ed5a04f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["LightDiscordant", "tashacho", "dream-tempo", "Toppie", "nobleseascallop"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
