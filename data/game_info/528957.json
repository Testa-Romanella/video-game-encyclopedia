{"id": 528957, "slug": "solarlab", "name": "Solarlab", "name_original": "Solarlab", "description": "<p>Solarlab is a simple space simulator designed for educational purposes (with a bit of fun thrown in as well). Ever wondered what planets sound like? What its like to explore moon and mars bases? what it would be like to drive a rover on Venus, well here's your chance. Solarlab was built by me in a weekend and has slowly been added to over the past few years. Its now a complete project but I still revisit it from time to time, so check back for updates every now and then. Its taught me a lot about unity, space, science and even physics. I've even taken it to a local library for an space exhibition. There are some bugs that I am aware of already such as the menu not loading when you are in explorer mode on the moon or mars. If you like it, feel free to leave me a comment, I would love to hear from you.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T04:29:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62f/62f73773f26867e08cc37fa94bfb41fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Max Proton Labs"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
