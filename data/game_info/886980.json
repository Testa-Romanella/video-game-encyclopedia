As expected, the whole game is played using only a single button. I joined this jam kind of late, so I challenged myself to make a minimum viable product, as a sort of proof of concept. The whole project was made in about a day, due to being busy with work, ect. In the future, I might like to revisit this idea and see if I can extend it by tweaking the phsics a bit, adding more stage gimmicks, ect. But as a small prototype, I'm happy with how this turned out, and making a one-button game was a nice challenge!<br/></p>\n\n<p>THE GAME:</p>\n<p>This is a Speed-Run Challenge platformer! This game is about carefully jumping, trying to preserve your momentum, and seeing how quickly you can get through the stage! You play as the Blue Square. Avoid the Lava (orange stuff), or you get a game over. Try your best to make it to the end!<br/></p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>Space: Everything.</p>\n<p>If you are on the ground, you can jump. Hold Space longer to jump higher.</p>\n<p>If you are airborne, press Space to boost. You can boost as many times as you like, but note that boosting moves you DOWNWARDS as well, so be careful!</p>\n<p>If you touch a Yellow Circle, that's a Boster! You'll get a small boost of speed.<br/></p>\n<p>Press ESC to exit<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T08:38:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4c/e4c2dfb416e6274e6ef81cfda1726127.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SvenBTB"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
