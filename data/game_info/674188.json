The ship has been designed and built from the ground up with an unprecedented level of detail. From the bare structural framework to the miles of cables and conduits, every part of the ship is fully simulated and designed to be scientifically plausible. Nothing is mere surface detail. Every button does something, and every piece of hardware serves a real purpose.</p>\n<p>Our focus on science and realistic simulation also extends to the galaxy itself, with currently over 2 billion procedurally generated star systems to explore.</p>\n<p>Players can choose to occupy one of a number of different roles on the ship, with each one presenting the player with unique and interesting gameplay challenges.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": true, "updated": "2023-09-08T16:37:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6f/e6fd54649c85cc5d891dbac53ea1377d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 263, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation", "Casual", "Educational", "Family", "Indie"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
