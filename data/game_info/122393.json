Controls are explained on my LD 41 game page, or with ugly text boxes at the start of the level (sorry for that, didn't got enough time on my hands to do a better tutorial)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Links :</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Web Browser version (can lag\u00a0!):\u00a0https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/710248</p>\n<p>The LDJAM page :\u00a0https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/41/test-3</p>\n<p>My twitter, if you wanna say hello :\u00a0https://twitter.com/lautregars_</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c73/c733c3d06d6ce910d50e41b7334adf86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lautregars"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
