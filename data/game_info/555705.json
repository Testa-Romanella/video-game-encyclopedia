I work on tv series\u00a0development but as a narrative enthusiast I've been exploring and enjoying videogames so much. I have no other artistic or technical background so when I saw this Narrative Driven Jam, I started thinking about ideas I would explore if I knew how.</p>\n<p>The<strong><em> CAGED IN</em></strong> theme really inspired me on a story that is very special and close to me. It is just an idea, a proof of concept\u00a0if you will. It is me playing around with Bitsy\u00a0to explore interactive ways of telling this story.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading, thank you for playing, and thank you for inspiring me to try something new and learn new things.\u00a0Thanks to Rafa\u00a0and his community\u00a0for the much needed support and\u00a0encouragement, and to DeLarge for introducing me to new tools :)<br/></p>\n<p>I'm going to keep working on it to try to make it properly so any feedback is most welcome!</p>\n<p>@Adriii</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T06:38:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d4/1d46e285e6b1799a01c0660e6de64f5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Adriii"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
