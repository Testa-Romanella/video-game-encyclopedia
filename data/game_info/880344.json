{"id": 880344, "slug": "paradise-end", "name": "Paradise End", "name_original": "Paradise End", "description": "<p>Made in 1 day, so it's a bit simpler than my previous jam games. Supports gamepad in some browsers. You can retry from the game over screen by pressing jump when the text disappears, or reset the game with ctrl and R.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A<strong>ll code, graphics, and sound were created during the jam period.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\n<br/><strong>Move:</strong> arrow keys | gamepad movement\r\n<br/><strong>Jump/Fly:</strong> x-key or v-key | gamepad B</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br/>You need to flap your wings to change direction in the air. By holding left or right you gain momentum in a direction, but you gain more height if you flap your wings without holding a direction. You can hold down the jump button to flap as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>When the meter at the bottom of the screen reaches 0, the game breaks down bit by bit; disabling colors, and music tracks until there is nothing left.\u00a0<strong>Collecting feathers refills the meter.</strong></p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to make it as far as possible. There is no end to the level.</p>\n<p><strong>Development</strong><br/>I wasn't planning on participating in the game jam this time. Neither the theme (heaven)\u00a0nor limitation (everything can die)\u00a0felt inspiring to me at first glance and I\u00a0had already made other plans for the weekend. However after rolling the limitation\u00a0around at the back of my head for a while I realized that Pico-8 had an interesting color function that fit pretty well with the limitation.<br/></p>\n<p>Basically you can set transparency on any of the 16 available colors independently. I figured that I could truly \"kill\"\u00a0<em>every</em> part of the game piece by piece as you played. I made the game to play around with that concept. I don't think there is much room for further development, other than adding more tile types and obstacles so it fit pretty nicely with my limited time.</p>\n<p>The game is really simple, but I hope it can give you a quick bit of fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T09:43:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/667/667f39c971773ae3b24e485245cb9463.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kerneliron"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
