This game was created by several groups of students over the course of 3 years at the Husky Game Development Enterprise at Michigan Technological University.</p>\n<p>They say that the mansion on the other side of town is haunted, but is it really? The kids tell stories on how dangerous the house is, but they\u2019ve never made it through the door. That's when you decided to enter the mansion and see what the fuss was about. You didn't believe those rumors, until you found yourself waking up in a strange room within the mansion after blacking out at the door. Explore the mansion with the mysterious young girl that lives there, solve puzzles to progress and escape the mansion.
