Every magic creature of Insilentium world has its own storyline and destiny. Playing character with a story is not the same as throwing cards, right?<br/>Insilentium was conceived as the world of the dead, inhabited by five races: humans, deaths, robots, creatures of the Astral and the Nature.<br/>Deaths are almost indigenous inhabitants of the gloomy world, because they\u2019re actually dead. At the top of the deaths is the insane King, who at the dawn of time fell into Insilentium by accident, and the thirst for revenge and justice forever changed his mind ... In battle, deaths are mainly choked with debuffs.<br/>People enter Insilentium through a portal, and out of pure chance and curiosity. They attack all living things, half-alive and dead, and the watake are exceptionally good, like many of the fallen ones.<br/>Robots are a parasite of the world of the dead, a race controlled by Artificial Intelligence from the human world. How AI infiltrated from world to world remains to be seen for players. They show themselves well in defense.<br/>Astral creatures can hardly be called inhabitants, because they are part of the world, primordial and uncontrollable chaos. The game combines completely different mechanics. Chaotically aggressive.<br/>Insilentium is a magic world of the dead, but not a dead world. It has a peculiar Nature, and it protects itself much more aggressively than the long-suffering nature of the Earth\u2026 Pretty good at healing and regeneration though.<br/>There are legends among people about the Altar, having reached which, a person can return from the world of the dead back. But the King of the Dead also needs the Altar in order to return to his world - and take revenge\u2026</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T06:13:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/924/924502c9d66630c6c0662f19041f3b82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Insilentium"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
