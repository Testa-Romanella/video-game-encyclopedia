Now she can finally smash some of them ghosts and protect the campfire on her own.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Complete Menu Overhaul</strong> - The menus and UI elements ingame got a complete graphical overhaul. There are now buttons, backgrounds and HUD popups in a style that suits the game well.</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Global Timer</strong> - After a few tests and a lot of feedback, we decided to shorten the timer to six minutes (for now). This should result in a different game feel. The value might be adjusted after a bit more testing.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Compass</strong> - Some of you got lost in the woods, so we implemented a compass for you. The widget always points in the general direction of the campfire, which makes it a lot easier to find your way back.</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>32-Bit Version</strong> - From now on you can download a 32-Bit Version, too.</li></ul>\r\n\u00a0Minor Changes &amp; Bugfixes\r\n<ul><li><strong>Blocking Volumes added</strong> - The level has got some additional blocking volumes that make it impossible to fall off the map.</li><li><strong>Convenience Buffer</strong> - Our Convenience-Buffer has been shortened, so from now on you have to take care of your bonfire even more.</li><li><strong>Ingame Music</strong> - The ingame music plays now in a loop.</li><li><strong>Interact Widget</strong> - The interact widget has been embellished.</li><li><strong>Custom Cursor</strong> - The game has now a custom cursor - Bye, Windows default cursor.</li><li><strong>Desktop Icon</strong> -\u00a0 The game also has Desktop Icon now.</li></ul>\n\r\n\u00a0T\u00a0H A N K\u00a0 \u00a0Y O U\r\n<p>After that being said we want to thank you for all the positive feedback we received.\u00a0<br/>If you encounter any more bugs, feel free to message us.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing St. Hestia\u00a0- It means a lot to us!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T05:01:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/252/2526a822398fefbd03162a3a49897b55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sleeprunner Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
