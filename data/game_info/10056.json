{"id": 10056, "slug": "kane-and-lynch-dead-men", "name": "Kane and Lynch: Dead Men", "name_original": "Kane and Lynch: Dead Men", "description": "<p>In this crime thriller, Kane and Lynch are hardened gangsters who are soon to be executed. Instead, they are released from the prison by a gang that believes Kane stole its money. The gang has Kane\u2019s family as hostages and wants the money back. Kane, Lynch, and other criminals they will hire have to gather the required sum by robbing banks, kidnapping people for ransom, and completing other criminal tasks. Gameplay in Kane &amp; Lynch is slightly reminiscent of GTA series with its third-person cop-shooting massacres. However, instead of the open world, there are consecutive levels with a mission in each, like in Hitman series (which was made by the same studio). <br />\nIn the story mode, Kane is the only protagonist under the player\u2019s control. Lynch and other members of the gang are AI-controlled, though Kane can order them to move, follow, or attack. In the co-op mode, the other player can assume the role of Lynch. Playing for him is a little different because Lynch is a psychopath who sees hallucinations. There\u2019s also an online multiplayer mode called Fragile Alliance that includes several new maps. In this mode, the team of players tries to survive the police assault and reach their getaway car.</p>", "metacritic": 67, "released": "2007-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-03T05:21:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/bef/bef072bb5a968347f40cbeefcf7b80db.jpg", "website": "http://www.kaneandlynch.com", "rating": 3.6, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 134, "owned": 2245, "beaten": 469, "toplay": 48, "dropped": 111, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 96, "ratings_count": 445, "suggestions_count": 506, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 450, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox 360", "PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Square Enix", "IO Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Square Enix", "Eidos Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
