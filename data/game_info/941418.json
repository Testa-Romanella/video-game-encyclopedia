Using the innovative Skybox tool developed by Blockade Labs, which utilizes ethically sourced AI, I created over 100 stunning skyboxes that provide a breathtaking backdrop for my music.<br/><br/>This Unreal Engine project is available to my Patreon Supporters, as a tool to create their own 360 Music Videos slideshows with AI Skyboxes or any other skybox or 360 footage. You can set the duration of the 360 images which has a dissolve transition to each skybox, and the rotation or rotation speed. There is also a Song randomizer blueprint, or you can play just one song.<br/><br/>Collaborating with talented producers Brightwing, Seven D, and Drop D, I played on three beautiful bamboo flute songs with electronica and Tibetan bowls that blend seamlessly with the visuals to create a 10-minute repeating music journey. To bring my vision to life, I enlisted the help of my old game design team member from UnrealPHD, Jurij Gantar who developed the Unreal Engine blueprint that allows me to customize each slide's length, fade-out transition, and texture array selection. I added camera lag delay, and some post-process adjustments, as well as an auto-rotation setting that can adjust the skyboxes rotation speed.<br/><br/>This project marks my first collaboration with Jurij again on Unreal Engine development since we created UnrealPHD Introduction to Unreal Development Kit (UDK). I am thrilled to share this project and proud of what we've accomplished in a short amount of time, which can be used as a tool to create interactive 360 VR and Video experiences with music fast and easily.<br/><br/>Thank you, #blockadelabs, for developing such a powerful and innovative tool that allows me to explore new creative avenues.I've also successfully tested the UE5 Panorama plugin for rendering 360 images back out of UE. The skyboxes come out perfectly and seamless with any new 3d models, particles, images, etc. that we add to the 3d environment. The app will be followed up with a printed XR book, that uses QR codes to activate AR features and downloadable music.<br/><br/>#ai #aidesign #conceptart #skybox #unrealenginedev #ue5 #design #team #project #artwork #music #development #video #thankyou #creative #collaboration #technology <br/><br/>Developed by Mn8XR<br/>Unreal Engine Developers - Anthony Bonnet and Jurij Gantar<br/><br/>Click the link below to join me on Patreon for access to the Unreal Engine Assets, Project files and massive Skybox libarary of 200 images including all seen in the Brightwing VIsions XR 360 Music Video.\u00a0 You can use this project to quickly create 360 music videos slideshows of different skyboxes on a variable time, just add your music track and Skybox images or use ours, and\u00a0build your app, which will be under 1 Gb.</p>\n<p>Monkey AI | creating videos and illustrated art | Patreon<br/><br/>You can visit our website page for SkAIBox\u00a0Visions XR here:<br/><br/>Visions XR \u2014 Mn8XR</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T16:45:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6fd/6fd6539c862321fb4f94fb72dc4f6b32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 276, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mn8XR"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
