Try to teach your new baby dragon how to behave so that he doesn't burn the place down or even worse: alarm the neighbors! Try to guide your Dragon towards the objects that will help him learn about life and avoid guiding him towards anything that can catch on fire. All thanks to your trusty weapon, the jazzy trumpet, which your baby dragon is terrified of! Be careful though, nothing is as dangerous as an angry dragon. You could say this whole situation is a hot mess!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-31T04:54:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/210/210a5796315efe3aa9eb53277a507d67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SdeMatos", "Cheminot"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
