Even one week was not enough to have a good concept for me, so I worked on a game that I could do in less than a week, but I designed \u00a021 levels in order to have some content for you. So I hope it made me progress and that my next game jam games will be better.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T09:41:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc9/cc9fcf4652ac4bbdfbcf8e359eb19a5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["scratchinartist"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
