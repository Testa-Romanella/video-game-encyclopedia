{"id": 381472, "slug": "triptraps", "name": "Trip&Traps", "name_original": "Trip&Traps", "description": "Overview\r\n<p>Trip&amp;Traps (<em>Trip-and-Traps</em>)\u00a0is a turn-based board game mixing bluff and strategy. Rules are simple but finding the best strategy to win can be very tricky!<br/></p>\n<p>Players can play against different level of AI or against real players connected to the game through the network.</p>\n<p>Actions are made through simple mouse interactions.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Players should carefully remember their password when logging in to\u00a0play against humans since there is currently no automatic method\u00a0to recover lost passwords. In any cases, for people who do not want to be identified or are not\u00a0interested in keeping game statistics,\u00a0there is an option to let them\u00a0play as guests.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\r\nGame Principle\r\n<p>The game features a merciless confrontation between two clans in the land of the rising sun. The players control pieces evolving on a board made of hexagonal tiles. The goal: safely bring back its most valuable characters at its camp before they are captured by the opponent. To this end, players will have to assess the characters behind the opponent's pieces whose identity is kept secret at the beginning of the game.</p>\r\n\r\nRules\r\n<p>A\u00a0detailed description of the rules is accessible\u00a0by\u00a0selecting the 'Rules' button directly\u00a0from the main menu or, during the game, from\u00a0the option panel at the top left corner of the screen.\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\nFuture Developments\r\n<p>The game should be\u00a0perfectly playable as it is. However, it is a first released version and I would obviously love to improve various aspects of the game\u00a0if I have more time\u00a0in the future. I detail below some of the extensions I have in mind.</p>\r\nGraphics and Sound Effects\r\n<p>The graphics and sound effects are currently relatively basics and I wish I could improve these aspects as well as let the player customise them according to their taste.<br/></p>\r\nPlayer Features\r\n<p>  I would love to offer new features such as a tutorial to\u00a0learn the rules, a mechanism to store and\u00a0replay the games' history, a game editor to build a given board configuration, etc.</p>\r\nNetworking\r\n<p>A login system is proposed to\u00a0allow players to record statistics about their past\u00a0games. These infos are currently very basic. In the future, I would like to provide additional informations. The lobby interface is also still simple\u00a0and I would like to propose more advanced options for players to help them connect\u00a0with other players.</p>\r\nAI\r\n<p>There are currently three AI levels, players can play against. Even the best\u00a0AI is moderately strong although it should be a bit challenging for a beginner. I am currently working on\u00a0\u00a0more\u00a0sophisticated\u00a0\u00a0AI but it takes some time... As a side note, I believe this game which relies on partial information\u00a0could be a great benchmark for evaluating AI based on\u00a0Machine Learning\u00a0methods.</p>\n\r\nAuthor's note\r\n<p>I am a big fan of board games and I invented some of them myself. Trip&amp;Traps is one of these games I started to design\u00a0years ago. Since I really enjoyed\u00a0its mechanism, I thought it would be great to build a digital version of the game to help sharing it\u00a0and\u00a0 here we are! This is my first digital game,\u00a0so please, be indulgent ;). In any cases,\u00a0I would love to have your\u00a0feedback about both the game mechanics and its digital implementation, but more important,\u00a0I really hope you'll enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T06:20:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cba/cba5f45dbc7238a6e2cca7ef69fe2a0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["LeonardJaillet"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
