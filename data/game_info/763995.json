A content warning is displayed at the start to mitigate harm.</strong></em><br/></p>\n<p>This demo features an original soundtrack, story, and some of my art of questionable quality. <br/></p>\n<p>Made with RPG Maker VX Ace. Only runs on Windows right now. All installments of this game will be completely free until I compile them all together. Donations are appreciated though! :)</p>\n<p><strong>KNOWN BUGS:</strong></p>\n<p>-Images staying on screen/not being deleted. I think I caught them all, but there may be some remaining. I will work hard to remove any issues in this regard.</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing/reading this far!</p>\n<p><strong>CHANGELOG:</strong></p>\n<p>01/04/22 - Changed a certain boss's HP because it's already troll-y enough.</p>\n<p>01/04/22 - Changed Mirai's last name.
