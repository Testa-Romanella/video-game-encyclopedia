Players will need to gather resources, assume complementary roles, and keep the balance between mining and firing if they want to keep the invaders at bay. The game plays with the tension between two levels and two sides, holding a cycle of resources that flows from a harvested fruit to nutrients. When hit by fruit, enemies release resources into the soil, which need to be harvested underground and used to stimulate roots, leading to fruits growing again.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Enjoy our entry for Global Game Jam 2023!</em></strong><br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Amir Sholi\u00a0</strong>- Compositor y productor de M\u00fasica y Sound Effects.\r\n </li><li><strong>Eric Silva\u00a0</strong>- Artista 2D, Animaci\u00f3n, Game Design, UI.\u00a0\r\n </li><li><strong>Federico Alvarez\u00a0-\u00a0</strong>Programador Lead.\r\n </li><li><strong>Federico R\u00edos\u00a0</strong>-\u00a0Artista 2D.\r\n </li><li><strong>Gast\u00f3n Ibarburu\u00a0</strong>-\u00a0Game designer Lead y producci\u00f3n.\r\n </li><li><strong>Mauricio Figliolo\u00a0</strong>-\u00a0Artista 2D Lead, Animaci\u00f3n, Game Design.\u00a0\r\n </li><li><strong>Sebasti\u00e1n Uriarte\u00a0</strong>-\u00a0Programador.\r\n \r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T15:23:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34a/34aeea750d0ba31737b9f780e75b79ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Fede Alvarez"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
