It was released by SETA Corporation in 1990.</p>\n<p>In QBillion you control a mouse that, for reasons that are left unclear, has to reduce stacks of blocks to units one block high. This is represented by a grid in which several squares have numbers, representing how many blocks are there. The player can move a single block around, or push a block down off a stack. However, to push a block the player must be standing on a block one level lower than the block - i.e. to push a block off the top of a three-block stack, the player must be standing on a two-block stack.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1989-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:36:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/243/243340a6f6aa2956ac64788c8d90fd5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Game Boy"], "developers": ["SETA"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["SETA"], "esrb_rating": null}
