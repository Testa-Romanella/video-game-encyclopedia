Immerse yourself in a gripping first-person shooter that will transport you to the heart of the action. This game developed by Burut Creative Team will have you on the edge of your seat.<br/>\r\nPicture this: the Nazis have made a chilling discovery, a technique that brings the dead back to life. But there's a twist - these revived soldiers possess incredible powers and are under the control of the first person they encounter. As the Allies fight to win the war, the Nazis start unleashing their fearsome UberSoldiers - super-soldiers with unimaginable abilities.<br/>\r\nStep into the shoes of Karl Stoltz, a German soldier who was killed in combat but resurrected by the Nazis. Now, Karl is seeking vengeance against his former masters and has joined the Allies to turn the tide of the war. Embark on a thrilling 12-mission rampage against the Third Reich, wielding 16 authentic WWII weapons, from the powerful Browning automatic rifle to the mighty Panzerschreck.<br/>\r\nBut that's not all - as Karl, you have access to a unique \"temporal shield\" that temporarily freezes bullets in mid-air, protecting you from enemy gunfire. Take down enemies with precision headshots to extend the duration of your supernatural shield, or unleash fury by stabbing three foes in quick succession to increase your health. Build up your rage and destruction to maintain your powers and unleash chaos on the Nazi threat.<br/>\r\nThis special Steam release of UberSoldier has even removed the original DRM Starforce, giving you a seamless and unforgettable gaming experience. Join Karl in his quest to bring down the Nazi regime and take control of World War II. Are you ready to rewrite history?
