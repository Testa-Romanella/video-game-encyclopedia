Looking forward to it, that peacefulness of nature, they start the long drive to their weekend away, unaware of what is about to unfold.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Robert wakes up disoriented in an underground bunker. The last thing he remembers is driving, heading to the cabin, but he doesn\u2019t recognise this place. He hears a scream and quickly realises it\u2019s his wife Anna.\r\n  </p>\n<p>He realises he must find Anna, and his two children, Josh and Sarah. This is far from the trip he was expecting. Someone has kidnapped his family and locked them down in this bunker.   </p>\n<p>You must find out <em>why </em>they are there, <em>who</em> put them there, and <em>how</em> to save Anna, Josh, and Sarah and escape the bunker alive. </p>\n<strong>Development Team<br/></strong>\n<p>Mind Games was developed by myself (Julie Black) and Daryl Black.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76e/76e00148c1edaa59a2f2bd92d7070f93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Julie Black"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
