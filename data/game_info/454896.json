I got a randomised link to a WikiHow page and had to make a game based off of it.</p>\n<p>Here is the article in question:\u00a0https://www.wikihow.com/Go-on-a-Road-Trip-with-All-Your-Friends</p>\r\nGameplay:\r\n<p>In this game you select buttons to make choices. These choices affect how the game plays out and you will end up with a different ending depending on the path you go.</p>\r\nOther info:\r\n<p>If you would like to, donate to me through the download link, if you wish. It will help me with developing better games in the future and will allow me to maybe even get better equipment. Also, the music from this game is from: www.bensound.com\u00a0<br/></p>\n<strong>Development Info:</strong>\n<p>I am planning on further working on this game and updating it further on. I'll add new choices, features, details, etc. This game is just a foundation, I guess you could say of what is to come. Be sure to check up on my devlogs for later updates. I'll get started soon, but I have school so that'll slow me down. :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-15T03:26:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dcd/dcd3dfc54e60215e08fe0b491592b20e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OMOEXPERIENCES"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
