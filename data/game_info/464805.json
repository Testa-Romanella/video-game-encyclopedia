There is a bug that prevents objects from spawning after you die once (Hearts, Power-ups, and the Exit). If you die, reset the game to make the objects respawn (Pause with Enter&gt;\"Reset Cart\").</strong></p>\n<p><strong>For GMTK Theme:</strong></p><p>Scrap boy can't control when he swaps power ups.\u00a0He will swap after some time or when hurt!</p><p>The bar on the side of your current power shows how much time you have left with that power. When it's fully depleted, your next shot will trigger the swap.</p><p>Why we implemented this mechanic for the jam: Usually in games with multiple power ups, oftenly the player\u00a0sticks to one power, either because it's their favourite, or because you just forget about it. In Scrap Boy, by removing the option to choose, the player is incentivized to use all powers and mobility options. It's more fun this way!</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>\u2191\u2193\u2190\u2192 -\u00a0 Move and Aim</p>\n<p>Z - Jump</p>\n<p>X - Shoot</p><p>You can swap X and Z\u00a0 if you prefer: Pause&gt;Swap Buttons</p><p><strong>Credits:</strong></p><p>BoneVolt - Graphics, Programming, Sfx</p><p>Julio Maass - Music, Level Design</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T06:30:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/025/025f7dc1ee1d40c686804b938d4ea224.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BoneVolt"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
