The Elder of\u00a0this village does not believe your claim that you are a goddess, and he sets you a series of three trials, during which you will gather followers and become stronger. With each follower gathered and each trial passed, more villagers believe you to be a goddess. Eventually, the Elder will finally believe you\u00a0and the whole town will adopt you as their patron goddess. Will this be enough to reclaim your immortality?
