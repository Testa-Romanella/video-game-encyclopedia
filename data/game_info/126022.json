Before spending any money, please check out the\u00a0free demo (Unity Web Player) of brown! If you like it, or me, or both, then feel free to grab the full version, either here, or the Webplayer Version (coming soon) or on the Appstore (coming soon), or Google Play (here). It's \"pay what you want\" over US$2.99: any more than that would be super-appreciated.</p><p>Proceeds will go directly to my expenses, including but not limited to the cost of my computer, a Unity Pro license (and hence the removal of that awful splash screen), various other licences (iOS and Android Developer licences, etc) and the production of further levels and other games.</p><p>NOTE 2! If you bought 1 version of the game then I'm very happy to give you access to them all. email me at stoogebag at gmail dot com and we can figure it out.</p><p>NOTE 3! If you find a strictly better solution than my best (the gold medal usually represents my best score: sometimes this is obviously the optimal solution, sometimes not), get in touch!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a98/a983373aac47e14488fa2345fddbbcd8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Stoogebag"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
