You've been exiled for your inability to die and locked away in a tower, never to be seen again.. or so you thought.</em></p>\n<p><em>Kill yourself to slowly make your way up the tower, taking on a spiritual form to float right through the ceiling and up to the next level of the building!\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>------------------</p>\n<p>Didn't get as much done as I would've hoped but alas.. had a ton of IRL stuff get in the way so couldn't get enough time in for the jam. Hope to do a bit of bug fixing post-jam to get it working proper!</p>\n<p>Bug at the beginning of the game where some of the spikes just wont kill you or send you up as a spirit long enough.\u00a0</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>LEFT/RIGHT Arrow Keys\u00a0or A/S\u00a0to move</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Jump / W / UP key to jump</strong></p>\n<p>------------------</p>\n<p><strong>Music credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Komiku/Helice_Awesome_Dance_Adventure_/dropda...</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T18:12:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/066/0665cce263eb7f460fd7abd8cfe53472.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FatiguedFox"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
