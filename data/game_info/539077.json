Control yourself and your surroundings. Leap from spinning debris across the void. Traverse ruins as old as time itself. Pierce the shell. Intense gravity.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPuppet a robot body controlled by a neural interface with the last sentient being in the universe. Sail across the emptiness, thread the needle, and make orbital contact with large chunks of spinning debris by using your godlike zero-gravity force based movement. Engage precision multi-directional force control on objects. Turn a ladder into monkey bars with climbing zero-gravity climbing, where no direction is up. Latch on to spinning debris flying past, and experience a reference frame shift where the debris is motionless, and the world is rotating. Let go from this bucking boulder, and your angular and linear velocity is preserved as you slowly spin and drift away from the terrain.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T02:18:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a65/a657ec6faa4ba2ae77404a6745f7b6e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZURG"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ZURG"], "esrb_rating": null}
