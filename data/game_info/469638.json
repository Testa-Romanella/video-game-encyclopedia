Donations, if you choose to give any will help me make this whole game development thing an actual career, but there's no pressure, even just feedback on what to add/fix would be a great help.</p>\n<p>[Gameplay]<br/></p>\n<p>The gameplay controls are based on a xbox style gamepad, you will need two controllers to actually enjoy the game as of now, which is something I'd like to get around to fixing if possible. The default keybindings (can be changed in builder) are as follows:<br/></p>\n<p>A: enter button for ui (cannot be remapped as of yet)<br/></p>\n<p>T-axis: (right trigger increases speed, left decreases/reverses)</p>\n<p>RB: laser gun fire button</p>\n<p>LB: missile fire button</p>\n<p>Left stick-X: roll</p>\n<p>Left stick-Y: pitch</p>\n<p>Right stick-X: yaw<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T05:14:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c81/c81166b43977d17e9dd05e03ab01a2c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Irvin_Games"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
