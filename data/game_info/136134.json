Being inspired by stuff I've read and watched about making an <em>actually good</em>game, I'm working on an early prototype for a very loose idea I have.<p>I have a plan of making a logic game with puzzles and a small amount of action - the concept is that there are certain floors that players can turn on and off to be able to walk on them instead of being stuck.</p><p>From what you can see so far: what do you think, is it viable? The highlight is on the patterns you can form with the players; I tried to give them some strategic variety; is it done properly?</p><p>Here's a manual of all things you can do in the current prototype:</p><p>BASIC CONTROL</p><p>- press WASD to move</p><p>- press Q to change character</p><p>- use mousewheel to select an ability; press a mouse button to use it</p><p>MOUSE CONTROL</p><p>- you can change direction with the position of the mouse</p><p>- turning has no step cost</p><p>- the first 4 abilities are symmetric, the rest are direction-sensitive</p><p>ABILITIES</p><p>- when an ability is selected, its pattern is drawn out</p><p>- when you push a mouse button, tiles in the same patterns are changed</p><p>- a certain type of floors that can be turned \"on\" and \"off\" by these abilities</p><p>OBJECTS &amp; MAP</p><p>- there are walkable and impassable floors without any further properties</p><p>- certain floors can be turned on and off; latter makes players stuck</p><p>- Shadow Towers: disables the ability casting of players in a predefined distance</p><p>- Exit tiles: the two players must stay on exit tiles to finish a level</p><p>GUI</p><p>- by clicking on the arrow and circle icons, you can move and zoom the map</p><p>OTHER FEATURES</p><p>- you can create any maps by drawing a bitmap</p><p>- press Z to load testmaps I've done (dev feature)</p><p>PLANNED FEATURES</p><p>- signs</p><p>- expanding the Cast_Ability function: explosion events, rockets</p><p>- change from mouse to keyboard selection</p><p>- circular effect to shadow towers</p><p>- kickable urns (Hirlau...)</p><p>- teleports</p><p>- jump to selected player</p><p>- a proper zoom</p><p>- autotiling</p><p>- one-way gates solely for one player</p><p>L\u00d6VE forum thread.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a6/0a63a5760e473d32e1f747ef60bf4121.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Katamori"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
