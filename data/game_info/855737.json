{"id": 855737, "slug": "gear-shift", "name": "Gear Shift", "name_original": "Gear Shift", "description": "A 2D puzzle platformer with a single\u00a0button input and the core mechanic of gravity shifting.\r\n<p>                                                    A little cog named Coggi is an essential component of a Robot's heart. The Robot's condition has deteriorated over time due to the irregular amount of bubble gum spread across its surfaces.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The only way to clear out the bubble gum is by unlocking the tubes that connect the Robot\u2019s organs and allowing to flow normally. Coggi\u00a0is the only cog whose shape matches the keys needed to\u00a0unlock these tubes.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Coggi's main mission is to find these keys by spinning through the surfaces, jumping between platforms and shifting the gravity to access different parts of each organ. This will all be done by automatic impulse and\u00a0the press of a single button: 'Space' to jump.</p>\n\n<p>                                                         The Keys are the collectibles needed to unlock the tubes and get through each level. Once picked up, they become a part of Coggi\u2019s shape.\r\n</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Spinning is the essence of Coggi\u2019s movement. Coggi spins automatically and flips directions when colliding with walls. Tapping the SPACE button makes it jump.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Gravity shifting is enabled by colliding with cogs that are displayed across the levels. The Gravity Shifters establish the gravity in four dimensions: Down, Up, Left and Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some stationary pieces of pink gunk are stuck on surfaces and stop Cog\u2019s movement entirely, essentially killing him. They should be avoided.</p>\n\r\nTeam (Capybara Studios):\r\n<p><strong>Game Programmer: </strong>Andre Borja Miranda -\u00a0https://andreborja.itch.io\u00a0/\u00a0https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreborja/</p>\n<p><strong>Level Designer: </strong>Eduardo Cavalcante Almeida -\u00a0https://edu-cavalcante.itch.io\u00a0/\u00a0https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduardo-cavalcante-almeida/</p>\n<p><strong>Project Manager / 2D Artist:\u00a0</strong>Naomi Nagayama Freire -\u00a0https://naomifreire.itch.io\u00a0/\u00a0https://www.linkedin.com/in/naomi-freire-068520189/</p>\n<p><strong>Game Designer / 2D\u00a0Artist:\u00a0</strong>Sebastian Beltran Convers -\u00a0https://sebastian-beltran.itch.io\u00a0/\u00a0https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastian-beltran-convers-74b069152/</p>\n\n<p><em>Any feedback on this project is much appreciated!</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T16:08:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93f/93fbe36c07df457a727564a9b2ba2677.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["andreborja", "Eduardo Cavalcante", "Naomi Freire", "Sebastian Beltran"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
