All my art was created in that time period\u00a0with MS paint only. All the sound and music was created in that time aswell using only my mouth. I sang in a note and played it transposed to every other note on my digital keyboard. Grey area i guess ^^. I didn`t use a drawing tablet and had a lot of fun. Hope you guys enjoy. It was my first game ever and this is my first, published small game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T05:12:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33a/33a52756aa031038ef0d8ed9c3e34a7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["R3dleg"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
