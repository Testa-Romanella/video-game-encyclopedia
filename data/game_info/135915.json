All the characters are hand animated on paper then scanned, cleaned up and coloured digitally.<br/>It was a lot of fun to make, and a lot of hard work.<br/>I hope you enjoy it, and thanks for taking a look at it.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:<br/>Keyboard:<br/>Move - A and D ot Left and Right Arrow keys<br/>Jump - Space<br/>Pause - Escape<br/>Start - Enter<br/><br/>Xbox360 Gamepad:<br/>Move - Left Analogue Stick or the D-Pad<br/>Jump - A, B, X or Y buttons<br/>Pause - Start button<br/>Start - Start Button<br/>*Other gamepads should work, but haven't been tested.*<br/></p><p>Level Select: At the main menu,\u00a0 hold down Z and B then press a number to load up that level (1 - 9)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/237/237399fe215cc9a23d15cb143de546f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Zoran Bosnjak"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
