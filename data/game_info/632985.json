Complications ensue that leads the gang to confronting what's messing with God Gamer. Along the way, old friends and new friends show up in the quest to save God Gamer!</p>\n<p>There are plenty of spelling mistakes and likely many more glitches and errors, but as this is a silly game made in a short time frame I figure it's a lot of work to correct.
