The puzzle design is excellent and it generally stays clear of cheap jump scares, yet still has some very scary moments and a deep sense of dread throughout. There\u2019s no doubt in your mind that you\u2019re dabbling with dark arts that are best left alone, but the clever use of environmental storytelling does a good job of revealing why you\u2019re pushed to such desperate measures. Highly recommended.\"<br/><br/>--Free Game Planet", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-31T06:25:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c9/6c984d870c1f800c6a04cde9f776c201.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Regularly Scheduled Programming"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
