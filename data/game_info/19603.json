{"id": 19603, "slug": "intrusion-2", "name": "Intrusion 2", "name_original": "Intrusion 2", "description": "<p>Intrusion 2 is a single-player Run and Gun, reminiscent of games like Metal Slug or Contra. It was a finalist of Independent Games Festival 2013 in Technical Excellence category. And for the game that is a direct sequel to 2008 free to play the flash game mostly created by one man, it is a no small feat. <br />\nPlayers will have to lead the nameless protagonist to battle against enemy war corporation on the distant ice-covered planet. Sci-fi style of the setting creates an opportunity to present a lot of unique mecha-enemies, whose behavior is based on physics and procedural animation, which results in ragdoll physics for the 2D sprites. Intrusion 2 is a relatively short game that has only nine levels. And in order to compensate, the stages are scaled and filled with enemies to represent an old-school gauntlet-like experience. Some of the enemies can be mounted, giving the players some extra mobility. At the end of every three levels players will have to go through a multistage boss battle, and with every difficulty level the game will ramp up the number of enemies and threats on the hard mode.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2012-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T12:39:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c0/0c0a2dd166cbeeaba326dc2b2958782f.jpg", "website": "http://www.intrusion2.com/", "rating": 3.11, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 85, "owned": 1297, "beaten": 18, "toplay": 12, "dropped": 26}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 14, "ratings_count": 71, "suggestions_count": 543, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 71, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Aleksey Abramenko"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Aleksey Abramenko"], "esrb_rating": null}
