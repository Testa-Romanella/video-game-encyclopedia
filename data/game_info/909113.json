{"id": 909113, "slug": "jam-crop-meti", "name": "JAM: Crop METI", "name_original": "JAM: Crop METI", "description": "<p>Welcome to Programming 101. In this class you'll learn to program a space probe. It will fly to Sol III (known as Earth by its inhabitants) and reconfigure a specific crop field. We do this to test the intelligence of those earthlings. Good luck!</p>\n<p>The crop field serves as input to the probe's program. It is a field comprised of 8 positions. Each position can be either a wheat plant in various growth stages or just the soil. The starting and ending position of each field will not contain a plant, i.e. soil. The highlighted position is where the probe could begin its execution.</p>\n\n<p>The source code is comprised of multiple instructions. Each instruction is made up of 5 characters: <em>CURRENT STATE CURRENT PLANT </em><em>NEW PLANT MOVE DIRECTION</em> <em>NEW STATE</em>. The starting state for the program is always <em>A</em>. If <em>CURRENT STATE</em> matches the program's current state and if <em>CURRENT PLANT</em> matches the plant/soil that the probe sees in its current field position then:</p>\n<ol><li>the probe will replace what it sees with <em>NEW PLANT</em></li><li>the probe will be moved one position in the field according to <em>MOVE DIRECTION</em></li><li>the program's state is changed to <em>NEW STATE</em></li><li>remaining instructions aren't executed, instead a new cycle starts</li></ol>\n<p>There is one special state <em>Terminate</em>, <em>T</em>. If <em>NEW STATE</em> is set to it, the program will halt execution. It's recommended to switch to this <em>T</em> state when you have finished re-configuring the input field to the expected form. Each situation (STATE + PLANT) the probe encounters needs to be handled by some instruction, otherwise the probe will self-destruct.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>\n<ol><li><em>A50RA</em>: If program's current state is <em>A</em> and if probe sees plant <em>5</em>, then replace it with plant <em>0</em> (just the roots), move right and keep state to <em>A</em>.</li><li><em>ASS.T</em>: If program's current state is <em>A</em> and if probe sees no  plant <em>S</em> (soil), then keep it as a soil, remain there (stay) and change  state to <em>T</em>, which terminates execution.</li></ol>\n<p>That's it! Make us proud!</p>\n\n<p>(Keep in mind this is only a prototype, made for LD52.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T16:22:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa3/aa3cae0eca83ed904783b8089a0cf90c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["seshoumara"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
