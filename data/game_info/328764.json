As with all great infinite puzzlers, Hexa Frog! is great in one minute bursts or hours of emotive fun.<br/><br/>In the game you are challenged to interact with a tower block of varying shaped bricks upon which rests a hexagonal block. The aim is to get the hexagon down the tower block to earn points. You do this by tapping the bricks to make them disappear bringing the hexagon down into the space cleared underneath.<br/><br/>It sounds annoying, but when the hexagon starts to roll or the tower tilts, and with pressure of high scores you\u2019ll find it\u2019s not as easy as you originally thought. If you flick the tower, it gains momentum and rolls off the screen, then it\u2019s game over and you have to start all over again. <br/><br/>Challenging, emotive and blissfully simple to play. Hexa toad! will have you hooked on getting as far down the tower as possible.
