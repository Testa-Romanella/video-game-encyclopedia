Currently, however, I'm still working on combat and animations. For now, all that the player can do is move around.\u00a0New mechanics are planned to be added in the future.</p>\n<p>This is the first game I've ever worked on for itch.io and it's still very much a work in progress. I appreciate any comments on what to improve on. Thank you for taking the time to try this game out, even if it's not complete!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T17:28:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08b/08bf76a9f5dd22324e805f62cc69d8d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NV_Navnit"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
