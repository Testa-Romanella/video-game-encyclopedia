Don't touch red walls. The game uses only one button, but you can use space, enter, left click or your controllers equivalent to the xbox 360 A-button. You start rolling by tapping. Every tap also moves the blocks you have to bounce on to get to the goal.<br/></p>\n<p>Tap the button to traverse the menu or make the blocks move \u00a0ingame. <br/>To confirm menu selection keep the button pressed until the circle in the bottom right corner is filled. The speed at which it fills can be adjusted in the main menu.<br/>You only bounce in multiples of 45\u00b0 angles to make it less of a messy physics puzzle.</p>\n<p>To reset a level keep the button pressed. When you are at the start of a level and keep the button pressed you return to the menu.</p>\n<p>There are currently 4 levels for each new block, so the game is not very long.</p>\r\nOther Info\r\n<p>Created for the 1-button jam 2021.<br/>This is the first game I ever finished. It is made with the Godot engine. I picked it up this october and love it. <br/></p>\n<p>I consider continuing to work on this project. Would love to hear what you think, even though I'm aware that it's not exactly hard to come up with improvements yet. I want to upgrade the art with  vector graphics and co to make it look and sound less like the programmer-art that it is and the physics need to be made more stable. I probably won't start working on that right away though. <br/></p>\n<p>Ironically I got carpal tunnel while making it, so I'm looking forward to trying the other jam entries.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T08:16:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25f/25fe51852f8eec24ef1168b63a47a225.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nonsense90"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
