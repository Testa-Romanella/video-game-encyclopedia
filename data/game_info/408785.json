{"id": 408785, "slug": "necrom-antics", "name": "Necrom-antics", "name_original": "Necrom-antics", "description": "<p>A Metroidvania-like puzzle platformer where you, the Necromancer, have to 'repair' various creatures in order to get through the ruins of your lair and find a way out. Mix and match spell ingredients like bones, cloth, and goo to cast spells and summon creatures to help you through your lair's tricks and traps. Create <strong>skeletons </strong>to harmlessly pass through spikes, <strong>zombies </strong>to chew through blockades of vines, <strong>mummies </strong>to help you down perilous ledges, <strong>slimes </strong>to squeeze into tight spaces, <strong>fishmen </strong>to carry you across water, and- if all else fails- <strong>ghosts </strong>to destroy any other creatures you've accidentally summoned. Collect the ten <strong>Mana Orbs</strong> to open the doors and exit your lair.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Programming by myself</li><li>Art by Ky (@kythesquiddy on Twitter)</li><li>Map design and music by Lewis (@blueis_h on Twitter)</li></ul>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Arrow keys</strong> to move\u00a0</li><li><strong>Z</strong> to begin casting a spell and to accept selection\u00a0</li><li><strong>X </strong>to cancel spell\u00a0</li><li><strong>C</strong> to teleport to most recently activated checkpoint -</li><li>Press <strong>Up arrow key</strong> to activate checkpoint and recover spell ingredients</li></ul>\n<p>(This game was made for the Global Game Jam 2020 in 48 hours, so we know it's not perfect.
