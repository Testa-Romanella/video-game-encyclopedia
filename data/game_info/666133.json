Move around with W, S, A, D and the mace will follow with your momentum. Use the mace to attack your enemies and kill them for points.</p>\n<p>Knocking enemies into each other will cause a chain reaction. Killing enemies with a chain reaction will cause them to drop coins. Coins are worth an additional 250 points when picked up.<br/></p>\n<p>Goblins take 3 hits to kill<br/>Red Knights take 5 hits to kill<br/>Note: Chaining enemies into each other will deal damage to both even if they are currently invincible against you.</p>\n<p>Killing a Red Knight is tough, but if you manage to do it they will drop a powerup. Green gems provide a speed boost, Teal gems provide temporary invincibility, and Purple gems provide a damage boost. These bonuses only last for 5 seconds so use them wisely.</p>\n<p>Try and get the high score and login via Azure PlayFab to compete on the leaderboard!</p>\n<p><strong>Assets Used:</strong><br/>Graphics sourced from:<br/> Game-Icons.net</p>\n<p>Music provided by:<br/>The Intergalactic Beets Project - Full-Length Song Collection I<br/><br/>Sounds provided by:<br/>Kenney.nl - RPG Audio Pack<br/>Magic Smite Sound</p>\n<p>Fonts:<br/>Google Fonts - Redressed</p><p>Additional Plugins/Assets:<br/>DoTween - Free Version</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T09:15:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ef/5ef2512ffe608c3d872f51006a75a815.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Diannara"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
