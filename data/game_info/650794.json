Through the lens of these rules, it seeks to answer a simple question: what makes a choice meaningful?<br/><br/><ul><li> Over 100 puzzles that are challenging due to the underlying ideas. Each puzzle is honed to its simplest form, so the difficulty comes from discovering the consequences of the mechanics rather than the size and complexity of the puzzles.<br/></li><li> Friendly design that wants you to understand. If you get stuck, each puzzle has a hint to point you in the right direction. Still stuck? There's a step by step solution available to help you get past the mental block.<br/></li><li> New ideas are constantly introduced, examined and twisted. There are no filler puzzles - each one has something new to say.<br/></li><li> Original soundtrack by Ian William Craig.<br/></li><li> Color-blind friendly</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T13:20:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4be/4bee0580ee393fcc41d4b20434ee2318.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 219, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mark Graham Johnson", "Marikat Software Corp"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Marikat Software Corp"], "esrb_rating": null}
