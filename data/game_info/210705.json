To rebuild an brick, you simply point toward it and press the action button, as long as you have ammo, that constantly spawns around you.</p>\n<p>The objective of the game is to reach the furthest level you can.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/282/2822ef1d65a6a0ffb674962dbaf880f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Thiago Guardado"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
