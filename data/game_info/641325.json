Around that time \"Psychonauts 2\" was announced, and inspired me to do this little project. Since the sequel chose Unreal as it's engine, I thought it would be a fun gimmick to remake the first game in Unreal. <br/></p>\n<p>The production, including getting into Unreal (I never worked with it before!) took one week.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T07:58:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/023/02308db7246e0c93b635c34e2138799f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Marius Winter"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
