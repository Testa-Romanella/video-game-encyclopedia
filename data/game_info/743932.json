It is a little Simulation of what the state can do to provide a good economy in its country. You can adjust taxes and subventions for several branches of industry. If the subventions are high enough the industry locations will most likely change their main branch of industry. If you do not give a branch of industry any subventions it will raise the possiblity for it to switch.The challenge of this game is to not lose too much money, keep your people happy and not to lose too much power. It is controlled via all three mousebuttons. Most of the Graphics are hand-drawn.\u00a0The current language is German, but it will be possible to change it in near future.\u00a0This is our first game. Btw it`s a bit hard, so you might need a couple tries to figure it out.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T05:32:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c6/7c67bf405077ae1127a07fa0deb6cba1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gasmaskskeleton Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
