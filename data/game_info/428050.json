Everything you have been ignoring is coming back to get you, shouting at you that they are real.\r\nAnd what if you don't wake up? You keep living the same nightmare over and over only because you are deeply lost inside your own mind, only because you are too weak to handle your fears.\r\n\r\nThey took it from us, our identity, our face! I am here to make sure to bring it all back...\r\nI remember how that liquid was a stain from the walls to the floor while you walked in those halls, feeling the safety of my world under it's shell. You were free, not exposed to the savagery of the outside. You knew the truth but you looked for more, this creation wasn't enough, we made that shell and you began melting it bit by bit, slowly peeling one layer after the other, leaving only a black hole of nothing.\r\nIt's gone too far. After all, you are part of them.\r\n\r\nIn this game you play an unstable man, you will wander between walls that trap his mind and you will go deep into places you have never seen before. \r\nThe environment will be inconsistent, at first you might explore the brighter areas of his mind, but as you go deeper it gets darker, illusions and voices are everywhere.\r\nDenial is the hard work of two brothers who worked tirelessly to bring their dream to life and they couldn't be more proud of it.\r\nWe invite you to take a visit into the madness, to face the truth.\r\n\r\n\"I AM A COSTUME, SHELL, SHADOW. BUT THAT'S OKAY, I AM THE ONE THEY CAN SEE AND YOU WERE LEFT TO FEEL IT\"\r\n\r\nGame features:\r\n\u2022 Psychological horror - your sanity is fluctuating, your brain betrays you and you are losing it without your pills.\r\n\u2022 See the big picture - there are pieces scattered everywhere, can you find them and finish the puzzle?\r\n\u2022 Multiple endings - which one will you choose?
