Inspired by the potential LD34 theme \"Stick Together,\" Escape Squad blends the isometric, top-down shooter mechanics of Binding of Isaac with the single-entity party mechanic of Legend of Grimrock to create a uniquely tactical action roguelike. Play as the four best friends Bearemy the Barbearian, Moz the Firefox, Bandit the Ranger Racoon, and Cynthia the Armordillo escaping from their evil captor-animals. Each shoots in the direction they are facing, and you can rotate the party to change your tactical setup.</p><p>This game is a prototype created in 72 hours for the Ludum Dare 34 game jam. The code and assets are open source and are available on GitHub.</p><p>We made this game during the Kickstarter for our full-time project, Adventure Guild. Please support us by checking out, backing, and sharing our Kickstarter campaign.
