Its a rough skeleton of a game, with minimal polish. The theme was Deeper and Deeper.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>\n\n<p>A 6-level game about retrieving your brain.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This mole made his way up to the surface, but has forgotten how to dig upward. He clearly forgot his brain, and needs to go deeper to get it back.</p>\n\n<p>To dig, hold A, S or D respectively and HOLD space to begin digging. When the circle is full, the block will break. Press E to eat!</p>\n<p>Standard dirt will produce worms and beetles. Both will heal you as you slowly lose health throughout the game.</p>\n<p>Thick dirt with lighter patches could produce spiders which give you special benefits. These are:</p>\n<p>Speed - Increase digging speed slightly for a short period, increase movement for a short period.</p>\n<p>Strength - Allows destruction of stone, massively increases digging times.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Known things:</p>\n<ul><li>- UI is very basic, I spent more time on the mole art.</li><li>- You can escape the map sometimes, and you wont die.</li><li>- Some animation glitches</li><li>- Lacking extra content</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T06:16:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23c/23c95d9a5ba8187f72dd49318e69b95d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tbage"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
