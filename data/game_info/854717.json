Instructions\u00a0below:</p>\n<p>Walk around using WASD. You can play the card game by walking close to the game board on the table and clicking mouse1 while looking at it.</p>\n<p>Card game rules:</p>\n<p>Click cards to pick them up. Click again on an empty tile to place a card back down. Click and hold to try combining cards. Combining works by dragging the mouse through several neighbouring cards (without backtracking or diagonals). Recipes are given below.Moving cards expends energy, which is limited. When all energy is expended, no further card movement is possible, and you should end the day by pressing <strong>BACKSPACE</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Standing up will cause all top-tier resources (like firewood, pumpkin pie, etc.) to be added to your resource counter. Your first target should be firewood: combine two sticks to form a log, and combine two logs to create firewood.</p>\n<p>Sitting back down at the table will replenish all your energy, and consume some of your stockpiled resources to give you a comfort boost. The boost lets you move more cards to use more complex recipes.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Recipe list:</p>\r\n\r\nTop tier resources:\r\nPumpkin + Pumpkin + Firewood + Sticks + Water -&gt; Pumpkin pie\r\nApple + Apple + Firewood + Sticks + Water -&gt; Apple tart\r\nLog + Sticks + Water + Firewood-&gt; Book\r\nLog + Log + Sticks + Fabric -&gt; Furniture\r\nFabric + Sticks -&gt; Pillow\r\nLog + Log -&gt; Firewood\r\nIntermediate resources:\r\nFlax + Flax + Water -&gt; Fabric\r\nDirt + Water + Log -&gt; Apple\r\nSticks + Sticks -&gt; Log\r\nDirt Water Seeds (50%) -&gt; Pumpkin\r\nDirt Water Seeds (50%) -&gt; Flax\r\n<p>The goal of the game was to raise the comfort level with resources acquired from the card game, which would be reflected in new furniture and decorations appearing inside and outside of the room.
