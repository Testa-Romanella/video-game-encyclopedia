Start with \u00a3500 and attempt to generate \u00a350'000 as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>This game was developed as part of a project for my last semester of my media production degree, the game forced me to adapt quickly as working inside of the timescale, while learning the C# programming language as well as working with Unity in a capacity I had no done so before. This project was a chance to expand my skill set into another field before leaving university, and is something that I hope to continue to expand on to use as a portfolio piece in the future.<br/></p>\n<p>The game as it stands now is lacking some of the features that were planned to be implimented, these were cut out due to time constraints and hopefully will be added in a future version of the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T06:40:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5a/c5a75616a1c041daee2e12892d99b70e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Kogara"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
