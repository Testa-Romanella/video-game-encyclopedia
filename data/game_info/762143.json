Well at least for as long as you can, INEVITABLY you will lose and we will need to replace you\u2026</p>\n<p>But for now.. DELAY the INEVITABLE skin breach as long as possible by SATISFYING as many cells as possible. Good Luck and thanks for choosing to work in the Skin Division!</p>\n<p>If a cell reaches the top of the screen with open connections you will lose a heart. No Hearts = Game Over. Keep your health topped off by satisfying health cells.</p>\n<p>hint: they have hearts on them</p>\n<p>SATISFY: Click and Drag from one cell's NODE (colored circle) to another cell\u2019s NODE.
