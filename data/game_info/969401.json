There are 16 cats to collect, try your best to get them all and learn their stories. Every cat you discover has a name, and a brief description you can find under <strong>Meet the Cats</strong>!<h3>DARK MODE BACKGROUND</h3>Are you a cat? I figured- protect your kitty cat eyes with our <strong>Dark Mode Background</strong>! Now you can stay up all night without any pesky humans knowing you are awake causing chaos!<h3>AN ADDICTIVE CHALLENGE</h3><strong>Easy</strong> to learn, <strong>hard</strong> to master, <strong>harder</strong> to put down. You would not believe how often we got distracted playing the game when testing changes during development! Once mastered, a single game could last hours!<h3>FUN SETTINGS</h3>Be it <strong>Super Fill Mode</strong>, <strong>Spawn Any Discovered Cat</strong>, or the developer favorite <strong>Gravity Mode</strong>, you will have a great time with these tweaks to your game!<h3>SFX</h3>Cats have very sensitive hearing, so along with the <strong>Master Volume</strong>, you have 5 additional volume sliders to tweak <strong>UI</strong>, <strong>Chimes</strong>, <strong>Game Reset (Meow)</strong>, <strong>Game Over</strong>, and <strong>Cat Merge/Spawn/Swipe sounds</strong>!<h3>STATISTICS</h3><strong>Kitty Cat Squash</strong> offers you many fun statistics about your game, including <strong>Amount of Cat Merges</strong>, <strong>Amount of Swipes Made</strong>, <strong>Amount of Cats Spawned</strong>, and many more including averages, and per-cat spawn rates! Purrrfect for our cat masterminds!<h3>UNDO</h3>We all make mistakes, so <strong>Kitty Cat Squash</strong> allows you a single <strong>Undo</strong> per game. Use it wisely!<h3>ADDITIONAL DISPLAY SETTINGS</h3>In the <strong>Display Settings</strong>, you have several options including showing the <strong>FPS</strong>, adjusting the <strong>Game Board Zoom</strong>, disabling the <strong>Tips</strong> at startup, and toggling <strong>Fullscreen</strong>. This is also where the <strong>Dark Mode Background</strong> option lives!<h3>CONTROLS (BASIC INPUT METHODS)</h3>Fingers? Cute little paws? Weird alien tentacle thing? We got you covered! <strong>Kitty Cat Squash</strong> enables you to control swipes with the <strong>On-Screen Arrow Paws</strong>, the <strong>WASD Keys</strong>, <strong>Arrow Keys</strong>, controller buttons/axes, or...<h3>CONTROLS (SWIPE MODE)</h3>...<strong>Swipe Mode</strong>. In swipe mode, you can use a touchscreen or drag your mouse to swipe. You can also control the distance you have to travel for a swipe to register!<h3>CONTROLS (ANIMATION TIME)</h3>Want to make swipes faster? Sure! How about super slow? Why not! You have full control over the <strong>Swipe Animation Time</strong>. In fact, we have also included a <strong>Time to Think</strong> option; when your board is not very full, your eyes will be darting back and forth like a kitty fixated on a laser pointer, and your animation speed will be very quick, however once your game board starts to fill up, the swipe speed automatically starts to slow down so you don\u2019t accidentally fill your board, run out of valid swipes and loose!<h3>ADORABLE!</h3>All game art was made by our very talented artist. Each kitty was designed with love, many based on real cats.
