In the top left is how much health you have which also corrosponsed to what numbers you can roll. E.G if you take a hit you now have 1 less health and you cannot roll the the lowest number you used to have. So if you take a hit youre more likely to roll higher but at the cost of lower HP. You gain full health every level.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T16:53:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/866/8662b337640c5153fd006bad6f60b363.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["somestufz"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
