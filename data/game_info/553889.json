In creating this prototype, I learnt how to implement a User Interface into my projects. I added a title screen with a difficulty select menu that will control how challenging the gameplay is,\u00a0 a score display that will track how many points the player has earned, and a Game Over screen, which will allow the player to restart and try again. In learning these skills, I am now able to create a fully \u201cplayable\u201d experience that the user can enjoy from start to finish without having to restart the application to try it again.</p>\n<p>After completing this Unit, I am now\u00a0able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a Game Manager object that controls game states \r\n</li>\n<li>Detect where the user has clicked their mouse in order to create a click-based program\r\n</li>\n<li>Use the Canvas to create UI elements like a Title, Buttons, or score display\r\n</li>\n<li>Lock elements and objects into place on the UI with Anchors\r\n</li>\n<li>Use variables and script communication to update elements in the UI\r\n</li>\n<li>Make UI elements appear and disappear with .SetActive\r\n</li>\n<li>Use script communication and Game states to implement working \u201cGame Over\u201d screen\r\n</li>\n<li>Restart the game using a UI button and SceneManagement class\r\n</li>\n<li>Add listeners to detect when a UI Button has been clicked and trigger functionality \r\n</li>\n<li>Set difficulty of gameplay from title screen by passing parameters between scripts</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T07:24:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b00/b00b2df6b17aa1d300d72fee34e984b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lewis Stephens"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
