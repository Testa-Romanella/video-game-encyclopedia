High Score (amount of Cavorite collected) can be seen in top left-hand corner. Crashing into asteroids will cause you to lose some of the collected Cavorite.<br/></p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys - Player Movement</p>\n<p>D - Shoot lazer (used to mine Cavorite deposits)</p>\n<p>S - Gravity Pulse (use to slow down Asteroids, not Cavorite though).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42c/42ca437ef681addfd595c21670d80bab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SleepingSafari"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
