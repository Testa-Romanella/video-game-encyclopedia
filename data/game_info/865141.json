Available again after way longer than was necessary! A holiday miracle!<br/></p>\n<p>Starring a Princess taking control of her own destiny, and a magical cat with strong eyeliner game.</p>\n<p>I first released this game in late July 2014. The timing turned out to be less than ideal. I didn't promote it as much as it deserved because of terrorism, and at the end of the year I had to withdraw it entirely because of new EU tax rules that were completely impossible to comply with. Then all my executive functions got frozen in an iceberg for seven years and somewhere along the way  I misplaced the final render. But listen, we got through that with a minimum of pants and a maximum of effort and a normal amount of fire, and now with very special help from ragdollwitch here is the game.</p>\n<p>Tips and donations are optional, appreciated, non-refundable, and help support further installments slowly getting made. There is a plan, but I'm just one very tired\u00a0goblin\u00a0so it's taking a while.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Things this game definitely includes:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>trope subversion\r\n</li><li>feminism dragon\r\n</li><li>a level shaped like a butt\r\n</li><li>chainmail banana hammock\r\n</li><li>references to Zork, The Princess Bride, The X Files, and more\r\n</li><li>old meme\r\n</li><li>homage\r\n</li><li>the ghost of 2014 tumblr probably</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Things this game definitely does not include:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>metal bikinis\r\n</li><li>doomguys\r\n</li><li>damsels in distress\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>System requirements</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Windows 2000 or better\r\n<br/>\r\n1.0\u00a0GHz Intel Pentium III equivalent or better\r\n<br/>256MB RAM\r\n<br/>400MB available hard disk space\r\n<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T07:05:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/024/02427eacb55f2d9f59c03d5ab01e85d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Falling Dream"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
