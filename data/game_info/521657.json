But with a twist : the game is turn-based !</p>\n\n<p>I made it for the Mix &amp; Game Jam 2020. It's more of an experience than a game to be honest, but I'm proud of the result.</p>\n<p>There was supposed to be more maps (even with antigravity !). The mechanics have been implemented, but I didn't have the time to build the maps. But I learned a ton making those so it's all good.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>The assets are from the Synty Prototype pack. I didn't have the skill and time to make 3D assets myself, so I used a pack that I really like. With the post-processing, it gives a toon/imaginary feel.</p>\n<p><em>Controls :</em></p>\n<ul><li><em>Right Click : Switch Action</em></li><li><em>C : Switch top camera</em></li><li><em>P : Pause</em></li><li><em>Space : End Turn</em></li></ul>\n<p><em>The game is meant to be played in a 16/9 resolution, and in full screen.</em></p>\n\n<p>Feel free to send me a message with your feedback !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T07:39:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f95/f95d9c5edc2a2bb175241318d4a70e83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["perdonium"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
