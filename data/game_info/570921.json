When you saw it, press SPACE to start.\r\n</p>\n<p>Then you enter the game and you are the blue square (totally not because I was too lazy to make textures) and you can move with A and D keys or LEFT and RIGHT arrow.\r\n</p>\n<p>Try to avoid red squares. if you touch them, you will end up in a Red Screen. But worry not.\u00a0 You can start over with SPACE key.\r\n</p>\n<p>Your goal is to collect 200 gold squares and get to Gold Screen, then you win! (It is possible. Don't worry)\r\n</p><p>Well, Congrats. You know how to play. Now Play if you want (It is completely free. I don't even need donation.
