Humans are decadent, fat, giant, evil, and most importantly gruesome with their intelligence and modern technology.\u00a0Meanwhile, the dogs, former slaves, live in poverty in tribal/nature-friendly communities but have to live a sad life surrounded by all kinds of waste dumps, sicknesses, and hunger. They go on the hunt. In ambushes they attack robots that gather meat for the humans, to survive the coming winter.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nTeam distribution<br/>Dogs used to be precious allies to humans.<br/>But humans got lazy and created robots so they could do the hunting for them without asking for their share of the loot.
