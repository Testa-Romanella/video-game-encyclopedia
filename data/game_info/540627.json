Journey into the uncharted forest, guided by the harmonised whispers of the trees. Each tree with different voices, genders and dialects, speaking as one. <br/></p>\n<p>Taking artistic inspiration from expressionist painters like Edvard Munch and focusing on a powerful 3D audio experience with breath-taking choir work, Sunlight will leave you feeling entranced and in wonder in this artistic approach of telling you a story. <br/></p>\n<p>Playtime: 30 minutes.</p>\n<p>The visuals, that were hand painted using Quill, makes the experience feel like exploring a three dimensional painting.<br/></p>\n<p>The hauntingly beautiful music, composed by Tchaikovsky, was recorded in the Archbishops palace in Trondheim, Norway, and sung by the award winning choir Kammerkoret Aurum. Along with a wide range of voice actors spanning multiple continents, the atmospheric and meditative story comes alive.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T05:22:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/293/2933afef200e900cee475bae9e03e2b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KrillbiteStudio"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
