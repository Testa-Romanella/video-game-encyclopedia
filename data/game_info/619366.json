Easy, right?</p>\n<p>Both you and your player can't phase through blocks, and touching spikes mean instant death. The player will always try to follow your mouse, so you need to make sure you both don't die!</p>\n\n<p>Getting the mouse movement right was an incredibly technical task and took up a giant percentage of development time. As such, the game can only be played in fullscreen. Maybe I'm just dumb and it took me too long to get it to work.</p>\n<p>This is also my first game jam! All of the art, music, sound effects, and  code is by me. Creating the game with no engine (aside from MonoGame) may not have been the best idea, but it definitely worthwhile for me. Maybe you'll like this game. :)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Known Bugs (Minor Issues)<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>If the cursor is moved too fast, it will stutter. This is a side effect of my implementation for preventing the mouse moving through blocks. This may be fixable.</li><li>Sprites (particularly spikes) contains pixels from other sprites in the global spritesheet. I was working on a Mac and didn't encounter this problem until building for Windows. I think this is just an internal part of MonoGame, but there may be an easy fix.</li></ul><ul><li>On Windows, the window is locked at 1280 x 720. When I tested the game on Windows, the mouse calibration didn't scale properly with the monitor at fullscreen. This was an emergency change and was uploaded within the grace period.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T14:26:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/857/8572062a5d676807056fd72f8e7c2e09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["the_maverick_m"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
