The cooling systems have failed and a reactor meltdown is\u00a0imminent. As the only engineer on site, it is\u00a0up to you to save the facility from a nuclear meltdown!</p>\r\nWhat Is Meltdown?\r\n<p>Meltdown is an isometric puzzle game with the goal of repairing coolant pipes that flow through the nuclear power plant. In this game, there are a variety of mechanics the player will need to familiarize themselves with in order to complete the puzzles. Some of these elements include power sources such as\u00a0<strong>Switches, Buttons, and Crates</strong>, which in turn activate equipment such as <strong>Access</strong>\u00a0<strong>Doors, Bridges</strong>, and more! All these mechanics are driven by a color-coded power system that the player will use to find an effective path of fixing these pesky pipes.  With all these concepts in mind, the player will dive deep into the chambers of their local reactor to repair their cooling issues and save the day.</p>\n<p>Each level awards you with a star rating based on run duration, can you find the most effective way to reach the pipes?</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>W</strong> - To move in the direction the player is facing<br/><strong>A</strong> - Rotate left<br/><strong>S</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0 Turn around<br/><strong>D</strong>\u00a0- Rotate right<br/><strong>F</strong>\u00a0- Drop carried valve<br/><strong>Q</strong> - Rotate chamber clockwise<br/><strong>E</strong>\u00a0- Rotate chamber counter-clockwise<br/><strong>Spacebar </strong>- Interact / pickup</p>\n<p>Use the\u00a0<strong>Scroll wheel</strong> to zoom in and out of the map in order to catch an overview of the map or to zoom in for finer detail.</p>\n<p>This game was developed for the GoGodotJam 2 with the theme of <strong>Energy Source.\u00a0</strong>You can find more about our team and our various projects on our website\u00a0https://starlane.studio/.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Project Manager &amp; Lead Developer: @Jools</li><li>Game Design &amp;\u00a0Awesome Level Designer: @Secroza</li><li>Composer of our awesome soundtrack: @JacksonBean</li></ul>\n<p>Good luck and have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T13:48:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d5/8d5cd132d91328ca5323f0aea5eec61f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Starlane Studios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
