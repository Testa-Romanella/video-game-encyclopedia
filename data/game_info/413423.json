{"id": 413423, "slug": "cards-with-personalities", "name": "Cards with Personalities (itch)", "name_original": "Cards with Personalities (itch)", "description": "Introduction\r\n<p>In <em>Cards with Personalities</em>, players take on the role of a humble hero trying to assemble a team of great personalities to defeat the weird bosses that roam the lands. Each turn, you will play cards from your hand to gain Gold, Attack or other effects (like converting monsters to your side). You can spend Gold to acquire new cards from your deck. Attack is used to slay monsters, which earns you Gold and other cool effects. The battlefield is always changing so you have to adapt and come up with new strategies to defeat all eight bosses! </p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Move cursor<br/><ul><li>Keyboard: Arrow keys | Controller: D-pad or Joystick\u00a0</li></ul></li><li>Action button<ul><li>Keyboard: Z | Controller: A / Y</li></ul></li><li>Secondary button<ul><li>Keyboard: X | Controller: B / X</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p><em>(All actions that you can take are indicated at the bottom screen)</em> </p>\r\nRules\u00a0\r\n\n<p>Every turn starts by you drawing five cards from your deck. Your deck always starts with the same ten cards, seven <em>mediocre bards</em> and the three <em>common guards</em>.\u00a0In order to win you will need to buy and defeat cards in the middle lane to build a better deck. To do that, first draw from your deck by pressing the action button, then select which card you want to play and again presss the action button. After that, select the monster or minion you want to slay / buy. If you want read more about the cards, press the secondary button on them at any time. <br/></p>\n<br/>Cards\r\n<p>There are three types of cards: <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Minions</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Cost <strong>Gold </strong>to buy and are indicated by the color of light blue (or brown for common cards). When bought, they are put in the graveyard and will be shuffled in the deck when there are no cards left to draw from your deck. The effects of the minions are activated when they are played.<br/> <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Monsters</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Cost <strong>Attack </strong>to slay and are indicated by the color of dark purple. Monsters in the lane attack every turn for one damage so keep that in mind. The effects are played out when slaying them. After doing its effects the monster is removed from play.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bosses</strong></p>\n<p>Each boss has different effects. They will only attack when their criteria are met. The criteria are always depending how many turns a player have taken. When the number of turns corresponds to the criteria, the boss will attack and the turns will reset to zero. Bosses will also boost up their attack, they also follow a similar pattern to the criteria, but the number of turns does not have to be equal. \u00a0</p>\n<p>One really important thing to keep in mind is to <strong>remember to attack the boss</strong>, this will attack the boss with your remaining Attack so if you plan to slay monsters do that first.<br/></p>\n<br/><br/>End turn\r\n<p>If you have no cards left to play and you have done everything you planned this turn, press the action button on your deck and the turn will end. Three things will always be checked. First all your resources will reset (excluding block that will reset last). Then if monsters exist in the lane they will attack. And lastly if the criteria of the boss are met, it too will attack. Then five new cards can be drawn again and a new turn starts. \u00a0</p>\r\nGame end\r\n<p>Each game will have you trying to reduce the current boss health to zero. If you manage that you will be rewarded with lots of XP to unlock more bosses and backgrounds. If the boss manages to reduce your health to zero the game ends as well, only rewarding you XP for how much health you managed to reduce from the boss. \r\n</p>\r\nCredits<br/>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Design, programing and art<br/></strong><ul><li>Sebastian Lind<br/></li><li>Twitter: @Elastiskalinjen</li></ul></li><li><strong>Music and SFX:\u00a0</strong>\u00a0<ul><li><em>Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n \"</em><em>Bibiki</em><em>\" Garc\u00eda\u00a0</em>\u00a0(check him out, he is awesome!)</li></ul><ul><li><em>Twitter: </em>@BibikiGL</li></ul><ul><li><em>Website: </em><em>http://bibikigarcia.com</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>Main tester:\u00a0</strong>\u00a0<ul><li><em>Simon Lind (My always helpful brother and biggest fan)</em></li></ul><ul><li><em>Twitter: </em>@YTFFTW<br/><br/><br/></li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>Have fun and good luck!
