Crows suck.</p>\n<p>Suggested by Jackie Edwards and That Random Robot:</p>\n\r\nGamepad Tips\r\n<p>If your gamepad is not working, try these tips:</p>\n<p>- Restart computer, unpair and repair controller (ie. actually remove it in your bluetooth settings). Make sure the player number light on your gamepad is lit up, if it's not, might not be properly connected.</p>\n<p>- Don't open Steam, Steam is selfish and has its own way of dealing with Gamepads that basically involves\u00a0screwing with the drivers so that no other games can work. If you have opened steam, you may have to restart your PC and not open it (also stop steam from opening automatically on startup).</p>\n<p>- Avoid binding multiple controllers per reboot. Binding PS controllers can mess up Pro Controller drivers and vice versa.</p>\n<p>- Pray to the great Button God</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T07:41:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/347/347642f71a15a466271ee86afa304b06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["BobboDev"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
