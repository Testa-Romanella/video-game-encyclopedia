{"id": 52394, "slug": "asteroids-1979", "name": "Asteroids (1979)", "name_original": "Asteroids (1979)", "description": "<p>Asteroids is an arcade space shooter released in November 1979 by Atari, Inc. and designed by Lyle Rains, Ed Logg, and Dominic Walsh. The player controls a spaceship in an asteroid field which is periodically traversed by flying saucers. The object of the game is to shoot and destroy asteroids and saucers while not colliding with either or being hit by the saucers&#39; counter-fire. The game becomes harder as the number of asteroids increases.<br />\nAsteroids was one of the first major hits of the golden age of arcade games. The game sold over 70,000 arcade cabinets and proved both popular with players and influential with developers. It has since been ported to multiple platforms. Asteroids was widely imitated and directly influenced Defender, Gravitar, and many other video games.<br />\nAsteroids was conceived during a meeting between Logg and Rains and used hardware developed by Howard Delman previously used for Lunar Lander. Based on an unfinished game titled Cosmos and inspired by Spacewar!, Computer Space, and Space Invaders, Asteroids&#39; physics model, control scheme and gameplay theme were derived from these earlier games and refined through trial and error. The game is rendered on a vector display in a two-dimensional view that wraps around in both screen axes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1979-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-13T07:58:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb2/bb2cc339e686d70604d03659f6022381.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.74, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 27, "beaten": 21, "toplay": 9, "dropped": 16, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 34, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 35, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox 360", "Atari 8-bit", "Game Boy", "PlayStation", "Atari 7800", "Commodore / Amiga", "Atari 2600", "Game Boy Advance"], "developers": ["Atari", "Krome Studios", "Krome", "The Code Monkeys", "General Computer", "Code Monkeys"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Atari", "Microsoft Game Studios", "Taito", "Accolade", "Sears"], "esrb_rating": null}
