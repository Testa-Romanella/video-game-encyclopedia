Each turn is divided into several phases.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 1 - data acquisition.</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0At the beginning of the turn, you receive a data packet from the server, which must be placed in the \"Arena\".</p>\n<p>A data packet is necessary for objects located on a 4 by 4 grid. Using the data controls, you can rotate the grid with data, specify a place for data recording in the \"Arena\".\r\n  </p>\n<p>When finished, click on the submit data button. If the objects overlap, then they will be overwritten. If the intersection occurs with a player, then in the case of an enemy or an obstacle, you take damage.\r\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>\u00a0</strong><strong>Phase 2 - player actions.</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0Having loaded the data into the work area called \"Arena\", you can activate your abilities (movement, attack, teleportation). In more detail, about each ability and about each object, you can read on the information panel (right-bottom) by selecting the required object.</p>\n<p>For every action you take, you need to spend energy. Each turn in this phase, you automatically gain 3 energy. Energy, like life, accumulates from turn to turn.\r\n  </p>\n<p>This phase will end if you run out of energy or you clicked on the \"Confirm\" button.\r\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 3 - the actions of the opponents.</strong></p>\n<p>In this phase, the enemies begin to act to destroy you.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Then a new turn comes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>GAME MODES</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Task - it is necessary to download 11-15 data packets, and a point of penetration will appear.\r\n  </li><li>Endless - there is no way out. =)\r\n</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Windows - Mouse, F4 - Fullscreen.</li><li>Android -\u00a0Tap.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Creative Commons attributions</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Graphics, References from\u00a0Vecteezy.com,\u00a0Kenny\u00a0</li><li>Sound samples from\u00a0Kenny,\u00a0FreeSound</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T04:24:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce2/ce25151de848d910d781b005abfb997a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["E1e5en"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
