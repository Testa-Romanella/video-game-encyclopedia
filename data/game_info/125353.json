{"id": 125353, "slug": "the-wizards-excel-adventure", "name": "The Wizard's Excel Adventure", "name_original": "The Wizard's Excel Adventure", "description": "<p>This is a simple platformer game. It was made for the Broken Engine Jam! whose purpose was to use \"busted, obscure, and outdated game engines\". I chose to build my game in Excel which, while certainly not obscure as a spreadsheet tool (and far from outdated),\u00a0wasn't designed for game development. Still, I'm a firm believer that Excel can do pretty much anything.</p><p>All graphics in the game are being generated by Excel itself. There are no externally built pictures being shown on pictureboxes. Every pixel is made up of an Excel cell.</p>\n<p>In this game, you play as a wizard on an adventure. It's basically just a simple and short one level\u00a0platformer game (just made in Excel). Get to\u00a0the end of the level and defeat\u00a0your twin brother\u00a0to win. You can jump on enemies or shoot them with your wizard powers. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>A\u00a0few notes:</p>\n<p>1. This game was intentionally built in a software which isn't designed to run games like this. So you can reasonably expect to encounter issues, particularly\u00a0with lagging. There are definitely better games out there in the genre which perform much better, this is more just a novelty showing what can be done in Excel.</p>\n<p>2. This game requires Microsoft Excel to run. Other spreadsheet software which can open Excel files would not likely provide the functionality necessary for the game.\u00a0Though there are versions of Excel built for operating systems other than Windows,\u00a0this game\u00a0was built for and has only been tested on Windows.</p>\n<p>3.
