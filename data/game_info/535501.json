Rack up the most points to be shown on the leaderboard. Don't die! Change between a pistol or a.k., there is no way of healing, good luck. Don't be a noob, be a pro lol.. btw you need friends to play. Compete for points by killing most of the players with your two guns, team up with others for a advantage.  <br/><br/>There are moving platforms to jump on and ladders to climb for height, drawing with the weapons is optional, up to you. Players are able to respawn and open lobbies for friends or random people to battle with. Practice aim by shooting the cat on the moving platform. You can run away from enemies if badly hurt by holding shift.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T04:09:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/048/0482be8961424ce6946d9233c9c60f4f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bifinley"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Bifinley"], "esrb_rating": null}
