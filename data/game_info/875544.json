However, I will be updating this demo\u00a0over the course of the next few months to add everything I had planned to include here, including extending the length of the demo. Once that's done, it's on to editing the full commercial release, complete with all non-commercial assets replaced, many many new enemies and bosses, and several more hours of gameplay.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T13:23:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a88/a8899f10ec096212ed9c8990642a7638.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Logic Obscure Productions"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
