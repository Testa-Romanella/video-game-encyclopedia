Stumble home is all about how you can always return home... Even if you come back drunk in the middle of the night. It is a 2D top down game where you have to complete simple tasks in order to get to bed. Wandering into objects such as dog toys, vases or the creaky floorboards will make noise, wander into too many objects and you'll wake your parents, or worse: the baby.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-01T05:05:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c52/c52f14629beeff949aa1f36a632e331c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zoe Rowbotham"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
