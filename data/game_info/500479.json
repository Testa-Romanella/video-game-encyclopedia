We were given an image to base our game off of and this is the result!</p>\n<p>The aim of the game is to score as high as possible, gaining points by mowing grass, and collecting batteries. Picking up batteries gives power and a speed boost, fill up your power bar and go into power mode, going faster and getting double points! While playing, watch out for hazardous boxes and the rat that chases you. If you get hit, you'll lose power. Run out of power and you lose the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Katie Wright \u2013 Producer/Concept Artist/3D Artist\u00a0</li><li>Harry Miller \u2013 Programmer\u00a0</li><li>Alexandru Afloarei-Ionut \u2013 Programmer</li><li>Andrian Denys \u2013 Lead artist (also made background for this PowerPoint)</li><li>Fin Miller \u2013 Texturing/3D artist/UI artist</li><li>John Bates \u2013 Texturing/3D Artist</li><li>Nathan Whitehead \u2013 Texturing/3D Artist</li><li>Ludovic Jean-Francois \u2013 Foley Sound Artist</li><li>Colin Cupid \u2013 Musician</li><li>Jamie Bovell \u2013 UI artist/Logo designer\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>The developer high score is 574, let us know if you can beat it :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T07:06:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75c/75c6a8756e7cbf86eb5f00fce48799c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Haarry"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
