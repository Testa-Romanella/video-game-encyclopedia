The second level loads, but you can only get so far before this stop working correctly. We're also having a bug issue with our character animation, so we hope to get that fixed here (climb animation won't switch). <br/><br/>A very challenging weekend, but all in all we are happy with what we were able to get done. If you get to the second stage, stick around for the music, I'm really happy how it turned out!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2df/2df4a87308201dd66487c38ff303e450.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["ShuddaHaddaLottaFun"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
