Move your ship to abduct humans, and attack your opponent to make them drop humans and launch their ship across the map. Drop off humans in the jar at the bottom to score, the person with the most humans dropped off wins! </p><p>Full 360 gamepad support, unknown support for anything else. </p><p>\u2717\u2717\u2717\u2717\u2717\u2717\u2717\u2717\u2717\u2717\u2717\u2717\u2717\u2717\u2717\u2717\u2717<br/></p><p>Let us know what you think on twitter! @nathanwentworth + @kieran_grealish</p><p>\u2717\u2717\u2717\u2717\u2717\u2717\u2717\u2717\u2717\u2717\u2717\u2717\u2717\u2717\u2717\u2717\u2717<br/></p><p>Code/UI/Audio: </p><p>Nathan Wentworth - @nathanwentworth</p><p>Kieran Grealish - @kieran_grealish</p><p>Art:</p><p>Brett Crowe</p><p>Andrew Couture</p><p>David Thurston</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/835/83577597a6302d2ece1a6f8b6cddc056.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["nathan wentworth"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
