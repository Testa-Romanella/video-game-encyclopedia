This is my very first game and I had a lot of fun. There will probably be a few bugs since it was made so quickly but I hope I've fixed most of them. Any and all feedback is appreciated. Thx for playing.</p>\n<p>Edit: Just wanted to say that the game runs horribly in browsers and I just recently realized that while trying to clear up my game file to make it smaller I accidentally deleted some things that I needed for my game so the game essentially breaks at certain points. I've fixed everything and made a downloadable version that works great but unfortunately can't add the downloadable version to the game page since voting is still happening for JimJam 2. I would just like to apologize and say that I've definitely learned from this whole experience and it won't happen again. If anyone is interested in downloading the game plz message me on Discord (Username: Tazmen) or ask in the comments. You will probably get a quicker reply with Discord. Thank You. This link should bring you to the downloadable version:\u00a0https://tazmen.itch.io/tim-ruswick-reborn-download</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tazmen"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
