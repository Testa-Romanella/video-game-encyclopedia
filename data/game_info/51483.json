Your goal is to clear as many of the randomly generated battlefields as possible before all the ships in your squadron are taken out. A new battlefield is generated after each one you clear, so the game goes on as long as you can survive, but be careful the battles get more chaotic and dangerous as you progress. Completing zones earns you gems which you can use to buy effects and upgrades for your ship, allowing you to go even farther and keep increasing your high score!<br/><br/>Key Features<br/>- Infinte procedurally generated battlefields.<br/>- Fun retro graphics and sounds.<br/>- Challenging and intense battles.<br/>- Competition for high score on the leaderboards. <br/>- Currency rewards for beating levels.<br/>- In-Game shop to spend those rewards on upgrades.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:30:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a7/8a7e1638da62fe04e7d7bd13d7c4e4ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Dylan Buchheim"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Dylan Buchheim"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
