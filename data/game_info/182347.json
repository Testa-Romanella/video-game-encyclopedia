Your quick shooting is reflexes is the only thing standing in the way of his escape.</p>\n<p>A very simple first person shooter game in the style of a runner. My first unreal 4 project too. Saying that expect it to be rough around the edges but still very playable. Very simple concept, shoot the npc running ahead of you a few times, avoid the red squares, and shoot the blue squares if you have to.</p>\n<p>This is a final project for Columbia College Chicago's Game Production course. Any assets used were used for educational purposes only.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/500/500f285b2ab3af96d0cae2d43a360520.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RyanTHECarpenter"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
