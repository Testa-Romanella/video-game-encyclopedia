Orbs will catch small meteors and halt their movement. Click and drag an orb to rotate it along with any meteors trapped inside. Click an orb to destroy it and release its contents at full speed.\u00a0<br/><br/>Large meteors can't be affected by gravity orbs. To destroy a large meteor, fling a small meteor into its path. In fact, smashing meteors together is a great way to rack up points!\u00a0<br/><br/>If you let too many meteors strike the Earth's surface, you're toast!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Game by Nate Slottow, Nico Prins, and Pat Kemp.\u00a0<br/>Music by Teo Acosta.\u00a0<br/>Sound effects by zimbot via freesound.org (http://www.freesound.org/people/zimbot) licensed under Creative Commons.<br/></p>\n<p>On Ludum Dare (#11 Overall!):\u00a0http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-32/?action=preview&amp;uid=4349</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-19T03:41:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc4/cc427791da02df495fc83123f7da8116.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Patrick Kemp"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
