Now it is up to you to stand up against your past mistake and take Charles down with the help of your new AI companion Carl...\u00a0</p>\n<p>don't forget: This is the story you created... You might have started this story, but I will be the one who decides how it ends - Charles</p>\n<p>(developer note: I noticed a bug in the game unfortunately. When you die you cannot move your character anymore and the game becomes unplayable. Your character can take 5 hits, after that you have to restart the game. Carl on the other hand can take 4 hits and can always be revived. I'm very sorry that this bug got into the game. I hope you can still enjoy the game\u00a0)</p>\n\n<p>Controlls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Movement - WASD or DirectionKeys\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shoot - Left Click\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dialogue - Space\u00a0</p>\n<p>Interact - E</p>\n\n<p>Some words from the developer: Hey, I hope you get to enjoy my first GameJam entry. CharlesVenture is the very first game that I more or less finished and I am very proud of that. I joined the Gdevelop GameJam 4 days late -_-,\u00a0 so I couldn't include all the things I wish I could have implemented, but the game is still fun to play in my humble opinion. If I had a little more time, I would have liked to add background music and some fun game mechanics that I planned out before. The only thing I regret is that I didn't start sooner. I'm very proud of my game and hope that you find it enjoyable. This GameJam gave me the motivation to keep on making games and improving myself. So stay tuned for the future.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>I tried to focus a little too much on the story aspect of CharlesVenture. I hope you can bear through the dialogue and enjoy the story as well as the gameplay :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T08:29:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/916/916a01ca0810f9d9174ca27d4bd468c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["StarbloodGames"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
