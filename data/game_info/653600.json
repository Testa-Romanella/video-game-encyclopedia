Modeled the assets myself thanks to the awesome low poly tutorial from\u00a0Imphenzia and a big chunk of the game mechanics I was able to pull off thanks to\u00a0DevAddict's comprehensive guides &lt;3.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to survive as long as you can . You start running out of space quicker as more enemies spawn.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Had a lot of fun doing this project modeling the meshes myself and only using free assets from Epic for particle systems and sounds.<br/><br/>Would recommend starting with Drive (C:), as the other levels are harder and were done in the last day so there were some issues and a couple of bugs to fix.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T08:20:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/488/48806f78c9fd3a1c0276b8c3da820060.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rainstory.games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
