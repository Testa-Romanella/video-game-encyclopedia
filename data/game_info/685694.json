I\u00a0kept the Windows and MacOS versions in their original formats, but stripped them down to bare minimum for the WebGL formats. For the full experience, I recommend downloading the executables rather than playing the HTML version.</p><p>Major modifications include a retexturing of the menu, swapping out the in-game music and the introduction of additional game objects.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I repurposed\u00a0 the PickupAnimation script to make the rocks appear to levitate, and even used it on the hovering spaceship at the spaceport in Level1.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the orbiting Space Station, I\u00a0created two scripts: one to move the entire spacecraft forward, and another script used on the two rings, causing them to rotate in opposite directions</p>\n<p>For the toxic plants, I\u00a0added a variety of particle effects, box colliders and damage scripts. Also, I repurposed the EnvironmentDamagedEffect and the\u00a0EnemyKilledEffect, so that the plants appear to break apart when you or the insects shoot them, leaving behind random pickups in their place.</p>\n<p>For the buildings, I\u00a0combined cubes, with free textures from the Unity Asset Store, and props from the custom package provided by MSU. I\u00a0added point lights to the lamps and turned off all the additional lights, keeping the Top-Down Light created in the assignment, and matched the angle to that of the sun provided in the\u00a0 free UnearthlyRed skybox material, found on the Unity Asset Store.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T07:45:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/643/64375f4d4019edfd8406b9981ec294fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 204, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nico80"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
