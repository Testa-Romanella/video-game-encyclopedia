Each player has a tank equipped with the main cannon and one defensive weapon (mines in this version). There is one central ammo station to refill ammo over time and there are 2 - 3 barrel changing stations where the player tank gets a new barrel aka a new weapon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is just a test version or prototype to test the basic gameplay. I am starting to make a multiplayer version of this game where 4 players (maybe up to eight) can fight each other in different game modes, like Deathmatch, Team-Deathmatch, Capture the flag etc.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Update #1\u00a0</p>\n<p>I decided that it is better to make a single player version first. That means different enemies, more maps and various game modes.<br/>Some ideas for the game modes are Survive as long as possible, defend random areas, clear the map etc. I plan on making different kinds of maps that match the game modes.\u00a0I think it is easier for a game like that to be fun in a singleplayer environment rather than in a multiplayer environment. I still plan on making a multiplayer version after that. As soon as I have a playable single player version I am going to upload it to itch io.\u00a0</p><p>Link to the devlog for the single player version.</p>\n\n<p>In this version, two players can fight each other on split-screen and test things out but that's it. There are no Gamemodes, stats or win/ lose conditions. Currently the game has no sound. It is just a sandbox.<br/></p>\n<p>First player can play with Keyboard/ Mouse or Controller and second player has to use a controller.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>If you experience performance issues, disable Tank Trail System in the options menu. Currently, that system is very expensive.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Complete Gameplay Video -&gt;\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d75/d755efac07495b67e9589501a097ce21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Solo Byte Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
