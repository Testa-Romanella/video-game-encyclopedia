However, at this critical moment, the Earth is facing an unprecedented crisis. A group of aliens from distant galaxies, whose goal is to collect resources from within the Sun, will bring incalculable disasters to Earth. Faced with this crisis, governments around the world have abandoned their differences and started working closely together. They organized a special task force consisting of top scientists, engineers, and military personnel from around the world to jointly study countermeasures. At the same time, countries are actively mobilizing resources to prevent them from accessing solar resources. In order to achieve this plan, the team needs to overcome numerous difficulties in a short period of time to complete the manufacturing and deployment of the device. With the joint efforts of governments and people of various countries, they overcame numerous difficulties and finally established outer space bases to fight against aliens. Under the tenacious resistance of humans on Earth, aliens ultimately failed and were forced to evacuate the sun.<br/>\r\nGameplay: In tower defense games, the selection of defense towers must be combined with the bonds between the towers. A single type of defense tower cannot exert its combat power. The game must start from simple mode, and to challenge high difficulty games, there must be enough save cards. There are two types of resources in the game: star iron and star coins. Star coins are mainly used to refresh and select defense towers, while star iron is mainly used to build defense towers and obtain star coins. Reasonable use of resources is necessary to achieve ultimate victory. Starcoin can only build one defense tower at a time, and each defense tower needs to be refreshed. There are three types of refreshes, each of which can refresh defense towers of different qualities. The higher the quality of defense towers, the higher their attributes. It is necessary to combine the constraints between defense towers.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-12T11:42:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4dd/4dda6668fcea341f6466cc3dd5b30e40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hidden dragon\u72ec\u6e38"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["hidden dragon\u72ec\u6e38"], "esrb_rating": null}
