It's been a fun experience, I recommend these type of jams to any developer reading this, especially if hosted by Trijam.</p>\n<p>I would love to hear your comments about the game.</p><p>Controls are really simple: just use the arrows to move the player around the Universe. Try to catch as many stars as possible but be careful to also get some oxygen otherwise Holden is going to die.<br/></p>\n<p>I uploaded the game as downloadable for Windows and Mac because today there seems to be trouble with the WebGL support for browsers like Firefox and Safari.</p>\n<p>I used some free assets for the game, these are the links to all of them (I give them all the credits they deserve) : <br/></p><p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/free-pixel-space-platform-pa...
