Use your board to adjust your aim and the power of your shot, and then you can fire. You have only 60 secondes to manage to hit it, so be sure to aim well and to avoid those birds!</p>\n<p>But be cautious, your cannon is very sensible to weather, so open your shutter only once you are ready to fire, or it will overheat or the power will be soaked! Also alimenting the board with a battery wasn't such a cleaver idea, and maybe wou will have to change it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was our first attempt to the TriJam and we must admit that we didn't manage to respect the 3 hours time limit at all. We aimed probably too big even if we thought would be ok in such a short time. As a result, only the sound designer made it in three hours, the graphic designer woked for 4 hours and a half, and the programmer and myself probably worked around something like six hours both. So yeah, we did a lot of overtime, but even so, we hope that you will like our little game at least as much as we do!</p>\n\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Programmer - Jules Marty\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sound Designer - Pierrick\u00a0Veillerobe\u00a0https://twitter.com/VeillerobePrrck</p>\n<p>Graphic Designer - Tanguy-Tanguy\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/tanguy___tanguy/</p>\n<p>Game Design and additional programmation - Paul\u00a0Mozet <strong>https://twitter.com/MrPouletBZH</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T02:58:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/427/427f6e47ede3b42e1f888990a5b30c5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["MrPouletBZH", "TenthDalek", "tanguy-tanguy", "CameronMeduse"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
