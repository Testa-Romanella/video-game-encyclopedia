Obstacles, mishaps and even other desperate families will make bringing back enough precious water to keep their village alive a difficult task.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game was made by a team of two students from Norwich University of the Arts; Callum Horton and Jonathan Marshall. We received mentorship from the lovely Tiffany Wild who really helped us to cement our idea in place and kept us on track through the course of the 48 hour jam. We'd like to extend a massive thank you to her, and for Ukie Students for hosting and organising the jam. It was an awesome experience!</p>\n<p>All code and assets used in the game was the original work of myself and callum, with models produced using Kenshape and Autodesk Maya.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sounds are all sourced from freesound.org and then mixed by our team.
