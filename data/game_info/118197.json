That game, where time moves when you move. You should know it. [It is here!] Our game is also better, because it is free! And we like it so much, so we don't want any money!<br/><br/>You play as handsome man called Hero, who infiltrates the mighty factory of Big Boss. You chase him, you kill him, you are the winner, ordinary job of every hero. Or is it not like that...??? Better story then Hollywood can produce. Don't argue.<br/><br/>Controls? I am sorry, we developed such a great in-game tutorial. You just need mouse and keyboard, which you should have, if you got here.<br/><br/>If you are interested in seeing some more of my games, you can visit my [Facebook page], my [YouTube channel], my [Twitter account] or my [Instagram], where I regularly post pictures from either my games or from my life.<br/><br/>Also check out work of this guy. He was working on it with me! I stole his precious time, I am a beast! You can visit his [Facebook page], [Instagram] and his [Youtube channel]. By the way, he is open for any collaboration with any developers, so if you like his work in this piece of... well... yeah (he was doing cutscenes!), you can contact him wherever you want to.<br/><br/>Music in this is an old work of a guy, who call himself Jaded Prysmo. Here is his [Soundcloud], if you want to listen more of these cheese peazy electronic badass hardcore fast house-like whatever bananas stuff.
