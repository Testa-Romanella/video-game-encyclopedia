{"id": 46859, "slug": "hexaplunge-2", "name": "HexaPlunge 2", "name_original": "HexaPlunge 2", "description": "HexaPlunge 2 is a logical puzzle game based on shapes and physics. The deal is this - there is a hexagon shape placed on a pile of other shapes. Those other shapes are stocked into a pillar and you can remove any of them by clicking on it. Your goal is to get the hexagon to the ground platform. However, as you remove other shapes there is a high chance the pillar will collapse and cause you to fail the level. This is why you need to be careful and smart and think twice before removing a certain shape.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/596/596b7109652617f47f829dd81d44c9fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anteater Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Silicon Echo"], "esrb_rating": null}
