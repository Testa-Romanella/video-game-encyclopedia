Things do not go as planned. Because the Old Man screwed up. Badly.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>The Old Man has unfortunately not yet implemented customizable controls. The Captain is stuck with these:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD: Movement</li><li>Left Mouse: Shoot Primary Weapon/Next Dialogue</li><li>Right Mouse: Shoot Secondary Weapon/Skip Dialogue</li></ul>\n<p><strong>The Old Man's Screw-up<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Erika was taken apart and put back together in the Old Man's misguided attempt to overhaul and improve everything about her. A lot of her old functionalities have been broken as a result.<ul><li>Erika's jukebox is broken. She doesn't have her old sound effects and music playing abilities.</li></ul><ul><li>Erika only has two weapon modules installed. But at least you can fire both without switching modules.</li><li>Erika currently cannot be upgraded</li></ul></li><li>It would be irresponsible to let you go out space pirating with your ship in this condition. You are currently not allowed to leave the test flight area.</li><li>Seriously, I screwed up. Go play Episode Zero instead to actually have fun. This demo is only being released for my own vanity of making me feel like I'm making progress.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T03:55:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e57/e579f262055a822fd07b169714ac53a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Jack Anderson"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
