Ah the glory of working alone.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>\n<p>Your goal is to reach maximum connectivity, to do this you will need to load \"Packets\" into the Connection Point (this is the machine that you start next to).</p>\n<p>Use the Extractor next to raw resources (Energy, Signal, Memory).<br/>Convey\u00a0these resources to refineries, crafting items so you can build Constructors.<br/>The Constructor can\u00a0create the items needed for the Packer.<br/>The Packer\u00a0creates those desired \"Packets\" for the Connection Point :).</p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong>\u00a0When placing conveyors, best practice is to make them at least 2 tiles long, they can work as 1 tile - but sometime get confused about what they should be connecting to, and even using the\u00a0R for reverse will not connect them properly. Demolishing and placing new belts is always the answer :).</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Keys:</strong><br/><em>WASD </em>- Movement<br/><em>Escape </em>- Pause game, and show volume options<br/><em>E</em> - Toggle Player Inventory<br/><em>B</em> - Toggle Build Mode<br/>(While in build mode: <em>SPACE </em>will toggle between <em>BUILD </em>and <em>DEMOLISH</em>, or click the buttons in the UI)<br/><em>R</em> - While hovering over conveyor belts will attempt to reverse them, not all machines accept input from belts! (Extractor for example)<br/>Clicking on a machine will open its UI/Dialog (Crafting Recipes for Refineries/etc, Inventory for Extractor/etc).<br/>Clicking on a conveyor belt will grab the item from it, placing it in your player inventory.<br/>The build menu can be scrolled with the scroll wheel, or grabbed and moved (emulated touch).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T15:15:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f74/f74c9ca3f70c70d330a1bb4074a66cb8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Magnanix"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
