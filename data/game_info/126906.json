The story would follow a crew of rebels fighting back against an intergalactic government mega corporation that dictates how everyone in the known universe should live their lives, and destroying home planets for the resources with no consideration for the preservation of species or even where people live.</p>\n<p><strong>--DETAILS--</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This demo was created in about 12 weeks by myself, including the design documentation, concept art, 3D modelling, Animation, and programming.</p>\n<p>Although the scope of the final game is planned for, this project is only a short prototype level with simplified mechanics.</p>\n<p><strong>--WEIRD STUFF--</strong></p>\n<p>If you press F a few times you can change between windowed, 1920x1080, and 1920x1200. A bit weird but it's all I needed to showcase it in uni. if you have a different resolution then I'm sorry *sad face*.</p>\n<p>Also, a controller is sort of required because I forgot to map a key to get you out of the launch screen on keyboard.</p>\n<p><strong>--</strong><strong>FUTURE--</strong></p>\n<p>I would like to make this into a full game in the future and there will be a kickstarted page that I will link to when it is up if you would like to fund it. Frii's Echo will have a full combat system with a wide variety of characters and customisable weapons. The main story of the final product will have you taking the role of Frii, someone who the intergalactic government mega corporation shut away on a remote prison planet because she learned of things that they didn't want getting out.</p>\n<p>The final game would have a main story that can be played alone or with 2 players locally, and a unique multiplayer story for up to 4 players locally or online from a selection of 8 unique characters.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I hope you enjoy the game. Constructive critique is always helpful so let me know what you think, I'll leave the music composer's link down below.</p>\n\n<p>Studio Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/WorkingOnTitle/?ref=aymt_...</p>\n<p>Music person: https://soundcloud.com/d-eastes</p>\n\n<p><strong>--UPDATES--</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Pre-Alpha - </strong></p>\n<p>First version on itch.io</p>\n\n<p><strong>Alpha 1 - </strong></p>\n<p>Started rebuilding the systems from the ground up, basic movement is implemented, but no combat. </p>\n<p>The layout for the demo level has been planned and blocked out. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ae/1aef9fef84751a65f5bc0f9abc8e43bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["scarwoo"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
