When I started I set myself the goal of participating in Ludum\u00a0Dare 49 and finishing a game in 72 hours. I wasn't sure if I'd be able to do it with just one month experience but here we are!<br/><br/>This is Tip-See-Saw, a simple weight balancing game. You play as Tipsy The Forklift. Your goal is to pickup and move the falling boxes to different points on the see saw to balance weight and prevent yourself from falling off, while collecting any spare parts that appear.<br/><br/>You can move with A and D or the left and right arrow keys, pickup boxes with E and drop them with Q. See how long you can survive and how many spare parts you can gather!<br/><br/>Up until now I have been primarily focused on the coding side of game dev, but this game was entirely developed by me, including the scuffed artistic assets and sound. It was a great way of seeing what goes into those sides of game dev, and I'm proud to have finished. Thanks for checking it out!<br/><br/>Tools used:<br/><br/>Sound effects: sfxr.me<br/>Music: beepbox.co<br/>Art: Aseprite<br/>Engine: Unity</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T15:43:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8aa/8aa9f7a882c09e975ba6e25eda29a246.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MickyHC"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
