{"id": 151434, "slug": "bitpath", "name": "BitPath", "name_original": "BitPath", "description": "<p>Introducing <strong>BitPath</strong>, a game in which players must strategically swap tiles to create a checker board pattern as quickly as possible, while only viewing one pixel at a time.</p><p>This game was designed to have as little player feedback as possible - this means no audio, animations, and only one color visible during gameplay. For clarity, outside of gameplay the user has access to the menu, options, and their final score.</p><p><strong>How to play:</strong><br/></p><ul><li>After clicking the launch button, there will be a quick grace period to remind you of the size of the board you are playing on. </li><li>Once the text disappears, the timer starts and controls are enabled. </li><li>Use the arrow keys to navigate around the grid, and the space bar to select a tile for swapping. On the second space bar click, the two selected tiles will swap positions.</li><li>Beat the game by successfully swapping tiles until the grid is in a checkerboard pattern of alternating colors, in both the X and Y directions.</li></ul><p><strong>Controls:</strong></p><ul><li>Arrow keys: navigate around the grid</li><li>Spacebar: Select tile/swap tiles</li><li>Escape: Return to main menu/exit program</li></ul><p><strong>Tips:</strong></p><ul><li>There are no restrictions against already solved boards - luck is part of the game! If you have a solved board, hit space twice to swap a tile with itself and win.</li><li>Navigate the board in an organized fashion to keep track of which pieces are solved.</li><li>Keep a mental map of which rows/columns you have solved and where you've swapped bad pieces to avoid backtracking</li><li>There are no notifications if you try to move outside of the grid; you will simply not move. Keep track of your current position in respect to the walls of the grid - You always spawn in the very top-left position of the grid.</li></ul><p><strong>Coming soon:</strong><br/></p><ul><li>Optional audio</li><li>Time records</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/976/9764d13f7f8cc0e752c2c1927110b62e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PimpedKoala"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
