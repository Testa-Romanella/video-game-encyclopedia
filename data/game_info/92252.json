You only have a limited amount of yarn to roll around with, so you must find rewind points along the way to wind back up and keep going. You can also find extra bits of yarn that can extend your reach! You never know what awaits you!<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>CONTROLS</strong>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Arrow keys: </strong>Move<br/>\n<strong>Select:</strong> Restart a level\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tYou can roll back up by touching a ball winder or by backtracking your steps. You cannot roll over previously laid yarn (i.e. cross your own path).\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tGoals and winders are only activated if touched using your last piece of yarn. You can see how much yarn you have left on the bottom of the screen.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe number on the bottom right of the screen is the level number. There are 23 levels total.
