Also, do not forget about your Rumba(s), they can help!<br/><br/>Since this was created for the <strong>Bullet Hell Jam 2022</strong>, you <em>will</em> find bugs and issues, but feedback would be greatly appreciated since this ended up being a prototype with ideas that can be developed further, for a -maybe- fully fleshed game.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to thank\u00a0<strong>Jim Papanick</strong>\u00a0for creating music and SFX in such a short notice! Great lad! Check out his work!<br/><br/>Huge props to the amazing\u00a0<strong>Top Down Engine</strong>, which really helped me get the basic functionality up and running\u00a0<em>fast</em>. Amazing Unity Asset, I recommend it without a second thought.<br/><br/>Thank you for playing, and please feel free to comment and give me feedback!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T07:36:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/354/354cbbe9e1326a8cf565944750810e18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nzam"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
