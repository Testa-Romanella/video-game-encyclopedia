The mood we want to capture in Zombie Playground is the feeling that you had as a child when you were completely immersed in your imagination fighting monsters and doing things you thought were cool from your favorite movies, comics, and video games. <br/><br/>Stealth Studios Inc. has worked long and hard to create a game that delivers on the promise of our original vision. Zombie Playground\u2122 is made with the brains, disease, and puke of all involved - that means heart! We've put everything we have into this development, and we intend to put a lot more.<br/><br/>Gameplay in Zombie Playground is a hybrid of third person shooter and action RPG mechanics set in a cooperative zombie survival horror arena. This translates simply to \"A fun romp solo or with friends.\"<br/><br/><strong>Key Features - What Me Worry??</strong><br/> <strong>Arena Style Map</strong>: Classroom Building Arena Map comprised of a Courtyard, a Main Entrance, and areas for Language Arts, Biology, Computer Science, and Music. <br/><br/> <strong>Multiple Enemy Types + BOSS FIGHT!</strong> Normal, +Elite, and even a Big Bad Boss! From crouched zombies, to vicious adult zombies, to the dreaded mopper of the halls... Buckethead, the Janitor! Can you topple this giant flesh bag and live to tell the tale? (If not, try with some friends!)<br/><br/> <strong>2 Playable Classes</strong>: '<strong>Bully</strong>' is your damage dealing, tanky type class, where '<strong>Rascal</strong>' is akin to an agility, or glass cannon, class. Both have their own stats and abilities: Bully-Bomb, Bully-Buff, Rascal-Can't Touch This, and Rascal-Speed Demon.<br/><br/> <strong>2 Playable Weapon Styles</strong>: Each class has both full melee and ranged combat capabilities, complete with combos and finishers. Why sacrifice one for the other when you can have both!?<br/><br/> <strong>17 Unique Weapon Choices</strong> (currently) to choose from: a variety of melee and ranged weapons. (And more in the pipeline!)<br/><br/> <strong>10 Missions</strong>: Do you have what it takes to discover the source of the contagion?<br/><br/> <strong>Tons of Gear!</strong>: We have over 200 different aesthetic assets in the game at present, and more are coming!<br/><br/> <strong>Up to 4 Player CO-OP Networking</strong> is a go! But sometimes, this function is more than 'one click' away. Should you encounter any issues, please check our forums on our main site.<br/><br/> <strong>Original Soundtrack by the Amazing Shawn Lee</strong> made specifically for Zombie Playground. Hot!! We were lucky enough to collaborate with Shawn in order to bring some sweet funky beats, crossed with an 80's style retro feel, to Zombie Playground. Some of Shawn's other credits include Bully, Tales from the Borderlands, and Sleeping Dogs.<br/><br/> <strong>Keyboard (or Controller) Breakdown</strong>: Be sure to check out the keyboard commands refresher, it will help you understand how to play the game better, complete with detailed descriptions of combos, finishers, and abilities.
