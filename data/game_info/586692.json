The goal of each level is to use all crates to cover all targets. You can use spikes to help you. Spikes can be pushed or pulled, and will push or pull things in front of or behind them. Meanwhile, without a spike, you can only push crates (either yourself or with other crates). Crates and spikes can go over holes, but you can't - but you can make one final push against something over a hole!</p>\n<p>Please feel free to leave a comment! This is a part of a personal challenge to make a simple puzzle game every day for a week, with at least 10 levels. I'm using puzzlescript for each game.\u00a0This is game three.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T06:25:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28c/28cd1aa16e16effb8e3a3fa21a6bebfe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["oeschmid"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
