You are on the Almost top floor of a fancy hotel\u00a0and fighting the last of them. You shoot the Slime and when it dies\u00a0it drops an item. Randomly you get a Doughnut or a Energy Package. You can carry how many you like. When you are at the Power Station(started with a red 0 on top) you can throw the Energy packages on the Power Station do load it up to 100. You get 10 in energy for each package. When the power Station is 100 you activate the lift to take you to the sky floor. And when you do that. you win the game. good luck</p><p>Keyboard</p><p>Left and right keys to move</p><p>Up key to shoot</p><p>Down key to throw what you have in the packpack</p><p>Spacebar to Jump or Double Jump</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T06:20:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba2/ba26947e7f518a298b6934d964f40f23.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kaktusbear"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
