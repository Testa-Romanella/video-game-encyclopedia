{"id": 452564, "slug": "mollusc-camp-demo", "name": "Mollusc Camp (Demo)", "name_original": "Mollusc Camp (Demo)", "description": "<p>This is a DEMO VERSION of Mollusc Camp, a video game tentatively set to be released late this summer. The full game allows the player to experience the last day of summer camp at a camp for adolescent molluscs. This demo version allows the player to play up to the first half of that day. All camp activities after lunch are only available in the full game. This is a very early, unpolished, unfinished release, set loose because I needed a deadline to motivate more work on it.</p>\n<p>This is the second version of the demo, and the first to be more publicly available. Many of the issues from v0.0.1 are gone, a few smaller ones remain. The game should be largely functional all the way through with no soft-locks, but I could've missed something; I haven't tested thoroughly.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-08T05:47:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/299/2991442c72b42a5a118627633342c437.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["1try"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
