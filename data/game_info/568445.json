And can we make this a little harder? :-)</p>\n<p><strong>Failtris starts very simple, but gets much harder at the end. </strong>Beat level 10 to win the game.</p>\n\n<p>The mechanics have an inner logic, where shapes with missing tiles are still shapes that can only fall down together (not like candy crush). There is also no chain reaction (again not like candy crush). Therefore higher columns than currently allowed and tiles in the air can exist and are not bugs, but certainly a different mechanics might be even more fun (like candy crush ;-)).<br/></p>\n<p>Here is a video of the gameplay:</p>\n\n<p>KNOWN ISSUES: There was a bug where sometimes the game just stopped instead of spawning the next tile or proceed to the next level. It should be fixed, please let me know if you still encounter it (or other bugs). Please use the BUGFIX version if you play the download versions.<br/></p>\n<p>Submission for the Wowie Jam 3.0.</p>\n<p>Theme: Failure is Progress.</p>\n<p>My first published game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T14:01:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b75/b75eb9944f874d19204bc9ac38664cbb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Kai Eckert"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
