Cover all the goals in a level with a box by moving your character a pushing the boxes. Can you optimise your moves across all 6 levels to get the expert rank?</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p><strong>Arrow Keys/WASD</strong> to move and push boxes<br/></p>\n<p><strong>R</strong> to restart a level</p>\n<p><strong>Enter/Space</strong> to progress to the next level once complete</p>\n\n<p>Mentions:</p>\n<p>This is my first solo project. I've minimised the scope to ensure I focus on completing games in the future, not just start them! Incredibly happy to hear your feedback in the comments.</p>\n<p>A HUGE thank you to Emilio who provided a fantastic tutorial covering the basics mechanics of this game - I have taken his code and made a fully functioning demo!</p>\n<p>Assets:</p>\n<p>https://kenney.nl/assets/bit-pack<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T07:36:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8f/c8f609c1b8c500ca9005274e119b84d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HaydnTheGreat"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
