Your goal is to beat an escape room, but clues that you find in one game are crucial to solve riddles in another. Both games are joined together with clues and you can't finish one without another.<br/></p>\n<p>All assets were created by the two of us during gamejam.</p>\n<p>We hope that you will enjoy our little\u00a0experiment, as much as we\u00a0were enjoying making it.
