Moreover, fighters of a given class specialize in the use of only two weapons and their related techniques. The knight is your all-round balanced warrior, the dwarf a martial artist with great defense, the lionman an unstoppable force of nature, and the list goes on with eight carefully diversified unit types, each with their own strategic role in battle. <br/><br/>Weapons <br/>There are many different weapon types: swords, bows, axes, knives, and all have their characteristic attack patterns and allow the execution of specific techniques. Hammers can be used to break your opponents armors, knives thrown to inflict status ailments, while hand combat is good to move targets and open paths through your enemy's defense line. <br/><br/>Magic <br/>All magic skills belong to some element, and different elements include skills that are quite different among themselves expecially in terms of range and area of effect. <br/>To give you some examples, Water skills are able to hit multiple targets in wide patterns, and they can target only positions lower than the caster; Earth skills always affect the positions around the caster; Lightning skills can only strike single targets and have no height limitation; Wind skills target multiple positions and have the highest range. <br/>In addition, some elemental skills may cause some status ailments, like Ice skills that induce Paralysis, or Lightning that induce Darkness. <br/>On top of that, different characters have higher or lower affinity with each element, making them more or less vulnerable and able to deal more or less damage. <br/><br/>Character customization <br/>You can develop your characters by learning new skills and balancing their battle stats to suit your strategy. <br/><br/>Game customization <br/>Build your own maps with the in-game map editor. <br/><br/>Credits<br/>Charlie Fleed - author, developer <br/><br/>Lane Brown - 2D environment artist <br/>Douglas Draco - character concept artist <br/>Abdallah Nabil - 3D modeler <br/>Agnes Swart - 3D animator <br/>Matthew Weekes - level designer<br/>Carl Zeno Manalo - UI artist <br/>Carolina Garcia - 2D environment artist <br/>Julia Levadik - 2D environment artist <br/>Valera Malov - 2D environment artist <br/>Nick Resa - 3D animator <br/>Carmen A.
