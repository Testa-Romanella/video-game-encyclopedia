{"id": 842749, "slug": "combine-harvester", "name": "Combine Harvester", "name_original": "Combine Harvester", "description": "<p>Oh no! Your harvest is about to be collected, <em>and you completely forgot to harvest.</em></p>\n<p>Time to jump in your combine and get to work!</p>\n<p>Combines, as everyone knows, aren't exactly built for speed. Normally one of your farm hands would be driving a truck to handle the actual \"to-and-from-the-drop-off-point\" business, but they called in sick. Fortunately you're an eccentric type and ordered a remote control system for the truck. Time to put it to good use, you'll have to drive both vehicles if you want to get this field harvested in the next two and a half minutes!</p>\n<p>You'll have to deliver as much -\u00a0corn? wheat? who even knows what these yellow cubes are supposed to represent? not me - to the drop zone\u00a0as possible before the time runs out.\u00a0</p>\r\nHow to play:\r\n<p>The first step is to ignore the missing art. You must accept that the small red cube is in fact a truck. The other, larger, also-kind-of-red cube is the drop-off zone.</p>\n<p>Drive your harvester (WASD) over crops to harvest them.\u00a0Keep an eye on your capacity!\u00a0Any crops harvested when the harvester is full will be lost.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The truck\u00a0(arrow keys) is faster than the harvester and has more capacity, but can't harvest anything. When the vehicles are close, crops will automatically be transferred from the harvester to the truck.\u00a0Crops driven over by the truck will be squashed and ruined,\u00a0making them impossible to harvest.</p>\n<p>Score points by delivering crops to the drop off zone and delivering them (space, when within the drop off zone).</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>WASD: harvester movement</p>\n<p>arrow keys: truck movement</p>\n<p>space: deliver harvested crops from any vehicle inside the drop zone</p>\r\nWhere to play:\r\n<p>Ideally, download one of the files linked above. Linux version is untested as I don't have a Linux system, but it should work. There is also a web version, but it's horribly unoptimised.</p>Credits:<p>Programming:\u00a0Cunning Hound</p><p>\"Art\"*:\u00a0Cunning Hound</p><p>Font: Abel Regular by Matthew Desmond, used under SIL Open Font License</p><p>Sound:\u00a0what sound?</p><p>*the term \"Art\" is used loosely</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T07:10:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/117/1175f931386f37154e0d5cc89f3e3a77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Cunning Hound"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
