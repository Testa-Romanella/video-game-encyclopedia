It is a time of fanatical religious fervor. The Sacred Office, a powerful organization leading an Inquisition against heresy, purges the sinners who threaten humanity. Those responsible for conducting a mysterious ceremony that contradicts the rules of the Church are labeled \u201cwitches.\u201d\r\nSet forth with Sisters Semilla and Fran, missionaries in the Church\u2019s service, on their journey to thwart the witches\u2019 ceremony and protect the common-folk from heresy that endangers the status quo.\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>A powerful fantasy story inspired by the history of medieval Europe</li><li>A unique visual aesthetic combining hand-painted 2D art with cel-shading</li><li>Fluid controls encouraging careful engagement and patient play</li><li>Offensive combat enabling players to crush enemies with a mix of swordplay and spells</li><li>Defensive options including dodge-rolls and parries</li><li>A leveling system that helps players adjust their character to their desired difficulty</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\nHello there! I\u2019m rdein, the creator and director of\u00a0<em>Minoria</em>.\r\nFirst of all, I\u2019d like to share my excitement in announcing this project. This is a universe I care a lot for, from the setting to the characters, and it\u2019s been a lot of fun to explore and develop its concepts during the process of game development.\r\nFor the first time in many years, I started a game project set in a new universe. It felt like a breath of fresh air for me. With that said,\u00a0<em>Minoria</em>\u00a0does contain some similarities with my previous projects (especially Momodora\u2019s latest installment, Reverie Under the Moonlight).\r\nI am proud of what we\u2019ve been making for\u00a0<em>Minoria</em>, and I hope you will enjoy the story and characters I\u2019ve prepared this time around!\r\n\r\nHowdy folks, Dan here from Dangen Entertainment. It\u2019s been hard patiently waiting for the announcement of\u00a0<em>Minoria</em>, knowing what an amazing game it\u2019s going to be. It combines everything I love about the Momodora games with stronger emphasis on a solemn story. I love how Bombservice is approaching the visuals this time around too--it\u2019s a unique take that looks beautiful and shows another evolutionary step in the team\u2019s development experience, just as previous titles have.\u00a0\r\nThis game is extraordinary. A must-play if you\u2019ve got an appetite for action-platformers like I do.\r\n</p>\n\n\n<p>MINORIA OFFICIAL SOUNDTRACK</p>\n<p>MINORIA, Side NUN: Original Soundtrack\u00a0<br/>1 Reminiscence<br/>2 Ramezia, 1203<br/>3 Divine Mission ~ St. Hildreth's Cathedral<br/>4 Pursuit<br/>5 Augur<br/>6 Blossoming Witch<br/>7 Fragile Retreat Prelude ~ Princess Amelia<br/>8 Fragile Retreat ~ The Library<br/>9 Fire to Flowers<br/>10 Witch of Ranillia ~ Decisive Battle<br/>11 Witch of Ranillia ~ On the Brink of Death<br/>12 Witch of Ranillia ~ Devoir<br/>13 Arbor Prelude ~ Castle Outskirts<br/>14 Arbor ~ Snakeroot Garden<br/>15 A Chance Encounter<br/>16 This Heavy Cross<br/>17 Fran<br/>18 Halls of Absolution ~ Mercy Cellar<br/>19 A Betrayal<br/>20 Despair, Darling.<br/>21 Ceremony ~ St. Hildreth's Cathedral<br/>22 Lair of Witchcraft ~ Royal Castle of Ramezia<br/>23 Ink and Blood<br/>24 Minoria ~ Ceremonial Forest<br/>25 Auto-de-F\u00e9 I<br/>26 Auto-de-F\u00e9 II<br/>27 Auto-de-F\u00e9 III<br/>28 Dance in the Dark</p>\n<p>MINORIA, Side WITCH: Extras\u00a0<br/>1 Defeat<br/>2 Trailer Theme I<br/>3 Trailer Theme II<br/>4 Divine Mission (Alternate Version)<br/>5 Augur (Extended Version)<br/>6 This Heavy Cross (Alternate Version)<br/>7 Fran (Alternate Version)<br/>8 Minoria (Alternate Version)<br/>9 Best Foot Forward (Unused Track)<br/>10 Errant Lullabye (Unused Track)<br/>11 Sister (Unused Track)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-30T04:50:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91c/91c725a96165d07290999fba30913151.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 341, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dangen Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
