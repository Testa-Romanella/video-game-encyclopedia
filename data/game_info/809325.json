{"id": 809325, "slug": "project-moonlight-superboss-test", "name": "Project Moonlight - Superboss Test", "name_original": "Project Moonlight - Superboss Test", "description": "<p>A test release for a late-game boss fight in Project Moonlight. Contains spoilers.</p>\n<p>Comes with a screen to tweak the difficulty to your liking, including setting up HP, offense (damage) and defense. Defaulted to be rather difficult.</p>\n<p>Use the sliderbars to set them up. You can even give yourself 1 HP or 999 offense, go nuts!</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS<br/></strong></p>\n<p>WASD - move (you can aim up and down, though down is limited)<br/></p>\n<p>Hold J - Fire, automatic (except with fireworks)</p>\n<p>Q/E - swap spells (NOTE: if you swap to off-bound spells (like pressing Q on the first spell) you won't be able to fire anything!)<br/></p>\n<p>Space - Jump (equipped with double jump here)</p>\n<p>Shift - dash (disable the \"sticky key\" keybind\u00a0for better results)<br/></p><p>U - Activates a special mode that makes your attacks faster, and essentially more powerful. Only useable when the SP bar is full!</p>\n<p><strong>BATTLE TIPS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>See the shields above the boss bar? Certain attacks (hint: they're bright) will deplete it, helping you to deal more damage to the boss. The lower the shields, the more damage you'll do. You don't wanna stay hours doing 1 damage. The shields have a little trick if you know how to mess with them!</p><p>If you look at the top of the arena you'll find some crystal hearts. Destroy them during life emergencies to regain some HP!</p>\n<p>Fireworks are your best friend here. You can rocketjump with them, and reach higher than normal jumping. They'll deal massive damage to the boss when the shields are lowered.</p>\n<p>You can use dashes upwards and downwards to dodge better. You can only recharge them if you're on the ground!</p>\n<p>There is a hidden fourth weapon after the fireworks. Use E to swap to it. This is very effective to deplete the shield points of the boss, however, it is not automatic (you'll need to press J several times to attack with it)</p>\n<p>Don't confuse the boss' shield points with the shadow shield! The shadow shield is summoned sometimes mid-fight, and it takes lots of hits to destroy it. Wanna make the process faster? Use the fireworks and the shield will blow up like no tomorrow.</p>\n<p><strong>SPECIAL CREDITS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Placeholder Music used:\u00a0</p>\n<p>disclaimer: there's no intent with copyright issues, i just love this song<br/></p>\n\n<p>Thanks to all who supported me on this rather hellish but rewarding journey!</p>\n<p>Join my server to obtain news on development:\u00a0https://discord.gg/ycyfbqgcYE</p>\n<p>Donate to my patreon:\u00a0https://www.patreon.com/teamPM?fan_landing=true</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T07:55:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d1/6d1bfea3a67c598438c305e15b539f2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Taiki"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
