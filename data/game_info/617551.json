When you have made it to the actual Game, you can move the blue soul with\u00a0WASD and the red soul with the Arrow Keys.</p>\n<p>As you might have noticed, the two souls are bound together. Every few seconds, this connection pulls the Souls together. When the Souls are being dragged, you have to avoid hitting the lit areas on the ground, so position yourselves carefully!\u00a0If one of the souls hits one of these areas in the drag phase, it loses one of its four soul lives. If one soul loses its last soul live, the game is over.</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you</strong></p>\n<p>This game was made by 2 students from germany\u00a0with little experience in Unity. This was our first Game Jam. We'd love if you'd to check out our Project</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T07:05:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/608/6083c510c15b01a49fc1d51e970c3556.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mensch2134"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
