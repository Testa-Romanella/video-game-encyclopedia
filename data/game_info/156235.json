The sequel to the frantic curtain-fire shooter-where-you-can't-shoot, Torso Ninja, Torso Ninja II pits you against three levels of insane action! Torso Ninja himself returns (sans arms, of course) and you must guide him safely through waves of bullets and enemies! No more random patterns with easy workarounds - each level in Torso Ninja II has been painstakingly designed to offer a tremendous (but beatable) challenge! Dodge shuriken, collect pickups, use life-saving smoke bombs, and do whatever it takes to survive the waves of enemies and rack up a high score! But keep a look out - these hostile red ninjas have a new, dangerous leader, and he has it in for our intrepid, armless shinobi...</p>\n<p>Torso Ninja II is my 6th game as part of #1GAM, and the first sequel I have ever made. To all the fans of the original, I hope you enjoy this revisit, and to any new players, watch out!
