This first demo explores the beginning of the game and the player can try a lot of features. <strong>Action combat, stealth system and a glimpse of the main campaign</strong> from the first game made by the Italian indie team Linked Rooms Games!</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><em>Life in New Wells has been destroyed by a catastrophic event: something transformed the citizens into violent monsters without control, fierce cannibals devouring each other. Along with a destroyed society, New Wells is now more similar to Hell itself where human life has no more value. Two people are still alive thanks to lucky circumstances and personal skills: Seph Garrett and Hellen Bates are united and divided at the same time. He is an undercover cop, she is a well-known criminal: they are natural enemies, but now they need to cooperate to save their lives. The city is now a deadly labyrinth and death is around the corner.</em></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<ul><li>Hybrid mechanincs stealth/RPG/action</li><li>Dark and modern setting</li><li>Old school pixel graphics with high quality</li><li>Beautiful artworks</li><li>Competitive difficulty for expert players</li><li>For PC and other upcoming platforms</li></ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>Team Linked Rooms</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Marco \"Ally\" Camedda</strong> - <em>Mapping, Eventing, Scripting, Art director, Game Design</em></li><li><strong>Simone \"Macbeth\" Granata</strong> - <em>Mapping, Storywriting and Game Design</em></li><li><strong>Davide \"Mishima\" Isimbaldi</strong> - <em>Character design,\u00a0Additional pixel art</em></li><li><strong>Anthony \"Chaucer\" Padilla</strong> - <em>Core scripting</em></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:26:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c55/c55428f4d82dd5a4c83dc4d1e716b9fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 397, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Linked Rooms Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
