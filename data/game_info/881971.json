Unfortunately for Mai Foreman, the protagonist of this small game, the amount of time in question is a mere twenty seconds. Will that be enough time to get a meal's worth of food down her gullet? That depends on your finger speed!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The idea for this game came about when I realized how fun it was to press a repeating sequence of buttons as fast as possible. At least I find it to be fun. Hopefully you do as well, since that's all this game is: pressing down, up, down again, and right in that order as many times as you can in twenty seconds. Even if you don't, I still hope you enjoy this little project! And either way, thanks for playing! <br/></p>\n<p>This game was a submission to the 20 Second Game Jam, a jam entirely comprised of games that last only 20 seconds. Trying to come up with a concept for a game that could be fully explained and still entertaining in such a short time span was quite the fun challenge! Speaking of challenge, the highest score I was able to get was 60, but I'm sure people with faster fingers than I could do better! If you happen to be one of those people, please post your score in the comments!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T14:27:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e7/6e7bddee9309c470881c341a553ea6ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Phil Johnson"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
