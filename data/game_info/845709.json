Get the cubes! Simple, right? \ud83d\ude0a<br/></p>\n\n<ul><li>24 <em>Hand-crafted</em> levels</li><li>Realistic-ish ball bounce physics</li><li>Simple controls\u00a0<em>(mouse and space bar)<br/></em></li><li>Casual gameplay</li><li>Minimalist design</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>Like so many starting out in the wonderful world of game design, I had this wonderful idea for a game! A huge simulated open-world that would make Los Santos feel like a walking simulator. I should've listened to the voice in my head telling my to stope myself before I overscope myself \ud83d\ude22. But you live and you learn. <br/></p>\n<p>So you go back to the basics. You create\u00a0<em>Pong </em>or <em>Brickbreaker </em>- but you don't clone it. Nah, you've got way too much creativity to just make <em>Pong</em> and put it out there like that. Nope, you've got to make this puzzle-platformer thing where you bounce a ball around and make it traverse through levels, stick to simple shapes so you don't have to be a chadgod in Blender, add in an easter egg or two, lay a music loop behind it all. Boom. Maybe now I can get started on my open-world multiplayer procedural-generated masterpiece.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T16:36:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c8/3c80779acdbe702ed211158953bd15b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Control Shift Escape"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
