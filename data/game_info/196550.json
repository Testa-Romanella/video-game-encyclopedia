This was my second Ludum Dare, and the second time I worked on the project solo. Overall I'm really happy with what I got done, even though I found out a platformer with rotation doesn't lead to as many fun mechanics as I would have hoped. I hope everyone had a great weekend and thank you so much for taking the time to play!</p><p>CHANGELOG 4/25/17:</p><p>- Updated some platforms that could potentially cause the player to fall into a planet</p><p>- Fixed Boss move AI, move counter issues and rng could make the encounter last longer than it should</p><p>- Updated Boss Swipe Move speed from 25 to 20. Initial speed was too fast according to some early playtesters</p><p>- Fixed issue with end credits not being displayed... Would you believe this was an issue with my player prefab not having it's collider set to is_trigger.....</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69a/69ad02a262fa3888d62443794daebf7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["titomakanijr"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
