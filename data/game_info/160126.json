FULLSCREEN is recommended for the best experience!</p>\n<p>Based on an old real-time strategy game that I tried to make in my sophomore year of high school. All of the sprites are reused from that project.</p>\n<p>This resurrected version is a top-down space shooter with an emphasis on physics, collisions, and satisfying explosions. I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>Please give me as much feedback as you want. Every critique is appreciated :)</p>\n<p>This game is in progress. I'll be adding more features over time, including new ships, weapons, and game modes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cc/9cc8aa3ba412d9aca5db7a70f53b7ec1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SquareCircle"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
