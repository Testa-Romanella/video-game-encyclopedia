There are three types of cards: Qigong, lightness skill and internal skill. They also have five different attributes: gold, wood, water, fire and earth. They restrain each other. Making good use of these characteristics can achieve unexpected results in combat.<h3> transaction </h3><br/>Trade with other heroes, exchange your cards for basic resources, or exchange your basic resources for their cards. However, it should be noted that the transportation in ancient times was inconvenient, and the transportation of resources took time. Do not use trading resources to make cards or use cards to fight before contract settlement, which will lead to breach of contract.<h3> reconnaissance </h3><br/>If you know who you are, you will be invincible in a hundred battles. Before choosing to compete with other heroes, you should spend some resources to spy on him, find out his card composition, find out his weaknesses, and then create a deck to restrain his card set.<h3> duel </h3><br/>Use your card to compete with other heroes! Join a conspiracy in the battle to weaken the strength of other heroes for a long time. After obtaining a higher ranking in the Wulin, weaken the strength of the weaker heroes, so that they have no chance to pose a threat to you.<h3> status  </h3><br/>A higher status will give you more ability to develop yourself or suppress other heroes. At present, there is only Wulin ranking, and more systems will be added in the future.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T02:27:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0c/e0c67d6eee540373c004db6482bc6d28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["7-429"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["7-429"], "esrb_rating": null}
