The theme of the jam was a [genre] without [mechanic] (i.e. platformer without jumping, driving game with steering), so I went with top-down shooter without shooting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'm pretty happy with how this turned out, as I took this jam pretty chill and didn't stress too hard about it. First time using post processing stack, which is really cool and easy. Reflect function in unity is great too , made the lasers pretty easy\u00a0lol.</p>\n<p>Probably could do with music but i'm no music man. Got some more ideas of mechanics, but mechanics take time. Probably could of done more levels too.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing if you do it means a lot! Please rate if you liked it, or at least found it interesting!\u00a0</p>\n<p>James.</p>\n\n<p>PS. if you have trouble hitting turrets even though you think you figured out where you need to stand, try shooting loads of bullets at once</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c8/8c84c6fb2818ada8b8f81f5ce8cd967b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JamesBriggs"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
