HEADBATT includes a remote multi-player mode so that you can play with a friend who lives in a different city or even on a different continent. \r\n\r\nIn single-player mode, you play against an AI opponent. HEADBATT is a labour of love that began life as a Christmas party project at UNIT9, before evolving into its current shape.
