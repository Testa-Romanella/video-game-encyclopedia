What I have uploaded here is the windows and mac version but please do download the android version from the playstore.</p>\n<p>https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.VihaanNagarkar.LavaFall</p>\n<p>Played from the point of view of a ball, your goal is to survive in the game by dodging the lava that falls in your way by tapping on either side of the screen to move from side to side. The longer you survive, the more points you get!<br/><br/>While playing, you can collect coins that boost your score at the end of each round and also allow you to buy new skins for your ball. Once bought from the ball shop, these skins can be equipped and used anytime in the game!<br/><br/>In addition, powerups have also been added to assist you in surviving against the lava for a longer period of time!</p>\n<p>Art and Design Credit: Vedant Satapathy<br/></p>\n<p>The controls for the windows and mac\u00a0versions are:</p>\n<p>Arrows to move</p>\n<p>\"P\" to pause the game</p>\n<p>Arrows to use the cursor to select the buttons</p>\n<p>Enter to select a button</p>\n<p>Arrows to pick skins</p>\n<p>Space the equip and enter to play</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T04:34:50", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["vihaannagarkar"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
