So he invites his five closest (and most competitive) friends to take part in a ridiculously dangerous fun little challenge to prove themselves the worthiest of the honour.</p><p>This game is an extremely frantic tower defence mixed with top-down shooter vibes, where you fight off mechanical beasts closing in on you from 8 different directions.</p><p>I made this game for Ludum Dare's October Challenge 2013. You're welcome to download it for free, but donations are much appreciated. I really hope you have some fun with it.
