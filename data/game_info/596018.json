In which you have to guide your Submarine to the bottom of the ocean.</p>\n<p>The rules are very simple.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The submarine is steered indirectly by the little man (Dave). So to turn right, you have to go to that button and click it.</p>\n<p>To move use a/d or &lt;-/-&gt; and to jump the space bar. To press a button click the left Mouse button. Be careful, if the submarine turns, the paths change.</p>\n<p>Finally, a little tip: Don't forget that you can switch off the engine. In tricky situations you can react much better that way.</p>\n<p>And now have fun with 'Submarine Expeditions'.<br/></p>\n\n<p>At the end some credits:</p>\n<p>Thanks to my friend, who made this game with me, but unfortunately doesn't want to be named.</p>\n<p>The music in the game is a mix of\u00a0 a song from there:https://www.musicfox.com/info/kostenlose-gemafreie-musik.php\u00a0 and some underwater sounds from here:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASiqmfYr9dXqZAdap8AfcQ\u00a0 and here:https://www.videvo.net/sound-effect/underwater-bubble-by-pe311303/260540/</p><p>Changelog:</p><p>- Fixed a bug where the video at the end didn't show</p><p>- Decreased Submarine speed</p><p>- Decreased Seabomb damage<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T16:34:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf2/bf2d87f7626b21f8f1221e8b3f1aae38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Zeusonator"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
