Life Sim [Working Title] is a unique social sim created by our brand new studio. The game you are about to download is a very rough build. We hope you have fun as you travel the sights and get to know people, but as you play, please be on the lookout for any issues you encounter in the game. Our in-game logbook will allow you to report these bugs directly to our development team. Your reports and feedback are very valuable to us. We appreciate your time and hope that, even in its current state, you have fun with this exciting new project.<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Thank you for playing the Beta of our game.</em></p>\n<p><strong>---------- Here's the real description ----------</strong></p>\n<p>Okay, so this actually isn't a Beta of anything. This is the finished game. Life Sim Beta is an idea I've had for a while that I\u00a0think worked out pretty well as a small project, but it's flawed as is. I\u00a0was inspired by games like Pony Island and The Stanley Parable and I\u00a0think this works pretty well as a proof of concept, but I also think more could be done to do the idea justice. I really want to create an actual interface where the list is concerned. Have actual boxes you can check or something rather than just another obvious choice box. But more importantly, the whole thing just works\u00a0better if certain conditions are met. Conditions that will not necessarily be met by all players. The game plays best if:</p>\n<p>1. You enter all the correct names (no joke names).</p>\n<p>2. Have a girlfriend (so I suppose also being either male and straight or female and not).</p>\n<p>3. Have a cat or dog.</p>\n<p>The game plays fine if the last two conditions are not met, but I\u00a0don't think it plays as well.\u00a0Clearly I\u00a0didn't control for all of those things, but that isn't to say I\u00a0might not be able to if i come back to it.\u00a0I suppose I could ask the player for their gender and sexual orientation at some point and then change what happens based on that information. That might be interesting.\u00a0But again, this is more a small proof of concept than a finished idea.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I may indeed come back to this at some point and really refine it. In addition to the options just listed, I would also like to give the player the ability to try and escape their situation or maybe even join with the antagonist if they like, rather than the game just ending after a series of predetermined outcomes. It's something to think about.\u00a0This project was created in a week and it turned out more or less the way I\u00a0wanted it to as a concept - again - barring all the limitations listed above. I may come back and expand on this idea later, but I\u00a0hope you get a kick out of it as it is in any case.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing.</p>\n<p>Created By Dand:\u00a0https://dand-if-i-do.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Music: https://www.bensound.com<br/><br/></p><p>Sounds: http://ZapSplat.com<br/><br/></p><p>Sprites by sutemo: https://itch.io/profile/sutemo<br/><br/></p><p>Backgrounds by Noraneko Games: https://itch.io/profile/noranekogames/</p>\n<p>Desert Background by Digital Moons:\u00a0https://digitalmoons.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Simple Notebook Paper image by Cougarmint:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/users/cougarmint</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T04:29:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd9/fd9e567947dfc2f4f080d0635f1f0aba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DanD"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
