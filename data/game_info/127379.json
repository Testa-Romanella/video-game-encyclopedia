This person was Finnbar. He came up the initial idea, as you read above, in an IRC meeting, and from that sprung the original game.</p><p>\r\n\tAfterwards, the friends further developed the game, creating more style and color and strange experiments, anticipating a far-off rewrite and final release. But, as projects often are, it was abandoned, and these additions became only available through the source on Github.</p><p>We have now released the game on itch.io so you may more easily experience this forgotten work. We don't expect it to give you much, but however cacophonous, rambling and unfinished it all is, we want to remember that we made it.</p><p><strong>Credits</strong>:</p><ul>\n</ul><p>Tim Bumpus- Lead programmer, often graphics artist.</p><p>Finnbar Keating- Composer and sound designer, secondary programmer.</p><p>Micha\u0142 Sidor- Moral support officer, ghosticle designer.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/626/6262663cf87255c8d3af51f1f417ac33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Michcioperz", "Tim Bumpus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
