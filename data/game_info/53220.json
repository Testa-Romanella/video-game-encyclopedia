The game was developed by Graphic State and released by Midway for the Game Boy Advance in 2001. It is the only game in the series not to be preceded by an arcade release and features slightly different gameplay from its predecessors. The game uses the same engine as Dark Arena, a first-person shooter game also developed by Graphic State, to achieve a pseudo-3D effect. This approach garnered the game mixed reviews.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2001-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:36:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e48/e48bf2cc6958acd25503605da6be4358.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance"], "developers": ["Graphic State Games", "Graphic State"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["Midway Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
