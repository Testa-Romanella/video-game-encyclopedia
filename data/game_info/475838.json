{"id": 475838, "slug": "jumpcrafter", "name": "JumpCrafter", "name_original": "JumpCrafter", "description": "<p>JumpCrafter was developed over the course of two projects by students of the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts. Its goal is to enable game design students to explore level design for platform games. As such, it provides an easy-to-use level editor to create your own levels. It also contains a review mode to annotate existing levels, e.g. to highlight design patterns, kish\u014dtenketsu or areas that are especially well done or need improvement. Levels can be easily shared via JSON export which allows instructors and/or learners to give feedback to each other.</p>\n<p>Please let us know if you are planning to use this project as part of your Game Design teaching! We'd love to hear your feedback (and that of your students) to further improve JumpCrafter.</p>\n<p>The initial version was developed by Olivia Kaufmann and Trong Viet Dao. The project was then extended by Kevin Brenzikofer as his bachelor dissertation.</p>\n<p>Supervisor: Prof.\u00a0Dr.\u00a0Richard Wetzel</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T05:17:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9f/f9f2cb7554c7683445e483e8dcca435a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["gamedesigngames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
