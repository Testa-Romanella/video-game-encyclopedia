Could a hypnosis device I accidentally found on the bus be my chance to making my dreams come true?<br/><br/>\u201cCarry these boxes up, hurry!\u201d<br/>\u201cThese boxes are as heavy as lead and you want me to carry them all up to the 7th floor by myself without a lift?\u201d<br/><br/>I was working as a humble security guard in a hospital and was being ordered around by an unreasonable female boss. In my anger, I used this dark power for the first time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\u201cGood, you have satisfied your master. Now you need to remember my orders.\u201d \u201cMake sure you choose the best women carefully, I\u2019m very picky.\u201d<br/><br/>After this first taste of sweet victory, I started planning my own harem. The arrogant female doctor, the gentle big-sister-type nurse, the cute girlfriend-type nurse, the strict teacher-type nurse, and the weak MILF... were all in my grasp.<br/><br/>\u201cThis hypnotic device is clearly not a magical spell. I\u2019m pretty certain it\u2019s a technological product.\u201d \u201cWhether or not the person who made this had a greater purpose in mind, it's mine now.\u201d<br/><br/>But will such power be completely free of side effects?
