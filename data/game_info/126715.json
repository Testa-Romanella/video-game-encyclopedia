Small pieces of strange elements pop into existence around you.\u00a0You might not want to stand around and stare too long though. Water, food, and oxygen must be obtained before your reserves are depleted. Expand your\u00a0platform and build machines to obtain vital resources. And then, experiment and discover how this world works.</p>\n<p>Developer's note</p>\n<p>This is a early access version of a vast game I plan on making. While this particular version is only\u00a0the foundation of the game and may not seen like much, I have a story line and many ideas that will be implemented soon. I will be making a\u00a0developer\u00a0page if you want to follow and see what Ideas I am working on. I am also open for suggestions and I would like to see what you think of the game and what you think would make it better.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>To anyone who has played this game, there is\u00a0short survey that I would appreciate if you could fill\u00a0it out. The feedback gathered will be taken into consideration for bug fixes and updates for this game.</p>\n<p>https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRwyecSuIYAwvGZnZ-8kfjmUPUzYs00Sw8-N5c...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8db/8db0a04da117636080a7541086cbc1e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["StormFlame"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
