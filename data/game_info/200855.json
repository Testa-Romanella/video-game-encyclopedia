The aliens took a strange method of attack, and opted to freeze over the sun with super-cooled asteroids. The scientist, holding up his pledge, created an orb that could eat and transform the asteroids. This game features their battle.</p><p>This game was created for Ludum Dare 32, which was based around the theme of \"An Unconventional Weapon\", and was created by myself and Jjp137. In it you control an orb with 5 abilities, each costing a different amount of energy. You must use these abilities to try and protect your sun from freezing over from too much exposure to super-cooled asteroids.</p><p>Ludum Dare 32 Page: http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-32/?action=p...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b0/1b0100d3b21ea3d6bd48cbbaf8358817.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LegoBricker"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
