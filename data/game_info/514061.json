I was going to make a proper horror game, but around 5 days into the week-long game jam, I started modelling the monster and realised, I couldn't possibly make anything scary with my modelling skills...</p>\n<p>So I did what anyone with about 1 day left of a week-long game jam would do... I started again. My friend talked about a game where you're a spider, so I went with that, and this is the result.</p>\n<p>It's a little buggy, but it works fine. Could definitely use more polish - but oh well it is what it is.</p>\n<p>Basically, you walk around a pumpkin and pick up sweets as a spider, you have 1 minute to collect as many as you can.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T06:00:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/336/33604f9505dad6ccb4694039d927b3f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Slimburger"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
