It\u2019s a kind of<strong> anti-Mad-Max</strong> where you solve problems and discover a better non-end of the world by <strong>traveling from community to community</strong> in a virtual makeshift trailer.<h3>Universe and genre</h3><br/>The world of Caravan SandWitch is based on three main axes. <br/><ul><li> <strong>Deeply human characters</strong> who somehow manage to adapt to the collapse of civilization. The aim is to show people doing their best and to question our attitude in the face of profound changes in society.<br/></li><li> <strong>The strange environment</strong>, reminiscent of a sort of rebellious Provence, where the landscapes have suffered but where the flora and fauna have decided not to let it go, to direct the gaze to the way in which they have been treated. and forcing compromises.<br/></li><li> <strong>The mysterious retro-futuristic technology</strong> whose control is less and less assured.</li></ul><h3>Gameplay</h3><br/>The goal of Caravan SandWitch\u2019s gameplay is to serve a sense of<strong> discovery and contemplation</strong> while leaving space to enjoy the encounters and emotions of the characters. We took inspiration from narrative games and metroid vanias to define the gameplay loops. The goal is to promote a <strong>non-linear exploration</strong> while allowing the story to move forward. The player will find himself facing challenges in the form of a puzzle limiting him in his progress. It could be physical puzzles or specific interactions with characters.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T02:35:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e7/2e7110410db13e29f4952550c23f734b.jpg", "website": "https://caravansandwitch.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 248, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adrien Lucas", "R\u00e9mi Lefevre"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Self-publishing"], "esrb_rating": null}
