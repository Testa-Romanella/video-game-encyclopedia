You start with three different abilities each will randomize every time you press one of the ability buttons. The ability that the slot lands on will be your next attack.\r\n</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p><strong>The tower and immortality</strong>\r\nGodfist is unlike any other roguelike in where you don't actually lose health, but instead you gain pain. Every time you get hit, you become a little more unstable. Your objective is to climb the tower without falling off the edge and every hit will bring you closer to the edge. The same goes for your enemies, they cannot be killed by conventional means and must be thrown off the edge!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T12:55:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/029/0297f9dc412cfd4f6292b3cf375eb0a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 219, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Icehelm"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
