Space to interact or jump.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The day after Lunar New Year, our twelve animal deities have been captured and locked up in some kind of dungeon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mouse may be the smallest of the twelve, but he was the first to win the race all those years ago. He must find his friends and get out of the dungeon.</p><p>3 different endings.</p>\n\n<p>Walkthrough:\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Level 1</strong><br/></p><p>When you leave the first room, continue walking until you see a floating platform. Climb as high as you can and start jumping on platforms on your right. (Some of the jumps might be difficult but they are entirely possible.) Continue to the right until you find a room with a Key.</p><p>Take the key to the right on the top platform with the Door. Take Monkey with you and go down. Find the pathway on the far left and continue down until you find Ox. Use monkey on the cage door to untie the knots. You will receive Ox.</p><p>On the right, across from Ox's cage, you will pass the level door.\u00a0Continue right and use Ox on the Black Crate. Go into the room and grab the Metal Key. Use Metal Key on door you passed earlier.</p><p><strong>Level 2</strong><br/></p><p>Travel downward to reach the bottom floor where Dog is tied. Talk to Dog and get him to come with you.\u00a0</p><p>Now travel upward to the top level. When you see a door on your left, take the top right path until you find Ram. Use Dog to annoy Ram to come with you.</p><p>Find pig on the second lowest floor, towards the right end. Use Ram to free Pig from the door. Go and speak with Horse to receive a Wine Jar.</p><p>Find snake on the floor above on the right side. Give Snake the Wine Jar so that he throws up a Cell Key.\u00a0</p><p>Go back to the top floor and unlock the door on the left. Talk to Rooster and take the fish.</p><p>Take the Fish to Tiger on the middle floor. Tiger will come with you.</p><p>Use Tiger to cut Rabbit down. Rabbit will give you a key to the Main Door.</p><p>Find the Main Door on the floor below and enter.</p><p><strong>Level 3</strong><br/></p><p>Getting a Bad Ending will not reset the game. Instead, getting a Bad Ending will transport you back to Level 3 to try again.</p><p><strong>Bad End 1:\u00a0</strong>Let the time run out.</p><p><strong>Bad End 2:\u00a0</strong>Get to the top, but escape through the right side passage.</p><p><strong>True End: \u00a0</strong>Get to the top and take the Left Overpass.<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Art:</p>\n<p>All art taken from OpenGameArt.org</p>\n<p>Cat Sprite: <strong>Flofflewoffle</strong></p>\n<p>Animal Sprites:\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>AntumDeluge :</strong></p>\n<p>Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA) version 3.0 or later Copyright \u00a9 2017-2018 Kimmo Rundelin</p>\n<p>\"[LPC] Horses\" Artist: bluecarrot16 License: CC-BY 3.0 / GPL 3.0 / GPL 2.0 / OGA-BY 3.0.
