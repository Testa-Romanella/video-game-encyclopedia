{"id": 15203, "slug": "pixelman", "name": "PIXELMAN", "name_original": "PIXELMAN", "description": "<strong>PIXELMAN</strong> is a retro styled action-filled, endless-flyer, high-score chaser, where you control the title character in his mission to rescue the citizens of Pixville from the evil Baron Von Pixel and his contraptions.<br/>In <strong>PIXELMAN</strong> you need to keep your combos going to be able to make it into the online leaderboards!<br/><br/>The citizens of Pixville are counting on you!How to PlayControlling <strong>PIXELMAN</strong> is very simple: you press and hold to go up, release to go down, and you can also use the pad to move faster (but with less accuracy!) Your goal is to rescue the citizens (humans and their pets!) to keep your heroic energy up, and also avoid crashing into buildings, traffic, and Von Pixel\u2019s weapons and traps. <br/>If you don\u2019t rescue anyone for a while, your heroic energy will go down; and if it reaches zero, you\u00b4ll lose your powers and fall! <br/><br/>XBox 360 Controllers, Mouse and Keyboards supported (We truly recommend the controller).<br/>CombosEvery time you rescue a Pixelian, your combo meter will go up. Once you\u2019ve rescued 5 in a row, your score will start to multiply! BUT, if you fail to rescue a single soul, you meter will deplete, and you\u2019ll have to start all over again. Keep the combos going for maximum high-scorage!<br/>Power UpsFrom time to time, you\u2019ll come across a present box. If you grab it, you\u2019ll activate the power up mode! In this mode, your score and combo meter multiply, your speed goes up, and you can\u2019t get hurt! The bad thing is, it only lasts for one hit, so you better watch out! <br/>PIXELMANHe\u2019s Pixville\u2019s senior superhero, his superpowers are flying and untying knots really fast. He also loves podiums! His main weaknesses are buildings, bombs, lasers and missiles\u2026 nothing that a good power up can\u2019t fix! <br/>PIXELGIRLShe\u2019s Pixville\u2019s new superhero! She\u2019s pretty much like <strong>PIXELMAN</strong>, but faster and cooler! Once you learn her quirks, she\u2019ll start racking up points like nothing! <br/>Baron Von PixelPIXELMAN\u2019s main antagonist is a mustache twirling villain who hates everyone in Pixville. He managed to buy a few rusty WWI weapons on Craigslist, and he\u2019s not afraid to use them! His main hobby is to tie people up and leave them on top of buildings, trees and cars. Only <strong>PIXELMAN</strong> can stop his devious schemes! <br/>PodiumsWhat\u2019s a superhero without a podium to stand on? In <strong>PIXELMAN</strong> you start on top of a sad soapbox, but to show their gratitude after being rescued, the Pixelians will start building new podiums for you! Can you unlock them all? Are you the hero Pixville needs? Or the hero Pixville deserves? How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? <br/>Online LeaderboardsThe game doesn\u2019t have an ending. You can play until your eyes bleed or the speed goes so far up that you can\u2019t control your hero anymore! The goal of the game is to make it to the online leaderboards. And in order to achieve that, you need to maintain your combos going. If you have a high combo and you manage to get a power up, you can make over 1000 points for just one rescue! <br/>AchievementsCan you slalom between 50 rockets? Can you survive over 5 minutes in one gameplay? Can you reach over NINE THOUSAND!!!\u2122 points in one game? If the answer is YES, this is the game for you!
