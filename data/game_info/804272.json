{"id": 804272, "slug": "mmry-solitaire", "name": "Mmry Solitaire", "name_original": "Mmry Solitaire", "description": "<p>Mmry Solitaire is\u00a0 a unique solitaire game that challenges your puzzle solving logic and memory equally. Strategize and plan your moves or click around randomly until you win. Enjoy flipping cards over and over and over and\u00a0eventually yelling at your screen in frustration!</p>\r\nRules:\r\n<p>I recommend just sorta messing around until you get a feel for the rules of each card. However, to ease (some) confustion, here's a few clarifications:</p>\n<p>The object of the game is to finish with a <em>low</em> score.\u00a0I feel like that should be apparent, but it might not be.</p>\n<p>Aces and jokers are wilds, meaning you get to flip cards of your choosing (provided you choose cards next to the aces or jokers). You can choose one card with an ace, or 1-3 with a joker. Careful, though, wild cards cost the most points.</p>\r\nQ&amp;A:\r\nCan this game be played with physical cards?\r\n<p>Yep! I originally designed this game\u00a0to be played with a deck of standard playing cards. The main difference in this digital version is that the game will keep score.\u00a0(Plus, you don't have to remember the rules, or manually flip over cards.)</p>\r\nCan a round of this game be impossible to solve?\r\n<p>Good\u00a0question! The short answer is: I have no idea.</p>\n<p>The long answer: Proving whether all possible layouts of cards are solvable in this game is actually pretty complicated. There are an insane amount of possibilities just for the 3x3 grid.\u00a0And considering I'm no mathematician, I don't even know where to start on trying to answer that question.</p>\n<p>If I had to guess though, considering I've likely played 100 or so rounds while testing this game and every single one has been solvable, I think it's likely that all possible rounds are solvable.</p>\r\nDo you plan on updating this game?\r\n<p>No, no I don't.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T21:37:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f6/7f677071cc4fc88210916cd8e5e3f2ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Detective Software Devs"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
