You need to click the buttons in the right order to build the different objects on the factory line. You have a time-limit for each object, what gets shorter as the level progresses. </p><p>Controls: Click the buttons at the bottom of the screen in the right order as those shown above the guys head (from left to right.)</p><p>It's a small game where you need to be quick, and where you will need to use your memory too. We hope you will enjoy. Good luck.</p><p>Game developer: SpriteyFrog</p><p>Art made by Gica using Gimp and Manga studio.</p><p>Sfx made in BFXR.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db2/db2f7a8b12ce840c211ac5aa1c44f8dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SFrog"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
