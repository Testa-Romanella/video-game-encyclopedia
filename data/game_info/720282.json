The Arab countries neighboring the country, including Syria and Jordan, attacked aggressively and strongly. The loss was on the horizon, but Israel managed to recover and fight back. Nine days after the outbreak of the war, one of the most significant turning-ups in the war took place: the Battle of the Armor on October 14. This was a large tank battle between the Israeli army and the Egyptian army, and played an important role in Israel's victory.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>*You're playing in the armored battle on October 14th, and to win the battle, you have to survive six waves of enemy tanks. To survive the waves, which are becoming increasingly difficult from wave to wave, there will be a tank and bomb store that will allow you to buy weapons and protective measures against the attacks you will have to deal with (To buy, click on the icons of the weapons). You can get coins on any tank you defeat and also get a large amount of coins for every wave you manage.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Hope you will enjoy!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>(Made for Historically Accurate Game Jam 5)</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T05:51:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87f/87fdaab97fddf2ece31c5e4239b01bf1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Tinise_Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
