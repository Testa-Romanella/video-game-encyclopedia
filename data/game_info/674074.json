The core feature of the game is that you can create your own custom board and play Go with your friends or community on any device.</p>\r\nCreate Your Own Board\r\n<p>Bored to play on a squared board? Create your own! Conquer a territory on a map of Japan, or have fun killing your opponent groups on a donat-shaped board. Only imagination is the limit! Custom board not only brings more fun but also fills gameplay with more creativity, true strategic thinking experience and reduces the gap between beginners and advanced players..</p>\r\nFind an Opponent Online\r\n<p>Seeing all the requests to play from other players, you can accept their terms or create your own in just a few clicks. You can choose not only a board, but also a time format (bullet, blitz, rapid, classic) and other options. Want to play with your friend? Create a dedicated online room and send her a link, or have fun on the same device offline.</p>\r\nPlay Wherever You Are\r\n<p>No matter what device is near your hand, the game is always in just seconds to start. We tried to implement a stable cross-platform solution for the game, so you can play on:</p>\n<ul><li>Windows, macOS</li><li>iOS, Android (coming soon\u2026)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T10:37:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/218/21841886002cc5d7ded5d67f1f92cbaa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Band IT Studio"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
