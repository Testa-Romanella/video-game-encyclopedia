Now you can control the horizontal position of the slime. If you touch a leave from the bottom, it will break and you will receive one point. As you fly up into the air, you will get slower and in order to get faster again, just let the slime fall ontop of a leave. If you fall out of the screen at the bottom, you will DIE!<br/><br/>This game was made for the \"Friday Night Game Jam - #2020-37\" in 3 hours and everything was made by myself (which is obvious from this bad art :D).\u00a0 <br/><br/>Hope you have at least a little fun playing it :)\r\n\r\nIf someone is interested, here are the colors i generated for this game: https://coolors.co/141b41-b8c480-156064-f67e7d-ea7af4", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-14T04:22:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cae/cae7b03605f882dbe77ad65f849f909f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BitFehler"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
