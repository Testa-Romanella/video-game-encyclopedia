The reason why it's called 4-7-8 is because that's the rhythm (number of seconds) you are supposed to breathe in, hold, and the exhale for proper practices of meditation. When a player is exploring the 3D landscapes, soothing music and an audio recording of a narrative plays, allowing the player to listen and explore. A pulsing circle on the right side of the screen reminds the player to keep breathing in the rhythm of 4-7-8.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-13T03:00:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/378/37870f28458918a06150bda998e70195.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Nicole Polidore"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
