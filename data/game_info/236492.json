(They return to normal configuration by pressing again the activated one).<br/>'Engineering Control' = Like above, they fix one area faster but delay the others. 'Hull' is the most important, if it reaches zero the ship explodes.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8c/a8cc7df3edd3eeeb327d74c92699d356.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Marcio Palmeira"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
