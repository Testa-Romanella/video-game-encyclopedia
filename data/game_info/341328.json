But not the boring parts, oh no! You will be responsible for doing what teachers like most: Collecting phones from (innocent) students. Build an everlasting empire by selling phones and building security cameras to bust even more students!</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: TeacherSimulator is a game which was made as a joke for a specific school. It, therefore, includes many references to events that won't be understood by the general public.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: The ingame-text is german, the game is not localized. The German text isn't gameplay-relevant, but mostly jokes/running gags though.</p>\n<p>INFO: The game was initially developed as a mobile game. If you want to, you can play it on android as well.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-15T04:38:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74e/74e229e5e4ff9bf23c29e1bfa5e9a3d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["devsaur"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
