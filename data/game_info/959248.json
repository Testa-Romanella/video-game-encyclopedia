And when it's on your taskbar, it'll either jump or eat, or maybe even take a nap or give you a wink.\r\n</p>\n<p>But here's the really cool part - when it's ready to move on from your screen, it'll make a run for it and dart off the side, only to come back down from above like a fluffy little superhero. It's pretty entertaining, and we think you'll love it as much as we do. So go ahead and download our app today and let the sheep add some fun to your day! <br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Features:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>seven different animations\r\n</li><li>eight different parachutes\r\n</li><li>duration and frequency of actions are purely random\r\n</li><li>graphics automatically adapts to monitor resolution\r\n</li><li>different options available in integrated menu\r\n</li></ul>\n\r\nThe software is already functional, but is still under development!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T23:45:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e6/6e691c1c769c70748a192bd71e8415c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["computer-knopf"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
