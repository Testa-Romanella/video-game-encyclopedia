A bit \"FPS\", a bit \"Card game\", a bit \"Rogue-lite\".<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCollect your loot after clearing a room, then modify your weapon's stocks, grips, muzzles, scopes and magazines with the parts that you picked up, each giving your weapon crazy powers.<br/>\r\nEach type of weapon has it's own unique playstyle, for example how about putting a part that sets your enemy on fire with 5% chance per every bullet..on a shotgun that shoots 8 pellets per shot. With three guns in your pockets wield your perfect stack of kill-tools!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n(Current screenshots and trailer are from the work in progress alpha version.)", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:52:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d82/d82e06127787b905e9869338f0765817.jpg", "website": "https://twistedweapons.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["B."], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["B."], "esrb_rating": null}
