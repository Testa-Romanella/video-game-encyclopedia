This game features Film Grain effect(which in India we call mosquitoes on tv), so don't think that your monitor is borken or my game has poor graphics. Graphics levels can be set at runtime using option menu.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls :-</p>\n<p>WSAD / Arrow Keys : Movement</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button :\u00a0Fire Laser</p>\n<p>Z : Slow Time</p>\n<p>X\u00a0: Activate Shield</p>\n<p>Left Ctrl : Start Hacking</p>\n<p>E : Move Box with You</p>\n<p>Level redisgnes itself after every game. Background music changes too.</p>\n<p>For best graphics results, play Desktop version.</p>\n<p>Warning : My naming skill sucks(as you may have seen after reading title of this game).
