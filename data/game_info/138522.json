Otherwise their White Avatar will stand still and fall prey to the treacherous Red Hunters.</p><p>Find 1 to 6 players, grab your pads, find a way to coordinate your moves (yelling, mostly) and try to get as many Green Gems as possible, while avoiding falling off the ground and being caught. As you go on, your playfield will fall apart and more enemies will fill the stage.</p><p>Credits:</p><p>Design, programming and 3D models: Maurizio Tatafiore</p><p>Main screen and UI: Marco Giammetti</p><p>Music and sound: Luca Di Gennaro</p><p>(soundtrack: https://soundcloud.com/lucadige/global-game-jam-20...)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbf/dbfdb9a6cfd97805a32581a2286ca4f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OldSchoolPixels"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
