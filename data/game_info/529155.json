Some stars are worth more than common stars, but they are stronger than them (stronger enough to break lures and rods!). You and up to 4 friends must compete to get as much points as they can from stars they've manage to catch for their collections. Whoever earns the most star points wins.\u00a0Good luck catching as many stars as you can for bragging rights!<br/></p>\n<p>Link to the game:\u00a0https://playingcards.io/zdmezv<br/></p>\n<p>Additional notes (mainly for a physical game):\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Rules can also be printable as cards that you can holepunch and use a keyring to hold them together</li><li>Each type of card &amp; piece are also printable (keep in mind most of them are required to be duplicated to an appropriate amount); separate spinner/10-faced die is needed as well.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T05:17:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e6/2e6b8f3f5f3fedeedb47a9c9473af287.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ScarletScarves"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
