It was released in 1999 throughout Japan, North America, and Europe by Sony Computer Entertainment.</p>\n<p>The game features mecha designs by Shoji Kawamori of Macross fame.</p>\n<p>Being released late in the PlayStation's life, Omega Boost is said to have some of the best graphics on the console with parts of the game running at 60 frame/s. The game was criticized by some reviewers for being too short (Nine levels with nine unlockable special missions) and simplistic. However, it is still considered one of the best Macross-style mecha simulation games produced and is thought of by many as a sleeper hit due to its poor marketing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-23T04:05:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0dc/0dcda6d4ec754fb4e419021bed117ce3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 305, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": ["Polyphony Digital"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment", "Sony Interactive Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
