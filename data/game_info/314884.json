Through planting materials and <strong>fertilising the soil with his own blood</strong>\u2026 he is able to bring to life non-organic objects - like Microwaves, Toasters, Clown horns and much more! And these non-organic objects are worth top dollar!</p>\n<p>However, this goes against the <em>Farmers Fair Trade Act of 1963: \u201cOne must only grow organic matter</em>\u201d. As a result, the vegetables are mad. Their real mad, and will come and attempt to destroy your farm on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>Plant combinations of wood, metal, plastic and blood to grow over 10 different plants. Once fully grown, you can harvest these items to help protect your farm! Each object has a special ability. Throw televisions, mow down some carrots with a desk fan, stun the tomatoes with the flash of a camera! Your farm is worth defending - but save\u00a0<em>some</em>\u00a0of your grown loot\u2026 a farmers gotta earn!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T08:02:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ba/6ba2896a6988ef356f3f45a14b7b31c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["HonestDan"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
