Its just a simple game where you control a marble and the goal of the game is to get through all ten levels and collect all the tokens without falling off the platforms.</p><p>I currently only develop games for a hobby under the name Hallow Games, but would like to possibly do it for a living in the future. I mainly work with the Unity engine and make games that I find enjoyable. For the most updated info on my current game projects, you can follow me on Twitter (@HallowGames) or check out my website at www.hallowgames.com.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0cd/0cd97133ca131e1692a66e3c6ab1b740.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Hallow Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
