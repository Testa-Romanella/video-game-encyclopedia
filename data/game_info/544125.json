We are a group of Arcaxer fans with barely enough knowledge, coffee and stubbornness to figure out how to make a game. We were inspired to do this while watching the Overrun devs livestream working on their game. We are using this as an opportunity to learn how to use game making tools and make an homage to our favorite character in Arcaxer.</p>\n<p>Notes on Comfort<br/>This is a first person game with no comfort settings that uses a lot of flight movement. The bow of the ship goes a long way to alleviate motion sickness by giving a stable reference. Be sure to assess yourself periodically while playing. The game is designed to be played standing, but can be played easily seated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-18T02:54:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0c/a0cf2f4e5af1fbbd8e7bbbc4e809e747.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Zach Ess"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
