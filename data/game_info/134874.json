(64 x 64 pixel games). It's a short game, though not as short as you might think. Or maybe it is? Life is full of mysteries. It's a little wonky, and that's in part to deciding to leave in some inexplicable but entertaining glitches. </p><p>Player 1, you're at the top. A, S and D let you move left, shoot, and move right.</p><p>Player 2, you're at the bottom. The Left, Up and Right arrow keys do the same for you.</p><p>You both only have six bullets.</p><p>You have all the time you need.</p><p>Definitely more than one screen! Almost certainly at least one secret ending! Made with GAME MAKER! YEEHHAAWWW!!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/877/877f569d33a8d0779c56f9eec25dbb86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Atomic Toilet"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
