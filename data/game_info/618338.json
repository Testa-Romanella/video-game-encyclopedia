Unfortunately your dimensional tethers can only function when you are in relative <em>superposition</em> (I.E. if you get too far apart, you'll slip to your home dimensions). However, thanks to interdimensional collapsing objects, tears in space time, and a little ingenuity, you may just be able to use your dimensional tether's weakness to your advantage. Enter superposition and explore the multiverse.</p>\n<p>Note:\u00a0This is a spiritual successor to our first game jam game from 2019!</p>\n<p>Note 2:\u00a0This is a game designed with a two player experience in mind but is completely playable single player.</p><p>Note 3: The final\u00a0level with 5 portals\u00a0is unfortunately broken in build, and not possible to complete.</p>\n<p>Player 1 Controls:</p>\n<p>W,A,S,D movement</p>\n<p>E to grab crates\u00a0and mirrors</p>\n<p>Player 2 Controls:</p>\n<p>Arrow key movement</p>\n<p>Right Shift to grab crates and mirrors</p>\n<p>Universal Controls:</p>\n<p>Hold R to restart stage</p>\n<p>Esc to exit</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T10:20:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e1/7e1422de1cac4b40bcce70b06b6435b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["bobby123jack"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
