With gameplay similar to Rad Racer and Pole Position, the driver races towards the back of the screen.</p>\n<p>The names of the opponents are chosen partially at random; they can also vary because of the ranking level of the course and the type of vehicle used. Like in Rad Racer, the player can supercharge an automobile to go up to 255 miles per hour or 410 kilometres per hour.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1990-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:01:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddb/ddb680c749f399b9373562df931a69d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["NES"], "developers": ["Winkysoft", "Winky Soft"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["SETA"], "esrb_rating": null}
