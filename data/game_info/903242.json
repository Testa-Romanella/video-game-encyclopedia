Winter was allways hard, yet, it became harder and harder, to the point it was unberable. It never stoped, and it didn't look like it would.<br/>You arm yourself with courage, and decide to go talk with the Gods at the Gods Altar, up in the mountain, under a never ending storm.<br/>Will you stop this never ending winter?<br/><br/><strong>Gamewise:</strong><br/><br/>The first part comprehends a labyrinth, filled with clues to find the right path. Be careful! If you run into a dead end far too many times, you'll have to start from the begining again.</p>\n<p>The second, on the other hand, is a matter of choosing the right options across the dialogue.<br/><br/><strong>Endings:</strong><br/><br/>There's only two endings, one good, one bad. Don't worry, the bad ending will give you a chance to restart from the second part onwards!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Programming:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Mat</p>\n<p><strong>Writting:</strong></p>\n<p>Writter: Mat<br/>Editor: Rads</p>\n<p><strong>Art:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Backgrounds: Rads<br/>Characters: Rads</p>\n<p><strong>Music:</strong></p>\n<p>Mat</p>\n<p><strong>Sound:</strong></p>\n<p>Mat<br/>Other sounds taken from freesounds.org:<br/>Fire sound by\u00a0deleted_user_2104797<br/> (\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/deleted_user_2104797/sounds/164661/\u00a0) <br/>Under license\u00a0CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication<br/>Footsteps sound by\u00a0\u00a0florianreichelt<br/>(\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/florianreichelt/sounds/453168/\u00a0and\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/florianreichelt/\u00a0)\u00a0<br/>Under license\u00a0CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication<br/>Forest sound by\u00a0felix.blume<br/> (https://freesound.org/people/felix.blume/sounds/328293/\u00a0)\u00a0<br/>Under license\u00a0CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T06:10:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/102/1021c934d3e40d2530c33980c2168f41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Mat", "Rads"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
