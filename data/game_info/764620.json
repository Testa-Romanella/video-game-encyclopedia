It's time to see where this feeling takes you.</p>\n\n<p>A (crappy) 2D beat em' up, featuring a 1-minute day-night cycle.</p>\n<p>You lose when your hideout is breached, or when you die. You're life is essentially over when that happens. But do keep in mind that you are human, so you cannot take that many hits. (And I totally did not do that because I'm bad at programming enemy AI.)</p>\n<p>There are 3 endings by the way.</p>\n\n<p>Keys:</p>\n<p>Use WASD or Arrow keys to move</p>\n<p>Attack: H or Z</p>\n<p>Strong Attack: J or X</p>\n<p>Stop Fighting Stance: K or C</p>\n<p>Interact: L or V</p>\n\n<p>Made originally for a game jam, but I was an idiot and uploaded it a day late. So it's here now.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-05T07:51:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/496/4961a15fd839a2dba801f662bc47690a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Notimetravel"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
