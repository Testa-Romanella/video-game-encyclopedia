One whale, one room, many nazis, and a friendship that lasts forever! <br/><br/>===================== <br/> <br/>Controls: <br/>Arrows/Stick - Movement,Jump(\"a\" button for gamepad)<br/>Z/X(gamepad) - Shoot/interact <br/>Space/RT - Roar<br/><br/>=============== <br/> <br/>Credits: <br/> <br/>Art/Animation: <br/><br/>Arcade Hero - @arcade_hero<br/>3 Dudes Make Games - @3DudesMakeGames <br/><br/>Code: <br/>DimLight - http://dimmedlight.newgrounds.com/ <br/> <br/>Sounds/Music: <br/>FinalSketch - https://soundcloud.com/final-sketch <br/>Ksenia Harris - https://www.facebook.com/ksenia.harris <br/>Gink Freud - https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1000111199... <br/>Artemy Makeev - https://www.facebook.com/makeev.artemy <br/> <br/>===============<br/></p><p>This december we made this game for Ludum dare 37. This was our first jam try and despite many imperfections and compromises we had to make<br/>due to time limits we liked the result very much. So we thought it could be fun <br/>to spend a little bit more time to build a more presentable prototype. And finally we are happy to present it to you.<br/>In our minds we have big plans for this game: revised gameplay, improved graphics, comprehensive story filled <br/>with drama and stupid whale puns, and many more. <br/>But for that we need your support and feedback. And probably a good publisher. <br/>Hope, you will enjoy our game! Have a good time!</p><p>If you're a publisher and you're interested in the game, please contact us through arcadeheroart@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/012/012f4060657a098c1bbfe8090fd80ab2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["arcadehero"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
