{"id": 2698, "slug": "damn-little-town", "name": "Damn Little Town", "name_original": "Damn Little Town", "description": "(WARNING: This version doesn&amp;#39;t work on iPad 1 and iPhone 3GS)<br/><br/>Damn Little Town is a tactical board game for 1-4 players. The game is divided into two phases: <br/><br/>- during the first phase, you build your little town and place your settlers;<br/>- during the second, you try to escape the town, which has been corrupted. <br/><br/>Evil is rising and destroying everything in its path. You have to escape this Damn Little Town before it\u2019s too late...<br/><br/>Multiplayer modes: <br/><br/>- pass-and-play (2-4 players);<br/>- online multiplayer (2 players at the moment).<br/><br/>Single player mode:<br/><br/>- play with 1-3 computer opponents.<br/><br/><br/>REVIEWS:<br/>------------------------<br/><br/>CNet.com:<br/><br/>&amp;quot;Best mobile game of June 2014. If you like Carcassonne and Downfall of Pompeii, Damn Little Town -- which was inspired by both of those games -- will be right up your alley.&amp;quot;<br/><br/>PocketGamer.co.uk:<br/><br/>&amp;quot;A sparse quick-fire boardgame with plenty of interesting ideas, Damn Little Town is just a little too punishing for its own good.&amp;quot;<br/><br/>PocketTactics.com:<br/><br/>&amp;quot;Damn Little Town builds Carcassonne over the Hellmouth. Combining Carcassonne with Survive! is an awfully clever idea and I\u2019m looking forward to this.&amp;quot;<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>Dear Board Game Lovers, <br/>Your comments and critiques are welcome!
