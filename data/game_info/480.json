For 13 long years, Resident Evil series were rejecting the survival-horror aspect and atmosphere of first original games in the series mainly released in nineties on PlayStation one system. From the famous Resident Evil 4 until Resident Evil 6, the series went full-force into action genre leaving horror elements behind and hard-core fans disappointed. Finally, Capcom realized that Resident Evil needs a change and Resident Evil 7: Biohazard delivers those changes at its fullest. First of all, the camera angle changed from over the shoulder view into first-person mode. Another change is that survival-horror elements are back together with light puzzle solving, inventory management and maze-like mansion in which the main story of the game happens. The player controls Ethan Winters who is searching for his lost wife in a dark mansion filled with horrible creatures and insane family. <br />\nResident Evil 7: Biohazard can also be played with virtual reality setup and it\u2019s known as one of the best games which supports VR.</p>", "metacritic": 85, "released": "2017-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-18T21:20:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/cee/cee577e2097a59b77193fe2bce94667d.jpg", "website": "http://residentevil7.com", "rating": 4.33, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 419, "owned": 5228, "beaten": 1724, "toplay": 370, "dropped": 316, "playing": 130}, "playtime": 10, "achievements_count": 392, "ratings_count": 1843, "suggestions_count": 286, "game_series_count": 19, "reviews_count": 1874, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC", "Xbox One", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Capcom", "Capcom U.S.A"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Capcom"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
