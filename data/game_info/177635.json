My game is about the famous environmentalist, Doug Freeman, who is on a mission to save the last rose on earth from extinction. Using the vines that instantaneously grow from his biomechanical gauntlets, also called \"Green Thumbs\", \u00a0he must climb to the top of the highest tower to save his beloved rose, then bring it back down again to safety. Hope you have fun, and feel free to comment, and critique.
