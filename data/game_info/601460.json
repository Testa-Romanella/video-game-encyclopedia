A friend and I came up with the name and premise years ago, but never acted on it. I decided that it was too good to pass up on so here I am with this. If you couldn't tell from the pictures I'm a piss poor artist but I try my best. I prefer doing back end programming but I'm having a blast making this so I hope someone out there finds it fun!<br/></p>\n<p>Right now only the \"Infinite\u00a0 mode\" is in the game. There are seven difficulty levels and it reaches that point at about 3 and a half minutes. Try to survive the onslaught of tempting deal!</p>\n<p>Note: I already know that some of the credits text doesn't fit in the WebGL version.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T05:30:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5bf/5bfed49136d03102ba1b8140851328b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["mattman107"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
