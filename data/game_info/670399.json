Then I closed my eyes tight and looked away, and just using my memory and vague approximations of distance using the mouse, I painted everything. I would then open my eyes to pick a new color, vaguely re-center the mouse, and repeat a few times.</p>\n<p>I made all the sound effects (the few that I implemented) using only my mouth, but I actually made these sounds for my friend's game for this game jam that he didn't finish and submit, so I recycled some of them.</p>Notable Feature<p>This was my first time making a game that allows you to draw your own character images! In GMS2 terms, this involved some basic applications of dynamic surfaces and runtime sprite creation.</p><p>I've been wanting to do it for a while now, and while this is of course a very silly bad game and the painting system is incredibly simplistic, it's a solid proof-of-concept for the technical side of it. I could just as easily swap out the \"brush\" used by the player, have rounded tools, even drawing tools with built-in transparency or directionality like a spray-paint tool or paintbrush tool. It's pretty straight-forward. I could do layers, dynamic dimensions, inherit transparency, an eraser tool, etc. fairly easily from this point. I\u00a0can envision how to make an undo/redo system as well, but that doesn't sound great as my GMS2 vision of it requires a lot of surfaces stored in memory to achieve it. Not complicated, just a lot of memory.\u00a0Maybe with buffers it would be better, which is also way more complex. There are more complex things to try even from there, like inverting or rotating a painted image, or trying to smooth out draws flicked across the canvas, which now entail a lot of blank spaces between painted squares. I could approximate between frames to draw a series of images to smooth out, which would work but has issues,\u00a0but if the drawing tool has transparency, that breaks, so more still to learn.</p><p>Regardless, this is an important technical step for me. This same simple implementation could be re-used for a wide variety of purposes, which I'm happy about.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T07:03:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9b/f9b154b9d0b2d04af6b5000bfb509858.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Gunnar Clovis"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
