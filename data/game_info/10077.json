It's grim and dark. The ever oppressing Faction wants everyone to follow and obey. They will stop at nothing. People are scared. Demoralized. The few who fight back are painfully outnumbered. They need hope. Someone to show them the way. Will you stand up for humanity and fight for its future? <br/><br/><br/><br/>Get inside this VR Shooter to lead the Resistance to victory over the evil Faction forces and their brutal killing machines. <br/><br/><br/><strong>&gt; WEAPONS, UPGRADES, AND IMPROVEMENTS</strong><br/>Arm yourself with a massive arsenal of fully-customizable guns, ranging from classic shotguns, assault rifles, sniper rifles and machine guns to super-powered futuristic firearms. Feel the experience of changing scopes at every situation, for close combat, mid range, or sniping<br/><br/><br/><strong>&gt; 4 AREAS TO EXPLORE &amp; 22 LEVELS TO FIGHT THE FACTION </strong><br/>Fight against the Faction through a huge territory under their control. Get into its alleys, slums and industry districts until you arrive at the core, where their headquarters are. Shoot your way out using cover like cars, houses, and destroyed machinery. Every area where you can avoid being shot is a good place to face the Faction with all your arsenal.<br/><br/><br/><strong>&gt; CHOOSE YOUR OWN WAY</strong><br/>You won\u2019t be standing still at any point during the game, just waiting until your enemies come to you. Every time you move forward, you will select which path you want to play. It\u2019s easy, choose the red one to increase the difficulty. Want to play the next levels as a professional sniper? Choose long distance weapons. Want to be a badass in the frontline? Take flashbang, air strikes and a big shotgun.<br/><br/><strong>&gt; EPIC BOSS BATTLES &amp; ENEMIES GROWING UP</strong><br/>You will increase your power, as you get a better arsenal, but the faction won\u2019t just watch you in silence. The deeper you go into their territory, the bigger the robots will be that confront you, with more powerful weapons that hit really hard. Also, learn to identify the uniforms and signs of the Faction soldiers. They will give you some information about their strength and how hard they will hit. <br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>&gt;FIRST PERSON SHOOTING FOR VR WITH ACCURATE AIMING SYSTEM </strong><br/>Overkill VR simulates shooting a real gun, without any autoaim. So, forget any help coming from the AI, it\u2019s all about you, your gun and your skills. On Overkill VR, you will find a designated aim system, exclusively developed for this game, that tries to emulate real world weapons. Weapon physics, like recoil, cadence, precision, ballistics\u2026 All details have been made to emulate real world weapons, to make you feel like you are wearing a weapon in the real world. <br/><br/>To survive long enough and become the legendary Resistance leader you will need to master the art of deadly precision. Without it there will be no hero. Only bones left in the sand. <br/><br/>Do you have what it takes?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:14:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/011/01133a7ed6f6eff2b24e743565f5563b.jpg", "website": "http://www.overkillvr.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 20}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 28, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 587, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Starloop Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Game Troopers"], "esrb_rating": null}
