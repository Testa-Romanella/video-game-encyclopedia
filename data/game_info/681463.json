Explore a growing set of highly interactive escape rooms. Move furniture, pick up and examine everything, smash pots and break locks! Supports community-made rooms through the level editor.<br/><br/><br/>Interactive Puzzles: Rummage through 15 rooms filled with puzzles designed by real-life escape room operators. If something is not nailed to the wall, you can pick it up.<br/><br/><br/>Online Co-Op: All the rooms are playable in an online co-op. We recommend to play built-in rooms with up to 3 players (but you're welcome to play with more). Community rooms have been tested with up to 20 people. Customize your character and join with friends to work-out puzzles together. More heads are better than one!<br/><br/><br/>Examine Everything: Read through books, examine ancient artifacts and find clues to riddles. Need to cross-reference a clue? No, problem - just pin it to the screen.<br/><br/><br/>Community-Made Rooms: The game includes a room editor with which you can design your own escape rooms and puzzles. Through workshop integration, you get to play awesome things the community has created.<h3>Fifteen rooms are arranged into packs:</h3><br/><strong>Labyrinth of Egypt</strong><br/>\"You and your mentor discovered the ancient Labyrinth of Egypt.
