While making his way to the exit circle.\u00a0Some of the tiles you cannot collect, while others do strange things...</p>\n<p>Beware\u00a0most tiles will disappear once Moosh has passed over them.</p>\n<p>Every\u00a0level can be completed within the time limit. If it seems impossible,\u00a0wait around a while...</p>\n\n<p>Stranded was my\u00a0first 'proper'\u00a0machine-code game for the Spectrum, back in the late 1980's when I was\u00a0still at school. Although I'd done POKEs for magazines, and\u00a0some nice\u00a0sprite routines, this was what it was all leading up to.</p>\n<p>Written using\u00a0the McGraw-Hill assembler, which came along with a book teaching Z80,\u00a0it proved to me that I could, in a small way, write games like Ultimate\u00a0did where character movement was pixel-smooth and graphics not limited\u00a0to the 21 UDGs available from BASIC.</p>\n<p>Looking back at\u00a0it development was a nightmare - all the code was\u00a0stored in separate files on tape, and that keyboard really wasn't good\u00a0for typing on, whatever Sir Clive might have said at the time!</p>\n<p>Finally finished\u00a0in 1989 (I had to do my exams!) it was very basic, and\u00a0didn't find a publisher, but I was very proud of it all the\u00a0same. Many\u00a0years later a friend told me of Cronosoft, and how they wanted new\u00a0Spectrum games, so I sent it to Simon, and the rest is history...</p>\n\n<p><strong>RetroGamer</strong> - \"<em>Stranded\u00a0is another solid release from Cronosoft</em>\" - 7/10</p>\n<p><strong>RGCD</strong>\u00a0- \"<em>the game\u00a0is nice\u00a0little puzzler that is well worth the \u00a31.75 download cost</em>\"\u00a0- 71%</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f34/f347c71b1a5347825d5da1f941587019.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bob's Stuff"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
