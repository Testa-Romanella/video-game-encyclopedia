You take on the role of a lone r\u014dnin, a clanless samurai who wanders through a small village which has recently been invaded by a horde of demons who have taken up residence in the village pagoda.<br/><br/>The townsfolk, though weary and defeated, will offer whatever assistance they can while you ascend the pagoda. Armed with only your wooden training sword, you must fight your way through an endless tide of demons to reach the top and confront their general. Be sure to stock up on valuable items from the town\u2019s blacksmith and item merchant as each level is cleared.<h3>Features:</h3><ul><li>Randomly Generated Dungeons<br/></li><li>Up-gradable equipment<br/></li><li>Deadly monsters and enemies on every floor<br/></li><li>An evolving story as you progress through the dungeon<br/></li><li>No In App Purchases or Advertisements<br/></li><li>Available for PC / Mac / Linux</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T02:11:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d83/d83554c6eb08d2975fa940592beb69ed.jpg", "website": "http://elektri.ca/vagrant-sword", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Elektri"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Elektri"], "esrb_rating": null}
