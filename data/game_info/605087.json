When one night, the Baker is awoken by a strange feeling, they venture outside to see the religious leader leave the town in a sort of trance, and vanish beyond the barrier. Perhaps this is what is happening to everyone?</p>\n<p>After the town discusses some heavy decisions they must make, the Baker is thrust beyond, and they must find their way back before it's too late.</p>\n<p><strong>Game Jam:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game was made in 15 days for the Neophyte Studios Narrative Game Jam #3.
