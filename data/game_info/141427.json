Over the years I have learned programming through self study. This game is an accumulation of what I have learned. I have programmed and drawn everything myself all artwork is original except for the earth. </p><p>The game is controlled by mouse. Left click to shoot. On the top left is your ship health and on the top right is your shield strength. Lastly on the bottom left is your radar and remaining enemy waives beside it.</p><p>To see how my game has progressed check out my YouTube playlist at game progress<br/></p><p> I have included two files one is a single run-time executable or exe and the other is a zip file. </p><p>This demo is free but the developer accepts your support by letting you donate what you would like to support the project.</p><p>music tracks<br/>Cut and Run Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) <br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/<br/><br/>Overworld Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) <br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d31/d318eb1aa041b7f5e02b52b2b2f76a8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mojo jojo"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
