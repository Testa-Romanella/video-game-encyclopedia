In this game, you will be playing as a ball that keeps moving forward and it is your job to not fall off any of the planks and to avoid the obstacles. This game is all about timing. You gotta make sure you jump from plank to plank and jump over the obstacles. You might have to play each level several times to be able to master the timing for each jump. It may get a little frustrating, but that is part of the whole experience. Now, are you up for the challenge?!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/700/7002264d9267be11398a49e8d8f1924b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["TeamBallRun"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
