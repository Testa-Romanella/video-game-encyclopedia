That is now a **Future me problem**!</p>\n<p>Stack hundreds (ok, there are 15) of different items on your trash pile. Push your skills to the limit until the pile falls over. Or just accept your fate and take the trash outside to receive your final score. And then brag about how much trash you managed to stack on a single pile.</p>\n<p>Enough of frantic trash stacking in challenge mode? Relive a glorious week of trash duty prevention in story mode.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>This game is a submission to the ludum dare 50 game jam. It was following the theme \"delay the inevitable\".
