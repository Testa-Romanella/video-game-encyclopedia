Scientists have found a possible cure to this virus only through boosting the performance rate of white blood cells. Play as a small white blood cell in the human body as you are now upgraded with new and unusual abilities. KEVIS-21 is more than just a virus, it's a synthetic bio weapon that creates smaller viruses that specifically attack white blood cells. As you play through the game, you will encounter multiple waves of strange pathogens that will try to attack you. Protect yourself as you use your weapons or antibodies such as plasma guns, auto turrets and flamethrowers. Each wave of viruses will increase in difficulty as you progress through the game. For example some viruses explode if you come too close to them. Others may shoot projectiles to slow you down or disable your weapons. Your goal is to survive and protect yourself at all costs until you reach the end goal of defeating KEVIS-21.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T06:12:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc4/dc4556dc16b2f7060cc5e4e86c9d2cee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Monarch Interactive"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
