Why don't I make a game?\u00a0So with very little modeling experience and even less programming experience I set about to do just that. I decided from the start that rather then making all of the art assets myself and compromising a larger game for a small one. I decided to use the Unreal Marketplace as a crutch for my small amount of experience, and choose to rely on the skill I do have some experience in, assembling\u00a0environments. So I did that, I started building a fantastical world of sci-fi blended with medieval.\u00a0\u00a0With the game far from done, some of my friends asked for a demo... and here we are. The RAGGid holiday demo from Radius (My legally nonexistent company, aka me).</p>\n<p>This demo includes basic gameplay mechanics of the game, including basic parkour systems, super jump, ragdoll, and slow motion. And exploration of course.</p>\n<p>Runics:</p>\n<p>You can find three Runics in this early demo. Runics are vaults of lore hidden around the game in out of the way places. They are not yet functional in this demo, but if you find them you can always come back for them in the final version.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>W,A,S,D = Movement<br/></p>\n<p>Shift = Sprint</p>\n<p>Space = Jump (Duh) can be used to jump and grab onto higher ledges\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hold jump = Super jump (Jump height can be controlled by duration of button press)</p>\n<p>Z = Slow Motion</p>\n<p>Alt = Crouch</p>\n<p>Double click alt = Roll</p>\n<p>X = Rag doll</p>\n<p>R = Respawn</p>\n<p>Hold down C = Switch from third and first person (First person not fully supported)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T03:34:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fdb/fdb539446ac415ee0286d420cb644fe6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lam0rak"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
