Leading up to this LDJAM I had an idea of what I was going to do, which isn't my normal plan of attack... regardless, the pre planned idea didn't fit at all with the theme! So instead I've made a game loosely based on an Adventure Time episode called Dungeon Train. You are stuck in an infinite loop traveling through the train carriages. Each time you progress forwards, the enemies get a little bit harder.</p>\n<p>I had a lot of things planned, such as an inventory, changeable armour, lots more scenery etc... but you know... time!</p>\n<p>Biggest thing I would like to have sorted out was to make the enemies only see you if they are facing you. They currently have eyes in the back of their heads!</p>\n<p>Move: A,D - left and right arrow keys<br/>Jump: W - up arrow key<br/>Attack: Space</p>\n<p>Health potions restore 20% of you health. If you health is full, they will give you some experience.</p>\n<p>Experience effects your attack power. And your health increases as you progress through the carriages.</p>\n<p>There is a lack of balance... you have been warned!</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy it :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T06:04:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4db/4db7d8c6d815b5fd0fbfc58bbb791a33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Odd Socks"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
