{"id": 959881, "slug": "mistrogue-mist-and-the-living-dungeons", "name": "MISTROGUE: Mist and the Living Dungeons", "name_original": "MISTROGUE: Mist and the Living Dungeons", "description": "'MISTROGUE: Mist and the Living Dungeons' is a<strong> Realtime-Dungeon-Generating Action Rogue-like game</strong> characterized by the<strong> 'Living Dungeons' </strong>- where the structure dynamically changes in front of your eyes. You fight through the dungeons using vital equipment and skills, and the 'Maze Stone', which enables you to modify the structure to your advantage.<h3>1. \u3000Attack and defense with the living dungeon, Tension from having everything change in real-time!</h3><br/><br/><br/>The 'living dungeons' will respond to Mist's actions and create gimmicks again and again, right there and then. There may be platforms with enemies or treasure boxes on them that suddenly appear when you approach them, bridges that collapse once you cross them, floor that moves in all directions, terrain that allows you to go up and down using elevations, etc. There are places where you may risk tumbling from the path if you run with all your might, but on the other you can use dodge to roll and go across the spot.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Due to the strange powers of the living dungeons, Mist's level will be reset every time he enters the dungeon. If Mist is defeated in the midst of exploration, some items and money obtained in that run will be lost. As mentioned previously, the dungeons' structures change constantly, so players must not let their guard down during exploration.<h3>2.\u3000Strategic and action combat in one package</h3><br/><br/><br/>Players can use items and change their equipment in the middle of a battle. Choose your equipment and spell books carefully depending on the situation. However, items and skills have cooldown time, so you cannot use them continuously in succession. You can gather a large number of enemies in one spot then stun them all at once with a spell book, or use knockback attacks to make enemies fall down.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Use the item 'Maze Stone' or special skills from certain equipment to create retreat paths, or drop footholds along with the enemies on the footholds at your own discretion. Freely utilize the unique puzzle aspects to clear the maze.<h3>3. \u3000Find your own strongest build!</h3> <br/><br/><br/>Mist can equip four types of equipment: weapons, shields, bangles, and rings. Weapons, shields, and bangles have inherent skills. Effectively mix and match these skills to increase the synergy between skills multiple times. Using this feature, players can progress their exploration with their own strongest builds to match their own preferences or the enemies they are facing, such as an attacker-type build with critical rate raise to the limits, thief-type build that specializes in ailments and agility, or tank-type build that specializes in defense and healing.<br/>While rings do not have any skill, they will raise specific parameters. Ring drops are completely random, so players must look for the most suitable ring for their build if they wish to optimize.<h3>Synopsis</h3><br/><br/><strong>The Maze has come to life\u2026</strong><br/>The stage of this game is a labyrinth left behind by a kingdom that is said to have reached its peak of prosperity a long time ago. When this kingdom was on the brink of extinction, they narrowly succeeded in confining the disaster in the labyrinth. However, due to the 'sealing magic' placed on it - a forbidden magic that constantly changes its shape, it is filled with life and has its own will. Eventually, the entire country was swallowed up by the dungeon, and the kingdom disappeared overnight. <br/><br/>A long time has passed since then. Mist, who lives in Lootgar, a town where treasure hunters gather, sets out to explore 'Living Dungeons' in search of the whereabouts of his missing father.<h3>Characters</h3><br/><br/><br/>Mist (main character)<br/>One of the treasure hunters living in Lootgar; the town where adventurers and treasure hunters gather.
