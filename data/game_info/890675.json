Mostly made this for a bit of experience, but releasing it and having others possibly play it sounded like fun so here we are.\u00a0<br/>Bees'N'Trees, or as I should have renamed it, Slingy Bee, is a casual game taking a lot of inspiration from Flappy Bird, though with slingshot controls. Though I originally intended to have the bee sling in the opposite direction of where you are pulling, I felt players could get stuck in the corners/ edges, so I opted to a sort of sling pull control scheme.\u00a0<br/><br/>Hope you enjoy &lt;3<br/><br/><strong>Controls:</strong> Click/ tap on the bee and drag in the direction you wish to sling it, then release.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>Goal:</strong> Go for a highscore and don't touch the vines at the top and bottom of the screen.<br/><br/><strong>Bugs:</strong> Good chance there will be some, I know that the game is a bit of a mess and different resolutions, this would be because I had my phones resolution as the base for the game an tried to get it to a state where it would look ok on other devices.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T09:26:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c73/c73a75ce21e50f92d8080716b9896b7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["Kronegade22"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
