New zones, new enemies, new upgrades, new Mechanics, new a lot of things! Right now there is only one playable room available but we think it's already a lot of potential for hours of fun and rage. We're already working on adding more rooms in a near future. <br/><br/>///////// PLANS FROM NOW ON /////////<br/>This is a list of changes the game will surely get in the future.<br/>The first changes on this list are some of the most important in our eyes and will be done really soon.</p>\n<p>From the closest change to the latest:<br/>- Add some new interesting Levels;<br/>- Add proper QWERTY support;<br/>- Finish Sound Designing the game;<br/>- Add Music;<br/>- Better Fullscreen/Windowed support;<br/>- A proper lobby (A playable non-combat room, used as some immersive menu);<br/>- New content through new interesting mechanics;</p>\n<p>///////// FOLLOW US /////////<br/>If you want to know what's up with our game, follow us here or:<br/>https://www.facebook.com/BlueBirb/</p>\n<p>///////// NOTES /////////<br/>The game expects a resolution at least this large: 1920x1080 px<br/>We don't currently support other resolutions.
