They\u2019ve waited until nightfall to strike, and all you\u2019ve got is your trusty catapult and access to the local store, who has loads of stones and easy (if expensive) access to hundreds of containers of lighter fluid!<br/></p>\n<p>Left click to launch a normal boulder into the darkness, killing all of the slow-moving horrors in its vicinity.<br/>Right click to launch a flaming boulder that will disperse the darkness and reveal the terrors beneath, allowing you to pinpoint and fire directly at them. Each flaming boulder costs 1 coin.<br/>There is also a store on the right side of the screen, stowed away and recalled again with the red \u2018X\u2019. The store allows you to replenish your health, make boulder\u2019s light bigger, and purchase traps that you can place in the paths of zombies.<br/>The sorcerers have magically forced the sun to stay down forever, so your goal is simply to take out as many of the bastards as you can before you inevitably fall. Good luck!</p>\n\n\n<p>Credits:<br/>Project Lead \u2013 David Kozdra (https://github.com/DavidKozdra)<br/>Creative Director \u2013 Andrew Crosswait (https://github.com/AndrewRCrosswait)<br/>Art Director \u2013 Luke Thomson (https://github.com/floofyboi7)<br/>Game Developer \u2013 Ruel Coy\u00a0(https://github.com/Ruchox)<br/>Game Developer \u2013 James Ferry\u00a0(https://github.com/Memelock)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T03:09:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12c/12c20b1571d86b33e67a19430994cfec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Magentaautumn"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
