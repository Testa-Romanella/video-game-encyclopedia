As the perlin noise function takes in x and y values, by<strong> mutiplying</strong> the calculated constant\u00a0 value (pixel number and offset/ width or height)\u00a0with a resolution value we can effectively zoom in or out of the perlin noise map. Thus, producing more frequent and\u00a0pronounced hills and/or valleys.</li><li>The <strong>framerate has been clmaped to 10 frames per second</strong>, for the terrain, as calculations required to generate the terrain are<strong> heavy and time consuming</strong>. I also want this program to run on low-end devices well and\u00a0without heating problems</li></ul>\n<p><strong>What i learnt :</strong></p>\n<ol><li>How to manipulate and code textures.</li><li>How to code, use and map meshes( this was my first approach )</li><li>Terrain field in unity</li></ol>\n<p><strong>Scope of Improvement:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Can use meshes and vertices instead of terrains</li><li>Code can be made faster with some adjustments</li></ul>\n<p>This was one of the harder projects I've made so it was certainly interesting and i learnt a lot. I hope you found this fascinating too.</p>\n<p>ArnavM (maname)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T16:11:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94e/94eefe880bb987a084afbe45d05cd15e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["maname"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
