The Device enabled him to take over the train, and you've got to fight your way through the goons to find and destroy the Device. It'll take 3 hits, by the way. Using your lasso, hop through windows and search the train on the inside and outside\u00a0for the Device. Don't turn back, keep moving forward. Don't get too close to the cacti (they have a history of exploding).\u00a0 If you have any questions, or you'd just like to chime in about your experience with the game - please drop us a comment below! We love hearing from you, and we hope you enjoy <em>Showdown at\u00a0Desert Bus</em>!</p>\n<p><strong>Tips and Tricks</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This is a difficult game. Please read the How To Play screen. Make sure to use all of the tools at your disposal, including the lasso, the whip, and the revolver. Don't forget to regularly check the outside of the train cars for the Device spawning out there. Make every shot count, and reload as often as possible. Don't be afraid to look for opportunities to lasso your way out of danger. When you get your combo up, killing enemies restores health. It's a good idea to try and restore your health to full before launching yourself back into the danger zone.</p>\n<p><strong>Known Issues</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, few game jam games are without bugs, and this is no exception. Loading the game can take up to about a minute. Your lasso stays captured around destroyed enemies and objects. You can get turned over, so don't be afraid to use your reset button. Your camera phases through walls, so try not to get caught in corners or it'll become difficult to see. If you can't defeat the Device in 50 train cars, you will run out of train to spawn - on average, it shouldn't be an issue to win before that. (If you can actually survive 50 train cars, then you shouldn't have any problem beating the game.) If cacti stop spawning, don't worry about that - you can continue playing as normal. When you win the game, the controller input may not work for you in the won-the-game menu: it should work everywhere else.
