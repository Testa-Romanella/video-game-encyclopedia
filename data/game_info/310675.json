Entering in a lobby, you can choose out of four worlds: three tensive minigames, each one consisting of one cultural aspect of China, and one RPG map where you encounter people with problems: either the deadly smog that is present, or the suspicious and mysterious \"monastery\", or... You, George, have to help as much people with problems as possible, but you also have to watch out for any problems during your time in China!</p>\n<p>The game is made for a school project.
