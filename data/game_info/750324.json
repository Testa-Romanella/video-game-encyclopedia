Cory has absolutely no recollection of his days before he was eight years old, but for the years after, he has lived peacefully with his aunt with no troubles.</p>\n<p>One night, his aunt goes to Winterveer and does not return home for at least two weeks. Cory, not used to being alone for such an amount of time, takes it upon himself to venture out to the city and find her himself. It quickly becomes evident, however, that this trek is not going to be as easy as he thought. His simple journey to Winterveer will reveal itself to be the path of a horrible darkness, and one that seems to have a purpose in helping Cory remember his past.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2007-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-05T20:19:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff4/ff460253764da5987fc951601e66dad4.jpg", "website": "https://rpgmaker.net/games/263/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
