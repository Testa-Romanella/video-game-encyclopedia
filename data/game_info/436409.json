Player 1, the researcher, uses a mouse and keyboard to move around and control the first person camera. Player 2, Binky, flies around and uses their Magnet ability to repair the broken parts of the facility and make a path for the researcher to traverse to the next area. Both players have the same game screen, so this game requires cooperation and communication to get to the end of each section. Binky Saves the World was created for the 2020 Global Game Jam, and is continuing to be worked on, and will feature an original score by May.</p><p>This game Requires a Keyboard &amp; Mouse for Player 1, and a Playstation or Xbox Controller for Player 2<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-27T03:01:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c8/7c8c012a8a8015e983b9dbc45d483295.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["1010meha"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
