Unfortunate for some, maybe, but for you, there is a ride on the iconic Rambler ride coming. It's just going to take a little hard work...</p>\n<p>Ride the Rambler is a casual assembly simulation with a twist. With minimal instruction, you must assemble an amusement ride from parts scattered around the scene and then enjoy a ride. Ride again in day or night then build again in day or night.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Includes partial game pad/controller support. Dual stick controllers, like Xbox and PlayStation, *should* work without issue for game play and UI control. It does not include controller mapping. Keyboard and mouse will always work.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T02:30:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cae/caecb44aa9f9d9a4052b3411a9c9c52f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Willow Lake Studio"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
