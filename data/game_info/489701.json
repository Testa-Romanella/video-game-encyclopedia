Play in 3 different modes at sea, air and gun, and defeat enemy units, save your crew from enemy air raids and recapture strategically important targets.</p>\n<p>Pacific Knights is the brainchild of two 3D artists (Daniel Br\u00fcck &amp; Todor Vankov) who have joined forces to improve their Unreal Engine skills and gain experience in the game development pipeline. Therefore we created the majority of the assets and blueprints ourselves. <br/></p>\n<p>We hope that we could entertain you with our little project for a few minutes and would be very happy about your feedback.</p>\n<p>Dodumentation : https://todorvankov.com/pacific-knights-2<br/></p>\n<p>Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/pacific_knights/<br/></p>\n\n<p>the system requirements are not yet final.
