The story underwent subversive changes after the original paper prototype. The game is originally full of mockeries of stereotypes, but since playtesters point out that the characters are unfriendly and not introduced properly, we made a much milder version of the presentation.</p><p>Designers - Ivan Pu &amp; Sylvia Shu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T10:31:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b11/b11be2addc30ee8ead3f8863c9f5a77c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ivan_blank"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
