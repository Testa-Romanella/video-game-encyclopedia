It was also to showcase personal development in these areas and address skill gaps to increase my employability.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is a first-person controlled walk in the park, with an added modicum of challenge. The idea was to make a stage that the player will know how to traverse, with no prior context or explanation. Similar to <em>Journey</em> (2012), a towering point of interest is visible in the distance, indicating your destination and beckoning you towards it. It demonstrates a key understanding of level design principles and features a range of 3D assets I modelled to breathe life into the scene. As it was my first time modelling in Blender, I focused on making low-poly models for scope.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T13:08:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b4/1b4b24dcd78fd6a8a051c9a15b59cc59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JamesRhodes96"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
