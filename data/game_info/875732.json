You must reset the game (with shift + F8) and try again. The sprites usually appear if you wait around 2 seconds before pressing start.</p>\n\n<p>CREDITS</p>\n<p>DANIEL TURNER - PROGRAMMING</p>\n<p>MCSWEG - MODELLING</p>\n<p>MARMAR - MUSIC</p>\n<p>GREG EDWARDS - SOUND EFFECTS</p>\n<p>DAYWALKER - SPRITES</p>\n<p>JUSTINF - LEVEL DESIGN</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T14:44:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6b/d6b9df40bb478b3d00f7d02d149c02aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hendo's box of mystery", "jfanzo", "marwastaken", "Midnight Mirage"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
