This includes but is not limited to scrolling backrounds, player collision stuffs, re-learning how to do text and numbers and such as well as controller stuff. Figuring out music, a little better sprite and color management, and that just when you think you're all done and ready to publish... You may or may not have a couple hours more work to put into it to get it even working properly. But don't give up! Thats the biggest thing I learned. Push through and you'll be glad you did.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I plan on updating this perhaps periodically just with little enhancements here and there but the LameBoy will be shelved until the next GBJAM I decide to partake in.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T05:35:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/594/594552926cf1a08b6e737ef210406b5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Lloyds Dev Corner"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
