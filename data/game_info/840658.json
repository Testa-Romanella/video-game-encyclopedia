The player character is moved with the left joystick, the camera with the right joystick, and with the A button can jump. If the A button is held down the player can perform a high jump, and pressing the button again while in the air will cause them to start/stop floating. The Back button closes the game.</p>\n<p>If you want to read more about this project or view some of my other projects, please check out my portfolio.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T16:21:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a1/4a139b1d8930e799cc2d5ac4eff9dd34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MeyerLeah"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
