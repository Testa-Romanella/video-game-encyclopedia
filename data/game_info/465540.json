So using a map give your SMAHT CAH a list of instructions to follow then watch as it does your bidding! The SMAHT CAH waits a full second before performing the next command, and then loops when it has reached the end of its command list.\u00a0If you've plotted your course correctly then groceries are your bounty. If not, well... maybe you'll get lucky?</p>\n<p>Your commands are: drive (go straight), accelerate, brake, veer left, veer right, turn left, and turn right. Use everything at your own risk!</p>\n<p>Note there's no sound for this game. So feel free to make your own.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Art and code: Neil Bonsteel</p>\n<p>Additional art: Gutty Kreum</p>\n<p>Many thanks to GMTK, GML, chat for keeping me company, and @Zas_ for saving my butt on more than one occasion.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Find me on Twitter @MayorMcFrumples.
