{"id": 273805, "slug": "ishi", "name": "ISHI", "name_original": "ISHI", "description": "<p>ISHI was created in 48 hours for the LD 43: \"Sacrifices Must be Made\".</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: There is a spirit ending! You have to find out where to click! :D Also, there are two kinda secret endings if you play around with balancing the constitution.<br/></p>\n<p>It's a bite-size existential pet simulator. Given its meditative constitution, if you've been struggling with intrusive thoughts or anything depressive recently, I don't recommend playing it.</p>\n<p>My intention was to offer some relief for these kinds of feelings and thoughts through the interaction of a \"pet\" (I guess pretty much everyone will have to deal with them sooner or later), but my writing may not be the best for many people. So be warned.</p>\n<p>If you do play ISHI, I hope you can enjoy it with tranquility.<br/>Peace.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>art and code by maruki: http://twitter.com/marukihurakami</p>\n<p>nyx8 palette by Javier Guerrero:\u00a0https://twitter.com/Xavier_Gd/</p>\n<p>Mini Pixel font by eitoa:\u00a0https://eitoa.itch.io/</p>\n<p>song \"Carried Along\" by Zodiax: https://zodiax.newgrounds.com/<br/>song \"Sweet Dreams\" by snokums: https://opengameart.org/users/snokums<br/>CSS only particle system by Robin Selmer: https://codepen.io/robinselmer/pen/mRjoXr<br/>CSS only Gradient Buttons with Background-Color Change by Captain Anonymous: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/dQaNBO</p>\n<p>thanks to sugoidev for the always awesome husbandry, company and proofreading</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92e/92edee8ec3ea4ac70ce83f5fffb45a8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["maruki"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
