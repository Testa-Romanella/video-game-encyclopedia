Alcoholics,\u00a0addicts and hobos love this place, the rest of the people - not so much. What can possibly be the reason? And why no one finishes the building?\u00a0Clearly, a dark power involved. This must be the forest near the building, and all the evil spirits living in there.</p>\n<p>The game is pretty short, only three floors of enemies, can be finished in minutes once you adapt to the pace and placement.</p>\n<p>This game is made in Leadwerks engine, and the only thing that is not made by me is weapons.\u00a0Also it has primitive saving system, which was implemented because I doubted if the game will run without any crashes. So you can continue from the last level if something happens or you just need to exit.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T04:23:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19a/19aa2b75f8c1603ea184c4eedceccd69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Span_King"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
