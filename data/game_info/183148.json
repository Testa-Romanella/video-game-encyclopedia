This game was a humble one, with simple moves and mechanics. It also featured music produced by Harrison Hall. It had original sprites created by George Antash and maps created by a collaboration between Harrison and George. Jacky Wong (LavaScribe) put together these resources and did a bulk of the programing for the game.</p><p>After Horry County Schools's 2014 Technology Fair, Harrison left the project and George and Jacky created Verge of Heroes. We implemented the skills we learned while creating Rage and created a refined fighting game.</p><p>After a year of work, we entered Verge of Heroes in the 2015 Technology Fair and won second place in our category.</p><p>This is that game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e12/e126e63643c2f731a5d5455853362391.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LavaScribe"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
