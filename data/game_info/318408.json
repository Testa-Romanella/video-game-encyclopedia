If you want to support us we'd rather have you buy one of our T-shirts or something!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHave fun exploring and grouping up with other adventurers, or going your own way!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWouter<br/>\r\nSenior snake charmer", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:45:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/584/58437eaf8de71c3477f47f306e09a4ed.jpg", "website": "http://www.wvv-games.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WVV Games"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Casual", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["WVV Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
