However what i tried to make was\u00a0 a twist on the classic snakes game by adding walls and assets to confuse the player. Primarily what i wanted was traps and bots that attack the player.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please be kind lol. This is my first attempt and I underestimated the value of planning as i changed the game idea so many times it left me with 5 hours to code and as i am am not experienced i was rushing and came across a lot of snags where i was unable to add a lot of the mechanics and basic gameplay i wanted.</p>\n<p>please give me comments on the game as i would love the feedback.</p>\n<p>thanks</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92d/92d21af8a0a95143a03c2dddbbe0b90f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tahmim"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
