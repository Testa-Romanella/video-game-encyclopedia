While the infinite circle is only the age and civilisation, the endless is the lighthouse of death.</p>\n\r\nDark Forest\r\n<em>\"The universe is a dark forest in which hell is other people, an eternal threat, and any being that reveals its existence will soon be destroyed.\"</em>\n<p>The installation is based on the laws of the Dark Forest, with the heads of separated beings fixed to the installation to show the tragic consequences of breaking the laws of the forest, alluding to the core law of the Dark Forest that \"<em>Hell is other people</em>\".\r\n</p>\n\r\nThe Sword Bearer\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>It is both a wall-facer and a wall-breaker, even can be a forest hunter facing far above its own civilisational hierarchy without falling apart. This installation presents a first-perspective view of a direct confrontation with the alien and the higher civilisation behind it by way of a stairway to the sky, giving a more visual and oppressive sensory experience.</p>\n\n\r\nProject Asset Sources\r\n3D Meshes\r\n<p>'Robotic Arm - Brazo Robotico' by\u00a0pcorralr (https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/robotic-arm-brazo-robotico-e10b8ba5105b4d5c9ff5b... )\u00a0</p>\n<p>'Female base mesh' by Drazen (https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/female-base-mesh-b6389ae82f044dbe9945c4dad2cd72a... )</p>\n<p>'Male Head' by Alexander Antipov (https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/male-head-0247a25a04ba46b99629130277fe39b7\u00a0)</p>\n\r\nUnity Assets\r\n<p>'Oculus Integration' by Oculus (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/oculus-integration-82022\u00a0)</p>\n<p>'Fast Mobile Planar Reflection URP VR AR LWRP v1.3' by\u00a0Rufat's ShaderLab (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fast-mobile-planar-reflection-...\u00a0)</p>\n<p>'Volumetric_Light_Beam_v1.99' by\u00a0Tech Salad (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/volumetric-light-beam-99888)</p>\n\r\nTextures\r\n<p>https://ambientcg.com/view?id=Marble016\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://ambientcg.com/view?id=Metal008\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://ambientcg.com/view?id=Plaster001\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://ambientcg.com/view?id=Pipe003\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://ambientcg.com/view?id=Concrete019\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://ambientcg.com/view?id=Metal029\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://ambientcg.com/view?id=PaintedMetal004\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://ambientcg.com/view?id=Metal024\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://ambientcg.com/view?id=MetalPlates008\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://ambientcg.com/view?id=Tiles074</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T18:16:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bcb/bcbb7fa961fb98332978b2e0cd6b6819.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Johnny Zhonghao Liang"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
