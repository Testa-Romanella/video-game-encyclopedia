Left-click for melee attack (must be standing next to an enemy).<br/>- Switch active character with tab.<br/>- WASD moves the camera around.<br/>- press and hold left alt to enter ranged mode, click on enemy to shoot them. Click on yourself to reload.<br/>- press E to immediately end your turn.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY:</strong></p>\n<p>The game is turn-based. You control two characters and your goal is to destroy a diamond present on the other side of the room.</p>\n<p>The game ends if at least one of your player characters dies, or if you destroy the diamond.</p>\n<p>If you have played the new XCom series, you should be familiar with the movement/attach approach that I used in the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You have two pseudo-action points (APs) at your disposal each turn. You can use them to\u00a0<br/>- move to a different tile (green range movement takes 1 AP, orange: 2 APs)<br/>- perform a ranged attack (requires at least 1 AP, but always depletes APs pool completely)<br/>- perform a melee attack\u00a0 (does not require AP, but always depletes APs pool completely)</p>\n<p>To be able to perform a melee attack with your sword, you must stand next to your enemy.</p>\n<p>To be able to perform a ranged attack with your rifle, you must have a line of sight to the enemy.</p>\n<p><strong>COVER SYSTEM:</strong><br/>If you are right next to a crate, and the crate is between you and enemy, the enemy only has 50% chance to hit you using their ranged attack.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a01/a018ee0ef67b8bfbcf592eb349d9881d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["bryqu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
