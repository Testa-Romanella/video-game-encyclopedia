This year's theme was \"Home\", so me and  JSAniken made a game about packing up your things after leaving home.</p>\n<p>[CONTROLS]<br/>Single-click objects to pick them up or put them down. You can't put down objects if they are overlapping another object, or if some parts are sticking out of the packing area. Once no objects remain outside of the packing area the next level will begin.<br/>The goal of the game is to decide what to pack in your limited carry space and what to throw away. You can't take everything with you, so be careful!<br/><br/>There are five endings total based on what objects you decide to pack, see if you can get them all!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T05:18:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/307/3074402392ca4512232f1fb0fe8e516a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["AhoyItsPhil"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
