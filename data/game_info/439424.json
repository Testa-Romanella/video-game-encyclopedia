(Your wombat was left there to entertain your grandpa since he was complaining how boring retired life is) You must go and bring them back to where you live.</p>\n<p>Gather allies and tools to protect yourself and your team in order to prepare for the trip! You will meet a variety of people and creatures on your way, and make sure to look out for strange symbols or numbers, which might be of use later. Interact with as many objects as possible to see if you need them.
