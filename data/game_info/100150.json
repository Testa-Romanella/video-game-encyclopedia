What's uploaded here is the final submission for the student project.</p><p>We began work on a major refactor and more thorough art concepting to push for a full release, but had to cancel after several months. An extremely similar game came out, and we decided that continuing down this path would be a bad business decision. We have been exploring more ideas to expand on for future projects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/faf/fafb18b595bef4a7072c76dc86fbc6f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KevKev"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
