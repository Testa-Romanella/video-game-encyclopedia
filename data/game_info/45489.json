Embrace your rage!    You can't play as a goat here, but at least there is a knife.\u00b7 Not a horror game, nor a survival game.    It's kind of a puzzle game with very simple puzzles suitable for novices.\u00b7 It once won the 1st prize in an online event in China.    So at least some people thought it's a good game.\u00b7 It's short.    You have enough time to play it through and then ask for refund.<br/>    Reason for not doing so: I beg you not.<br/><br/>P.S.
