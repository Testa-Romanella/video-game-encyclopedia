{"id": 909626, "slug": "3d-fps-spook", "name": "3D FPS SPOOK", "name_original": "3D FPS SPOOK", "description": "<p>This is a part Horror part Shooter whereby one goes around the map to try and eliminate the 7 ghosts before expending all your ammo. This game was made in unity and can be played on web browsers.</p>\n<p>You are able to move using WASD and shoot with left mouse button. You also have a flashlight attached to your gun. There are certain prompts players must use to open doors.\u00a0Enemies differ in health but after getting shot a certain amount of times will disappear, if they get to close however it leads to game over and players will have to start for the beginning of the map. Enemies spawn in certain location depending on where the player is located.</p>\n<p>The players must make sure not to waste ammo, this is limited for the entire duration and the player is unable to pick up any more, more sure to preserve your ammo otherwise the next ghost you meet will be your last.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game has aspects of both a shooter and a horror game, i wanted to achieve a certain tension while playing this short level, and i hope this is somewhat translated with the haunty mood of the game.</p>\n<p>While not directly inspired by any games, I wanted to make a somewhat basic classic horror game, at least a pocket section of one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T19:51:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2d/f2d00e6c30671a68033f389206859834.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zebbie"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
