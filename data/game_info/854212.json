Or maybe you just like smashing stuff? We know the feeling, but property damage is against the law. Fortunately for you, this monkey doesn't care!\u00a0</p>\n<p>No More Monkey Business is a fast-paced top-down destruction game set in a stylized monkey verse. Punch, throw and slam your way through 4 levels of colourful office floors while avoiding the monkey police. The game was built by a team of 14 people for a 7-week long course at FutureGames.\u00a0We were tasked with a theme of historical \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios and chose to imagine what the world would look like if humans had never evolved. What if monkeys did business? Our greatest inspirations were the destruction from the Just Cause and GTA franchises with the style of Going Under.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p>WASD - Movement\u00a0</p>\n<p>Left click - Punch/Throw\u00a0</p>\n<p>Right click - Pickup\u00a0</p>\n<p>Space - Jump attack</p>\n\n<p><strong>THE TEAM:</strong></p>\n<p>Andy Lampert</p>\n<p>Dave van Egdom</p>\n<p>Erik Larsson</p>\n<p>Halld\u00f3r K.
