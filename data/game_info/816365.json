That means you'll get your typical rogue-like experience (Randomized stages, equipment, battle bending curses, multiple choices, brutal bosses), but you'll keep your loot, unique heroes, and upgrades forever.<br/><br/>The Castle itself is full of mysteries, deadly traps, treasures, and enemies. It is rumored that Castle Greyrot is a living being that changes its location every 10 years and corrupts its surroundings wherever it goes. It welcomes every guest adventurer and feeds on their souls.<br/><br/>As an experienced Commander, you are summoned to engage in a raid on Castle Greyrot.<br/>With mercenaries on your side, you're about to venture to the Castle and destroy the unknown evil force within.<br/><br/><br/><strong><h3>Class-based Tactical RPG</h3></strong>16 Classes to pick from. Starting with Cleric, Thief, Warrior, and Wizard. Yes, our returning hero Time Mage is here as well.
