From the fireball that can burn an entire forest to summoning the rain that will grow the flora around, this game offers many different miracles. As you keep playing, you can unlock even more impressive miracles like throwing meteors or resurrecting the dead. You can even share them by ordaining priests.<h3> A living island </h3><br/>You play on a procedurally generated voxel island you can modify it to your liking. The island is composed of a wide flora and fauna. The game offers simulated seasons where the plants bloom appropriately. Everything on the island is trying to survive and will react to your actions. Using the physics engine you can throw anything around. You can help, hinder or simply watch the creatures on the island.<h3> Care for your people </h3>Your power comes from the faith of your people. Their belief will vary based on their living conditions. Are they fed ? Do they have shelter ? Are they being mangled by a hungry wolf ? The happier they are the more they will believe in you. Take care of them even when they die, you must reap their soul to prevent them from becoming angry ghosts.<h3> Expanding village </h3>Meanwhile the villagers will try to build and improve their village. You can influence their actions by terraforming the ground. And help them gather the necessary resources and even help them build their little economy. You can\u2019t directly choose the building. But you can destroy any building you don\u2019t agree with.<h3> Wide variety of challenges </h3>Protect your people from many dangers, from the horde of undead to abductions by an alien spaceship. There is never a dull moment. The game regularly triggers random events. You must react to those events or suffer the consequences. From invasive plants to strange astrological occurrences, you never know what\u2019s going to happen.<h3> Taking your time </h3>The game is meant as a relaxing experience. You can always restart on a new island. You keep every unlocked power. You control the difficulty of the game to fit your play style. You can choose to play a stress free experience without any random event. Or you can choose a nightmarish experience where you are expected to solve multiple problems happening at once.<h3> Speaking with me </h3>Whether you prefer Discord or Steam forum, don\u2019t hesitate to leave me a message. I am always on the lookout for feedback or cool new ideas to implement.\"", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-15T05:01:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/124/124ece72c9e9c04fff7f4caca5d744a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PIerre Nury"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pierre Nury"], "esrb_rating": null}
