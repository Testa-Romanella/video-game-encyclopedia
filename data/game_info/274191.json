Here's the description from the Ludum Dare site:</p>\n<p>Welcome, Omnipawtent Overwoofer! You have been created for one purpose and one purpose only: to oversee to the needs of the Pupreme Being themself, DogGod! In order to do your job, you must manage the fast-paced demands of organizing 3 kinds of sacrifices and dealing with countless natural disasters (signified by a warning siren and a flashing \"BLESS!!\" button to let you stop the disaster by performing a Miracle), one at a time for each continent of Followers on planet Furth: Human Sacrifice, Animal Sacrifice, and Special Sacrifice! Each type of Sacrifice will give you the related type of Sacrifice Point, which you can redeem at the Sacrifice Shop. But keep in mind that with Special Sacrifice points, while you can buy your way to temporary mood boosts for DogGod and it'll keep your Followers happier, DogGod's stats will go down faster. If you permanently satisfy DogGod, you win! If any of their stats drop to 0, though, you're fired! Can you keep up, or will you be a disappointment to your adorable creator?</p>\n<p>This was my very first game jam event &amp; I'm proud of where I got even if I had a 15 hour delay from catching up on homework, and while I don't consider it \"done\" since there's a lot more polish I want to add, it's nothing a bit of post-jam ironing out can't fix after semester's over. I was going to keep polishing and finagling up until the submission deadline, but I am so physically exhausted that I was falling asleep while playtesting it, so I'm gonna go ahead and get this submitted now. \u00a0Can't wait to go forth and play everyone's games later!</p>\n<p>Made with:<br/>Coding: GameMaker Studio 2<br/>Music: LMMS 1.1.3<br/>Sound samples (music):<br/>https://freesound.org/people/MisterTood/sounds/9032/<br/>Sound samples (sfx):<br/>https://freesound.org/people/LordForklift/sounds/448394/<br/>https://freesound.org/people/Zott820/sounds/209578/<br/>https://freesound.org/people/jamesabdulrahman/sounds/263621/ (attribution license: not modified, except for exporting from Audacity as .wav so I could actually use it)<br/>https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/410804/ (attribution license: not modified)<br/>https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/402581/ (attribution license: not modified)<br/>https://freesound.org/people/joedeshon/sounds/79677/ (attribution license: not modified)</p>\n<p>Art: MSPaint, Paint.NET, GameMaker Studio 2</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/559/559ba9f6f3c12de61a33a92c9134506b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["papabirb"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
