Goodbyes are made, some which you struggle to express. An ephemeral look at those ephemeral moments, moments that you often replay in your mind's eye and wonder how they could have ended differently. And it all starts with a simple question - how do you pack your hoodie?</em></p>\n\n<p>Hey y'all, so - this is my first foray into IF - it was mostly\u00a0written in one very late night session at library a few months back (the first line is very knowing), but since then I've been slowly tweaking it little by little, and thought I'd upload it here to see what people think, only about 5 mins, but can be played a few different times. Has some audio, but not much. Probably best played in fullscreen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T08:09:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a2/5a214910f75e456a0b75925e07805637.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jtlloyd"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
