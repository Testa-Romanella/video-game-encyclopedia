Additionally the sprites blend in somewhat with the background, I added borders to the sprites to make them visible but the WebGL build took too long and I was only able to apply the fix to the windows version before the deadline.\u00a0Download for bes results.</p>\n<p>Made in three days\u00a0for Wowie Jam 4.0 this is a puzzle platformer about an AI that helps you succeed by following your movements. Use the ghost sprite as a guide for what moves the AI will make and guide it to buttons to open the end.<br/></p>\n<p>All code, level design, audio assets, and sprite assets were created by me. The beautiful background/title screen was done by my girlfriend Aria Miller. This game was built in the Unity Engine and the audio was implemented using FMOD.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T22:31:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb1/eb131888d98aed0ee579ed305b8d899b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["AudioDread"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
