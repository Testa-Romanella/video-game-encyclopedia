There are small clouds that spawn around the planet that the player can collect. The more clouds the player collects, the more rain the cloud can produce. The clouds are stronger together.</p>\n<p>You control a cloud and your goal is to make sure that all of the planet's sectors are nice and green. You can produce rain by collecting the small clouds that pop up around the planet.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T06:28:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/355/35547f1a51131ed19ab7674a4aff5699.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nalucagames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
