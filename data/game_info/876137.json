Turns out the cult that resides here wants nothing more then your padded servitude and humiliation for their own depraved ends. Can you make it to the bottom of this diaper pail of a situation? Can you defeat the kinky cult? Or will you succumb to the curse and be forced to stay forever? Soggy Horror is a 3 \"horror\" game that doesn't take itself too seriously. Defeat puzzles, avoid the enemies, and try not to get captured by the cultists. Lights help cultists see you: Stay hidden to avoid becoming their next padded victim...\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Or don't.
