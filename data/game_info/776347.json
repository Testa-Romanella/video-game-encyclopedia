Puzzles are practically everywhere, solve them to open doors and unlock traps that will most often kill you if you're not careful.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can play Einar - Traps of Loki by keyboard or Joystick. The game was designed to have a simple and intuitive gameplay, without excessive use of buttons and keyboard shortcuts, thus creating a clean interface with a lighter gaming experience.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI hope you have a good game and that you play it again and again!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T04:56:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b3/2b31d1a10d8bc85ad8f091c35d200ef8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Monkey Indie Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Monkey Indie Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
