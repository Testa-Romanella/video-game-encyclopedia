The only thing more widespread than their monopoly is their reputation of wrongdoing. A brave band of delivery drivers fight against their tyranny: welcome to SRG.</p>\n<p>You must make your deliveries to those in need while avoiding the detection of the SUCCULENT SENTINELS. If you get caught speeding by their watchful eye, you have to start again.</p>\n<p>Seek the next delivery dropoff point using your DELIVERY FINDER. Advance the cause by making 3 deliveries as fast as you can without getting caught.</p>\n<p>Good luck!<br/><br/>CREDITS:</p>\n<p>MUSIC, SOUND, PROGRAMMING, UI\u00a0\u00a0Elliott -\u00a0 (http://elliottgrov.es)<br/><br/>PROGRAMMING, PROCEDUAL GEN\u00a0\u00a0- Erik (@acetrainererik)</p>\n<p>MODELS, TEXTURES, POSTPROCESSING - Astrobot (@thatastrobot)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T04:01:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/202/202b52e14441c9ec35b909eda47285ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Astrobot"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
