While steeped in the comedy of a lovesick singing robot, the game\u00a0encourages the questions of object love, alien love, and the\u00a0disorientation of queer\u00a0alien love that Van Veen connects directly to the\u00a0Afrofuturist imaginary.\u00a0Players can shuffle through the many songs at will while exploring the compact and isolating\u00a0science facility, floating in a kind of space/time limbo,\u00a0and meeting its other uncouth inhabitants.\u00a0Players can also shoot some hoops to pass the time while listening to the songs.</p>\n<p>As a 3-minute terminal experience, players are encouraged to play the game multiple times in order to hear all the songs, which range from comedic to tragic,\u00a0and piece together a broken narrative\u00a0of their own making based on the fragments of robot sentiment and lyrical storytelling.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>WASD \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 = movement</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Click \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0= sing\r\n</p>\n<p>E \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0= pick up (if object allows)</p>\n<p>Right Mouse Click \u00a0= throw object</p>\n<p>Note: Most apple laptops have Right Mouse Click defaulted to a two-finger click on the trackpad.</p>\n<p>Space \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0= jump</p>\n<p>Escape \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 = return to Title Screen to Quit.\r\n</p>\n<p>For more on Robot Love as Queer Love:\u00a0http://liquidblackness.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LB6-VAN-VEEN.pdf</p>\n<p>More from this developer:\u00a0https://johnvanderhoef.itch.io</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/626/62679f3af81cf4e9821390ba8a516b44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["John Vanderhoef"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
