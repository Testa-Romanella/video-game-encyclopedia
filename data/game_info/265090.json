Snood is a fun puzzle game that tests your intellect rather than your reflexes. Your goal is to save all the trapped Snoods by launching other Snoods at them. If you connect three or more Snoods, they will disappear. If that leaves any Snoods not connected to the top of the playing field, they will fall to safety. Don't take too long, though - every Snood you launch increases the danger level.<br/><br/>Play with the Classic Snoods or \"New and Improved\" Snoods!<br/><br/>Snood is simple to learn but difficult to master and therefore great for ages 2 - 102!<br/><br/>For technical support, contact us at support@irongalaxystudios.com.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:02:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/758/7580de24bf1da6b11bc841d5822c7bd6.jpg", "website": "http://www.snood.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Snood"], "genres": ["Family", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Snood"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
