After finishing you\u2019ll be asked to fill a questionnaire that takes about 10 min to complete! The questionnaire is optional but we would really appreciate if you'll take the time to do it, as it is part of our research.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game takes place during a one-shot session of a new pen and paper game between you and your friends. As usual, nobody has picked a support class so you have decided to being both a game master and a player, covering the role of the support.\r\n</p>\n<p>In this turn-based strategy game, your allies will communicate their intentions and you will need to adapt and maneuver the best possible outcome.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>There is no tutorial or onboarding so the game can be a bit rough to play, we have put a guide in the Options menu to help you understand what is going on!\r\n</p>\n<p>All you need to play is a mouse, trackpad, or similar!\r\n</p>\n<p>The game is available for both Mac Os and Windows.\r\n</p>\n<p>Please if you have any questions, feel free to contact us at:\r\n</p>\n<p>Fabio Murru - famu@itu.dk\r\n</p>\n<p>Marco Romoli - marro@itu.dk</p>\n<p>Massimiliano Masala - masma@itu.dk</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T09:03:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/639/639f286703612cc55505e71e1c083100.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Murrik", "Massi", "Marco Romoli"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
