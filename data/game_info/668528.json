I wish I could make the window resizable but the way the UI library is set up, I don't think it's possible without some headaches.</p>\n<p>Please give this masterpiece a try if you want an original Kraby<strong>TM</strong> experience.<br/>P.S: the game is in french, but you don't need need to know french to play.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Strategy Tips</strong></p>\n<p>The game is pretty hard (probably impossible unless very favorable enemy generation), but here are some tips to survive until floor 5 :</p>\n<ul><li>Stat priority is probably : attack &gt; defense &gt; agility. Attack is everything in this game, defense is almost equally as important, but agility is not <em>that</em> important, but do not let it drop too low, or enemies will crit you every turn.</li><li>Keeps your gear up to date</li><li>Stack up food for when you're in a pinch</li><li>Consuming food does not uses turns</li><li>At each floor, there's 1 enemy specialized in each stat (attack, defense, agility)</li><li>Kill EVERY enemy on each floor, or at least 90% of them, becomes more important each floor as the exp gained doesn't follow the level gap you might encounter on the next floor if you are unlucky</li><li>Equipment types (weapon/shield/amulet) do not matter at all regarding stat distribution</li><li>You can equip gear with high defense, heal up, and reequip gear with lower defense, your HP will not decrease (you can have more HP than your HP limit, e.g. 2000/1500 HP</li><li>For non-french speakers, important words you cannot guess :\r\n<ul><li>passer tour=skip turn</li><li>ramasser=pick up</li><li>niveau=level</li><li>arme=weapon, bouclier=shield</li><li>(CC) = Coup Critique = Critical Hit, PV=HP</li><li>Jeter=drop</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Kraby: main logic,\u00a0sprites\u00a0and tileset, floor\u00a01,\u00a03\u00a0and\u00a05 level design<br/>0cto: user interface, floor 2 level design<br/>Headache: floor 4 level design<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T06:46:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f8/4f8589cf900c3b77591fe1972f1ca94e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Kraby"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
