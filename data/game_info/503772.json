We ended up incorporating the theme by having the dungeon loop. Once you reach the last floor, you will loop back to the first floor, but with a twist! Can you manage to break the loop?<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/>Walk on W/A/S/D or arrow keys<br/>Attach and interact on space</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T08:49:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ccb/ccbabbed2536355a98d380567c35e519.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Kwarf"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
