{"id": 827351, "slug": "infiniteshooter", "name": "InfiniteShooter", "name_original": "InfiniteShooter", "description": "<p>InfiniteShooter is a simple vertical shooter game made in the Godot game engine.<br/>Originally made in Python for my grade 10 computer science class, I have since then remade the game in Godot and refined it a <em>lot</em> over the course of a year. (Just a <em>year </em>since I made the Python version? Man, it sure feels longer than that...)</p>\n<p>There's not a ton of content in this game, but I'm totally looking to add some more for future releases! There is one thing you should know, though.</p>\n<p>This game is fully free-and-open-source. In both meanings of free! Not only are all the assets public domain with CC-0 licenses (you can find them here, and anything external is on freesound and also CC-0), but the whole game is licensed under the GNU GPL v3, free forever. There's no in-app purchases, no cheap tricks, nothing to do with games-as-a-service... when you get the game, you get the <em>whole</em> game, for free. And I'll stand by that!</p>\n<p>Features:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>7 enemy types that you can't all have until level 30</li><li>A few different difficulty types, including one that creates absolute mayhem</li><li>Programmer art</li><li>Actually infinite gameplay (thankfully, we have a \"quit game\" option)</li><li>Music for the pause menu</li><li>A leaderboard where you compete with your past self</li><li>Roguelikelike gameplay</li><li>Some other stuff I haven't though of yet, but I swear this game is good trust me</li></ul><p>P.S. I found this game sounds a lot better with metal for some reason? I mean, almost everything does. BUT, if you fire up BFG Division on something like Spotify and switch your difficulty to Carnage, you will <em>not</em> be disappointed. Just don't use the enemy-wipe powerup. That breaks things for reasons I don't know as of yet (but that I think I can blame on the engine).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T10:23:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e8/7e828fb0d263d547471efad434421eb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["PastThePixels"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
