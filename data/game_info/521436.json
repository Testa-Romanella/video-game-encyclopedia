You need to <strong>find </strong>the <strong>purple aura </strong>that is <strong>trapped </strong>and <strong>released </strong>it.</p>\n<p>2. Once you release the purple aura, it will<strong> help you</strong> fight, but more important, he/she is the <strong>key </strong>to open the final door to <strong>fight the boss</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong>:</p>\n<p>.Since this was a <strong>prototype</strong>, it will probably have some <strong>bugs</strong>, i\u00a0<strong>apologize </strong>beforehand.</p>\n<p>.Sorry that this game help/hints are in <strong>Spanish</strong>, but i had no time to change that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T06:49:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f75/f754d09d62f14e59029afcecba6a01c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tangente"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
