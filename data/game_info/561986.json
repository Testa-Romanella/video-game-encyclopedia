You will have to switch between characters to make them work together to defeat the next enemy.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>A/D, right/left arrow -\u00a0 Movment</p>\n<p>Space - Use character's ability</p>\n<p>Q/E - Switch between characters</p>\n<p>R - Restart level</p>\n\n<p>Note: There is a slight issue where sometimes the characters will get stuck when moving on the ground. To get past that you can walk to the opposite side of the glitch and then walk straight towards the area with the problem, you should be able to get past the sticky point. #GameJamIssues #GameJamNoTimeLeft</p>\n\n<p><em>This game was built for the BRACKEYS GAME JAM 2021.1</em></p>\n\n<p>Asset Credits:<br/></p>\n<p><em>Music in the background from https://www.FesliyanStudios.com</em></p>\n<p>Health bar art from\u00a0https://github.com/Brackeys/Health-Bar</p>\n<p>Knight character from\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/knight-sprite-sheet-free-93897#description</p>\n<p>Sliding gate from\u00a0https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/the-dungeon-top-down-tileset/</p>\n<p>Platform tiles and background from\u00a0https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/cartoon-platformer-tileset-pack-1/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T08:39:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ba/6baed250e788a56173fd940f873f8b12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kento24"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
