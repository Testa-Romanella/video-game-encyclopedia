This has been going on for a long time and to make matters worse the red boss and the blue boss are twins. The family feud is getting out of hand and even the local tavern is being contested because both gangs happen to go to the same tavern. One day an arbitrary argument between the two groups turns into shouting and one of the members from one side shouts \u201cthis is our tavern!\u201d Tensions are high and someone takes a swing, a brawl is about to ensue and you're in charge of leading your gang to victory. Do you have what it takes to to break through their defenders and take down the leader?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/073/073c5f90dba0bda393a3f19cc0e3130a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Izgam"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
