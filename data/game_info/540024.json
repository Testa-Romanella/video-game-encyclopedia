A variety of tools available and three-dimensionality of the puzzles, while daunting at first, will satisfy both people new to the genre as well as veterans. As you rapidly prototype solutions to various puzzles you will soon come to love the unique playstyle!<br/><br/><br/><h3>Gameplay mechanics</h3>There is a ton of fun to be had with even the simplest of mechanics. From making your ball speed across the board like a small, round daredevil - to making it float in reverse gravity in order to cross otherwise inaccessible parts of the levels. And it is important that you know how to do so because most of the levels require you to collect all spawned keys in order to unlock the goal at the end.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Expect to see!</h3><ul><li> 80 campaign levels<br/></li><li> 18 unique blocks for you to use<br/></li><li> PowerUps - Gravity and Speed<br/></li><li> Portals (with multiple exits)<br/></li><li> Online level sharing<br/></li><li> Level Editor - build and share your own creations</li></ul><h3>Supported platforms</h3><ul><li> Valve Index<br/></li><li> Oculus Rift<br/></li><li> Oculus Rift S<br/></li><li> Oculus Quest+Link<br/></li><li> HTC Vive<br/></li><li> HTC Vive Pro<br/></li><li> HTC Vive Cosmos<br/></li><li> Pimax 5K+ / 8K series<br/></li><li> Windows Mixed Reality</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T02:08:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/783/78301d98a30e69caa939de1284c05a71.jpg", "website": "http://www.infinite.cz/projects/machizzle", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 223, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["iNFINITE Production"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["iNFINITE Production"], "esrb_rating": null}
