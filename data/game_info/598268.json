Loyal wizards must determine who among them is traitorous and vote them out in trial. The twist is that the trials occur on a regular basis and if players don't show up to the trial, it goes on without them.\u00a0Loyal wizards must also aim to complete tasks vital to the upkeep of the mansion. Traitorous wizards must secretly pick off the loyal wizards one by one until none remain.</p>\n<p>Ideally played in a group of 5-8 (current versions allow for 2-8 players for testing purposes).</p>\n<p>To host :\u00a0Click 'host' on the main menu. Ensure you have port 25565 (TCP) forwarded on your router (this is the same port\u00a0as Minecraft, if you have a port forward set up\u00a0for that it should work).\u00a0</p>\n<p>To join : Click 'join' on the main menu. Enter the host's IP address and you will join their lobby.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T07:14:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff3/ff30ea0becf41b0c69f4ef6a7a774c00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hipstream"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
