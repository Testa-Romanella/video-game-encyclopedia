I wanted to quickly get the first level of the game AND this demo done as soon as I can. Also, this is the first actual project I'm working on (other than game jams and experimental projects,) so expect a lot of bugs in the demo and the full game lol.</p>\n<p>Oh yea, the full game's going to be completely free, so don't worry about the price lol.</p>\n<p>And also, this game was tested on an Oculus/Meta Quest 2, so I'm not too sure on how this will play/control on an Index or Vive.</p>\n\n<p>Metro Meltdown is a singleplayer\u00a0VR shooter where\u00a0your only and current desire is to escape the city you live in due to a vast variety of reasons. (At least in the full game,) you'll be having to run, fight, ride, and grapple your way through a bunch of levels in order to escape your city\u00a0and finally find some peace and quiet.</p>\n<p>Also, in the main menu, you can find four sandbox levels for you to mess around in. Some of them being the test levels I made for this buggy mess of a game.</p>\n<p>Although, as said above, this demo only contains the first level of the game, so there won't be any grappling or riding stuff, just the fighting and maybe the running ;/</p>\n\r\nIn This Demo:\r\n<ul><li>Bust through robots with around 4-5 weapons</li><li>Mess around in four sandbox modes, some of them being test levels I made for Metro Meltdown</li><li>Umm... that's all I can think of and shove on this list lol</li></ul>\n<strong>Oculus/Meta</strong>\r\nActionButtonMoveLeft ThumbstickTurn<br/>Right ThumbstickJumpA or XGrabGrip ButtonsShoot WeaponsTrigger ButtonsOpen Pause MenuMenu Button (Left Controller)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T07:32:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbd/cbdf4e4d2627f5c5ca25f0c492478b62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["TheLuchenator"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
