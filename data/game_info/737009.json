During an episode, one may hallucinate (hear, feel, or see things that are not there). Episodes can last anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes.</p>\n<p>This is a short experience based off of my own sleep paralysis episode a few years back. Some aspects were obviously tweaked for a more interesting and entertaining gameplay experience. I hope you enjoy :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T07:21:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30f/30fce65df0d490bfea4601c9ad065682.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ad80alien"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
