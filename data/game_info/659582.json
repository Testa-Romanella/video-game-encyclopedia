In the chest you will find the diary notes that someone left behind, explaining that this is not a normal island, that it has a mechanism that makes the island zones rotate in a random time.</strong></p><p><strong>HOW TO PLAY:</strong></p><ul><li>ENTER: Interact with chest and tent. Collect Items</li><li>E: Use item from inventory</li><li>SPACE: Jump</li><li>WASD: Move around</li><li>Numpad: Select an item from inventory</li></ul>\n<p>But there is hope for you. You can get out of the island finding the 5 items required to repair an abandonment ship.</p>\n\n\n\n\r\n--- UPDATE ---\r\n<p>Hello! We've made this Jam to test our own skills. Unfortunately we had some errors in the 0.4 release that don't let you finish the game. When you are working really fast something you forgot to call your End Game function and the game cannot end never.\u00a0 We had a collision too that we forgot to remove that don't let you get one of the crucial items. We made a hotfix that we will release at the end of the Jam (with some more improvements). We will list next the fixes we made for the 0.4 in the hour after the Jam.\r\n</p>\n<p>We are sorry for the problems it may cause! Hope you did enjoy the Jam and thanks for playing our game.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Hotfixes 0.4:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Quit a blocking collision that didn't let you finish the game.\r\n</li><li>Call the End Game function.\r\n</li><li>When the time is fisnished it doesn't work again (if you do it from the tent it work).\r\n</li><li>There was an event with the items that wasn't working.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Stay safe,\r\n</p>\n<p>Beatriz &amp; Efr\u00e9n Sabater Serna.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T13:29:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b7/2b7cf7eae1c9eed3175f710d05a9b0a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Beatriz Sabater Serna"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
