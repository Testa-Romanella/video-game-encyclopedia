However, the true motivations of the engineer hide hidden secrets.<br/>Such a mystery is marked by resentment, obsession, and lust.<br/><br/><strong>THE CONTEXT</strong><br/>A dangerous military scientist obsessed with his dead wife decides to recreate her in a laboratory. However, that decision will destroy the world. An apocalyptic wind destroys 90% of the population, leaving the rest obsessed with sex. Only Sonya, but known as Hardpunch can survive in this world. It absorbs energy when having sex. The survivors of this world worship a goddess called \"Venus\". In fact, Venus is one of the clones of the mad colonel's wife. The colonel is actually an immortal. In the past, his wife was murdered by a demon. The colonel goes crazy and spends his whole life rebuilding his wife. Without knowing it, it creates a lethal virus with extreme sexual appetite. Harpunch becomes the only hope in this subversive world. As a clone, she can survive the violent sexual libido of the source of pleasure. That fountain is still alive thanks to the mad colonel. A Venus-worshiping sect created beings known as Spoils. These creatures produce strong sexual energy when they have sex. They are not dangerous. They practically have sex or masturbate constantly. The problem is the mutants that protect the spoils. Mecazombies, also known as carcasses. Sonya Rubra was one of the clones who managed to escape the colonel's laboratory. This happened during the cataclysm that destroyed almost the entire human race. Such a cataclysm turned the remaining humanity into freaks. In this world, there are no children because reproduction does not exist. Only explicit sex. Hardpunch found that she could become the host of Venus if she absorbs as much energy as she can with spoils.<br/><strong>THE MISSION</strong><br/>In the future, the last clone manages to transport itself to the past in order to destroy the dangerous engineer before the virus is created and spread across the world.<br/>This new version has the characteristics of Venus. However, the transfer was mental, unlike the other quantum leaps that were performed previously. Then, Venus' soul occupies the body of one of the most formidable clones developed by the engineer.

Whoever has the power to absorb through sex is supplied in these places. However, there will always be a creature protecting these posts. The main objective is to obtain enough sexual energy to activate the powerful Alive-Bomb that is hidden in the last level of the game.
