Basically the idea is you have to analyse what your opponent is trying to do, and outplay them. In theory, at least, not sure how good a job i did with that, but here we are. Also it's a tad unpolished and doesn't have any music but i'm frankly tired of working on it so this is the version you get.</p>\n<p>Have fun! Or don't, i guess. Don't let me tell you what to do.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-05T09:40:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c28/c28037a2a672c903b835a416862c1dce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lord Dragoneye"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
