You are a frustrated thirty-something wannabe writer from Warsaw who decides to make something out of himself. You will amaze the literary world with your earth-shattering book about refugees. It will inspire crowds and galvanize hearts, and expand minds, and change the world in all the right ways.<br/><br/>Before you prepare your Pulitzer Prize acceptance speech, there is only the trivial matter of actually travelling to Africa to gather some notes for the story. You have an ingenious plan to smuggle yourself onto one of the illegal boats that travel to Europe from the shores of Africa while pretending to be a refugee yourself. Surely nothing can go wrong and you are NOT completely out of your depth. Surely.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Developers support the refugee cause</strong><br/><br/>5% of We. The Refugees: Ticket to Europe profits will be donated to charities helping refugees. The first 2.5% goes to the Hope Project  - Greek volunteers who helped us meet refugees in person during research. The other half will go to other humanitarian organisation we will choose together with our community. <br/><br/><strong>The uniqueness of We.

The game deliberately plays on the clich\u00e9 of \u201ca white male\u2019s journey to an exoticized world\u201d and subverts it.<br/><br/>Multi-level, original narrative<br/>The game is metacontextual - it is not only a reportage about refugees, but also an interactive fiction game presenting the very process of creating a reportage. This way, the player discovers both the player discovers both the refugees\u2019 journey and a writer\u2019s challenges of exploring the subject.<br/><br/>Authenticity and Factuality<br/>Based on true events, the writing process was preceded by a series of interviews with refugees who were familiar with the concept for the game. To make this possible, the writers team visited the Moria refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesvos, where the prototype of the game was presented to refugees and volunteers. The script was also reviewed by experts from relevant NGOs.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-05T02:48:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/293/29333b523ce66ea5954a58bdd8ad1b97.jpg", "website": "https://actzerogames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 280, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Act Zero"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Polyslash"], "esrb_rating": null}
