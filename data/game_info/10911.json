You will have to play the role of the protagonist, an ordinary young man whose life has given him a second chance. Your mission will be to guide the protagonist in his decisions, and figure out the mysteries that hide inside the hearts of the three girls.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As in real life, our efforts can have unintended consequences; in the same way, Late Blooming incorporates a modality of decision that requires a much deeper analysis than simply choose a girl and wait for the desired event. Many decisions will require a choice between different moral values of equal caliber, or between different types of love: fraternal, romantic and sensual.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/><ul><li> Deep personalities and character development.<br/></li><li> 3 Main characters and 2 secondary characters (+ ko\u010di\u010dka).<br/></li><li> 44 Facial expressions, 9 costumes, different poses.<br/></li><li> 5 Romantic and non-romantic endings.<br/></li><li> Choices greatly change the story.<br/></li><li> More than 65.000 words (and more than 250.000 in all routes).<br/></li><li> More than 70 CGs included variations.<br/></li><li> Steam trading cards.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong> Team: </strong> <br/><br/>Direction, programming, script, production, art: Kurisu.<br/>Character design, sprites and CG: Nyatrix.<br/>Opening and PV artist: Teagirl-vn.<br/>CG artist and UI designer: Genacinth.<br/>CG artist: Atelier Astarotte.<br/>CG artist: Eminora.<br/>CG artist: Poopakoopa.<br/>CG artist: Tabithia.<br/>Cover artist: Funarie.<br/>Background artist, character design, fixes: KadajXxX.<br/>Background artist, fixes, CCPHIMS: Marta Stachowiak (Martith). <br/>Translation: Catalina Andrews.  <br/>Translation: Kaiming Zou.<br/><br/></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:14:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ce/4ce12a1a5d5a5e84c7ced75a5d388a4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 45, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 16, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 470, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Kurisu no Patto"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Kurisu no Patto"], "esrb_rating": null}
