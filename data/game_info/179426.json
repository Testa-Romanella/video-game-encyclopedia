While falling, by using The WASD Controls and Spacebar, you must dodge obstacles and get to the bottom of each distinguishable level. The aim of the game is to get to the bottom of each level where there will be Different Squares: All of one being bad squares, which you are attempting to avoid. These bad squares will send you back to the beginning of the level where you will have to restart. One of the Squares (Indicated obviously by it being green), is the square you are looking for. Completing the level will send you back to the spawn area where you can choose from another level.</p>\n<p>If your character is to make contact with any obstacle, you are sent back to the beginning of the level. Through the course of each level there will be killboxes which when you are to fall through, will act as an obstacle, therefore returning you to the beginning of the level. \u00a0Alongside these killboxes, there will be checkpoint boxes of which when you pass through will offer a checkpoint in which obstacles will teleport to you instead of the beginning of the level.  At the end of each level (once you reach the bottom) there will be a winbox where if you are able to pass through them, you will have completed the level and will have one. \u00a0A special surprise awaits the winner of all 4 levels.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ed/5ed0e11f10460a18c50dd47f273b7355.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["George_McLaughlin"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
