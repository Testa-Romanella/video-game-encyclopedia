Fight against mechanical insects from hell - in space!</em><br/></p>\n<p>This is a very old project, the first game I made in fact. Uploaded here as a time capsule with all its flaws and shortcomings. </p>\n<p>Gameplay</p>\n<p>The player dies of one hit. Enemies drop tech-powerups (increases canon strength), more bombs. Timebombs slow downs time for everything in area, use either defensively to slow down incoming bullets of slow down boss. Gravity bomb sucks in enemy bullets and uses them against them. Killing enemies increases your score multiplier.</p>\n<p>Right now there are only two levels and a bossrun.</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p><strong>Arrow keys</strong>\u00a0Move<br/><strong>Z</strong>\u00a0Fire<br/><strong>X</strong>\u00a0Gravity bomb<br/><strong>Shift</strong>\u00a0Focus Mode<br/><strong>Shift+x</strong>\u00a0Time bomb</p>\n<p>Engine</p>\n<p>The engine is custom made using C++ and SFML. It is highly customizable and one can create own levels, just place them in /levels/ and append to /levels/levels.txt. One can even define own enemies and AI. See the other .lvl files for examples.</p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p><strong>Programming and art</strong><br/>Jesper Tingvall</p>\n<p><strong>Music</strong><br/>Hartwigmedia</p>\n<p><strong>Sound</strong><br/>Taken from\u00a0theFreeSoundProject\u00a0users: LS, smokum, Superrex1110, gcmax</p>\n<p><strong>Font</strong><br/>Jochen Isensee</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-21T04:46:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09d/09d74eef114d02bb495232a10f01defe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 246, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["J3X"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
