In this game you guide an apple with a magnet trying to dodge atoms and magnetic saws pulling you to either side of the screen. Your mouse is the magnet you'll use by keeping it on either the left or right side of the screen. If you get hitted by an atom your magnet will start to repel the apple instead of attracting it!<br/> All images are made by me.<br/> Music from Zapsplat.com<br/> Font: Neuropol X from dafont.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T20:34:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f97/f97d59b63539404c0a3c9af84ed5dd35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["JimagineStudio"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
