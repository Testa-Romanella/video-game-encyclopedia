You really don't need a portal gun to teleport in this game, just touch to teleport. The objective of the game is to keep the magic ball alive by dodging the obstacle blocks. But remember to be super fast and alert as the speed of the obstacles increase to insane crazy levels. The more you dodge the obstacles, the higher you climb the leaderboards. You also get to unlock new achievements as you progress in the game. You will love the minimal graphics and simplicity of this game. So get your fingers ready to teleport yourself furiously fast to the top of the leaderboards. Let the teleportation begin!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:02:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5f/c5f58f98c670d0d8aef945b00372f974.jpg", "website": "http://jsplash.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["jsplashstudios", "JSplash Apps"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["JSplash Apps"], "esrb_rating": null}
