In the age of chivalry, of the war of roses and of the reign of the castles and blades, knights reign supreme. As an aspiring hero, prove yourself in hectic medieval fights - for honor and glory.<br/><br/>Intense duels against other knights, paladins, heroes and champions will brutally test your skill. Adapt your strategy in real-time: block attacks with the right timing, attack from where the opponent is open, and know when to play hero and when to hold your blade.<br/><br/>Block, clash, parry, counter, evade or even throw them off with a kick: every skill is useful to take the advantage during the duel, and be the one to take the initiative. But watch that stamina gauge, lest you let yourself get tired and present an easy opening - mistakes will be harshly punished by your rivals and their dark souls.<br/><br/>Create your own arsenal of formidable weapons and mount your blades on the wall: swords, axes, maces - all wielded differently (HEMA fans: half-swording and mordhau not included\u2026 yet). Assemble the perfect armor to give you impenetrable defense, complete with the paired helmet and shield - each with unique aesthetics.<br/><br/>Each piece of equipment has its own stats and provides unique bonuses: breaking through defenses, poisoning, added damage\u2026 In these unforgiving one-on-one battles, any small advantage can give you the edge. As a knight on a quest for honor, you will have no vanguard, no paladins, no templar by your side: only your chivalry and your sword.<br/><br/>Experience a solo campaign with ruthless opponents, lords and kings, harsh battles and gorgeous arenas: from castle sieges to melee pits, to charred battlefields and arid deserts, only the brave and the hardy will raise their blade and deliver the final slash on a complex political story.<br/><br/>Instant duels and arena seasons make you clash directly into the battle, climbing the ladder to obtain the supreme title and get the best loot. Thrust yourself into unforgiving medieval warfare: get in the arena and find the opening to unleash an array of powerful blade skills and chains of attack using special techniques (still no mordhau). <br/><br/>And never forget: don\u2019t try to show off, we let that to those horse mount and blade paladins who joust. Down here in the arena, iron, blood and skills are the difference between glory, and death.<br/><br/>Got a question?
