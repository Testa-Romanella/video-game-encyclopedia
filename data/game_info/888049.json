The only option you have left is the dangerous Frozen Mine. Within the frozen lake, lies low-hanging ores which are valuable. Maybe if you can take a couple...</p>\n<p><strong>[Gameplay]</strong></p>\n<p>Mine ores as you pass under them. However, a reminder that the ice below you is very thin, and mining the ores above will weaken them even further. Pick your mining spots very carefully.</p>\n<p>You will have a variety of tools to help you: the Sonar and the Construct, which will help you find and make better mining spots.</p>\n<p>Look out for the frost buildup. Being frozen alive is your time limit.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>[Controls]</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Press D to accelerate. </strong>Your cart moves naturally, but you can make it go faster.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonar </strong>- Lights up nearby ice with their durability shown.
