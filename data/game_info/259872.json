He gives you a reward and likes you a little more. Or maybe instead of delivering the item, you sell it to the highest bidder. Now the guy hates you. He tells his friends and they hate you. You&#39;re rich, but on the run.<br />\nIt&#39;s not a morality system. It&#39;s not a scripted story with branching paths. It&#39;s a system of cause and effect. Characters have unique personality traits, memories, and goals, so they act and react differently. Your actions build your story.<br />\nGive, take, save, kill, inform, hide, be loyal, betray. Do what you want, and deal with the consequences.<br />\nOpen world, open story, single-player.<br />\nCharacters remember and react to the actions you and other characters take.<br />\nWith every new game, the characters&#39; traits and relationships are randomized, so you always get a new experience.<br />\nBeautiful landscapes to explore.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-25T18:34:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/642/642e8771585171120f483ce8642d5de3.jpg", "website": "http://thousandthreadsgame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 22, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 31, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 233, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Seamount"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Seamount"], "esrb_rating": null}
