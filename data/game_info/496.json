All of us at Camouflaj are anxious to finally release the fifth and final chapter of R\u00e9publique. To all of you who waited patiently for the series conclusion, we deeply appreciate your patience and support. The team here at Camouflaj put our hearts and souls into this epic final episode -- we hope you agree that it was worth the wait.<br />\nJust as we did with previous episodes, Episode 5: Terminus is not just an additional chapter but it comes with thousands of fixes and enhancements. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the major changes we made in addition to adding the fifth episode:<br />\nImproved performance, crash frequency, and optimized framerate for lower-end devices<br />\nResolved issue where Hope falls out of the game world on some machines with AMD graphics cards<br />\nFixed issues regarding Hope\u2019s trouble retrieving the EP3 cassette at beginning of episode, near desk in Reception Area<br />\nUnity default typeface no longer appears by default in certain prefabs (English alphabet only)<br />\nImproved and revised navigation, pathfinding, and collision in Episode 1-3<br />\nImproved camera rotation limits and view in all episodes<br />\nUI and pop-up improvements in all episodes<br />\nUpdated 2D art for some scannable items in Episode 1-3<br />\nIn addition to the upgrades we\u2019ve made, here is some of the new stuff you can expect in Episode 5 (without spoiling too much):<br />\nHostile Cameras: These new security cameras scattered throughout the game world will scan Hope and alert guards to her presence. Players can only inhabit them for a limited time, adding a neat layer of complexity to the gameplay loop.<br />\nBranching Paths: This is something we\u2019ve kept close to the vest for a long time: EP5 has branching paths that change the course of the episode based on a decision you make early on. We don\u2019t want to reveal too much, but this is a huge addition that greatly expands the content offered in Episode 5, offering a nice incentive to play through the campaign again.<br />\nA New Metamorphosis: Players are returning to the world of some previous episodes, but will find it looking and feeling much differently than before. You\u2019re going to see new areas, meet new enemies, and forge some interesting alliances\u2026<br />\nWe want to say more, but it\u2019s better if you to experience it for yourself!<br />\nWhen you\u2019re done with the game, I encourage you to check out our final installment of The Making of R\u00e9publique (available now in the Deluxe Edition), and take a look back on the production of this massive, four year endeavor. We\u2019ve prided ourselves on giving you a window into our world by providing open and honest in-game developer commentary tracks, and these video documentaries are an extension of that. You might even see some old footage from back when we were younger, healthier, and less sleepy.<br />\nFinally, we want to give a shout out to composer Zinc Lemone for his work on Episode 5\u2019s soundtrack (also included with the Deluxe Edition.) I\u2019ve had some standout favorite tracks in previous episodes, but EP5\u2019s soundtrack in simply incredible from start to finish. (\u201cLoose Change\u201d is the <em>JAM</em> y\u2019all.)<br />\nWatching Episode 5\u2019s final moments come to life this past year has been bittersweet. It\u2019s hard to believe that we are finally at the finish line after first announcing the game back in 2012. We owe a lot to our initial Kickstarter backers, our publishing friends at GungHo Online Entertainment, and our stellar voiceover cast including Rena Strober, Jennifer Hale, David Hayter, Dwight Schultz, and Khary Payton. It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that R\u00e9publique is the product of thousands of people coming together and making it a reality.<br />\nThank you all, from the bottom of our hearts. It\u2019s been an incredible journey.Camouflaj</p>", "metacritic": 72, "released": "2013-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-13T20:29:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/f8e/f8e26a97d0b6c77dd83f757d1bc5e66a.jpg", "website": "http://www.camouflaj.com", "rating": 3.3, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 91, "owned": 1086, "beaten": 31, "toplay": 47, "dropped": 37, "playing": 7}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 104, "ratings_count": 60, "suggestions_count": 510, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 60, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Camouflaj"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["GungHo America", "Camouflaj"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
