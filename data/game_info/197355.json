Your flower's health will decrease over time and you must use sunlight or water to boost its health, but too much of either will kill it so be careful! Your flower will grow until it reaches the final stage where you must keep it alive as long as possible as the health decreases faster. Try to get to the final stage and keep it healthy as long as possible! </p><p>Click on the sunlight or the watering can for heat or water.<br/></p><p>Press S to start, M to mute/unmute music and R to reset.</p><p>Created by Calvin Burrell for Ludum Dare 34.
