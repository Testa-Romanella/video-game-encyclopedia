Destroy enemies.</p>\n<p>Each cell on its own\u00a0has a simple function, like moving or spawning other cells. But when combined, more interesting\u00a0behavior emerges...</p>\n<p>Made for the GMTK Game Jam 2020 with the theme \"Out of Control\".\u00a0In the game, you only set the initial conditions on the grid of cells. After pressing play, you can no longer control anything. Instead, a simulation unfolds, with each cell behaving based on its own set of rules..</p>\n<p>The game is based on\u00a0cellular automata like Conway's Game of Life. Atoms, molecules, cells - do they behave deterministically? And if they do,\u00a0does combining them together change that?<br/></p>\n<p>Also the cell based machines you make in this game can grow exponentially, literally becoming out of control.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong></p>\n<p>Rearrange cells in the build area. The goal is for them to interact in a way that results in an enemy cell being hit. Press the play button to run the simulation. Press the step button to execute one generation of the sim. Press the restart button to enable editing again.</p>\n<p><strong>CELLS</strong></p>\n<p>Mover - moves in the pointed direction</p>\n<p>Push - can be pushed in any direction</p>\n<p>Slider - can be pushed only in one direction</p>\n<p>Rotator - rotates adjacent cells 90 degrees each generation</p>\n<p>Generator - Duplicates the cell behind it each generation</p>\n<p>Immobile - Does not move in any direction, but can be duplicated by a generator</p>\n<p>Enemy - Overlap any cell with the enemy to kill it</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T14:37:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b3/8b37a78484b8461baf179743088e347b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Sam Hogan"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
