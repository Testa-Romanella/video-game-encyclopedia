Each game must be made in less than seven days,<br/>2. Each game must be made by exactly one person<br/>\u20283. Each game must be based around a common theme i.e. \u201cgravity\u201d, \u201cvegetation\u201d, \u201cswarms\u201d, etc.<br/><br/>The theme for august 2009 was \"Bare minimum\" and, as you can see, the graphics of the game are close to the theme.<br/>Having bare minimum visuals is the first step, but trying to find the bare minimum gameplay to have fun with a game seems a lot more interesting!<br/>The idea behind Just a Button is that pushing a button is the minimal action needed to do something in 95% of video games, so why not trying to make a game where this action is the only one available?<br/>This game explore gameplay variations around this thought. Quickly the multiplayer aspect was added to the project because hell yeah, playing games is even better with friends around!<br/> <br/>And so here was born the idea:<br/>Fun with Just a Button and some Friends.<br/><br/>Game developed by Frogames<br/><br/><br/>More about Frogames<br/>www.frogames.com<br/><br/>More about Experimental Gameplay Project<br/>www.experimentalgameplay.com<br/><br/>Many thanks to QQQ for the button design!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:31:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/552/552732dd6594a841594d64d4b5cac33b.jpg", "website": "http://www.frogames.com/iphone/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Frogames"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Christophe Canon"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
