Found by yourself a mysterious world.\"</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis is the base idea of this wierd and unsettling platformer. One life, a low-res game, played in a small window, or in fullscreen (press Alt or rezise window), a bloody and gore environment, a flying / bouncing eyeball as protagonist, this game is unusual!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tCredits to Ross Budgen for the music [on youtube]\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tKnown Bugs:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Alt key not responding when after LVL1 &gt;&gt; now a feature (moves the window if of screen)</strong></em></li>\n<li>Game Crashes at last level (currently a way to end the game, it will soon be fixed) </li>\n<li>Eyeball going trough walls</li>\n<li>Eyeball spawning inside Spikes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\r\n\tI Hope you will have fun to play! This game is designed for windows. The game can be very hard, especially because the portal between levels is invisible. You can also sometimes \"bounce\" on spike. It's normal, without this the spikes would kill you by watching them. However saws are deadly!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aeb/aeb0290cd5493a4cce33379a30dcacd8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["azekill_DIABLO"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
