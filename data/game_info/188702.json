The theme was \"Deterministic\". The game had to not include random elements in the gameplay. I choose to create a remake of the well known game \"Heads Or Tails\", which is a game based on randomness. Go try the game to see how I turn it into a deterministic game!<br/>I never used any random generation in my game, so yes, if you understand the pattern, you are done with the game. Actually, the real goal of the game is to understand the pattern to beat the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83f/83ff01c0c0eefb9c678f6a7fdcc11323.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Darenn Keller"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
