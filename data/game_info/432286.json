You can feel it too, can't you? Spirit, Life, Magic, whatever you call it... it's there. It binds us all together in a way. We're all made of it. But some... some can conjure it. Mold it, shape it, change the universe with it. I fear those who can.\"</em><br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>Roseblight </em></strong>takes place on a distant planet called Ahokau, a monochromatic world filled with deadly monsters, vast uncharted territory, and mysterious natural phenomena. When venturing off into the wilderness and facing against mighty foes, you'll need a strategic outlook to avoid harm's way. With a solid battle plan, some reliable equipment, and an unlocked understanding of what you're made of, nothing will stand in your way.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>SCREENSHOTS<br/></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS<br/></strong></p>\n<p>This game was made all by myself; I did the programming, artwork, level design, and music.
