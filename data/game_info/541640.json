The game got expanded into a full trilogy with its later installments Corrupted Blessing in 2015 and Mechanical Prayer in 2016, and the three games grew together in various aspects thorough the next few years (like getting a full graphical remake and various new songs), and the series reached a satisfying final result in 2020.\r\n</p>\n<p>These games are one-man-made (apart from the musics, which are from various sources), made with Ren'Py and completely free.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game is Mechanical Prayer, the third and final game in the trilogy, and a sequel to the first two games. Mechanical Prayer tells the story of a shy boy called Murdoc, who becomes an angel against his will with the power to read people\u2019s minds. Murdoc is then guided by a mysterious girl called Sona and a fierce mercenary by the name of Ace of Spades, the three go on a dangerous journey to find out what happened to one of the five missing angels, before a new threat called Egregore does.</p>\n<p>The trilogy's genre falls somewhere between fantasy and steampunk, with story philosophical elements that may or may not destroy your emotions, and a plethora of interesting, hilarious and down-right depressing characters.</p>\n<p>Depending on how fast reader you are, each game will offer you 6 to 8 hours of story.</p>\n<p>It is recommended to play this one after both Pristine Sin and Corrupted Blessing.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T04:00:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fea/fea84e0691b50970783a9e91888be401.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pyllymursu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
