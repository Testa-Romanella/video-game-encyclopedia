To find medicine for his sickly mother, the Hunter ventures into the King\u2019s domain, a dangerous place guarded by forces both natural and not.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Will you complete your journey into the dark? Or will you just become a character in someone else's\u00a0story?</em></p>\n\r\nGameplay:\r\n<p>A Night In Riverager is a short horror adventure and a prequal to my other game My Beautiful Paper Smile. Players will explore and puzzle their way through a new part of this world. The game is\u00a0free, and a\u00a0great starting place for newcomers to this world, but also worth exploring for players who already own My Beautiful Paper Smile.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>If you haven't checked out MBPS, or just want to learn more about it, be sure to check out the Steam page here:</em></strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T07:22:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fc/2fcb8770d219a00dd5d3e64ca0fa9bc2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 190, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Two Star Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
