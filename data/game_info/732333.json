I had a family, a life outside this black and blue box. Everyday I swing and dodge, swing and dodge, to what end? I can't remember how I get here and there appears to be no way for me to leave. Even after I'm obliterated by the fire beams or crushed by the meteors I come back, just to repeat it all again.</p>\n<p>I see the faces of people on the outside, they look at me, but I doubt they see me. Clicking on their mouse and tapping on their keyboard, they don't care about me, I don't think\u00a0<em>I</em> care about me anymore. This hell has no end in sight and I cannot remember a start, perhaps the idea of such things is not applicable here... I do not enjoy that thought.</p>\n<p>Swing and dodge, swing and dodge.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T15:23:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/554/554f119dbfece086b3a85881fca7fd62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Joppy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
