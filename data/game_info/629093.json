{"id": 629093, "slug": "planes-out", "name": "Planes Out", "name_original": "Planes Out", "description": "<p>Planes Out - Bornwave Jam 5</p>\n<p>After a weekend of constant developing I can proudly present to you: a game about shooting down jets that come in huge amounts. Don't worry, they'll patiently wait for their turn, after which they will try to destroy you. This will obviously not happen, because you are an excellent pilot (or so do I think, because those planes are very expensive) and can evade any attack. In fact, the enemy should fear you, because sometimes, when they're not focusing, they will fly in front of you: The perfect chance for you to pierce them with some AAM's (Air-to-Air-Missiles). I wish you the best of luck on your important mission, destroying planes forever! <br/></p>\n<p>3.. 2.. 1.. Planes Out!</p>\n\n<p>This game was made for the fifth Bornwave Jam, organised by the team I'm proud to be part of (Team Bornwave ;)). Check out the other games, because those are masterpieces in their own ways!</p>\n<p>-Remi<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T11:02:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/748/748c1f88cecfccd9e8ced9ab7d1ee6a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Selectricity Productions"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
