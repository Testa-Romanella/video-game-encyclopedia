But one day, her stepsister, Agatha, finally takes notice and tries to help her. \r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tIt would be a welcome change of pace, except that Agatha's shift in attitude seems to be motivated by a terrible secret. Can she really be trusted when she says Cinderella is better off not knowing the truth?\r\n</p>\r\nFeatures:\r\n<ul>\n<li>1 hour play time</li>\n<li>Twisty storyline</li>\n<li>6 endings </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\r\n\tThis game is free, but contributions are accepted if you would like to support the creation of future games!\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tI would love to hear reactions and comments.
