Use explosives to mine metal ores or watch your newly constructed home get smashed to pieces by a meteorite impact. As you venture into space to discover new planets, the hull integrity of your custom built spaceship will be tested.<br/><br/>You start out by mining stone and chopping down trees to produce primitive building materials. As the game progresses you will be able to craft more advanced materials and ultimately construct a spaceship. Materials are also used to fabricate a wide range of different objects, ranging from simple furnaces and sawmills, to advanced technological achievements such as laser turrets and deep space sensors.Features:<ul><li>Fully Destructible planets and Spaceships</li></ul>[/b]Fully destructible environments where planets, buildings and spaceships are completely customizable.<br/>[/list]<br/> <br/><ul><li>Explore a Universe Full of Different Planets</li></ul>[/b]Discover new planets with strange lifeforms or planets covered with ice or lava.
