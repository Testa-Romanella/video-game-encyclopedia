This is all you will ever need!</strong></p>\n<p>The game was mode for the December installment of the Hungarian 1GAM jam of 2020 (2020 HEJ November-December). The theme of the jam was \"infinite\". In this project my focus was on\u00a0building a strong and distinct atmosphere, and I think I nailed it. As a consequence, there is not much gameplay, but hey - sometimes you just need to sit back and enjoy the ride ;)</p>\n<p><strong>Acknowkedgements:</strong></p>\n<p>I would like to thank <strong>Isidor Bobinec</strong> for allowing me to use his music in this project. It is, without doubt,\u00a0the main contributor to the atmosphere and without it the game would be far less enjoyable than it is now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you liked the soundtrack in the game, please, visit\u00a0Isidor's Bandcamp site and support him by buying his music!</p>\n<p>Used assets:</p>\n<ul><li>Car controller:\u00a0Vehicle Physics Pro - Community Edition</li><li>Car model:\u00a0Exotic Sportscar - Free Model</li><li>Buildings:\u00a0Some free skyscraper models from Turbosquid</li><li>Road:\u00a0Low Poly Road Pack</li><li>Skid marks: Nition - UnitySkidmarks</li><li>Endless runner tutorial: mirrorfishmedia - EndlessRunnerUnity</li><li>Misc.: Clouds, Road Blocker, Trees</li><li>Fonts: Kelvinized, Florencia Blonde</li></ul>\n<p>This game means a lot to me as it marks the end of my\u00a0 first year in game development.\u00a0\u00a0I really hope that this new year will be even more exciting than the previous one and that I will learn a lot more!</p>\n<p>Known bugs: you can - if you have the patience - go so far from the origin that lights and shadows fall apart. This issue can be solved by periodically moving everything back to the origin (it is unnoticable by the player), but the car controller percieved it as a collision, and it was weird and annoying. I wanted to improve the road generation track so that the road turns back, but run out of time. I have other projects in mind right now, but I want to come back to it later and fix it.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T04:56:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb3/eb30e6546b3938af75b5a977a130c718.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bence Mervay"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
