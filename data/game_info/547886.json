This section of the course covered how to make a tile based platformer and we were encouraged to find our own tilemap with which to create our game.<br/></p>\n<p>After searching on OpenGameArt, I discovered this gorgeous 'Deep Night' tilemap created by the talented Vexed:\u00a0https://v3x3d.itch.io/</p>\n<p>This tilemap heavily inspired\u00a0the\u00a0tone and premise for the entire game.\u00a0I decided that I was going to take this game a lot further than what was covered in the online course\u00a0and am hoping to develop it to a publishable standard in the future.</p>\n<p>Other sources of inspiration are classic games retro games such as Super Mario and Megaman. In developing this game I've tried to employ minimalist design choices in order to create an engaging and accessible experience, an example of this is the almost non-existent HUD.</p>\n<p>If you wish to know more about this game and it's development then please do get in touch. I've had a blast making it and I hope you feel the same playing it.</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>\"Deep Night\" tilemap created by Vexed.<br/>https://v3x3d.itch.io/deep-night</p>\n<p>\"Pixel River\" music created by Trevor Lentz.<br/>https://opengameart.org/content/pixel-river</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T10:28:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/135/135070b08262578c84bf18dfe5a22585.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alex Graham"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
