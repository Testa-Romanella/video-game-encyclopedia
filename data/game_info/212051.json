Prompt: Make a game that could use a given image as its box cover.</p>\n<p>My assigned image was relatively straightforward (at least compared to some of the more abstract ones my classmates got). It depicted a hedgehog getting royally \"thwacked\" by a rooster. I decided to make it a 2-player competitive game, with one player playing as the rooster, defending the eggs in their coop, and the other playing as the hedgehog trying to steal the eggs. The hedgehog must grab an egg and deposit it one of the 4 holes around the edge of the field to score it. If the hedgehog steals all the eggs, the hedgehog wins. The rooster must try to defend the eggs by thwacking the hedgehog, which will knock it back. The rooster wins if it thwacks the hedgehog into one of the 4 holes, creating a risk/reward dynamic where the hedgehog is most vulnerable when it is closest to scoring. The hedgehog moves faster than the rooster, but the rooster has a dash ability that it can use to catch up, at the cost of committing to a long movement.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/076/07614c0a184853235986596af9dfc625.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ben Costrell"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
