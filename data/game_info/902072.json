I used free assets from the Unity Store and a lot of Googling, but the end result is all me. I keep reading from various sources\u00a0that you should release anything you make out to the public because critical feedback can be invaluable, so I thought I would put this out to see what folks think. This project was primarily academic, in other words, created specifically to teach me Unity and C#. It may not be the most fun game in the world, but I learned a lot making it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-30T08:08:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d8/5d8dda1d6ad16f6f96a1f601c16b8f3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BigDaddyRichDX87"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
