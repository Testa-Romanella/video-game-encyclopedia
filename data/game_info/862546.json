Normally that would be an easy task.\u00a0Just flick on the good old invisibility field and run away.\u00a0However, your funds are pretty low and so you only could get the cheap 10/10 invisibility field. Despite its name it is arguably the worst invisibility field generator on the market. It stays on for ten seconds, then needs to recharge for another ten, before being available for ten seconds again.<br/><br/>Controls:<br/><strong>WASD</strong>\u00a0to control the ship<br/><strong>1-4</strong> to select a weapon<br/><strong>Left Mouse Click</strong> to fire the selected weapon<br/><strong>Alt+F4</strong> closes the game</p>\n<p>Collect coins from unsuspecting enemies to unlock new ships<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T14:54:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d47/d470371f4ba272878c9e5af2c17f9362.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["heho", "Zhed"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
