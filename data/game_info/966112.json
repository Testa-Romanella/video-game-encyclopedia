A pretty impressive feat considering that they now number in the thousands.<br/><br/>I made this \"Redux\" version partly because the \"Remastered\" Date Ariane demanded it, but being a remake of the first of a genre has some potential.  It was never as popular as Date Ariane, so I didn't feel obligated to be true to the original, hence some old \"sequel\" related content got dropped, and satirical genre defying content was added. I also incorporated the third game of the series Rachel Meets Ariane and added it to the end to make one big game out of two.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-11T02:15:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e0/2e0a15b401c1755eb8a2f23b111b5f99.jpg", "website": "https://datearianegames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Date Ariane Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Date Ariane Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
