You moved here from a bigger place where street gang fights are everyday life. <br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>SO LET ME ASK YOU... </strong><br/>Why did a policeman like you \u2013 the one who was doing well in a big city suddenly wants to take a chance in a place like this?

As a good policeman, you will answer even the most difficult calls. A shop robbery, or even a hostage situation - you have to be prepared for anything! But remember \u2013 it\u2019s only up to you how you approach a specific situation.  <br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>WHAT KIND OF COP YOU WILL BE? WHAT IS YOUR STYLE OF SOLVING THE CASES? </strong> <br/>There are many possibilities to do this right - sometimes the use of a gun is necessary, and sometimes a well-chosen argument is the best possible weapon.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>Each of these situations brings you closer to finding what you\u2019re looking for... And of course to be a better cop! The correct approach to the calls will allow you to expand your experience - the higher it is, the more benefits you\u2019ll get.
