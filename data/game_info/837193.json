Then you'll love Big Floppa Clicker.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a small simple game I\u00a0made. I like to take on big things but the problem with this is without a backbone of experience those are extremely difficult and prone to never being complete.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>My solution is to start with Tiers. I got inspired by the fantasy light novel Overlord.\u00a0In that world magic exists in Tier 0-10 (plus super). To overcome a tier and move to the next is extremely time consuming and takes great effort.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This is my first Tier 0 game. I plan to make at least 10 before I move to the Tier 1 game. For a game to be completed it has to be god enough for me to be not ashamed of it to even proud, then publish it.</p>\n\n<p>The details are still fuzzy on what constitutes a tier but I intend to keep Tier 0 very simple with basic if any polish</p>\n\n<p>Tier 1: Start menu &amp; Settings (if music)</p>\n<p>Tier 2: previous +\u00a0definitely music and consider monetization quality</p>\n\n<p>Tier 3+: ???</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T13:12:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e68/e681b8263ba2ad70fa43bc5daffeb8bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Failfer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
