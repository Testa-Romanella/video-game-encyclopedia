It will keep track of how many times your cat catches the mouse. You can select background (there are 7 different backgrounds to choose from) and you can reset the counter. That's all! It's so simple that your cat can play all by itself without any help or instructions from you : )<br/><br/>This game is designed for both iPhone and iPad.
