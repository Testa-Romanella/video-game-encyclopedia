{"id": 385524, "slug": "mass-plus", "name": "Mass Plus", "name_original": "Mass Plus", "description": "Mass Plus tasks players with using physics driven, self replicating, projectiles to complete levels by destroying target spheres.  Each level can be completed quickly but achieving high scores will require a more steady approach. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nProjectile spheres will spawn - and consume - smaller versions of themselves, increasing their size until they reach a critical mass. As a sphere grows, its pull on neighbors does as well. Players will have to carefully consider the merits of growing a sphere and risking its annihilation versus completing levels more quickly for a lesser score.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn Mass Plus, a player's score is determined by precision, planning, and a little luck. Will you race to complete each level or strive to be the top of a global leader board?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-25T03:27:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/488/488dcd397f3827192920a73bedc0abdd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gray Sage"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Gray Sage"], "esrb_rating": null}
