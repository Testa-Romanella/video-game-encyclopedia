Unfortunately, the game is missing the final element bring all the aspects together, enemies, due to over-scoping. Oh well. I will probably implement it after the Jam.</p>\n<p>Credits to @Polar for giving me a hand with the art assets</p>\n<p>Controls is</p>\n<p>-ARROW KEYS\u00a0to move</p>\n<p>- The x1,x2 and x3 are coins. Everything else are power-ups that affect your movement.</p>\n<p>\u00a0I aim to clean up the sprites, some UI improvements and a Tutorial before the Jam ends, but I at least wanted to upload a playable version first. Thank you! I'm glad to have been able to do this as my first GameJam experience</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T08:11:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/371/37104ffc26582add7e4d3c0c834c6e47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pixelelf21"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
