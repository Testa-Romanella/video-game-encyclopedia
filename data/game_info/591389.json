But darkness is a dangerous adventure and you should be careful about not to lose your light.</p><p>This is my second LudumDare. This time I\u2019ve gone for compo and choose a risky genre actually. In last 48 hours I learned, 2 days is not enough to build a satisfying metroidvania game. At least for me. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t have time to add SFX. Literally, there is no sound in the game. However, I am pretty satisfied with the other things. Visualization, core mechanics, level design etc. Long story short, I hope you\u2019ll like it :)\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00c7\u0131nar,\u00a0</p><p>Game On!!\r\n</p>\n<p>NOTE: You might have performance issues on HTML5.(It is playable but I had some FPS drops) So, desktop version is recommended!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T05:07:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4c/e4c769a91ba20c585bf8331ea3b377a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Cyaygel"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
