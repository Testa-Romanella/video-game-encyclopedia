In those 7 days you can steal from the rich to help your dying village and cause a revolution to storm the castle and save your Princess, or you can choose to do nothing for your village, hopefully bargaining with the king or sneakily saving her yourself. The game will be easier if you choose not to steal but your village will slowly turn against you as more people die, or you can make it harder as more guards are put out as your village thrives to help you. The fate of your village and your lover is in your hands.<br/></p>\n<p>All assets made within the jam</p>\n<p>Balancing Aint Perfected :)</p>\n<p>Intro cutscene not added in time:</p>\n\n\n<p>E- Interact</p>\n<p>Right Click- Use Item</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T10:29:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e2/4e29a2714251103dfd45d118462238e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CoolGuy27"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
