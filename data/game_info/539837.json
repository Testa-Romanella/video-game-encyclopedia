{"id": 539837, "slug": "wanderwoods", "name": "WanderWoods", "name_original": "WanderWoods", "description": "<p>WanderWoods is a chill forest exploration. Take a relaxing walk, explore deep into the brush,  or ride a horse down the many paths of this procedurally generated forest.</p>\n<p>During the COVID pandemic of 2020 I spent a lot of time walking my dogs in the forest near my house. I saw it change at different hours of the day and throughout the seasons. There was comfort in walking familiar paths, excitement in finding new ones. It was an experience I knew I had to do something with. WanderWoods is my humble attempt at replicating that.</p>\n<p>This first version is fairly basic, but I have some fun ideas for things to add over time. Let me know in the comments what you would love to see added.<br/></p>\n<p>Finally, a disclaimer: this thing probably requires a pretty beefy computer, with the many many trees and grass it renders. There's a low quality graphics options that I hope helps a little bit, but I'll see if I can optimize it further in the future.<br/></p>\r\nChangelog\r\n<p><strong>v0.2.2<br/></strong></p><p><strong>Initial public release<br/></strong></p><p><strong>v0.2.3</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Increased forest size by x8<br/></strong></li><li><strong>Tweaked vegetation placement and performance<br/></strong></li><li><strong>Paths can be wilder with more growth overlapping<br/></strong></li></ul><p><strong>v0.2.4<br/></strong></p><ul><li><strong>Added a climbable watchtower (take four right turns from the starting location)<br/></strong></li><li><strong>Improved tree draw distance performance</strong></li><li><strong>Improved player height on foot and on horse</strong></li><li><strong>Better placement of bushes<br/></strong></li><li><strong>Improved path texture<br/></strong></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T05:48:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e04/e0484d51f06a12af1e0979c998aad609.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hedgefield"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
