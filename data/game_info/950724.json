It is extremely unpolished and doesn't look or play that great. I did include somewhat of an ending, but that will NOT be the final ending to the finished product if it ever comes into fruition. Please enjoy this unfinished game, and be sure to comment any feedback about it and what you think of it. And yes, I do plan to use Scratch if I continue to work on this.\u00a0Other games I make in the future may still use Unity, but I feel like making this one in Scratch.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T16:29:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92e/92eee640865f3a1c37af8ba6439f6f42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["funnyspaceburrito"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
