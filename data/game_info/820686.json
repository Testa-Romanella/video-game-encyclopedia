Team Bonding Dodgeball Bonanza", "description": "<p>It's that time again, the annual notorious <strong>team bonding</strong> event. This time the <strong>Blocky Diemen Inc.</strong> have chosen <strong>dodgeball</strong> as their activity.</p>\n<p>It's a game of dice going against other teams of dice in dodgeball. It's pretty simple, when you get the ball, you can move and then either pass the ball or throw it to the enemy. If the thrower's dice value is bigger than the target, they will get knocked out. Otherwise they catch it and it's their turn to go for offence.</p>\n<p>Can be played with mouse only but also has some hotkeys for quality of life reasons. Also has a hot seat multiplier mode.</p>\r\nDev Timelapse", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T02:55:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/296/2960700514bf0d406b951d28a7947b1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["anttihaavikko"], "genres": ["Sports", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
