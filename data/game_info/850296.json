It will be scuffed, but I plan on updating it once I've gotten other things sorted. Thanks for understanding.<br/><br/><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>WASD\u00a0<strong>-\u00a0</strong><em>Move</em>\n</p>\n<p>LMB\u00a0<strong>-\u00a0</strong><em>Interact/Advance Dialogue</em>\n</p>\n<p>RMB\u00a0<strong>-\u00a0</strong><em>Zoom</em></p>\n<p>P -\u00a0<em>Pause Game [Only usable in game]</em></p>\n<p><strong>THE SCENARIO</strong></p>\n<p>In 1965, NASA launched three men into space with the goal of those men being the first humans to ever explore the moon. Once they launched, the mission seemed to be going great. People on earth cheered the men on... until it all went quiet. What happened to those men in the deep, dark isolation of space? They may have found an answer...<br/></p>\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong></p>\n<p>This game is a very short walking (or floating) simulator that is more of a concept or prototype than a polished game. The gameplay consists of moving through a dark, quiet station deep in space. Use the lack of gravity and your camcorder to capture the final moments of the crew.</p>\n<p><strong>DEVELOPER NOTES</strong></p>\n<p>So, this \"game\" was incredibly rushed in the final hours of the jam submission period. I started working on this game a couple days after the jam started and development was sort of on-and-off throughout the 10 days. Expect this game to have some bugs, UI and visual issues, etc. I'm also aware that the game is insanely short and lacks some narrative depth. Trust me, there are many themes, concepts, ideas and mechanics I would have loved to try out if I had more time. This will have to do for now though. After pulling my hair out trying to get the game working with Unity's confusing aspect ratio and resolution options, I just had to get it uploaded. Hope you enjoy regardless!</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p><p>Astronaut 3D Model By VISBYTE</p><p>All sound effects are from ZapSplat and FreeSound.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T10:40:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4e/f4e4e3704ff00681806af5fbd289a169.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Mediasaur"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
