Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Story: Welcome To Bald's House! It may seem like an educational game at first, but its actually pretty spoopy.\u00a0Baldi invited you over to help him with getting notebooks. But as soon as you get 2, he gets angry, and now you must collect all 5 and escape the house to win! Don't forget to have fun also!</p>\n<p>One thing I like about this game is that it's easy to mod.\u00a0Also, I was able to code in a new sound that plays when you collect all 5 notebooks, and also fixed the text not changing when you get 5 as well! Anyways, enjoy playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-17T03:51:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/693/6934bcd899dc0d93b9b144a4f41c6f98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JohnsterSpaceGames"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
