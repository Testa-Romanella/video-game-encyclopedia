Journey along with your co-worker Randon amongst the most ridiculous situations while meeting new characters along the way!\u00a0<br/><br/>The VN contains cheesy writing, cursing, intense h*nd h*lding, simping, steamy baths, and sensual apple sauce/cake consumption. Viewer discretion is advised?<br/><br/>Note: This is my first visual novel that actually got to see the light of day. (the ones I made before shall never be seen by anyone hehehe). I am still relatively new to Ren'Py ,and hopefully, you can enjoy this little project I made. :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T05:36:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d32/d32492a3a3c66068a577c5a33dbf0692.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Warm Gazpacho"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
