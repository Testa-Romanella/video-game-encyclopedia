It's supposed to be a loosely connected demo for a \"short\" more humorous 3D point-and-click-adventure (with a completely different atmosphere &amp; vibe to it lol) that I initially wanted to make, but I gave up after 5 days, because I figured I can't make these complex mechanics with dialogue etc (the writing is gonna be good &amp; gay tho!) within this short amount of time. But it will definitely be released in 2023 or sth. :)</p>\n<p>The first/initial door of this calendar was inspired by a scene from the third part of a screenplay triptych that I wrote in June 2022.<br/></p>\n<p>* * *<br/></p>\n<p> <em>Additional Art Assets that were used in the making of this game:\r\n </em></p>\n<p>Kobra Game Studios \u2013 TV / arm mount\r\n </p>\n<p>Vertex Studio \u2013 Classic Picture Frame\r\n </p>\n<p>Padia 3D \u2013 Christmas Decoration Props\r\n </p>\n<p>Deployer \u2013 Christmas toys\r\n </p>\n<p>BRAiNBOX \u2013 FREE Christmas Assets / Low Poly\r\n </p>\n<p>White Games \u2013 Projector Simulator\r\n </p>\n<p>Ferocious Industries \u2013 PBR Nutcrackers\r\n </p>\n<p>Elcanetay \u2013 Toon Furniture\r\n </p>\n<p>Andrey Ferar \u2013 Door Free Pack Aferar\r\n </p>\n<p>SpaceZeta \u2013 Spotlight and Structure\r\n </p>\n<p>Vertex Studio \u2013 Next-gen Camera\r\n </p>\n<p>ergin3d \u2013 Santa Claus Rigged\r\n </p>\n<p>Gaik Software \u2013 Breakable Windows\r\n </p>\n<p>Monqo Studios \u2013 FREE Lomo Camera <br/></p>\n<p>(+ MakeHuman, Mixamo &amp; some CC0 images &amp; CC0 sound snippets)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T12:47:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8d/d8d37a0ec1fa55f7ffcc22e951a9ea50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["luka"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
