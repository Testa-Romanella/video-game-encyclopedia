I was even ready to give up invisible item dialogs and smooth game endings. But there was just one thing I could NOT compromise on. After spending one and a half\u00a0hours making the tiles of Zaffiro, I then started to make Piccino, and\u00a0<em>THEY STARTED TO OVERWRITE ZAFFIRO</em>. You only have a given number of tiles in Bitsy Classic before you run out :( So that was the last straw for me, I had to go back to modern Bitsy. I've thrown in a few luxuries from modern Bitsy (ending, inivisible items, and animations) but I have kept the simple one room set up that I planned to use when I was going to stick to Bitsy Classic.</p>\n<p>There is another thing I have done as an homage to the entire history of the Bitsy Jams. Can you spot it? The answer: I have referenced every Bitsy jam title in the lines of dialogue, in order.
