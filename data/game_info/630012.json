(extremely early prototype)", "description": "<p><strong>OTAMAMANIA! INFO</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is NOT a complete game! This is barely even a prototype. I only uploaded the game this early to see how HTML5 files could be uploaded.</p>\n<p>The story/structure for OTAMAMANIA! isn't something I've decided too much yet. It might not even end up becoming a full game! (Due to burnout and laziness from me) I will however say that the basis of the game is: You're an otamatone (wikipedia page about the instrument here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otamatone; I DO NOT OWN THE NAME OR ANY RIGHTS TO DO WITH THE OTAMATONE INSTRUMENT, PLEASE DON'T DMCA ME) who lives in a friendly village with their peaceful neighbors. You will talk to and complete many tasks for the villagers, including, finding resources, buying food, and  fighting un-friendly enemies/monsters. Each task you complete, you will either be rewarded with hats that boost your performance and appearance, or coins, depending on the task. Yeah, thats all I have in terms of future gameplay ideas so far. The prototype is, once again, barely even a prototype. All it is so far is a movement system with a player following camera, directional idle animations,</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>(I know the back view looks a bit... uhh..), and some sprites I threw together that will be used in the future for environments/areas. Therefore, please do not expect much out of the game so far, and only give criticism based off of the artwork and the movement system.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T15:22:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b6/0b64ba0b2dfbba3bebc0ed1fe100a6d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sudevITCH"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
