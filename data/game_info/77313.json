If a single Black ball goes out or the Cue Ball goes out 2 times, the game will be over.<br/><br/>You can earn 3 Stars, 1st Star just for completing a level, 2nd Star for beating each level's time, 3rd Star for completing a level in less than required shot for that level.<br/><br/>So be careful... and have fun.<br/><br/>60 Levels<br/>Practice makes perfect! Play through all 60 levels to gain your Pool Madness skills.<br/><br/>FEATURES:<br/>\u25cf 60 Challenging Levels.<br/>\u25cf Realistic Physics.<br/>\u25cf Refreshing music.<br/>\u25cf 6 Cues to choose from.<br/>\u25cf Game Center support.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-29T11:34:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8aa/8aa20e1576ac37ffa89f62a4efe9886a.jpg", "website": "http://www.eivaagames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Sailendu Behera"], "genres": ["Sports", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Sailendu Behera"], "esrb_rating": null}
