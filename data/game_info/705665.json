Originally created by Kevin Manley of Ingenion LLC back in 2007,  it unfortunately has become obsolete due to the discontinuation of  Adobe Shockwave Player. This project aims to provide a modern experience  without any third party plug-ins.\r\n </p>\n<p>This version has a built-in level browser to view and  play the many levels that have been archived over time. You are  currently able to finish levels and submit your highscores to compete  with other players around the world.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Soon, you'll be able to create and upload your own levels, and play them in a multiplayer setting (Hangout, Co-op or PvP).</p>\n<p>Please support by giving me a cheeky star on GitHub\u00a0 https://github.com/Ruixel/YACY :P<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T12:32:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/454/45411ebc6a18ccf4cb90c41d07e25485.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["bagster"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
