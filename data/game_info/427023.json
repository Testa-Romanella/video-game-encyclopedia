You play a person who is split into a good and a bad version.<br/>The Goal of the game is to get as far as possible without dying. The tricky part is that both sides must stay at the same health amount or due to being out of balance for too long you will end up dying.<br/>You press J to hit with the good side and F to hit with the bad side. The hits must be very precise, if you miss you will be punished with a hit cooldown. To make the game more interesting it will speed up with time.</p>\n<p>Thanks for checking out our game :D<br/>@blekkh @Mima</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T05:57:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f97/f9709c89d8680f156d1234c12217f7f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["blekkh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
