As the couple is going through a divorce, through unknown means their minds are transported into two dolls which their daughter, Rose, made to represent them. Now they must reluctantly find a way to get back into their bodies, a quest which takes them through the most wild, unexpected and fantastical journey imaginable.</p>\n<p>It Takes Two further builds on Hazelight\u2019s proven track record of making rich and engaging co-op experiences. While developing It Takes Two it has been the team\u2019s number one priority to truly merge story and gameplay. Allowing both to influence each other guarantees a game that is as engaging to play as it is compelling to experience.</p>", "metacritic": 88, "released": "2021-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-23T07:54:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d47/d479582ed0a46496ad34f65c7099d7e5.jpg", "website": "https://hazelight.se/games/it-takes-two/", "rating": 4.52, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 239, "owned": 2244, "beaten": 1226, "toplay": 565, "dropped": 191, "playing": 205}, "playtime": 10, "achievements_count": 55, "ratings_count": 1380, "suggestions_count": 830, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1412, "platforms": ["PlayStation 5", "Xbox Series S/X", "PlayStation 4", "PC", "Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Hazelight"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
