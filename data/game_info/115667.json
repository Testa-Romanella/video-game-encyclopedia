So I decided to look for some tutorials and try to make a game of my own, and I found this Game Maker thing and some further resources online (am I gonna be arrested or something?).I feel like cheating but it was a really cool sleepless experience and I wanted to share it. The game is about a sheep that was abducted by aliens to save their famous extraterrestrial friends (lame, I know). Anyway, I hope you have fun and don't get too hard on me.<p> <left [space=\"\" arrow=\"\" jump]=\"\" right=\"\" to=\"\"></left></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5c/d5c689ed6b4e99eee8aaad9d17a9a87e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gray Irish"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
