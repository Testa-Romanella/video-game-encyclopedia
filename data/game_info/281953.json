How did you get there? It's a big ol' mystery!\u00a0Make your escape and meet up with your best friend at the top of the world!</p>\n<p>Try not to kill too much wildlife (by jumping on top of them)\u00a0or die too many times (by being jumped on, getting bit, zapped, or falling off the bottom of the screen).</p>\n<p>Short, sweet platformer.\u00a0Plays in-browser. Sound effects and music when game begins.</p>\n<p>There's no losing the game\u00a0-- just push along and you'll make it to the end\u00a0(I ran out of time for tuning the game to have finite lives, power-ups, etc., so you'll have to wait for\u00a0PnSBG2 to get those!).</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>Move Left: 'A' or Left Arrow key<br/>Move Right: 'D' or Right Arrow key<br/>Jump: Spacebar, Up Arrow, or 'W'\u00a0key</p>\n<p>After dying, you are a ghost and can return to the last platform you landed on.<br/>Move Left / Right (as ghost): same as above<br/>Resurrect: Spacebar,\u00a0Up Arrow, or 'W'\u00a0key</p>\n<p>'P' pauses the game at any time (it also unpauses it).</p>\n<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>\n<p>This is my\u00a0first game! It was built with Phaser 3. Kudos to the fine folks building that impressive library. There's no progressive loading screen yet -- just wait a little bit, and the black screen will change to the title.</p>\n<p>This game is a present for my dear Stirfry. Merry Christmas!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b7/9b79baced2af83aa4d96ca39d1102c48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LED-Coyote"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
