Pull out your best good luck charm and try to survive by jumping at the correct moment, but be careful: sometimes jumping is what will do you in!</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>Elegant Gameplay - With such a simple control scheme, it all boils down to when to jump and if the player is fast enough to react or to notice the traps. Easy to learn. Hard to master.</li><li>Concise Levels - 5 worlds, each with 10 bite-sized levels, totaling 50 levels (some of which are good)! No endless runner nonsense here; only handcrafted junk!</li><li>Costumes! - Do you love parodies, puns, and really obscure sitcom references? If you're daring enough to collect all 30 coins in a level, you can unlock a new costume. Including a few bonus costumes, the game has 70 unlockable costumes!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15c/15c03d97821cf465533c512675ce2fee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Razzlemataz"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
