The Theme was: Genre without Mechanics.</p>\n<p>It is a short Game about the differences and similaritys of Light and Dark.</p>\n<p>The catch: It is a Platformer where you can not see the Platforms. (See the Theme above.)\u00a0The only way of knowing where you can safely jump to, is to throw a small Sphere and see where it hits a wall.</p>\n<p>Because I have so much to do, the development was only 5 hours and there is a lot of stuff I wanted to add, for example better Graphics (I know, sounds wierd, considering the Game is only a black Screen), Sound, more Content and Gameplay Features.</p>\n<p>Maybe there will be a Sequel or a Remastered in the Future, where I fletch out the Game, and add all the Stuff I wanted to add.</p>\n<p>I hope you have fun.
