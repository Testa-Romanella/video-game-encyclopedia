I expanded the lore in order to make it into a game. There are 3 different endings.<br/></p>\n<p>Please do not attempt to replicate anything in this game. Inviting the Scungilli man into your life will have unforeseen consequences. I started making this game as a goof, but now I regret it. The Scungilli man took 9 days to make, more than 150 hours. It has consumed me. What started as a joke became a feeding ground for this cryptid. I barely survived the experience.<br/></p>\n<p>Besides that, it was fun to make and I hope you like it. There's a lot of stuff I had to cut out, so if you want me to keep developing the game, we need the blessings of the creator first.
