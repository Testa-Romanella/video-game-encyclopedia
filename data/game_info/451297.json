Click or hold the left mouse button to fire.</p>\n<p>This game was made in four hours for the DevAtlas Jam. You are a satellite that must stop asteroids from colliding with your planet. You have a lot of firepower, but watch out! You can damage your own planet if you aim poorly. The asteroids will keep coming so your duty never ends!</p>\n<p>All coding, graphics, and music were created by me in the duration of this game jam. I recorded a video of the development process and hope to upload that soon*. Tools I used: Unity, Inkscape, and Reaper.</p><p>*Youtube VOD: </p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T06:14:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/646/6461e03fcde5bacb004866636e8322ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Timmay"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
