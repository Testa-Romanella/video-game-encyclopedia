Although, if there's something\u00a0that everyone has experienced, at least once in their lives, it's having a certain sadness in their heart, a scar that never healed, some grudge in which they want justice or revenge.\u201d The game tells the story of four characters.\u00a0What do they all have in common? A deep pain in their hearts\u00a0that takes over their lives and makes it hard for them to\u00a0let go of their pasts. What does their futures hold? Salvation, forgiveness and happiness, or complete surrender to\u00a0the\u00a0despair over their pasts? It's up to you to bring the end of this story.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T22:08:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e42/e42d2b2bc14e27e57763dc380c465a4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AleBH"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
