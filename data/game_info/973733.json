No need to worry \u2013 this app has everything you need to get the timer ticking and the game back on track. Featuring one timer for the Head-to-Head Round, and another for the Charades Round. <br/><br/>PLEASE NOTE: This timer is intended to be used with the Blockbuster Party Game by Big Potato. Without the game, this timer won\u2019t be much use \u2013 unless you like making car horn noises. <br/><br/>The Blockbuster Game is made by Big Potato, an indie board game company from East London. Blockbuster is a super-simple party game for anyone who\u2019s ever seen a movie. And just like all great blockbusters, this one\u2019s a double bill!<br/><br/>Start off with a head-to-head challenge, where two players will face off against one another in a quick-fire buzzer battle, then move onto the second round: a movie charades challenge with a twist. First team to collect a movie from each genre are the winners and the new Blockbuster big shots.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-15T07:43:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17c/17cadea5fb5b003fbd4b53cd99848365_SAsSBy7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Big Potato"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": ["Big Potato"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
