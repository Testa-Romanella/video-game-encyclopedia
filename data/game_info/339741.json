{"id": 339741, "slug": "chomp-n-cheeky-shareware", "name": "Chomp 'N' Cheeky (Shareware)", "name_original": "Chomp 'N' Cheeky (Shareware)", "description": "<strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>\n<p>Chomp 'N'\u00a0Cheeky is a 2D adventure puzzle game that I have been working on since February. It is my first my commercial game, so your feedback and support would be greatly appreciated to help make this game truly awesome!</p>\n<p>The game stars\u00a0Chomp\u00a0 and Cheeky\u00a0</p>\n<p>You play as a smiley face called Cheeky and the enemy is a clam called Chomp.</p>\n<p>Cheeky was out looking for food and ended up lost in the middle of Clam Grove. You need to help get him out by finding the golden key, going through the doors in\u00a0each part of the grove and avoid getting eaten by Chomp and his other clam friends!</p>\r\nPLAY INFORMATION\r\n<p>Currently, I have a shareware version available.\u00a0You can play directly from the browser (above) and you do not have to download anything to play it. You will be introduced to the basic concept of the game with the first section (10 levels). The full version is still in development but will have 100 levels + a boss level after it with all features, obstacles, and puzzles to work out and more enemy clams with special abilities to avoid!<br/></p>\n<p>Please read the in-game popup dialogue that appears after entering the game to learn how to play.</p>\r\nKNOWN ISSUES\r\n<p>This version is currently alpha so please expect the following:</p>\n<ol><li>Lack of abilities to influence the enemy to eat the bread. I am working to improve this. In the mean time, get Chomp to chase you and then lose him so he hits a piece of bread and starts eating in a new area instead.</li><li>Currently no sound or music. This will be added but I am not ready to do that yet!</li><li>The graphics are not final. I plan on enhancing the graphics once I have completed adding all features and content in the full version.</li><li>The game play is complete but still open to enhancements where needed.</li><li>I do not have any plans for multi-player because this is my first commercial game.</li><li>If you find any bugs, please use the in-game bug report form to report them (You may still get a message saying it was not submitted but don't worry it actually\u00a0has, I am fixing this issue).</li><li>Only compatible via PC at the moment. Mobile compatibility is planned after full version is complete.</li><li>It is recommended to view the game in full screen!</li></ol>\n\r\nSUPPORTING ME\r\n<p>I am planning to stream live development work of Chomp 'N'\u00a0Cheeky this\u00a0week starting 8th of July, 2019 at 9:00AM Australian Sydney time on Twitch.
