All music was recorded by me, so if you record game play, you won't get copyright stricken.</p>\n<p>There are many known bugs, as this is a bare bones demo, the biggest of which being that if you are too good at picking up trash, sometimes, you delete other things. that may work in your favor, but it's not supposed to happen.</p>\n<p>I plan to do some more work on this without the pressure of the Jam submission.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T03:09:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6cc/6cc5246bab7718418d41084930db349f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JonoExplainsThings"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
