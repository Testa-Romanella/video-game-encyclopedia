This is achievable with the <strong>high degree of visual interaction</strong> that the application offers.</p>\n<p>Special Relativity Sandbox is also being submitted as an entry for <strong>3Blue1Brown Summer of Mathematical Exposition</strong> edition #2. Thanks to the organizers of <strong>SuME2</strong>, this contest was a great motivational help!</p>\n<p>Joint the discord server to report <strong>Bugs </strong>and leave <strong>Feedback</strong>!</p>\n<p>Documentation on how to use is found within the app itself.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T19:59:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d4/4d48e44e7f3f8f10d8a1297334d301d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ccbotix"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
