On the phone you can tap anywhere on the screen to get the flamingo to flap. See how far you can go!<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Please give the game a try and let me know what you think! My best run I got for my final playtest before release\u00a0was 57 gems.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits<br/></strong></p>\n<p><em>I used Kenney's UI prompts for the control prompts that show in the beginning.
