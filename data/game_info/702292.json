You have been sent into the area to search for survivors and to eliminate the Buffer. However, not everything is as it seems. <br/><br/><strong>North Hollow Heights</strong> was an ordinary neighborhood before the Buffer emergence. While you seek out a way to destroy the Buffer, explore the hastily abandoned homes and learn what transpired within. Maybe you\u2019ll even find some of the residents who were unable to leave before the area was sealed off. <br/><br/><strong>Gameplay</strong>: You\u2019ll have to avoid the Buffers within North Hollow Heights as you solve puzzles and learn the fates of its residents.
