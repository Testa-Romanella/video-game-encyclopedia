If you knock down the door, the door gives you neither treat nor trick. Every 5 rooms is a boss room, after which an extra life is offered as an upgrade and a new set of rooms becomes available.<br/></p><p>Current Status: Player can move around with doors permanently attached to its head and side. Stats appear on the HUD and Pause menu. Restart is super buggy. Buttons don't work because I tried to learn the new input system on a whim.
