Best played with headphones.</p>\n<p>Made in 48 hours for the 2019 GMTK game jam. Created with RPG Maker MV.<br/></p>\n<p>Since the theme of the game jam is \"only one\", I went with \"only one sense\", the sense being hearing. This is my very first finished game (unless you count that text adventure I made in third grade). I'd like to expand on the idea - iron out the bugs, add more levels with enemies, treasure chests etc. - but that's a plan for another day. Enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>Sounds by the following users of Freesound.org:<br/>apolloaiello, funwithsound, gregswinford, \"Footsteps, Concrete, A.wav\" by InspectorJ (www.jshaw.co.uk), Kukensius, LittleRobotSoundFactory, ljudman, makemebad, Marnenagel, medialint</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-06T00:26:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/008/008ee72c8f8ba228a4a4ed0208559393.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fimbulvetr"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
