Customize your own tank, recruit allies with unique abilities to fight alongside you, and defeat the badguys with a combination of teamwork and gratuitous explosives.</p>\n<p>This game's character portraits were created with the genetic algorithm \"Artbreeder.\" That means each of them is a new, unique character who doesn't exist anywhere else and has no human artist. I'm working on the UI art right now. The rest is \"grayboxed\" with random assets I\u00a0found in my files. Hopefully I will have time to replace this art with my own. &gt;:o</p>\n<p><strong>Core gameplay loop:</strong></p>\n<p>1). Test your luck by rolling against chance to unlock new characters, each of whom commands her own laser-shooting \"space tank.\"</p>\n<p>2). Visit numerous sectors across the galaxy, each with its own lore, conflicts, and narrative.</p>\n<p>3). Build a team of characters suited to the sector's unique challenges and fight the badguys.</p>\n<p>4). Make decisions in the heat of battle that will affect the story and the fate of those around you!</p>\n<p>5). Depending on your choices, new characters might become available to roll for (to add to your team).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T12:12:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d12/d1278a1c30acb26a3a433811be7e80bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Cass Aleatory"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
