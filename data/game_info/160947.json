How to play? Just tap at any screen position to move the player. With a short jump you earn one point. With a long jump you earn two points. If you jump and miss a white tile platform, and you don't have any white tile platforms below : you lose! Try to do as many jumps as you can, don't be touched by the big boss wall with spikes coming from the left, continuously, and don't fall by missing tiles.
