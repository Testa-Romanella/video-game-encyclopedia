I needed all those 72 hours to complete this. At about 40 minutes from the end, I had the game completed and for god\u2019s sake, it worked and was ready.</p><p>It has been a lot since my last solo Ludum Dare (like 4 years probably) but I'm so happy that this is the game for my comeback. This time the theme was \"Stuck in a loop\", and the Ludum Dare 47 started a bit earlier, at midnight for me. I thought about this concept just a few hours after I went to bed, and I've fallen in love with it. I believe this truly resonates with how I feel and have felt and this is why I think I've managed to make it conveys those feelings to the player.</p>\n\n<p>I decided one month ago that I would have used PICO-8 for this jam, and I'm glad that I've chosen it because I had so much fun with it! The editor is so lovely and very well packed.<br/>I did all my work with it (except using notepad to reorder PICO-8 code tab) and I think that it helped to keep me focused, not having to switch to different programs and stuff.</p>\n\n<p>PICO-8 also has a few limits to make the game feel like a true retro one, like palette color, sprite sheet, sound, and most of all (for me at least) code.<br/>The last day, at about 12 hours from the end and the game ALMOST completed, I reached PICO-8 tokens limit (a token is more or less a code word), so I couldn't write any more code! I totally panicked and had to refactor all my beloved copy-paste code.</p>\n<p>Three hours later, I had the same game but with more or less another 1000 free tokens, the rest of the day was pure anxiety since I had to be sure I didn't reach the limit again, which I reached a few times nonetheless, needing to strip away debug code and some other refactor.</p>\n<p>That said, PICO-8 limits are what makes it so satisfying and charming. They helped me focus on the important things and without them I wouldn't have made this game as it is.</p>\n\n<p>This time, thank again to PICO-8, I managed to do all by myself: code, art, sfx, music, levels and stuff (ok PICO-8 Celeste I\u2019ve copied your shake camera code but never mind).<br/>I am very proud of this but, most of all, this helped me to create the vision I had in mind in the best way I could within the 72 hours.</p>\n\n<p>This Ludum Dare has been an incredible and important experience to myself, one that I hope will help me going on towards my path.</p>\n<p>If you managed to read this far, I hope you will also manage to play my game and also leave some feedback!<br/>I'll love to hear what you think about it &lt;3</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for your time...but</p>NOT ENOUGH", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T05:12:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/689/689d624238dea9669cfe1bd010917bca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Elia"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
