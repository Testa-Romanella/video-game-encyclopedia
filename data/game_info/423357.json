My smoking owl has decided to run a role playing game through Discord. Come join at https://discord.gg/fxteZS. The game was designed so that people can come and go as they want.</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>My owl loves to play Dungeon and Dragons and other tabletop RPGs but I don't really want to play with him anymore. So I created this Discord server for him so he can make some new friends to play with. Let me explain the rules real quick.</p>\n<p>You are a party of wizards/sorcerers/warlocks/priests exploring a dungeon like this:<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>Each of you control one character in the party, and you will have to cooperate to not die (too often). Create a character with !createcharacter <name> (wizard|sorcerer|priest|warlock) and move around with !move (north|south|west|east).</name></p>\n<p>\r\nSometimes you will run into monsters which you will have to fight! Use !cast <spell> [<character>] to cast a spell (you can optionally specify a character name if you want to cast the spell on another character). But be careful, you will have to step to the frontline to cast a spell, and the monster usually attacks the players on the front. In other words, active characters are the ones in risk of dying. So you will have to alternate with your party members. Each class have different spells. Use !character to see into about your character and their spells.\r\nUse !help to see all commands. I think that's it.\r\nUhm, just one more thing. My owl is ... how do I say it ... He is quite something. Be patient with him, okay. Good luck!\r\n</character></spell></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T03:55:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebb/ebba283a5b5aa7cf03ff814c8d336fc7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eastvillage"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
