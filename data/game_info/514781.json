You have more interest in hacking into places than attending college classes. Therefore, you have got yourself a computer which you can use to hack into several places.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This hacking will require your skill in making the correct word out of the jumbled ones. Once you do, you have hacked into the system.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also there are a couple of easter eggs in the game. If you can find them, then take a screenshot of it and then tag me on Twitter (@monteboombox). Good luck, Hacker!</p>\n\n<p>PS. This is my first game here. If you like it then please leave a suggestion on my Twitter. You can DM me @monteboombox.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T08:49:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e2/2e2c8ff75b7d749f0734a598e3413b75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["MonteBoomBox"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
