Unfortunately, I had no clue that there was an entire sdk for google cardboard, and ended up doing all the programming the hard way, although this did give me the opportunity to learn a lot from the project. This is what i ended up with, It has most of the features from the original arcade game, not all tho.\u00a0there are 3 levels, each with increasing difficulty.\u00a0 I was only really able to release for android, as the system needs a mobile device, and apple hates devs, but I have included the xcode project if you want to build and install the app yourself.</p>\n<p>Definitely a fun project, hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T03:02:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00c/00c5ff3d406cc6bbe56df8d0e75eae19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Carl0011"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
