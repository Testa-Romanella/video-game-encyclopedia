Cook for your dreary customers some approximately delicious ramen but remind them there's a one topping limit! Keep an eye on your electricity meter as the rates go up and make sure you keep serving customers lest you're put out of business.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Don't forget to plug in your equipment!<br/></p>\n<p>Instructions</p>\n<p>A and D keys to pan left and right. Click and drag plugs, click to pick up other items and click again to interact with appliances.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Customers will appear with orders above their heads. If they ask for two toppings tap the \"Only 1 Topping\" sign to remind them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To make the ramen you'll need to put the noodles from the box into the cooker and plug it in. The noodles will change colour and eventually finish cooking. You'll then need to heat up the broth by plugging it in. Use the ladel to chuck it in a bowl then find the correct topping on the left and serve! When they're finished take their credit cards and run it through the card machine by the socket to take their payments. Repeat!</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Callum Tweedie-Walker - Technical</p>\n<p>Alec Thomas - Art</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T16:20:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8e/f8e541dc79535eaab5612ffd9a993274.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MonteBearo"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
