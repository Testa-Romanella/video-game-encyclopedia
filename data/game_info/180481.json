Two pistols of a length that definitely isn't a result of overcompensation. Ten locations. Ten targets. Ten teddy-bears.</p>\n<p>Slaughter them. Be rad. Radslaughter is a physics-based puzzle arcade game which gets difficult. Kill each of the targets without smashing your face open or being massively dismembered by razorblades. Find the secret teddy-bear in each level and complete them as fast as you can to get 5 stars (none of that 3 star crap here!)</p>\n<p>Made in 72 hours for the #indiesvspewdiepie competition on GameJolt.\u00a0http://jams.gamejolt.io/indies...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be4/be4bab90d537d574397a1ea68d98d25e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chequered Ink", "NAL"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
