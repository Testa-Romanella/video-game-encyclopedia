Should be considered a very early demo, as I didn't really get to include anywhere near everything i wanted to. It features original music, digitized hand-drawn graphics, and a mix of both hand-crafted and procedurally generated areas to explore. As of right now it doesn't feature traditional Yume-nikki-style effects, but it does incldue a fair bit of item-based progression. I still tried to maintain the sense of nonlinear exploration that characterizes Yume Nikki and most of its fangames.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Developed by: Juan Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez</p>\n<p>Graphics:</p>\n<ul><li>Hand-drawn graphics: Juan Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez</li><li>City tilesets used: GrandmaDeb's Modern Exterior Tiles, PandaMaru's Street Tiles</li></ul>\n<p>Scripts:</p>\n<ul><li>Kai Monkey's Random Dungeons v2</li><li>Yanfly's Parallax Lock</li></ul>\n<p>Music: Juan Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez\u00a0</p>\n<p>(All music was composed by me.

Just click accept and the game will still keep working normally. Not sure why this is happens, it started happening a couple days before the dealine and I wasn't able to find the issue on time, but it doesn't really affect the game in any way si I'll just fix it in an update when I find what the problem is.</li><li>I had to include the default Runtime Package ata in the installer bc I used a few sprites and sound effects from it. I eventually plan to replace everything i used from the RTP with my own graphics and sounds, at which point I'll remove the RTP data from the installation.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T16:53:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/384/384212ebd0b4b11766a5e9bf6ea295fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["imsobadatnicknames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
