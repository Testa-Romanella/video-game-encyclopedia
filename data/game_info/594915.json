However, the music robot's audio player has malfunctioned, causing the music to get <strong><em>deeper and deeper</em></strong> over time. The deeper the music gets, it will activate enemies from further away, because deeper pitched sounds travel further distances than higher pitched sounds. You can also do a double jump.\u00a0This game was made for Ludum Dare 48 where the theme was deeper and deeper. I think the game fits the theme because the music gets deeper over time.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Programing, art, sound effects: A.J.</p>\n<p>Music: Shawn.</p>\n<p>The font is arcade classic and made by PizzaDude.</p>\n<p>The color palette is Orbee's master palette and made by Orbitron.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T11:33:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d24/d244322664bf8e2bf451437c604d0167.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["A J"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
