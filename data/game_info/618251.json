Control <em>Monsieur Corcle\u00a0</em>and try to either stay alive as long as possible or obtain as high a score as possible. I challenge you to do both!\u00a0</p>\n<p>What makes this game different is that it directly challenges you to play better. You see, if you lose more than 5 times, you will find that the game c****s itself!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Adherence to the theme:\u00a0The game showcases 3 different forms of elements joining together:\u00a0</p>\n<ol><li>The world is joined with your screen. If you move out of the screen, you will die as the world does not exist anymore.</li><li>The player's stats are joined with the obstacles and the player's decisions. If you want to achieve a higher play time, avoid the obstacles. But if you want to obtain a higher score, pass between the obstacles without dying! <em><strong>I DARE YOU</strong>\u00a0</em>to get a score of above 50 along with a time of 50 or more seconds!</li><li><strong>The most prominent one -\u00a0</strong>The fate of the game lies in your hands. It's directly joined with your skills. Die more than 5 times, and you're in for a surprise!</li></ol>\n<p><strong>PLEASE DO LEAVE A COMMENT!
