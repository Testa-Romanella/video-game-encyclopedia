We were tasked with making a single button game, that was 2D and had to include animated sprites. We also drew a noun and verb out of a hat that was to be our game hence \"Crazy Cheese\". Hope you enjoy playing it and if you have any feedback please let me know. Thank you. This is the first project I have uploaded so hopefully it works, if not let me know.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/674/67405fa994795a3f03392a050c0f26d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Slambert"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
