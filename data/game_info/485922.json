Cooperate with your crew of fellow fishmen to be the first to reach the treasure island. In Repirates, the crew of up to four players is tasked to keep afloat the ship of Captain Goldfish and fend off the dangerous birdmen that try to stop you. The dangers don't stop here tho, other pirate crews will try to sink your ship to get to the treasure first, so performing repair and maintenance tasks on your ship is mandatory.
