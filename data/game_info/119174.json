The restriction of the jam was to use only 4 colors and at Gameboy resolution. You control a forklift and your mission is to load the item crates onto the ship with a limited number of pickups and moves. This is one of the few games were I also did the sfx and music as well as the programming and art, so don't expect wonders! But I think it's a charming little thing, at the very least. :)<br/></p><p>Controls:</p><ul><li>Spacebar = Action button</li><li>Backspace = Back button</li><li>Arrow keys = D-pad</li></ul><p>Palette swap cheat codes:</p><p>On the Nintendo intro screen, hold space and use the arrow keys to swap between 4 different color palettes!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e40/e40800b98913f9897d0cc517b60a9717.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JackOatley"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
