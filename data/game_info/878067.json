But beware that a doctor lurks in the shadows and will chase you if he discovers you!</p>\n\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>Use WASD or arrow keys to control the black capsule. Get others within your reach to infect them. You win if you infect a percentage of population higher than the herd immunity percentage set at the beginning (minimum is 50%, maximum is 90%). There is a doctor disguised as a normal individual. If you get near him, he starts to chase you, and you are able to identify him. If he reaches you, you lose the game.</p>\n\n<p>In future updates, these following features may be added:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Sound Effects</li><li>Different Game Modes</li><li>Achievements</li><li>Bug Fixing</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T05:45:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/819/819a923c4051507e9ddd038b62541b27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Drca1997"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
