You play as a cute little cat, pilot of a fish-rocket. Your mission: blow up your adversary. Players start back to back and race in opposite directions. During the first part of the circuit, players accumulate as much gas as possible, as measured by a number of points, by passing over three different boosts. When they reach the confrontation road, the players can collide (<strong>BOOM\u00a0</strong>!) or avoid each other.<br/></p>\n\r\nCONTROLS :\r\n<p>You'll need two Xbox controllers to play the game.</p>\n\n\r\nCREDITS :\r\n<p><strong>Game &amp; Level Designers</strong> :</p>\n<p>L\u00e9o BOUSSOUIRA-TERRISSE\u00a0&amp; Zo\u00e9 SEMP\u00c9\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Programmers</strong> :</p>\n<p>Marc CERUTTI &amp; Ilan OUAMROUCHE</p>\n<p><strong>Artists</strong> :</p>\n<p>Johanna BIRRALDACCI &amp; Astrid MERIT</p>\n<p><strong>Sound designer &amp; Composer</strong> :\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gabriel SAUVAGE\u00a0</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Thomas CHASTAGNOL\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>UX Designer &amp; UR</strong> :\u00a0</p>\n<p>Christopher NORTON</p>\n<p><strong>UI Designer</strong> :</p>\n<p>Zo\u00e9 SEMP\u00c9</p>\n<p><strong>Project Manager</strong> :</p>\n<p>Eve-Marie TISSIER</p>\n\n<p><em>Thanks to all our playtesters !\u00a0</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T09:14:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5f/c5f42996438750d02ecab77ca322048e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["m21-cerutti", "Riukko", "SushiChat", "AstridM", "wauldelta", "Zoeezz", "Cebolla21", "secretasnman"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
