{"id": 979161, "slug": "zerko", "name": "Zerko", "name_original": "Zerko", "description": "Some call it reverse sudoku, while others call it a nullification game, but it's Zerko - a puzzle game filled with shapes, numbers, and a straightforward goal: make every number zero.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTo achieve this, you need to strategically place blocks of various shapes and values so that the numbers on the board effectively \"remove up\" to zero.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLike all my games, this one too is about relaxation... Just chill. There are no points, no time pressure, no data collection, no in-app purchases, no ads, no nonsense ;) My only hope is that you'll enjoy it and that I'll be able to add new content and levels for you in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRelaxing audio by: Marek Koszczy\u0144ski", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-29T10:24:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ec/7ec425e3b19c68fcd266d81cbb475846.jpg", "website": "http://rainbowtrain.eu", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Maciej Targoni"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Maciej Targoni"], "esrb_rating": null}
