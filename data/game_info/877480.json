This was my High School Final that is now a Passion Project that I, knowing myself,\u00a0 might abandon at any moment. For now it is at it's pre-release stages and I decided to open it to public testing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Currently there is no sound nor graphics however I plan to add some. It is a text based combat game that as of the moment has all of the lore inaccessible, however on it's final release it will have lore and a slight story to follow.</p>\n<p>The game currently has 2 floors with 2 bosses, out of 10 floors with 10+ bosses.</p>\n<p>Here are the things I am looking for the most in the testing:<br/></p><ol><li>bugs</li><li>scaling issues(Enemies becoming easier or potentially too hard/impossible)</li><li>ideas, email me any ideas you may have at RatSouls@gmail.com</li><li>Just any general things that interest you and potential players.</li></ol>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading this far!
