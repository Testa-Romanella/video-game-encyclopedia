{"id": 361065, "slug": "shifty-wizards", "name": "Shifty Wizards", "name_original": "Shifty Wizards", "description": "<p>Shifty Wizards is a card game for 2-4 players\u00a0\u00a0with the goal of keeping your HP at +1 after every turn. If your HP does not equal 1, you will lose a life. This will continue until only one Wizard is left standing... sitting? Yeah, they're sitting.</p>\n<p>This game was made in 48 hours for the GameMaker's ToolKit Game Jam and is very broken.</p>\n<p>Rules:\r\n</p>\n<p>1. Cards must add up to +1 HP by the end of a player's turn.\r\n<br/>2. On a player's turn, Cards can be Drafted or Cast.\r\n<br/>3. Drafting a Card is adding the Card to a player's hand, which gives the Player +1 Mana.\r\n<br/>4. Casting a Card is removing the Card from a player's hand, which costs Mana, and adding it to another player's hand (the Card is now Drafted by the new player).\r\n<br/>5. Cards cannot be Cast on the same turn they are Drafted.\r\n<br/>6. Cards last a Duration of turns. At the end of that Duration, the Card is removed from play. Duration counters are incremented at the start of each turn after being Drafted.</p>\n<p>Developed By:<br/>- Ethan Caraway<br/>- Jordan Overmyer<br/>- Marcus Tegtmeier<br/>- Jacob Moore</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T20:52:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/356/356e24b5a0125dd635b08f09ff7ee3f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["jordanovermyer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
