Zusi 3 Aerosoft Edition is a train simulation for PCs, the professional version of which is also being used in railway companies for engine driver training purposes. It features faithful track recreations, authentic driving and braking behaviour, prototypical signalling and timetables, as well as various variants of the train protection systems PZB and LZB.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Zusi 3 Aerosoft Edition is especially suited for ambitious hobby train drivers. Beginners can learn the strings of this topic thanks to various assistances \u2013 for example, beginners and advanced users can set the protection systems less strict for an easier learning curve.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In total, Zusi 3 comes with 10 routes from different eras, including the route Cologne\u2013D\u00fcsseldorf that was developed for the Aerosoft Edition. This means more than 500 kilometres of track for you to explore.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Zusi 3 can also be extended to your liking. Choose from a wide range of additional routes, vehicles, timetables, and more; download them, and add them to the sim \u2013 or use the included editors to create your own expansions for Zusi and share them with the community.<br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Drive in the route network following pre-defined timetables.
