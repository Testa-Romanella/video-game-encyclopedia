After the store was closed one day, he made himself a Kapamaki.  He was thinking about closing the business the following week. <br/><br/>Just when he picked up the tiny Kapamaki and was about to put into his mouth, he heard a little voice: \u201dDon\u2019t eat me!  I will make you a lot of money!\u201d  <br/><br/>He looked around, there was no one there except himself.  Everyone had left.  <br/><br/>He raised his chopsticks again, and the voice sounded again.  \u201dI promise. I will save your business and make you rich.\u201d  <br/><br/>This time, he found where the voice came from.  It was the Kapamaki between his chopsticks.  <br/><br/>He was so amused and asked, \u201dHow will you make me money?  People are becoming vegetarian.  They don\u2019t eat sushi anymore.\u201d  <br/><br/>Kapamaki said, \u201dI can run!  I can entertain people so they will all run to your restaurant to watch me run.  You can charge them admission to watch me run.\u201d <br/><br/>Masao said, \u201dReally?\u201d  <br/><br/>Kapamaki said, \u201dPut me on the track.  Let me show you.\u201d <br/><br/>Now Masao became curious.  Having nothing better to do, he put the Kapamaki in the track of the sushi river.  <br/><br/>The tiny Kapamaki tried very hard to run, but he was quite wobbly at first.  After two rounds, he started getting better and better.  <br/><br/>Masao smiled.  <br/><br/>He said, \u201dIt's very nice of you to care about my business and try to help.  But how much can you make?  The rent is expensive.  My chef has to pay his mortgage.\u201d  <br/><br/>Kapamaki blinked his eyes.  He said, \u201dIf you make more sushi, we can all make money for you.\u201d  <br/><br/>Masao said, \"That\u2019s easy.\"  After all, he was the best sushi master in the whole country.  So he started making another Kapamaki.  <br/><br/>The first little Kapamaki said, \u201dJoin us together.  We will unite and become bigger, better, and faster!  And we will make you more money.\u201d  <br/><br/>Masao put the two Kapamaki together, and Bang!  They merged to become a new sushi Tekkamaki.  <br/><br/>Masao was so surprised and happy.  He made more and more sushi, and kept on merging them.  The next day, he put a sign outside his restaurant - \u201cMerge Sushi.  Ticket price: $10.\u201d  People felt curious and came in.  They found the sushi racing going on.  People started to put money down, betting which sushi will win.  <br/><br/>When more and more people rushed to Masao's restaurant to watch sushi racing, Masao\u2019s sushi got an invitation to a talk show to introduce his sushi restaurant. Now people all over the world know about Masao's restaurant.  In 2 years, Masao has become a billionaire.  And this all started with a little magical sushi!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:33:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb1/cb13db022e9aca0da55b780f101acc9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Magic Works"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Magic Works"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
