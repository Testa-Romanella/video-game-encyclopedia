{"id": 868170, "slug": "tanima", "name": "TAnima", "name_original": "TAnima", "description": "Your main goal is to go through the Last Doors and escape. You can do this from the beginning but it's not that easy. All that you need - are cards.<h3>Gameplay</h3><br/>You fight enemies, bosses. Collecting resources and unlocking new upgrades. Each run is different. When you die, you respawn in the Bastion. <br/>You are getting stronger by collecting new weapons and cute creatures called minions. <br/><br/>Minions can grant you special abilities, buff your statistics, die for you, and some of them... discover interesting secrets!<br/><br/>TAnima is always here with you. You can hear her talking to you all the time.<h3>Deck-building</h3><br/>Dungeons are procedurally generated, but you take an active part in the generation algorithm with the cards that you choose. There are a few types of cards:<br/><ul><li> Quest Cards - that's your main goal for the run. These cards have their own difficulty level and requirements for your deck to use them. <br/></li><li> Room Cards - special rooms that will be added to the dungeon. Like a shop where you can buy powerups. <br/></li><li> Dungeon Cards - each dungeon card adds one dungeon floor with all the special rooms. Each of the Dungeon Cards represents a different location. Special rooms may be acting differently depending on the dungeon that you are in.<br/></li><li> Item Cards - your starting items in the run. You can find more items in the dungeon of course, but at least you can choose how you would like to start.<br/></li><li> Upgrade Cards - changing and upgrading other cards or mechanics in the dungeon.</li></ul><br/>Each card has its cost, which you pay - fighting enemies. Each fight is harder than the previous one so you have to choose wisely.<br/>Some cards have special requirements that have to be met in order to use them. <br/>Each one of the Quests is a unique challenge that you can customize as you wish.<h3>Story</h3><br/>You are Sirius. One of many miners locked in the penal mining colony to gather the crystalized biomaterial called TAnima. You have been left here with other miners a long time ago.<br/><br/>TAnima is a living crystal. She talks to you and other miners in your mind. She is able to twist reality based on human memories. And she likes you.<br/><br/>On your journey, you will learn more about the plot. Meet new friends. Discover why all of these happened. All of this for one simple reason - come back home.<br/><br/>Some of these parts of the story are represented as cards. Some are just a consequence of your actions. There are many storylines. You can choose which one you would like to explore first.<h3>Exploration</h3><br/>When you build your world with cards, there are a lot of secrets to discover. Sometimes you will find clues of where to find a new interesting storyline. Or maybe a new item? Maybe a card? Maybe some doors that have been locked before will be open when you find a key later? Who knows? You can find it out!<h3>Permanent Upgrade</h3><br/>When you die - you will respawn in the Bastion. Along your journey, you will meet new friends that will join you and open new possibilities. You can buy new cards with resources found in the dungeon. You will find new minions that will help you fight enemies. Everything is here!<h3>Development</h3><br/>I am solo indie gamedev. My development process is transparent.
