Due to this, the game is able to be offered for the current price as I feel that every purchase a customer makes, should aim to give them the best value for their money. $1/hour has always been a metric I have stood by as a consumer and I have aimed to surpass that as a developer.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T03:23:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95f/95fae0486a868a58f4341d8c1f20a92f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 249, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Falling Ash Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Falling Ash Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
