Lots of 'em. How else would you destroy your foes?<br/><br/>You start with one big cannon which you can level up throughout the game but also there are 4 little ones that help you. Destroying enemies will grant you some 'scraps' which can be used to repair and upgrade your mini-cannons. Your main cannon is immortal by the way.. unless enemies reach it and damage your whole game board.<br/>The objective is to survive as much as you can and climb the leaderboards.<br/><br/>By playing, and more precise, losing, you will get an amount of coins which can be used to purchase better mini-cannons as well as some skins for your main cannon and backgrounds for your game.\u00a0<br/><br/>See you at the top!</p>\n<p><strong>Download for free on the Google Play Store.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66f/66f347c6e60496d44e4e488267059c30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 269, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Crystall"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
