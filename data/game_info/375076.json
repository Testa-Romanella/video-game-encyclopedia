That's it pretty standard platforming game but make paradox copies for you that can hold buttons open doors, and even hold things for you to solve puzzles.\u00a0And the best part? Make as many as you want, 50\u00a0timelines on screen? No problem.\u00a0currently 38 levels of a planned 50 are complete. Yes Im aware it stinks to rewind time to the begenning\u00a0 every time but its so ingrained into the levels at this point fixing it means starting over, so that will be the sequel.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-16T05:41:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ea/1eae094530f7461b5dea619cf5d81aa4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["spoonsinbunnies"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
