As you progress, enemies spawn not only on the color you're on, but also on the other two. Only one color is active at a time, but keep an eye on them, as swapping between colors can change your situation drastically!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:\r\n<br/></strong>WASD to move, mouse pointer to aim, left click to shoot. Be careful, as you move slower when firing!</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:\r\n</strong><br/>Programming by Sean Hale (Mr1upMachine), Adam Hayes (Adams880), Ty Simpson (Bitfrost), and Chris Strahl\r\n<br/>Art direction and design by Stuart Tresslar\r\n<br/>Music by Timmy Hawkins (FunkyHedgehog)\r\n<br/>Special thanks to Tyler Hocker!\r\n<br/><br/>\n<strong>Source:\r\n</strong><br/>You can find our assets and source code at\u00a0https://github.com/Mr1upMachine/GMTK-GameJam-2019</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T19:19:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fc/2fc98b7a4cb72d1d9f50dc3a5aaf1b6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mr1upMachine"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
