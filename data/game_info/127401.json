You must rotate hex-shaped pieces of train tracks to direct your trains through the level to their destinations. However, you need to be quick because if you\u2019re not fast enough, your trains may go off the rails and crash, or even crash into each other. Faster trains, longer trains, and multiple trains will appear as the levels progress, so you\u2019ll need to stay on your toes.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ff/7ff30570a81dc954fd86478e0a0db0c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Games@MQ"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
