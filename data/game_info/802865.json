Each Human's emotional perception of their environment is contingent on not only environmental characteristics but also on the individual's cognitive functions and consciousness. According to Carl Jung's definition of psychological functions in his book \"Psychological Types,\" cognitive functions are distinct mental processes that exist within the psyche of every individual. This concept is a key pillar of support for his theory of personality types. In his book, he described four primary psychological functions: Thinking, Feeling, Sensation, and Intuition. UTOPIA is an experimental immersive virtual reality project comprising four environments representing Carl Jung's four primary psychological functions. We used Unreal Engine, a 3D computer graphics game engine, to design UTOPIA. Every individual could enter the UTOPIA and experience the four distinct virtual reality environments via a VR headset, each representing\u00a0 Carl Jung's four primary cognitive functions. Each environment is designed based on specific physical features and meaning-related dimensions that correlate them with specified psychological functions. Experience with UTOPIA can elicit specific affective reactions for scientific, therapeutic, and recreational\u00a0purposes.</p>\n<p><strong>Intuition:\u00a0</strong><strong>Intuition is also presented as a basic psychological function as hunches and visions provide an alternative means of perception to sensation: \"It is that psychological function which transmits perceptions in an unconscious way. Everything, whether outer or inner objects or their associations, can be the object of this perception. Intuition has this peculiar quality.\" UTOPIA's intuition environment is a circular maze. The users should reach the center of the maze. The environment evokes the sensation of being in the depths of the sea.</strong></p>\n\r\n\r\nCreators: Arefe Paydar, Ali Nakhaee, Amir Najimi\r\nEducator: Ali Andaji Garmaroodi, Pooria Baniadam", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T11:37:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d9/2d950a7d0d00c9325ab3ade81dbf2369.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UTOPIA"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
