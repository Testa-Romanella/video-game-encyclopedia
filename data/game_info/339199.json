Any bugs will be fixed after rating is over (legitimately did not have time to test the build). Made using Unity 2019.3, and SteamVR 2.0.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> There is currently a bug where \"wrong solution\" glasses that are thrown away can no longer be poured. For now, please use \"new\" glasses when ruining chemical mixes.<br/></p>\n<p>------------------------------------</p>\n<p>A bio-engineered super-virus has been released, and is slowly crawling across the earth.
