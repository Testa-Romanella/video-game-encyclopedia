They can walk through bushes and tress and rocks and their objective is to trap you with their nature elements. The more they hit you the more the time slows down until it breaks and you will fail cuz time will be broken. But yoh can speed up time by killing and killing 50 elemental soldiers.</p>\n<p>This is hard but in fact you are supposed to have fun with time slowing and speeding up, this is a survival game in an arena\u00a0 not a campaign.</p>\n\n\n<p>i know this is my worst game so far but i didnt have time because of high school. plz follow me and give me feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T13:12:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d8/1d874e4702bce5355440cf95dc982234.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Em"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
