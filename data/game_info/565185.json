The May Day festival happens to be under way when Dahlia, her little sister Daisy, and her friends Ivy and Aster come upon the quiet village. Villagers encourage Dahlia and her friends to play and celebrate with them all day! They have many activities available for the discerning celebrant, and at the villagers' behest, Dahlia and friends split up to celebrate the festival, and agree to reconvene in the evening for the May Queen crowning ceremony. Fairly quickly, things start to change . . .\u00a0 will Dahlia be caught up in the celebration?</p>\n<p>This game is a series of minigames centered around celebrating May Day, a spring festival. The player is a human that happens upon a village that offers several themed activities for them to participate in. You can collect flowers by catching them, leap over fire, and decorate the May Day bush. As the day progresses, the fewer friends you are able to find. It is the player's prerogative to find out what's happening, and see if the celebrations in the village are as harmless and fun as they seem.</p>\n\n<p>Austin Acosta - Programmer</p>\n<p>Vlada Evtushenko - Background Artist</p>\n<p>Devin Fitzgerald - Programmer</p>\n<p>Leah Holm - Character Designer, Level Designer</p>\n<p>Schnerby Jacquet -\u00a0Character Designer\r\n</p>\n<p>Quela Reyes - Graphic Designer, UI/UX Designer</p>\n\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T03:58:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa7/fa74cf48f6c56127086ef0f3398d4095.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Leah C.
