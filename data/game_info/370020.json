Since these rituals are not to be done alone, she has turned her owner into a fairy to help out.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move Zoey: WASD</p>\n<p>Shoot an [unspecified ccg] card: arrow keys</p>\n<p>Move Fairy-Matt: mouse</p>\n<p>Move on to next level: J (must have collected all keys and gotten both characters to the door)</p>\n<p>Other Stuff:</p>\n<p>F2 - save a state, F3 - load state, 1-5 - pick a scaling multiplier for the window from 1x to 5x (multiplied by 320x200), 0 - reset room (in case of a bug I missed), alt + enter - switch to fullscreen, alt + F4 - close game (for when in fullscreen)</p>\n<p>Made for Extra Credits Jam #5, which had the theme \"passage\". In addition, these extra challenges were attempted: design for 3 hands, use an MS-DOS cga palette (which in my mind most properly includes a CGA resolution, hence being 320x200), include mention of eating jam, include media outside the game, include Zoey somehow, use only diagetic ui,\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was heavily inspired by\u00a0Arctic Adventure.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I uploaded a linux version (or rather \"Ubuntu\" version, as game maker studio puts it), but I'm not in a good position at the moment to test if it works due to recent computer troubles requiring switching computers entirely. I used the same build method that I've used in the past though, so it should work as well as the windows version does.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-30T06:04:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63b/63b8a445b97fc3c671c1cf67c5761491.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Colin EUMP"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
