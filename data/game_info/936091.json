Brand new opportunity just arrived - this planet we found is fulla junk! Clean it up, ship the waste out to space, and we'll be more than on our way to the top of corporate. How do you like our new job, boss?<br/><br/>Click the planet to collect waste and shoot it into orbit. Use that waste to create drone armies and AI servers that can work on collecting more waste. Keep that waste in orbit and watch as it fills up the vacuum of space (yes, that's how my game connects to the theme of the jam).</p><p>You can dismiss tabs by clicking on the Planet tab or by clicking on the same tab again.</p><p>Is this game good? No. It's more of an experiment into something new that I wanted to try :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T19:52:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06e/06eb502b22b5e6b5c77ec2391b256101.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Billy :)"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
