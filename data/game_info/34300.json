{"id": 34300, "slug": "breakthru", "name": "BreakThru", "name_original": "BreakThru", "description": "BreakThru is a puzzle game that puts a new spin on the Tetris\u00ae* concept.<br/><br/>You face a \"wall\" of tiles of different colors with some bombs and cans among them. Your goal is to clear out the wall. To make tiles disappear you need to double-tap on at least two tiles of the same color next to each other. The more tiles disappear at the same time, the higher your score is.<br/><br/>The top bonus row consists of randomly generated tiles accompanied by bombs. This row always floats from the right to the left side of the screen, occasionally falling down from time to time. You can slide the screen down or tap a bonus row item to drop the row when you need.<br/><br/>When the \"wall\" is narrower than the screen, you can move all the tiles from one screen side to the other to meet the bonus row when it falls. Bombs and cans are helpful: deleted cans add points to your score, exploded bombs destroy the tiles and cans around them.<br/><br/>As you remove all tiles of the same color, the bonus row will never give you tiles of this color at the current level. As soon as you clear the wall, a new level begins. The higher your level is, the more colors are used (up to 6), the faster the bonus row floats, and the more often it occasionally falls.<br/><br/>---------------------------<br/>Our players also like: Tetris, tetColor.<br/><br/>---------------------------<br/>* Tetris is a registered trademark of Electronic Arts Inc.
