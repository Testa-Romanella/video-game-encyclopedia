Suuuure you did.\r\n</p>\n<p>Yeah so, well, you now play as one!\r\n</p>\n<p>It  seems that they are in enormous debt, as the funeral house claims to  have lost 1 Million Dollars thanks to their Necromancing Shenanigans.  And thus, they were assigned a godawful job at a farm, and now they are  forced to be a farmer! However, their necromantic powers aren\u2019t for  show, and thus they created plantlings - cute lil\u2019 creatures that are  not a pain to harvest (THERE, WE SAID THE THEME). Your job is to get  rich, to hopefully not have to live your life of a vegetable anymore!\r\n</p>\n<p>And although the Necromancer can revive stuff, their power cannot revive its  creators\u2019 sanity after working non-stop for 3 days\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>hahaha<br/></em></strong></p>\n<p>Anywho, this game was made for Ludum Dare 52 by Snailcat Studio made out of four people, although the game development was handled by me (Izzy the Owl also known as TRUEchips), and 99% of the graphics were handled by Sushi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>The Wizard Guy<br/></strong></em></p>\n\n<p>They are a grumpy necromancer in debt, desperate to pay it off. \u00a0Just when they are about to pay it off, a disaster strikes! Their name isn't Jeremy, but that's how everyone calls them for some reason</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Sketchy Jeff</em></strong><br/><br/></p>\n<p>He is a civil Servant, devoted to his job of making the life of every unemployed person on Earth as miserable as it is humanly possible. He also is a very corrupt official, and is known to have taken bribes. His friends call him \"The Hopeless Jester\".<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>- Izzy The Owl/TRUEchips (Me) - </strong>She handled all the code for the game, and assembled the game in 72 hours. It was her idea to do this the second time after the \"ARG: The Journey for Sushitos\" game. <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>- Sushi - </strong>He made all the graphics you see in the game. If not for him, this wouldn't have been possible! Thanks so much, even thou I completely destroyed your sanity (sorry)</p>\n\n<p><strong>- Enno - </strong>She made all the concept art for the game, and her sketches saved sushi's ass. Thank you girl!</p>\n\n<p>-<strong> Hanna -\u00a0</strong>Although she only made one graphic, (the shopkeeper) - it still wouldn't have been possible without her. Thanks!</p>\n\n<p><strong>- SumRndmDde, Yanfly and other people from the RPG MAKER MV community - </strong>They made all the amazing plugins I used to make this game not suck. Thanks guys!</p>\n\n<p><strong>-</strong><strong> Kevin MacLeod - </strong>Music I used. Thanks bro.</p>\n\n\n<p>1.1 Update:</p>\n<p>- It fixed some bugs, they weren't game breaking, but they sure were annoying.</p>\n<p>- It tweaked some cutscenes very subtly (via sushi's request)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T14:52:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/258/2583c884cb2a75cd3ac28c58f04e153c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["TRUEchips"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
