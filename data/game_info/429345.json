Twist and Turn a device in the game to manipulate the player aswell as the game world to conquer three unique and challenging levels while collecting all 36 Red Orbs or going for a record time!\r\n<p>During your journey you will find <strong>four unique buttons</strong>, which you can <strong>attach </strong>to the device in any way you like. Every button has a <strong>special purpose</strong> in every level, while still being usable in a plethora of different ways.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even after collecting all red orbs, you can try to unlock every single one of the <strong>11 unique achievements</strong>, or even try<strong> speedrunning</strong> it, with the game keeping track of your personal best time and a<strong> speedrun mode</strong>, which adds a timer and an easy way to restart a level or the whole game with the press of a button.\u00a0With some planning you can see yourself skipping parts of levels and <strong>pulling off insane tricks</strong>, to get that last button in no time!<br/></p>\n<p>This game is completely playable with nothing but a <strong>mouse</strong>. Everything colored <strong>orange is something you can interact with</strong> by pressing the <strong>left mouse button and dragging, pressing or pulling it.</strong> <strong>You can even use the right mouse button to cancel a jump or detach a button, aswell as the middle mouse button as a shortcut for the first attachment.</strong> The only time you'll be using the keyboard is if you want to get really serious with your times, and use the speedrun mode.</p>\n<p>This game automatically runs a <strong>benchmark </strong>before the game begins to roughly determine your performance, and adjusts the graphics settings accordingly. You can also tweak these options in the<strong> settings menu </strong>manually.<br/></p>\n<p>If you enjoyed the<strong> soundtrack</strong>, you can listen to and download it for free at the highest quality possible over at my <strong>Soundcloud</strong>:</p>\n<p>https://soundcloud.com/prox276/sets/the-right-turn-soundtrack<br/></p>\n<p>The <strong>HTML5 Version</strong> of The Right Turn <strong>might take a long time to load </strong>if you decide to play it on<strong> itch.io</strong>. Newgrounds and Gamejolt seem to handle WebGL better, which is why you should try playing those versions, if this one doesn't load for you.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made in a timespan of <strong>2 months</strong> in <strong>Construct 2.</strong></p>\r\nAny Feedback, encouragement and criticism would be greatly appreciated!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T09:19:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b8/7b8a00e8827c782c10c3aedc68f48445.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Prox"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
