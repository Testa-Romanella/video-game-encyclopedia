Wisps wandering into scene may look harmless, but do not be fooled! A single brush with the corporeal Keeper and  they will explode with ectoplasmic energy enough to leave him in a SPOOKED OUT STATE! <em>Jittery!</em> Unable to tell up from down for one long macabre moment!<br/>\n</p>\n<p>Shocks of another sort arrive as <em>lightning bolts</em>, late into the rain-soaked night! Taking a jolt head-on will<em> bolt </em>the Keeper in place as he spasms all God's anger out of his system! If you see storm in skies above where you stand... <em>BOLT</em>!</p>\n<p><strong>R E M E M B E R !</strong><br/></p>\n<p>While dodging ghosts and ghastly lightning, don't let those dancing deadies out of sight! <br/><br/><strong>THREE'S A CROWD</strong>, so <em>bust those woke bones</em> -- lest you wish to watch your next sunrise from half underground!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahem. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Now then, to install the game:</p>\n<p>Kindly download the .exe file included below, then run the program to install <em>Dead Danse Denial!</em> to the location of your choice on your computer.</p>\n<p>Currently, this game is only available on Windows (ideally Windows 10) operating systems. A Linux port may be coming in future, and a MacOS version is but a wistful daydream (though still distantly possible).</p>\n<p>A README text file can be downloaded alongside the installer for quick access to general info and fun gameplay tips. The README is also installed to the same directory as the game, but I thought I'd also offer it here so you wouldn't need to dig for it.<br/>---</p><p>HOW TO PLAY:</p><p>Move the character using the Arrow Keys or WASD letter keys on KEYBOARD.<br/>Use the Digital Pad (up down left right) to move with a GAMEPAD.</p><p>To pause, press either P/Pause/Esc on keyboard. On gamepad, just press your usual designated pause button. You know which one.<br/><br/></p><p>Other notes on the game:</p>\n<p>CONTROLLER RECOMMENDED! (Should work with Xinput controllers [Xbox 360, One, and DS4 controllers if using DS4Windows)</p>\n<p>Game starts in windowed mode to prevent some goofy visual glitching I was seeing. Press Ctrl+Enter to enter/exit fullscreen any time you'd like (NOTE: doing this immediately at game start will skip splash screen/start screen, so maybe don't do it the first time if you want to see that stuff).<br/></p>\n<p>---<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Finally, in saying all this, I'll say a little more:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This is the first video game I've ever made, for better or worse. <br/><br/>I apologize for any bugs and glitches you may encounter, hoping they serve only to amuse and don't completely annihilate any joy this game may otherwise bring you.</p>\n<p>If you have any issues with the game, please contact me at cartaforehorse[at]gmail.com and I'll try to fix what's busted.<br/></p>\n<p>If you DON'T have any problems, but actually enjoyed the game or maybe even felt it improved your life in some way, please let me know that too! Leave a comment, write an email, I'd love to hear from you!<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T07:54:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d3/4d32b3c79d092044088f3b4f25f5b573.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cart Afore Horse Contrivances"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
