You start off by placing commands on the simulation board, and then seeing how the ships behave.<br/><br/><br/>Once the simulation starts, you cannot change the commands, so you have to figure out how the ships behave with commands and with each other.<h3>Navigate Pirate Hazards</h3>The simulations are full of ocean currents, icebergs and many more hazards. Learn how they interact, and how to use them to your advantage.<br/><br/><br/>Interactions between the simplest systems can hide the deepest mechanics.<h3>100+ Puzzles to Complete</h3>There is no time pressure to complete the puzzles, so you can explore each puzzle and see how all the different elements interact with each other. The simplest levels are on the beaten path. while the optional levels delve deeper into the complexities of the simulations.<h3>Follow the story of a Pirate Startup</h3>Over the course of the game you follow the story of Swami, Mani and Rajan. They are developing their simulation technology and trying to take over the Pirate Industry. See if they have what it takes to succeed.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T03:35:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d60/d6001732663e0a2a41359f4abf089fd9.jpg", "website": "https://www.konkancoastpiratesolutions.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["chapliboy"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["chapliboy"], "esrb_rating": null}
