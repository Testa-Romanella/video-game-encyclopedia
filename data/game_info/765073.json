From the Roman conquest to the William the Conqueror\u2019s Norman invasion, explore the destiny of many nations, and fight to become King.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Two famous game designers join forces to bring a new digital boardgame play experience.<br/>Lewis Pulsipher\u2019s masterpiece comes to life in 2022 in its digital version, thanks to Philippe Thibaut (Europa Universalis, Ageod, Avalon Digital games, SGS series). <br/><br/>The original boardgame inspired many of us for years and gave players countless challenges and hours of fun. The digital version retains the chrome and fun and leaves the cumbersome part to the computer. <br/> Take the role of the rebellious Queen Boudicae, the fabled King Arthur, Danish King Knut or William the Conqueror and put your mark on Britain\u2019s early history.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Britannia is a historical board game that broadly depicts the millennia-long struggle for control of England, Scotland, and Wales. The game begins with the Roman invasion of 43 A.D., continues through the many struggles between Angles, Saxons, Picts, Norsemen, Scots, Irish, and other tribes, and ends with the Norman invasion of 1066.<br/><br/>Britannia allows players to re-create this epic history, re-enacting important battles in some cases, altering the course of history in others. The game rules discourage players from making historically unrealistic moves, but also give players the freedom to alter Great Britain\u2019s history in important ways, creating countless interesting \u201cwhat if?\u201d scenarios. What if Boudicca\u2019s Revolt against the Romans had been more successful? What if the Romans and the Romano-British had repelled the Saxon invasions of the 5th and 6th centuries? What if William the Conqueror had died during the Norman invasion of 1066?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Britannia Digital faithfully recreates the simple, fast and very interactive rules of the original boardgame. All fastidious elements of the physical version, such as population growth or rolling numerous dice in battles is simply and elegantly taken over by the engine, making the game experience faster and allowing players to concentrate on strategies rather than mechanics. <br/><br/>The fast and simple rules of the latest Boardgame Edition (from 2019) are implemented, allowing for a quick entry into the game for those familiar to the physical version, and making the learning curve rather easy for the others.<br/>The computer version offers 2 more scenarios, the option to play on a classical medieval-themed look or a more modern 3D-like environment, as well as a choice between traditional counters pieces on the map, familiar to most boardgamers, or 3D characters for each of the warriors of every nation in the game . A set of variant rules has been included for those who want a different experience. <br/><br/><strong>Number of Players</strong> : 1 to 4. Multiplayer possible.<br/><strong>Number of Scenarios</strong> : 3, including the grand campaign. An extra variant scenario with Ireland included may come later as a DLC.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T06:28:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d4/5d40a916df9340f74d67d5429a7fc019.jpg", "website": "https://invasionsgames.com/britannia/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 325, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Avalon Digital"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Plug In Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
