The\u00a0'Souped Up\u00a0Edition' had a lot more effort put into it, but was still made to be a quick little project - so you'll undoubtedly see a lot of cut corners.<br/></p>\n<p>This is also meant to be a preview of <strong>Soup: The Game - PHASE TWO</strong>, which will be coming...at some point! It's going to be a bigger game, but will follow the same basic concepts you see here. Planned features:</p>\n<ul><li>Three episodes of platforming fun</li><li>Additional abilities for Benny</li><li>A few more enemies</li><li>Soup-related edutainment</li><li>The ability to save!</li></ul>\n<p>Until then, enjoy this remastered edition of The Greatest Game Ever Made\u2122.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Sprite assets from Kenney (mostly)<br/></p>\n<p>Sounds from Freesound / bfxr</p>\n<p>Music from The Games Factory</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> I'm not 100% sure that the Debian version works properly. Please give it a try first and report back if you can - I would like to get it working if possible!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T03:40:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/340/340ebde1d6197575902e59487d4f40c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["LunarLoony Interactive"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
