BLAZE YOUR OWN TRAIL.<br/><br/><br/>***************************************************************<br/>***************************************************************<br/><br/>What is procedural generation ?<br/><br/><br/>Core to Stellar Horizon is that its virtual galaxy, including the stars and planets, are all created through random procedural generation<br/>using deterministic algorithms. A single seed number is used to create these features via mathematical computation thus eliminating<br/>the need to create each of these features by hand.<br/>This enables the game to have a massively open nature: it is estimated that with the 32-bit seed number, Stellar Horizon virtual<br/>galaxy will include over 4 billion planets. Any player will be able to visit a specific planet once they know its galactic<br/>coordinates, given their spacecraft has the capability to do so, and find the same features as any other player,<br/>as these coordinates serve as the seed for the planet's topography and environment.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:27:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e01/e01e5b7cf4373aa4218233a130aa72d0_OK7ZqSW.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 217, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["S.MARSAULT"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Sylvain MARSAULT"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
