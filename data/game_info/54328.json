The game is similar to a computer game version of Risk. Each nation has its own strengths and weaknesses and the player is given a limited number of terms to develop their nation's society, technology, and military power.</p>\n<p>You have the option to play the game in different historical points in history, i.e. during the Cold War or in the future. The object of the game is to defeat the computer without starting world war three. The game failed to generate much commercial success due to its limited graphics, and difficulty the player often had in developing a military presence that could compete with the computer.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1993-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:35:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89a/89a39ace5eddf9d869df732c3037ad1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["SEGA CD"], "developers": ["Micronet", "Micronet co"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Micronet co", "Micronet"], "esrb_rating": null}
