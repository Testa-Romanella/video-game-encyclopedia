In this demo, you control a helicopter and do different missions in enemy base. To complete the level, you must complete all the missions then return back to your base. The level has limited ammo and fuel, therefore, you should manage your resources and focus on doing the missions.<br/>\r\nThis game is inspired by the series of Desert Strike, Jungle Strike and Urban Strike from Sega Genesis.</p>\r\nController\r\n\r\nUPmove forward\r\nDOWNmove backward\r\nRIGHTturn right\r\nLEFTturn left\r\nPpick up item\r\nOdrop item\r\nENTERconsume item\r\nTABselect target\r\nQfire missile\r\nWfire rocket\r\nEfire gun\r\nCchange camera view\r\nESCopen ingame menu", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T07:25:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b32/b32c4c73fc992731c2768495da4ce532.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HaiderLawend"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
