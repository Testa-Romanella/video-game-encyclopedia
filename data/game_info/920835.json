Our planet\u2019s\u00a0catnip supply is rapidly dwindling, and despite the lab\u2019s attempts to\u00a0find a solution through DNA research, they have been\u00a0unsuccessful. We are quickly running out of catnip and without it,\u00a0our feline population will be in peril. That\u2019s why I believe you are our\u00a0only chance. You must go back to your roots and find a source of\u00a0rooted catnip.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve marked your map with the location of the nearest earth. Best of\u00a0luck to you, as you\u2019ll surely need it.</p>\n<p>(Known bug: game controller is not working at the moment)</p>\n\n<p>This game is part of Global Game Jam 2023.
