Every 'cycle', you choose 7 events which will be completed in order. Each event will have various impacts on your 5 main stats; Hunger Social Energy Money Happiness If any of these reaches 0 (Or in Hunger's case, 100), you lose the game! Think carefully about which events you choose as you won't know their impact until the events are completed - and try and remember their impacts for the next cycle.
