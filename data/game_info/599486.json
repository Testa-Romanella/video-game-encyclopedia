Based on a proposed taxonomy of VR inventory systems we've created 4 different inventories, which you will be using during the experiment. You'll be put through 4 different tests for each inventory which cover actions one might perform in various games. We'll be capturing anonymous data on your performance which will be used to compare the performance of the inventory systems against each other. <br/></p>\n<p>Throughout the experiment you will be asked to provide subjective feedback on your experience in the form of a questionnaire.</p>\n<p>In order to participate in the experiment you will need to have SteamVR and compatible hardware. We hope that if you are able to participate that you will do it.</p>\n<p>Thank you very much!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T06:43:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/573/573c1c401adc6e747b277a5d3f2b09c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MagnusRubin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
