Playing our game you will be able to fully immerse yourself in the atmosphere of London, learn the history and interesting facts about the most important sights of the city. Our game is implemented entirely in English, so you can feel yourself in an English-speaking environment by communicating with the main characters, who are native speakers. So you don't even need to buy a plane ticket and fly somewhere, just click the download button and welcome to London!<br/></p><p>\u00a0The game is based on the story: you come to London and your friend Michael offers some help providing himself as a tour guide. You and your friends are going to visit a great number of places, answer different questions and travel with the help of GoogleMaps. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T08:25:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3c/d3ce4f34c4893d0c89b3c8e204ddefb8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["v_volkotrub02"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
