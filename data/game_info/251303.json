These tokens, which are large\u00a0red coins you encounter, they\u00a0can be\u00a0used to buy different colors for your ball. You can get a new high score\u00a0 (mine is 199, I played it for a while)\u00a0or maybe the most expensive color, red.\u00a0 The way the score is scored is the amount of time you stay alive. I hope you enjoy, this is my first game EVER and it was really fun to make and I hope to bring more games in the future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a59/a59238e376a18a961288fe00b2266e63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SHAWTY"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
