But there are a few problems \u2013 the drill needs gems to keep operating, and you\u2019ll need to give up some of your precious minerals to make sure it keeps going and gets upgraded. You\u2019ll need to\u00a0complete tasks together, make quick choices\u00a0in a small space and\u00a0manage resources carefully, to make sure you get down safe and alive.</p>\n<p>Be wary, though - the word is that the boss is looking to fire the miners who have the least number of gems at the end.\u00a0<em>Budget cuts</em>, he says. So be careful not to spend all your gems upgrading the drill - you might save your life, but not your job!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T23:42:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65c/65c11d03167d581540a06f8391cbcfb2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tuomasp", "Amber Perard", "samCorluy", "DuhanBas", "Lyawx"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
