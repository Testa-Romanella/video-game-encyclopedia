I just started re-making an old game I did a few years back, but this time with better graphics and resolution. </p><p>This game has RPG elements combined with top-down shooter parts. It has been inspired by classics such as Super Metroid, Zelda, and Deus Ex. </p><p>Development right now is still really early, and so I came up with a playable demo of a small sample of what is to come. </p><p>You play as an agent named Andrew who was sent out to a research facility to investigate a shady operation, and you have to return to headquarters with whatever data I find. The part of the game I released to you guys to play is a boss fight with basic mechanics. Many features are not yet available, but right now I'm looking for feedback to see what I can improve in the game. </p><p>I will regularly update this page with more screenshots as I come up with more art work.  My direction of art is an attempt to combine 16-bit elements with the more realistic PC game graphics with sprite animations.  </p>Let me know your opinions on everything: the animations, art direction, mechanics, design, etc. or suggest to me what I can improve.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74d/74d36b92374c9f6cf3ad0f7a0e3d0f5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DreyDay"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
