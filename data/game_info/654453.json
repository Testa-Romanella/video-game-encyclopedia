Computer space starts to fill\u00a0with different kinds of viruses - such as DOC-DOXXER, SmileStealer, and... Unreal Engine 6.</p>\n<p>You are constantly losing space whenever any virus is active, so make sure to find the danger fast, by looking through the folders and removing them from your computer.</p>\n<p>Each kind of virus has different mechanics, so the cursor has to adapt to what's going on.</p>\n<p>Playable with a controller and a keyboard!</p>\n<p>_____________________________</p>\n<p>Almost all of the assets that appear in-game and trailer were created solely by me and done during the time of jam (started on Sunday).
