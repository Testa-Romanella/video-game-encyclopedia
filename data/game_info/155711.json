It is a sci-fi story presented mostly though dialogue only.</p>\n<p>Illustrations are in progress.<br/></p>\n<p>Cast:<br/>You: Commander of the UEA Terrapin.<br/>Helmsman: Minor character. (yes I said it.)<br/>Nav: Female, Information relay and ship liason.<br/>Parmwell: Male, Cyborg, Biomech-interface and data hub for boarding party<br/>Sejic: Female, Engineer and medical officer. <br/>Burns: Male, Pathmaker.<br/>Harmon: Male, Guardian.</p>\n<p>This was made for a 40hr Make-a- thing challenge based on the words \"Blip\", \"Kind\" and \"Thwart.\" My original story plan involved the team of this story being lead into a derelict ship where they discover a group of aliens that try to kill them all (of course). I would have liked to incorporate audio and visuals but didn't get around to it as the story became much longer than I anticipated. In fact, I didn't even get to the story I planned, which is going to be part 2.<br/></p>\n\n<p>\"Blip\" was to be the sound of the life signature markers.<br/>\"Kind\" was to be the humans (an endangered species at the beginning of the story) vs the enemy alien monsters (Basically human sized sharktopuses). \"Of their kind\" etc.<br/>And \"Thwart\" was going to be the uninspired \"Humans win against the monsters\".</p>\n<p>In this new version, Part 1 acts as the set-up where the player learns the deadly ways that the derelict can be interacted with, and in part 2, they can use these dangers against the aliens on their way out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This first part prevents the characters from permanently altering the ship, but as they exit they will be able to as it won't affect them later in the story.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed1/ed19900199f48598441f3c1b50a1d483.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["VcPenguin"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
