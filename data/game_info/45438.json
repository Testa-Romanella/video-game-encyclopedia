Will you beckon the glowing call of its lone storefront and embark on a fantastical multidimensional walkabout through space and time?<br/><br/><br/><br/> Experience a beautiful environment where nothing is what it seems, a cosmic labyrinth where doors always lead to different destinations, an anomalous zone where mass gingerly defies gravity, a universe of inspiration, of dreams,  of everything and nothing: <strong>Experience 0N 0W .</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Facets:</strong><br/><ul><li>This is a <strong>peaceful </strong>adventure <strong>apt for all ages</strong>; it was exhibited in the <strong>Children's Museum of the Arts NYC</strong> to a great reception by children and adults alike.</li></ul><ul><li>Entirely non linear gameplay in an awe-inspiring open world where everything you see is accessible. There are no barriers or invisible walls to block your curiosity; walk to the very edge of the world to see what happens...</li></ul><br/><br/><br/><ul><li>A minimalist reinterpretation of modern gameplay mechanisms that eliminates loading screens, user interfaces, inventories, skill trees, stats, quick time events, puzzles, etc. This is gameplay distilled to its very essence with the sole objective to explore in wonder! </li></ul><ul><li>A randomized/procedural level progression system that provides a different journey each time you play.
