I wanted to get this alternate version finished for sunofes jam.\u00a0It is based on a script from the anthology series 'Inside No.9'.\r\n</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Original sprites, CGs, &amp; soundtrack\r\n</li><li>Fully voice acted (Rue's voice is currently missing and will be patched later when the VA has time to record)</li><li>New game+ with extended &amp; new endings\r\n</li><li>14 different endings depending on your choices\r\n</li><li>Casual choices &amp; choices with consequences\r\n</li><li>2 love interests\r\n</li><li>Endings gallery &amp; other unlockables\r\n</li></ul>\r\nWarnings/Triggers\r\n<ul><li>Mild suggestive/NSFW scenes (no nudity -\u00a0written/spoken - avoidable with choices)\r\n\r\n</li><li>Physical violence\r\n</li><li>Depictions of blood\r\n</li><li>Self-harm &amp; suicide\r\n</li></ul>\r\nThe Characters\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\nBugs &amp; Stuff\r\n<p>Feel free to head\u00a0here\u00a0if you find a bug.\r\nNeed help getting the game to open on Mac?

It's relatively spoiler-free :3\r\n</p>\r\nOther Notes\r\n<p>The soundtrack was made while wearing headphones, as I don't have any speakers x3 So if you're playing without headphones, you may need to adjust the sound somewhat to get the best experience. I do recommend playing with headphones though.\r\n</p>\n<p>I hope it is okay to submit this to sunofes. I'm not sure where it stands with the no sex rule. There is no sex or nudity in this game. And there is no suggestive artwork either. But there are a couple of written/voice scenes of a mildly sexual nature which can be avoided with choices.</p>\r\nThe Team\r\n<p>Writer/Creator/OST -\u00a0Melancholy Marionette<br/>Sprite &amp; CG Artist - Lazy Polar Bear<br/>\r\nUI Artist -\u00a0maneki-mushi\r\n<br/>Window Moon Background Artists -\u00a0sophrossynes\u00a0&amp;\u00a0LazyCrocodile\r\n<br/>\r\nAdditional Character Concepts -\u00a0Desichan</p>\r\nThe Cast\r\n<p>Rue - Hunter Zane Erquitt (coming soon)<br/>\r\nAkuji - CloudyDecember<br/>Perry - Casey Schryer<br/>\r\nFleur -\u00a0Megan \"The Fangirl\" Gotham\u00a0-\u00a0@The_Fanily\r\n<br/>Doctor 01 - Nicolle Zambrano<br/>Doctor 02 - XepherStar<br/><br/>Thank you so much to everyone who helped me bring this project to life!
