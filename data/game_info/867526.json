He is feeling his bones are getting old, health is getting worse and even he is still not in bad condition, he should to elect ,who will be his succesor. He has Two sons. One is strong, brave, clan warriors respect him but also fear him. But his personality becomes terrible, just ruthless, sadistic. His firstborn(Ivar) sacrifised his own first wife to gods because he suspected her from worshiping christianity. Also there is rumor he poisoned his father's second wife (Ivar is son of first wife). Also he act very sadistic against enemies sometimes even to own people. His second son is much less brave. Till age 13, when his mother died he was spoiled and controlled by mother. In that age 13 his brother Ivar already succesfully return from his first raid where he first time killed men. Our hero was long time without father influence because first son looks like ideal succesor and father was blind for some time about\u00a0 personality deviation of firstborn. Our hero is pagan too, but has some kind of understanding for other religions which is in best chief warriors consider as big weakness. He Was on couple raids but much later and killed few men only in self defence. His biggest passion is food and beer. He love feasts, stories about gods and mighty heroes. Also he likes music and art. Jarl likes his son for his personality but he knows nobody respect him and after chief dies, Ivar would kill his brother. Jarl knows it. So, rather let her son die by Ivar's hand, he give him opportunity become true warrior and send him in distant palace which is bastion of Oddins power of world where vikings pagan worshipers conquered distant lands. (our world is fiction no such palace existed, but truth is vikings warriors were in biggest glory of their age hired by Byzantine ruler as personal guards because they were considered as best warrior of those times. Also their viking warriors and scouts reached Constantinopole by exploring lands and seas) Jarl hopes if his son died in this palace in brave battle at least he claim chair in Oddins hall in valhalla. Or he return as succesfull graduate and Jarl announce his as next Jarl. He will be enough skilled to defeat Ivar after he try to reclaim his firstborne right for ruling. Also he will gain respect of mens which are fear or respect Ivar much more even he is sometimes sadistic to own people and sacrifised his own wife. He gave him 3 years for return, after it ,he will announce his follower. Jarl paid huge amount of gold to Oddins priests which in special ritual convert this gold into power which can use Oddin in his pallace for jarl's son resurrections. (pure fantasy here) This power is Oddin willing to use through his artefact of resurrection located in this palace. There is explanation about 3 kind of difficulty. 1]Jarl is very, rich, 2]not so rich. 2]+Ivar stole part of this gold to give his brother chance, so Ivar knows about this deal. His father Threat him, that if his brother (our hero)die, before he reach this palace, he will give claim his brother, ruler of another kingdoom. He send group of best soldiers and priest as witnesses to this palace. They dont need to go all that distance. In our world partly fantasy you can travel through roots, branches of yggdrassil (three of life) which is acording pagan mytology connect another worlds, locations. And one of this dimesion doors is near palace (next is inside their kingdoom). About palace is also short story. but this all for now</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T15:20:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b5/8b52b0c54a8421593f6c3dc0c3ece134.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joseph Everland"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
