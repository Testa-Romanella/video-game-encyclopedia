Its 3D jumping game where you start in a first, the most easy floor, and getting upper and upper floor until you reach the roof using cubes which you can build and jump on in. There is some arrows which shows you where you have to go. The reason why you're escaping is flood which is increasing every moment, maybe it will take a while before you get your own tactics, but do not give up!</p><p>Controlling game is pretty easy:</p><p>Move: W A S D</p><p>Aiming: Mouse</p><p>Creating cube: Left mouse button</p><p>Enjoy! And do not forget to leave comments, so i will know what you like and don't like about my game, what i should improve or your ideas to make game better! Thank you a lot. :)  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28d/28dd6bcfb66b15a9f7c800a30265082c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Heinz"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
