Things that couldn't hurt you before can now fly toward you. Thankfully, with the right jump, you can float away from danger. Be careful though - once you're off a surface, you are out of control!</p>\n<p>As a prototype, it only has a few levels, and there is plenty that I didn't manage to add or fix. But I am pretty happy with how the hair turned out!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T08:01:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e6/2e63a8cf3d12c5e2d8fbe21533eb589b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nickadance"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
