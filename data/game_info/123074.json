Your first decisions will decide how your character starts out, but as you progress on your adventure the decisions you make will change your stats and impact the chances you have of surviving.</p><p>...or that is, that's what I'd like to have fully achieved with STATS! I really like what I've done so far and this is my first ever attempt at doing anything with code, so I underestimated the challenge of learning on-the-go while limited by time. Hopefully you enjoy the concept and at least some of what's here, but don't expect to reach an ending - I didn't manage to get that far!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f9/7f94147080135a213dee029e2b16e131.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ParisJF"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
