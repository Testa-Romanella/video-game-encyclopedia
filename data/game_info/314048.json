Yes, that was our childhood. Now, the tank 1990 has been returned after our one year developed! It is a \"No Ads\" game, just for your better experience.  We respect the original game, however, we also bring some new gameplays, make it different and tiny, just like pocket tank wars. Now, let\u2019s go back to the childhood, use fingers to be a hero and join the battle!<br/><br/>The Features<br/>[New Framework] We use Cocos2d engine to redefine the Game: loading faster and experience more fluid. If you have a good operation skill, you will pass the mission more quickly, and earn more money!<br/><br/>[More Gameplays] You feel Battle City boring? Wake up! We are bringing brand-new style: turret defense, new game props (e.g. cloak, turret, radar), direction brick...... We still haven\u2019t stopped thinking and creating!<br/><br/>[Battlefield Transformed] Except for the classic maps, we have created the special maps: turret-fighting, time-limit defense, \u201cprops or enemy\u201d mode, \"endless\" mode...... Nothing is impossible! They are just waiting for you!<br/><br/>[Further Update] We will update \u201conline fighting mode\u201d when the number of users touches a certain number. Within this mode, you can challenge players around the world, no matter he or she is nearby. Let\u2019s see who is the NO.1 in the future!<br/><br/>Please pay attention to the follow-up updates (not regularly), we will bring more surprises! We lay most stress on the quality and creativity of the game, and object to copy other games\u2019 code!
