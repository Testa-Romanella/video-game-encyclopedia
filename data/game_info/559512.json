Years of research and many thousands of dollars (CAD) to bring this overall masterfully crafted game (A few little bug exceptions which can be ironed out with some funding).\u00a0\u00a0Hoping to be able to hire a programmer to fix bugs and optimize without changing the overall feel of the game.\u00a0</p>\r\nFuture\r\n<p>Wanting to create a bouncy ball game for years, slowly trying to figure out the controls. It was a heavy undertaking with very little documentation on how to actually pull it off. The overall project and moving forward as the company grows, we will be putting all resources into furthering research into the problems with UI and social engineering impact of video games. How developers will interact with their audiences, through means of my next big undertaking is to develop and create a new payment model for F2P games that can work across all platforms and genres.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T06:19:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc7/fc787796b4f103386a87fc4bd503f93d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Digital Mouse"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
