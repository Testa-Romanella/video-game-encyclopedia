With each passing shmecond of his existence, he questions his purpose in this mortal coil. The rotating oranges allow him a glimmer of hope in the darkness as he avoids the evil nutcracker god of eons long past, whose wrath was incurred by the lack of pineapple sacrifices in the year 2605. Legend has it that some guy found this game on a thumb drive at a dumpster in Florida and uploaded it to the internet, but that's just a rumor. Don't know what the green boxes are for, though.</p>\n<p>Enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-22T05:36:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ce/2ce91de333ab0e7d3d9e920fd7af6e4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["HerpDerpityPurple"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
