It's been a long and laborious journey, but you did it, YES!! You finally did it. You achieved entanglement, it's just a 2 qubits machine, but it's quite something. Later that night you notice something weird, there are some weird intermissions going on and if you don't do something. They're going to overheat your dilution refrigerator chambers and your qubits will decohere.</em>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>In each level you're trying to reach the exit.
