This game is being developed for the 2020 PSP Halloween Game Jam.</p>\n<p>I was not able to complete nearly as much as I wanted to within the 1 week period of the game jam so this game is extremely unfinished; however, I plan on continuing work on the game after the jam. Although I didn't get very far with my game, I still learned a lot and am glad that I participated in the game jam! Hopefully you guys can get a feel for the direction I'm headed with this game based on the little I've done so far.<br/></p>\n<p>The basic idea of the game is you are cursed by Death to be a skeleton and your bones are scattered throughout the map. \u00a0As you find different body parts, you gain abilities that help you progress further in the game until finally you fight Death as the final boss.<br/></p>\n<p>Here are the current features (very limited) and planned features for the future:</p>\n<p>Current Features:</p>\n<ul><li>Basic intro cutscenes to set up the story</li><li>Character can roll left and right and jump</li><li>5 Rooms</li><li>Damage system where if you take 4 hits, it's game over</li><li>Pumpkin enemies that jump around the room in a set pattern (hitting one causes damage)</li><li>Legs and torso collectible which allows you to jump higher to reach rooms you couldn't reach as just a skull</li></ul>\n<p>Planned Features:</p>\n<ul><li>Many more rooms</li><li>Multiple mini-bosses which you must beat to get your legs/arms back</li><li>Death final boss which will require all body parts to win</li><li>More enemy types</li><li>Arms collectible which allows you to use them as weapons</li><li>Throwing your arms hurts enemies and your arms will fall to the ground after hitting their target.
