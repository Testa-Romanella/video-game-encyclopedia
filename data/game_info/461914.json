With all these cute birds outside?</p>\r\nBACKYARD BIRDWATCHING\r\n<p>A simple little game inspired by me forever getting distracted by birds outside my window when working from home during lockdown. Made for\u00a0Neighbourhood Jam 2020, using Phaser 3!</p>\r\nHow To Play\r\n<p>This is a game you leave running in a background tab whilst you go about other things, whether that's work, social media,\u00a0 or playing other games.</p>\n<p>Every now and then, a new bird will fly into the garden (accompanied with birdsong to let you know!) and you can take a photo of it.</p>\n<p>There are 8 bird species in total, and 3 fun little facts for each of them.</p>\n<p>There's no winning or losing, I just wanted to create a little taste of nature you could leave in the background for as long as you like.</p>\n<p><strong>Changing the Wait Time</strong></p>\n<p>You can adjust how long the wait time between new birds arriving is by clicking the little cog in the corner.</p>\n<ul><li>Instant: a couple seconds</li><li>Short: up to 2 min</li><li>Medium: 5 to 10 min</li><li>Long: 10 to 20 min</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Keeping the Game Running</strong></p>\n<p>Browsers can be a little weird with pausing HTML games. Testing on Chrome, I found that as long as I didn't change tab from the game (opening separate windows is fine), the game still runs!</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Programming, design and background art\u00a0by me.</p>\n<p>Bird pixel assets were adapted from the awesome cute little set at:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-birds\u00a0(all but the sparrow were adapted by me)</p>\n<p>Birdsong recordings were from this amazing resource:\u00a0https://www.xeno-canto.org/. All the songs you hear are recordings of that particular species! The recordings I used were:\u00a0571251, 514130, 548289, 571303, 516370, 561097,\u00a0548473, 560862. (I did a little trimming and noise removal here and there)</p>\n<p>Camera shutter noise is from:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/camera</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-06T02:39:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7de/7de848a10ab9f54a702f0773b92ecdcb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["quackoquack"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
