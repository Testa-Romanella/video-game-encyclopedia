I started working on this game in February of 2020 with no programming experience\u00a0and learned/worked solidly for about 8 months before the project\u00a0went on pause (life stuff; getting reno-evicted mid-pandemic, re-locating, new job, etc. etc.). I'm currently working on making a more streamlined (and faster!) version of the game so hopefully I\u00a0can get a more fleshed-out update out\u00a0 soon.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T04:50:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/992/992e4bad3836ac093229e52ea3bf6e36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["weatherwatcher7"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
