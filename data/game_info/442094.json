The results showed a statistically significant improvement in moral judgement for the participants that played the game.</p><p>Game and research by Andr\u00e1s Baliga</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T03:42:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69b/69b441883d4886d76a4c0970072f599e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zeedar"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
