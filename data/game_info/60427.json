{"id": 60427, "slug": "vagrus-the-riven-realms", "name": "Vagrus - The Riven Realms", "name_original": "Vagrus - The Riven Realms", "description": "A vast continent is yours to explore, filled with unique locations, strange factions, lurking dangers, and a lot of characters you can interact with. In order to punish the Empire for their sins a thousand years ago, the Elder Gods manifested themselves in the world, letting loose powers that ended up devastating it. Following this Calamity, the Empire was slow to rebuild and became a dark caricature of its former image. The continent is now a wasteland, riddled with arcane anomalies, twisted monsters, and undead.<br />\nA large selection of longer and shorter stories make up the game\u2019s narrative in the form of events and quests. The choices you make in these often affect the companions and the world around you. Pick your background from trader, mercenary, or explorer; work for factions, follow rumors and trading opportunities; acquire wealth, gain fame, and discover hidden knowledge. The world is sandbox, yet it is filled with hand-crafted content.<br />\nEngage in turn-based, tactical combat that involves your companions and a large variety of enemies, both humanoid and monstrous. Use a wide range of character skills to succeed, as well as your own leadership-related abilities. Positioning and support skills are of paramount importance when your companions struggle against powerful foes.<br />\nMost journeys have to be planned and prepared for carefully, lest they end in disaster. Manage your supplies, morale, and the freshness of your people effectively to survive. Haul cargo and valuables across the wasteland or take it from others. Your crew of workers, fighters, scouts, and slaves have to be managed to optimize their effectiveness. Equip your caravan with upgrades and your companions with magical gear.<br />\nThe player can recruit a wide variety of companions into the caravan to serve in versatile roles, such as scoutmaster, guard captain, quartermaster, or navigator. Each of them comes with their own combat skills, background stories, and personal quest lines that, when completed, can upgrade them in unforeseen ways. They can progress through experience levels to become more potent crew members as well as in combat.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-04T10:16:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d06/d06bb633616258dbc9e76ccd25b3ab2c.jpg", "website": "https://vagrus.com", "rating": 4.38, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 35, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 17, "dropped": 2, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 86, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 490, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Lost Pilgrims Studio"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Lost Pilgrims Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
