It has a basic search engine, two camera mods(free flight and orbit) and control over the time scale. it models movement using the\u00a0six Keplerian elements. it also models moons, planetary surfaces and axial rotation.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Personal note:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This is my third solar system simulation, hopefully it shows.\u00a0this is by far my most complex project, been working on it for about a month and a half. I am hoping to use this as a base for a more complex project.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>TAB- open and close menu.</li><li>E,Q- Forward and backwards.</li><li>W,S- Up and down.</li><li>A,D- Left and right.</li><li>P,;- Shortcut for time scaling.</li><li>O,L- Shortcut for flight speed.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T07:53:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d79/d79368eca9706324c743d0354d9a47f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Acoolusername1669"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
