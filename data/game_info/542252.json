I'm pretty happy with how it turned out, although it was a little rushed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I decided to do something simple and try to \"remake\" (I put remake in quotes because it ended up being much more different than the original than I had intended) a game I made a while back with a friend, Bad Egg.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Pro Tip: Pressing Shift allows you to go to the next spell in your arsenal without wasting your current spell. Your current spell will go to the end.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T06:33:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82a/82a6800e492635a196cdd7ebcebcb2b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["FartFish"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
