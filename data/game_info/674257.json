Forget about jumping, dodging, climbing and so on. This is an RPG, not an action game. If your hero needs to do something, there will be a skill linked to the task ahead.<br/><br/><br/><br/>No classes, no blocks. Be limited only by the time you want to put in the game. Your character will evolve based on the skill you use.<br/><br/><br/>There are no fixed blueprints for crafting objects, buildings and vehicles. The game uses a system called <strong>skill-distribution</strong> that will take properties of material and convert them to items with skills. <br/><br/><br/>Forests and mountains have skills. Rivers and cities have skills. Plants and trees and rocks and even the weather has skills too. An intricate system makes the world feel alive.<br/><br/><br/>You will need buildings to craft, store material and host guests. Like the rest of the game, a skill-based challenge dictates the strength of your buildings.<br/><br/><br/>You come from a world trapped in a magical Mist. You were trained as a Mistwalker, whose job is to explore Mist around your home city of Valsonge. At the beginning of your adventure something wrong happened, you got out of the Mist and discovered the \u201creal\u201d world. This was not supposed to happen. Now what? You\u2019ll have to play to know more.<br/><br/><br/>Combat offers a turn-based and multiplayer combat system. As a Mistwalker, you can bring two companions from the real world that you will recruit in your adventures. If you need more help for a fight, you can have up to four other Mistwalker join you in your fight for multiplayer cooperation.<br/><br/>The game offers five combat specializations that can be mixed in thousands of ways to create your unique fighting style. Adapt your combat strategy based on your opponents and cooperate with other players to dominate some of the fiercest creatures of the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-18T15:41:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c78/c784ff65cac113f099ce01fb8f3f76d9.jpg", "website": "https://www.mistlegacy.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 64, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 105, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 559, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Virtys"], "genres": ["RPG", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["Virtys"], "esrb_rating": null}
