And now you can <strong><em>pick a side</em></strong> to expand\u00a0except down because that breaks everything. Though at least you have science bro to guide you through the tests.</p>\n<p>And if you manage to do something that feels cheaty but you don't die from it, I\u00a0call that a tech not a glitch and I\u00a0have noticed several places you can apply knowledge to break the level, they are no longer bugs, they are features. However the game is completeably playing normally.</p>\n<p>And I\u00a0appologise for the music just being synths...
