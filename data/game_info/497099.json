My first EVER video game.</p>\n<p>I've put a lot of time into this project this week and I'm happy and proud to say that it's ALIVE!</p>\n<p>The game is a simple collection game, you collect essence on a timed level to power your jetpack. Then you take to the skies and collect as many Sky shards as you can before your fuel runs out and you head back to the shop for some tasty upgrades....and possibly a secret!</p>\n<p>Please enjoy, it may not be much but it is filled to the brim\u00a0with essence from my own passion.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T04:35:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70e/70e077aa7ab7d9682a7f158296bf16d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Slowbison"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
