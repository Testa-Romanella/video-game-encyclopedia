{"id": 9977, "slug": "gear-up", "name": "Gear Up", "name_original": "Gear Up", "description": "<p>Gear Up is an MMO-oriented vehicular combat game. The player creates a battle robot and challenges other players&#39; robots to a fight in an arena. The game features arcade action and simple WASD controls as well as many customization options.</p>\n<h3>Modes</h3>\n<p>The game includes three multiplayer modes. The first two offer traditional deathmatches and team deathmatches for teams of up to eight players, typical for most online shooters. There&#39;s also a Conquest mode, which is an updated version of Capture the flag. In this mode, the teams compete over control of a radio antenna. There&#39;s also a single player mode in which the player can compete against the AI-controlled bots. This mode, however, is only meant as a practice, as the bots are very weak and predictable.</p>\n<h3>Customization</h3>\n<p>Customizing your robot is the main focus of Gear Up. Before entering a battle, the player decides what weapons and movement gear the robot will use. The player can equip his or her robot with legs or wheels, melee or ranged weapons, as well as skills like invisibility or wall climbing. The game offers a roster of 116 parts, however, because of the game&#39;s free-to-play model, some of them can only be unlocked by purchasing. </p>\n<p>The improvements are not perfectly balanced, and there are the obviously superior combinations that most players prefer. For example, robots with melee weapons, such as a chainsaw, usually have little chances against their enemies equipped with firearms.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-10T19:38:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/868/868a358e1c734f91cc836a37c92f61d6.jpg", "website": "http://play-gearup.com", "rating": 2.38, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 41, "owned": 1251, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 49, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 27, "ratings_count": 104, "suggestions_count": 380, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 104, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Doctor Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Doctor Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
