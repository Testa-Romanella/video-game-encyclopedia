You play as Ayvee, a girl looking for her real self and struggling between the desire of starting a new life, and the fear of abandoning what she has now and, Tera.The visual art walks the player while reading the story and it is an exploration of textures and \"optical/cinetic\" effects for creating immersive and meaningful experiences. To explore the feeling of cognitive dissonance - an emotional situation in which you are overwhelmed with multiple contrasting thoughts that prevent you from taking a choice - every time you will be asked to take choices, four similar options will appear dynamically one after each other, as different dissonant thoughts come to our mind in confused ways.</p><p>(A.Way first prototype was made during the <em>Narrative Games and Interactive storytelling 2015 Summer school</em> by We Are Muesli in Milan at Civica Scuola di Cinema. Thanks to Irene Camporeale and Anita Verona for the collaboration to the design of the first prototype.)</p><p>Selected for the ICIDS 2016 Exhibition http://icids2016.ict.usc.edu/exhibition/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63b/63b2591fb7b74b5839e2f91ed79f8166.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["annamariandrea"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
