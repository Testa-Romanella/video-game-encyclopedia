Navigate this labyrinth, guiding the sun while walls collapse around you. Try to collect stars and keep your next path in view - once you can't see it, it's gone! You'll have tools to help, including bombs, lassos and teleporters. Can you decypher the Stellar Labyrinth?<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tMove with the arrow keys or WASD. <br/>\r\n\tAim a powerup tool with the mouse, and use it with left click.<br/>\r\n\tPress space to increase screen zoom speed.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!
