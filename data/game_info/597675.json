The APK file can be downloaded to an android phone and installed using a file explorer.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T04:56:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d6/2d6e833db26f7d81bbf76fb42719319e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["OrangeScientist1"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
