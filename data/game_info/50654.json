Our teams (me and myself) worked hard to offer Xploquest on Windows, Mac and Linux.<br/><br/>But what is Xploquest?<br/><br/>Xploquest has all the features of indie game:<br/><br/><ul><li>It\u2019s ugly but with a lot of charm<br/></li><li>It\u2019s cheap<br/></li><li>It\u2019s played like an old game but with a current interface<br/></li><li>It\u2019s done with love</li></ul><br/>What else?<br/><br/>Xploquest is a retro RPG inspired by the greatest:<br/><ul><li>Ultima<br/></li><li>Might &amp; Magic<br/></li><li>Legend of Zelda<br/></li><li>Dragon's eye</li></ul><br/>The moves are tile-based and fighting is turn based. You explore the world freely and discover new places, dungeons and caves.<br/><br/>Okay, but what are the real assets?<br/><br/>Ok you want something concrete:<br/><br/><ul><li>It\u2019s hard, the game only saves when you're in a city. If you explore without being ready, you may die very quickly.<br/></li><li>No tiresome scenario, endless dialogs with tasteless NPCs. In Xploquest, you are alone, you do what you want, as you want.<br/></li><li>A clear quest system. When you accept a quest, it appears on the map. (xploquest 2)<br/></li><li>Perfect for both long and short game sessions.<br/></li><li>You can give up Xploquest for weeks and come back without wondering what to do. In addition, the game will not blame you for this absence.<br/></li><li>You can play other RPG at the same time.<br/></li><li>Perfect for a break.</li></ul><br/>Well, I'm intrigued and almost interested. I need an argument that kills.<br/><br/>Easy, I kept the best for last:<br/><br/>In Xploquest, as in any role-playing game, you earn gold. The difference with others is that you can spend it.<br/>Whether it's equipment, skills, food, potions or scrolls, you'll have to pay.<br/>Fights only bring in experience and gold, the chess contain gold (and maybe something else for some.<br/>No more depressed to have millions of gold coins without being able to spend them.<br/>In Xploquest, managing your gold is a very important aspect of the game.<br/><br/>I am convinced. Last question: is there a goal?<br/><br/>Yes the game ends when you have explored all the floors of the tower. For this you will have to find the 10 keys that will unlock each floor.<br/><br/>It's perfect. The final word ?<br/>It's free, guaranteed without advertising and without in-app purchase.<br/><br/>I developed the game, it's up to you now.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51f/51f8be830ebdfd9698de448b82348e60.jpg", "website": "http://www.xploquest.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 104}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 5, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Jean-S\u00e9bastien Nouveau"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["33 Production"], "esrb_rating": null}
