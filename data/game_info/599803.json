It was created on a C64 environment and then ported to the PET. For this reason, a C64 version is included but naturally the quality is... minimal compared to what you'd expect on a C64.</p>\n<p>There are versions for the Commodore PET 2001, 3032, 3032B, 4016, 4032, 4032B and Commodore 64.</p>\n<p>You use the 4 and 6 Keys to move and A to fire. P will pause and U will unpause. The object of the game is to shoot all of the candy while not running out of bullets. Birds will come down and try to gobble up your bullets.</p>\n<p>The level ends when all candy is shot, regardless of if Bonus letters or birds are left on the screen. Shoot B-O-N-U-S in order to top up bullets and receive bonus points.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T08:10:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a06/a0636afd8ebe44e49803e409030d2a51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["milasoft64"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
