This immersive experience plays with our expectation of light as a means of making things visible. Here, the opposite happens: you are the light and continuous exploration will lead you to unseen environments, new sights, sounds, things, thoughts...</em></p>\n<p><strong>This project outlines a research whose aim was to develop a design taxonomy for the creation of an immersive experience. Immersion is a state of mind that is often talked about and experienced but very elusive to design and implement. What aspects make an experience immersive? How can an understanding of these factors help designers in their process? One of the major contributing theories is the concept of immersion as flow. Flow embodies cognitive elements of involvement such as concentration on a task, completing a challenge, having control over the environment and so on. This cognitive flow is also integrated with affective components such as the loss of self consciousness and sense of 'oneness' with the environment.\u00a0 To truly achieve flow, one must concentrate on the task to the point of being absorbed so that no outside stimulant can disturb the pleasure or enjoyment of it.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Master Project at Sint Lucas Antwerp, Belgium</p>\n<p>https://www.sintlucasmasters.be/students/anna-beirinckx/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T06:43:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a88/a8815676edbe3a1759710bac3a1b00b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anna Beirinckx"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
