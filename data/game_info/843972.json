It's meant to be cute and quirky, so if you get a chuckle out of it when you realize what's going on then mission accomplished.</p>\n<p>Credit where credit is due: some sprites I made for the jam but\u00a0most sprites came from\u00a0https://o-lobster.itch.io/simple-dungeon-crawler-16x16-pixel-pack\u00a0and the king's picture from\u00a0https://kiddolink.itch.io/fantasy-npc-non-playable-characters-pack. I wrote the music a really long time before the jam and this is its premiere in a game. Some SFX\u00a0were\u00a0made during the jam and some are from freesound.org. And maybe some other things I'm forgetting but all public domain / CC0.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T16:33:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d62/d6237899e1962f11465553bdfa7f3789.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["3p0ch"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
