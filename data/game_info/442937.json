Ages ago, at\u00a0the lake's edge was a tall chapel. What must have once\u00a0been a great feature, grew degraded by constant storms and rising water levels.\u00a0\u00a0Barricaded and weathered, the chapel was\u00a0left to be\u00a0swallowed by the water's growing edge.<br/><br/>On some nights, when the lake's\u00a0tide is at its lowest, the chapel's silhouette can be made out against the moon, emerging from the lake to reclaim its place.\u00a0<br/><br/>A traveling scholar, <strong>Clement</strong>, is caught on a cold night\u00a0in the woods surrounding the lake. As the weather begins looking grim, and his lantern's fire begins to fade, Clement \u00a0sees the faint\u00a0silhouette of a chapel against the moon light. Excited\u00a0at the prospects of\u00a0shelter, company, and literature, he approaches the building as the first droplets of cold rain hit his skin.\r\nFeaturing\r\n<ul><li><strong>Dynamic lighting</strong> to hide poor pixel art</li><li><strong>Uncomfortable sounds</strong>\u00a0to make your experience really memorable</li><li><strong>8 minute play time</strong> for players on a schedule</li><li><strong>Open source code</strong> so you can see every scare coming before you even play</li></ul>\r\nReviews\r\nI don't wanna play test anymore, it's scary :[<br/><strong>- My Girlfriend</strong>\r\nOh!
