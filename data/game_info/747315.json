(Paraave)", "description": "***DISCLAIMER***\u00a0\r\n<p><strong>Try using your phone while testing the game</strong>. If possible, better to download the mobile build on your phone (apk file). Alternatively, the WebGL browser version\u00a0also works in mobile devices, but is not as fluid.</p>\n<strong>Description:</strong>\n<p>You need to swipe through 10 randomly selected news/facts and decide which of them are fake or real, every time you answer correctly you gain a point. Most of the time the statements have\u00a0a comedic approach, so playing with friends is strongly encouraged, this way you can compete against each other to get the highest score.\u00a0\u00a0Beware, because many of the news you read will make you feel like: \"Wow, did that really happened?\"\u00a0</p>\r\nConsiderations:\r\n<p>There are 2 languages available: english and spanish. Just swipe right or left according to you preferences\u00a0at\u00a0the card with the country flags. I recommend the use of a phone while playing the game, the swipe mechanic feels much natural this way. There are many questions in the game\u00a0so try a couple of rounds to check them out!<br/></p>\r\nControls during the quiz section:\r\n<p>You can either swipe right to say it's fake news or right to answer that it's real. Alternatively there are two buttons with a thumbs up/down that replicate the swipe mechanic. If playing on the computer just hold and drag the cards using left mouse button to either side of the screen.</p>\r\nComments:\r\n<p>Try writting me a useful comment, the things that you liked the most, the ones you disliked,\u00a0if the questions were appropriate... A simple comment like \"good game\" doesn't help me at all and won't make me do things better next time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T11:06:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/457/457b4d304542e65e87895599c0b9db1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Paraave"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
