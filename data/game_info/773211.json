When 256 colors seemed like a luxury and games were known more for their gameplay than their flashy graphics. Inaria is an RPG created in that style, but with modern interface conveniences that make it easier to play, giving the best of both worlds.<br/></p>\n<p>Inaria is a land divided. The above-dwelling Humans and the subterranean Slorn had long been at peace\u2026until a new Slorn King pushed his people into war with the surface. Many cities fell to the Slorn onslaught, but one held \u2013 Emerald, the last free city of Inaria.\r\n</p>\n<p>As a citizen of Emerald, you\u2019ve decided that it\u2019s time for you to join the fight. While the main forces prepare their defenses, King Gianfranco sends you on a seemingly impossible mission\u2026to destroy the Slorn King himself.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Inaria features:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Classically inspired graphics\r\n</li><li>Huge dungeons to explore\r\n</li><li>Tons of different enemies to fight\r\n</li><li>RPG mechanics that reward you no matter how you choose to create your character\r\n</li><li>A plot of intrigue and deception, where things aren\u2019t as simple as they seem\r\n</li><li>Superb retro-styled music courtesy of (and available for purchase from)\u00a0H.
