For an optimal experience, downloading the executable for Microsoft Windows is highly recommended, as the WebGL version may either not work at all (on Chrome)\u00a0or the timing of the beats/notes may be\u00a0flawed (on most other browsers).</p>\n<p>Also note that this prototype was created for a course at the University of Klagenfurt, and for that it includes\u00a02 extra levels that can possibly showcase the Cocktail Party Effect by having 2 extra songs playing at the same time. Therefore, this is not a game purely built for fun, though in the future this may be changed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T05:31:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/779/779009f2b2020c5ba17f7b7d850940d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["oeloe1"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
