This is my first game posted on itch.io, so I'm hoping at least a few people play this. The game was somewhat similar to Xonix but I wasn't sure about the rules of the Xonix game. I watched many videos about the game but didn't understand how the player passed the level. I decided to add some rules to my own version.</p>\n<p>Rules:<br/>1. Do not let the enemy touch your path.<br/>2. Do not touch your own path.<br/>3. Fill more than 200 tiles on screen<br/>4. You get a 1UP every 5th level.\u00a0<br/>5. The game ends at level 15.</p>\n<p>Resolution: 1280x720</p>\n<p>Graphics: 1-bit</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T05:34:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e1/1e1bfe46935d1b355ecae519aaf09779.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["imaginexrios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
