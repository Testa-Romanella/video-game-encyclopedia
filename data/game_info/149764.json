For this project, I decided to make my own game engine and gathered a team of four people to cover all needed areas. We called ourselves <strong>GameOrama Studios</strong>. The project started at early 2011. We chose iOS as our target platform.</p>\n<p>The game engine turned out very well, but in order to make the game portable a considerable amount of additional work would be needed. We had important time limitations so it never happened.<br/></p>\n<p>Anyway, EggOrama was released on iOS on July 6th, 2015. Initially, it was a paid game, with no ads, but given it was being difficult to sell it we decided to change the model to a free game with some ads. And that's it!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Meet GameOrama Studios</strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Valerio Sevilla</strong> (Game Design &amp; Programming)</li><li><strong>Javier Jim\u00e9nez\u00a0</strong>(Graphic &amp;\u00a0Character Design)</li><li><strong>H\u00e9ctor Pardo\u00a0</strong>(Music)</li><li><strong>Jos\u00e9 Palma </strong>(Programming)</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e96/e963aba0208574a839b2fc07ad419158.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 248, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Valerio Sevilla"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
