As gamers ourselves, we\u2019ve often desired an AC-130 Gunship simulator that authentically modeled their combat deployments and we simply got tired of waiting. Far too many times we\u2019ve only been granted a simple taste of this type of gameplay, but <strong>Project Gunship\u2019</strong>s intent is to be the go-to for historical AC-130 Gunship combat. <br/><br/><strong>It is important to acknowledge the fact that the Project is in an Alpha state, as it is in early access. This means current features are limited and improvements are occurring daily. We\u2019ve made some great progress since release but have a long way to go before we can call this project finished. Many players have already contributed solid feedback that has helped us guide development and we\u2019ll forever be grateful for their contributions and continue to seek good feedback to ensure the project achieves its potential. </strong><br/><br/>Some of the key features of the game include:<br/><ul><li><strong>Stunning Visuals</strong> \u2013 By utilizing the Unreal Engine 5, experience the realistic perspectives of the Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) thermal camera as you observe and engage hostile targets.<br/></li><li><strong>Realistic depictions of AC-130 Variants, Weapons, and Munitions</strong> \u2013  Fly in the original AC-130A \u201cProject Gunship\u201d variant utilizing the 4x GAU-2/A 7.62mm miniguns and 4x M61 Vulcan 20mm cannons or the active AC-130J \u201cGhostrider\u201d variant utilizing 1x ATK GAU-23/A 30mm Autocannon, 1x M102 105mm Howitzer, and multiple wing-mounted AGM-114 Hellfire missiles. Project Gunship allows the player to customize their experience to meet their expectations. <br/></li><li><strong>Immersive Audio</strong> \u2013 Feel the subtle roar of the (4) Rolls-Royce Turboprop engines, radio chatter from the crew, and pound of the weapons firing in support of the troops on the ground. <br/></li><li><strong>Dynamic AI</strong> \u2013 With the goal of replay-ability, AI is not scripted but allowed to make decisions in response to their given circumstance. This reactive AI allows scenarios to play differently each time and helps paint a realistic picture for the player. <br/></li><li><strong>Unique Game Modes</strong> \u2013 The goal of Project Gunship is to provide a variety of game modes that all can enjoy. The game currently features realistic scenarios and point defense style modes. </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-30T08:34:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b7/3b7a45834c5f7b55a7da4e8904b3af34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 349, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sklorite Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sklorite Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
