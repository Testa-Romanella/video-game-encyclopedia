Get box bux!<br/><br/>Controls: WASD move. E to interact. Space to jump. Hold Shift to run.<br/><br/>Hint: Try interacting with the box in weird ways by figuring out what the signs suggest.<br/><br/>NOTE: Bugs cropped up with the WebGL build with colliders. The exe build works better -- you have to press E while the dot isn't on the object to drop it. Some other minor bugs too we didn't get around to finish in time. Thought we'd have another hour for bug fixes but lost track of time.
