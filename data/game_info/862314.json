There are 36 levels available, all with ranks for time and score\u00a0A through F. Use your blast to launch yourself through levels at ludicrous speeds, run up walls and stomp down to get through each level as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>\n<p>After playing a level you\u2019ll unlock a lap race mode where score instead gives you more time on a countdown, and try to get through the level as many times as you can!</p>\n<p>Collect gems to unlock micro-levels called singles, and open every gate in order to unlock a harder version of that level.</p>\n\n<p>DEVELOPER\u2019S NOTE:</p>\n<p>Everything shown in this demo is subject to change. Feedback is greatly appreciated so this game can be as enjoyable as possible. The demo contains the first of several worlds (or tracks, as they\u2019re referred to in-game)\u00a0planned to be in the final game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T13:09:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ee/1ee028e8267505a24d00f56d3c062f8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FowenCoolman"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
