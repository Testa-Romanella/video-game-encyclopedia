Clear stages to unlock new balls.<br/><br/>ONE HUNDRED PINS<br/><br/>Knock down as many pins as you can in 5 throws at a rack of 100 pins!<br/><br/>CANDLEPIN<br/><br/>Invented in 1880, Candlepin offers a great challenge. Candlepins are thin skittles that bounce and spin unpredictably when struck. Pins aren't cleared between rounds allowing you to knock them into still upright pins.<br/><br/>FIVE PIN<br/><br/> Invented in 1904 in Canada. In 5 pin, each pin is worth different point values. Spares are strategic attempts to hit the most valuable pins. A perfect game is 450 points!<br/><br/>NINE PIN<br/><br/>Invented in medieval Germany, 9 pin is what most later bowling games are based on. Nine pins are arranged in a diamond shape with a \"kingpin\" in the middle. Knocking all the pins over earns 9 points. Knocking all the pins over but the kingpin earns 12!<br/><br/>LONG ALLEY SKITTLES<br/><br/>Knock over pins by throwing a barrel-shaped 'cheese'! To score points, you first have to knock over the kingpin. It's tricky to master when the ball bounces unpredictably!<br/><br/>DUCK PIN<br/><br/>Invented in 1904 in New England. Duck pin uses the nearly the same rules as 10 pin, but allows 3 rounds to knock over all the pins. The ball and pins are smaller making precision very important to score well!<br/><br/>IRON PIN<br/><br/>Iron pin is the same as normal the game but one random pin is much heavier than the others. Careful consideration has to be made on how to knock over the heavy pin while also clearing the normal ones.<br/><br/>SHUFFLE BOWLING<br/><br/>Challenging skittles on a shuffleboard table! Knock over the pins with a weighted puck.<br/><br/>WEST COUNTY SKITTLES<br/><br/>Traditional skittles game that has been played in British pubs for centuries.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T05:59:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87a/87ab7da70aaf144f24750a9f2853616f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Winterlight"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
