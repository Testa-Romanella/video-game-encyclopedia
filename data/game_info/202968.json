We had around 3 weeks to work on our project for the class. At the beginning of development I struggled even\u00a0<em>beginning</em>, overwhelmed by all these features that I wanted to implement in my first game.\u00a0<br/><br/>\"This would look cool? Why don't I try and add it!\"<br/>\"Oh...this wasn't what I planned but let me add this other feature!\"<br/>\"Hmm, how would this look?\"<br/><br/>These thoughts popped up throughout development and I believe that they were the result of not having a strong design document before hand. I quickly realized that I had no solid idea of the technical scope of the features I wanted to implement; to remedy this issue our instructor stated that we should focus on\u00a0<em>one</em> core mechanic. This would be our foundation and what we would build our game around. With that in mind, I started digging through documentation and programming away at \"Runner, Run!\"<br/><br/>The final project was finished on-and-off well past the deadline and while this game is nowhere near what I had envisioned when I began, I eagerly look forward to returning to it once I have polished my developer skills. <br/><br/>\"Runner, Run!\" taught me the importance of scope and having a solid design in mind before I begin a project - and I'm okay with this.\u00a0<br/><br/>(musical themes were composed by my good friend, Logan Vrankovic! feel free to contact me if you would like to get in touch with him)<br/><br/>Best,\u00a0<br/>May<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/064/064d0e98e4746eb1d881859aaf3e5907.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["maynard santos"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
