{"id": 769071, "slug": "rogue-together", "name": "Rogue Together", "name_original": "Rogue Together", "description": "<p><em>Four players fight side-by-side in this Multiplayer-Roguelike as they climb the mighty tree Yggdrasil and fight the gods to start Ragnar\u00f6k. The screen gets split into four parts and the players can explore the levels on their own, while using splitscreen overarching skills to help their allies. Since all players are spawned in different rooms, the goal is not only to kill the boss on each level, but also to find your allies. Will you be able to reach the top by working together?</em><br/></p>\n\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>\r\nGrab your friends, raise your horns and get ready for the climb of your life, as you aim to bring the end to the world and all gods. You and three companions will fight side-by-side as you climb up the sacred tree while defeating mighty Vikings. \r\n</p>\r\nHelp your friends in battle!\r\n<p>Fight together, regardless of being in separate rooms. Shoot arrows over the screen, send some friendly creatures to your friends' aid, send a mighty shockwave through all rooms - the splitscreens can be used to your advantage.</p>\r\nSolve tricky puzzles!\r\n<p>Teamwork and communication is key! Maneuver your friends through a room of spikes, move crates, shoot targets that need precise timing - you will be rewarded with powerful items that hold the power of gods.</p>\r\nFight powerful bosses!\r\n<p>Every level leads to a mighty boss that tries to put an end to your plans of destroying the world, but even death does not stop these enemies from interfering with your plans. The soul ascends to higher levels and lends other bosses their strength and unique ability - making each bossfight more challenging.</p>\r\nExplore changing levels!\r\n<p>Every level is generated randomly in the ever-shifting tree Yggdrasil, and every death means starting again from the bottom level - but you will not recognize the layout from your previous attempt.</p>\n<p>Are you and your friends ready?\r\n<br/>PLAY TOGETHER!\r\n<br/>FIGHT TOGETHER!\r\n<br/><strong>ROGUE TOGETHER!</strong></p>\n\n\r\nImportant Information\r\n<p>\r\nBecause this game is only a demo version, it currently only supports input via controller (PlayStation, XBox and Nintendo Switch Pro controller are supported).<br/>We strongly recommend to play the game with 4 players, as some of the games features may not be possible with less players. <br/>For easier group finding, we would be happy if you joined our Discord server.\r\n</p>\n\r\nHow to start the game?\r\n<p>\n</p>\r\nHost\r\n<p>Select 'Create Game' with your controller.
