The mages, of course, are prepared for this, and will do everything in their considerable power to stop you.<br/>-\u00a0 Fly between the air and ground to make the best use of your abilities, and get those eggs back -- and maybe earn some gold along the way.<br/>- Dodge projectiles in the air, and block them on the ground. A dragon's skills are versatile indeed. Dodge or block with perfect timing, and you will receive both a greater score and a shorter cooldown!<br/>- Crush mage towers to regain some health, and to halt the red runes in the sky. They say revenge is best served cold, but dragons would disagree.<br/>-\u00a0 <strong>Beware the slimemancer</strong><br/><br/></p>\n<p>Art, Sounds, and Music Acquisition\u00a0-- LoremasterThranix<br/>Coding, Concept, and Project Lead -- PinheadPants</p>\n\n<p><em>Featuring royalty-free music by Kevin MacLeod</em><br/>Music from\u00a0https://filmmusic.io<br/>\"Devastation and Revenge\" by Kevin MacLeod (https://incompetech.com)<br/>\"Crossing the Chasm\" by Kevin MacLeod (https://incompetech.com)\u00a0<br/>License:\u00a0CC\u00a0BY\u00a0(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-13T03:33:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/819/819590246712bfcb4ae047e58329f604.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LoremasterThranix", "Sean Estep"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
