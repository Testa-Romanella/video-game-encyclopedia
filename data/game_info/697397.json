This project was undertaken in the first two weeks of my second semester in 2021 and was mainly used to develop my skills in areas such as:</p>\n<ul><li>Post Processing</li><li>UI</li><li>General Programming</li><li>Movement</li></ul>\n<p>Although based off of Dani's original project all code and assets\u00a0(aside from font) were created and implemented by me. Once again my main intention with this project was to\u00a0 simply see if I\u00a0could closely replicate another games features using my own knowledge and is therefore a much more simplified iteration.</p>\n<p><strong>Dani's </strong><strong>Project;</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T11:21:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aae/aae2ff92f3c4ffa1fdf617c124e97552.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Baxter Dulieu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
