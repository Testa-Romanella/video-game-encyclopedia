You do this by buying different tiles and placing them on the terrain.</p>\n<p>You will find the tiles in the top-right menu.</p>\n<p>There are 4 tiles you can buy:</p>\n<p>-Buttons: These are the base tiles. Start by placing one and then clicking on it. Each click will grant you one dollar.</p>\n<p>-Hammers: These will automatically click on surrounding buttons, passively generating you money</p>\n<p>-Stars: These will double the value per click on surrounding buttons. works both for manual clicks and the ones made by hammers. The boost is multiplicative (3 boosters surroundign the same tile give a 8x boost).</p>\n<p>-Lightnings: These will double the speed at which surrounding hammer click. Their boost is also multiplicative.</p>\n<p>Lastly, you can expand the buildable zone by clicking on the \"next zone\" button.</p>\n<p>You can move the grid around with ctrl + left click or with middle click</p>\n\n<p>Our first game ever,\u00a0made\u00a0 by team Surex (Matthis Perreaux and Antoine Coulon)\u00a0during the Ready Player 42 Hackathon</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-21T05:09:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5e/d5e46c1c99d04c8c39e4bae769e5c16a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nyanplatypus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
