This was not supposed to be a game but a nostalgia build, but it slowly turned into a game. There are no goals in the world yet, except to learn the map of the world without any help. And so far this game has at least 6 minutes and 15 seconds of entertainment!</p>\n<p>This game is still in development so there will be bugs and missing features. All known bugs so far are: moving blocks will eject player if they are moving on the y axis and the player is colliding on the x axis, lucida calligraphy font does not work on all platforms, v sync issues for high frame rate computers.</p><p>Please report any new bugs to this discord server:\u00a0https://discord.gg/Pv6agYuc4C.
