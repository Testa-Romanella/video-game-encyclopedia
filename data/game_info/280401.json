{"id": 280401, "slug": "glowium", "name": "Glowium", "name_original": "Glowium", "description": "<p><strong>I would strongly recommend downloading the game and playing it instead since it is quite intensive due to the loading in of chunks.</strong><br/></p><p>This game was produced in the Ludum Dare 42 Game Jam under the theme of 'Running out of Space'.</p>\n<p>Summary: You have just stolen a rare mineral called glowium however it lets off such a bright glow that the police are able to see your getaway, this bright reaction causes the player\u2019s visibility to be reduced. To counteract this you can find glowing purple crystals called darkium, this will help with the visibility! Last as long as you can, good luck.</p>\n<p>How to play?:\r\nThe yellow bar is how light you are, the more light you are then the camera will zoom in more, to help fix this you need to find an pick up dark purple crystals called darkium. You can use the spacebar to find the nearest darkium, however, this will deplete the left bar, this is how much you can use the darkium detector. Good luck and have fun!</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\nWASD = To move forwards, back and to turn\r\nQE = To rotate the Camera\r\nEscape = Pause Menu\r\nDarkium Detector = Spacebar</p>\n<p>Creators:\r\nOur first Ludum Dare !!\r\nKoltonix (Chris) - Programmer\r\n@Joedb100 (Joe) - Programmer/Artist\r\nmutantdevle (Devlin) - Level Designer</p>\n<p>Extra Pieces:\r\nTosh200 (Josh) - Created the main menu and pause sound track\r\n@daniel-neale (Dan) - Created the in game sound track</p>\n<p>How our Game Relates to the Theme?:\r\nOur game relates to the theme mainly in the sense that as time goes on your camera size which is orthographic is reduced over time until a value of about 5 in Unity.</p>\n<p>Bugs/Issue:\r\nThe main issues consist of the AI being abosuletely abhorrent and being generally buggy mainly in the sense of moving and following the player. The second primary issue is optimisation which is due to the game being \u2018procedurally generated\u2019, but I will use that term loosely, which I would have liked to make much more optimised, but due to time contrainsts wasn\u2019t quite possible. Due to time constraints due to the AI needing to be changed we also didn\u2019t get a chance to include sound effects, but our friends were able to produce some tracks to fit the game.</p>\n<p>Software Used:\r\nUnity C#\r\nMaya\r\nPhotoshop\r\nMuse Score 2(Dan)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88b/88b776b20d1df40430b4d0fc54c88583.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Koltonix"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
