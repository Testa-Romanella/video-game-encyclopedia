The goal is to find the chicken the feather belongs to. The more feathers join your feather, the further you can let the feather fly and the better your chances are of finding the chicken. But watch out! If your feathers get too wet, they will become too heavy to fly and fall to the ground.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T03:01:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8aa/8aa82ca96afe230dce149f3847a15edc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["luizaMuffin"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
