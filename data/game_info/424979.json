This allows space partitions to be arranged<br/>in a so-called space-partitioning tree.</p><p>The entire dungeon area is represented by the root node of the<br/>BSP tree and is partitioned recursively until a terminating<br/>condition is met (such as a minimum size for rooms). The BSP<br/>algorithm guarantees that no two rooms will be overlapping, and<br/>allows for a very structured appearance of the dungeon.</p><p><em>How to do?</em></p><ol><li>\u00a0start with the entire dungeon area (root node of BSP tree)</li><li>divide the area along a horizontal or vertical line</li><li>select one of the two new partition cells</li><li>\u00a0if this cell is bigger than the minimal acceptable size: go to step 2 (using this cell as the area to be divided)</li><li>select the other partition cell, and go to step 4</li><li>After partitioning:</li><ol><li>\u00a0for every partition cell: create a room within the cell by randomly choosing two points</li><li>starting from the lowest layers, draw corridors to connect rooms corresponding to children of the same parent in the BSP tree</li><li>repeat 2 until the children of the root node are connected</li></ol></ol><p>The code is available to see only for business inquiries.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T05:58:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a8/7a82643ffd890849cabda0ca6f460f1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ant\u00f3nio \"Xpop\" Barreiro"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
