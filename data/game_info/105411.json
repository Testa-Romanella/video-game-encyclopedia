You pilot a hover tank, with a control system that lets you control each side of the tank's thrusters separately. Clear waves of enemies and rack up points, while managing your tank's energy levels. Destroying enemies and clearing levels will fill up your energy, but it will drain over time and when you get hit.</p><p>Latest build: Fixed issue where energy cubes were invisible on some computers.</p><p><strong>(Note: Game requires an XInput gamepad to play)</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e2/6e25c2b0d75b541f4b700af41f5772e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zerofiftyone"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
