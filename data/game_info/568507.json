{"id": 568507, "slug": "basically-acidic", "name": "Basically Acidic", "name_original": "Basically Acidic", "description": "<p>You, a ball of acidic powder, have gotten lost in the sewers and found a horrid place where every floor is covered in bases. Due to your chemical nature, bases will kill you whenever touched, so it's best to stay as far away from them as possible. \u00a0Can you hop, skip, and glide your way out of this horrid place and back to the pit of acid you once called home? Find out!</p>\n<p>My game explores the topic by making the acidic pits the safe place and the ground something that will kill you in an instant. The goal is also bottomless pit, which is another thing that is typically used as a symbol of failure. In short I approached the theme from a symbolism standpoint, making things that are typically symbols of danger or failure into the goal and safe points.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T14:17:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/082/0826f88e0b1d4791d242d98f55b91b1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Starfishness"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
