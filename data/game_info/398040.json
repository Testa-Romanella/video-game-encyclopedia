{"id": 398040, "slug": "defend-the-fort", "name": "Defend The Fort (itch)", "name_original": "Defend The Fort (itch)", "description": "<p>Defend The Fort (DTF) is a simple fortress/tower defense game that I created for a college project. The goal of the game is to use defenses that you purchase to defend your fortress from oncoming enemies.</p>\n<p>The game will progressively speed up as you beat each wave. Enemies will spawn in faster and the total amount of enemies per wave will also increase.</p>\n<p>Once you make it to wave 20 and beat it, you will have won the game.</p>\n<p>The game does support saving and loading of data so you can save your progress between waves. If saved, you will retain whatever currency you had, all of the defenses you had purchased and whatever wave you were on.</p>\n<p>Please be aware this game does not look too pretty. This version that I am uploading is rather basic and I'm not sure I will be working on it further. There are no real graphics other than primitive shapes, there are no sound effects, and there is no music. Also, the GUI lacks in feedback, meaning that sometimes you might press a button but nothing will seem to happen immediately. Don't worry about this too much, I assure you that all the GUI does work, it just wont tell you that its done something.</p>\n<p>Thanks for taking a look!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-13T04:12:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/021/0215f36dd020a2f266d5fad77b52085d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["baconation"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
