You, the player, come from a failing technocratic society which has been corrupted by the wealthy elite, and have turned to crime in order to survive. During different heists you may come across wondrous devices and can either decide whether to donate, sell or keep these items for future missions. Either become the legend you\u2019ve always wanted to be or spark the dawn of a new era.</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Included with executable (\"Silence - Controls.txt\")\r\n</p>\n<p>Programmers:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Michael Jordan (https://itch.io/profile/corrosiveknifer)\r\n</li><li>William De Beer\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Artists\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Fiona Cheung\r\n</li><li>Peter Nguyen\r\n</li><li>Roger Painting\u00a0(https://magicmanprime.itch.io/)\r\n</li><li>Sabrina Li\r\n</li><li>William Lawrence\u00a0(https://williaml.itch.io/)\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T03:12:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ec/6ec5157d339f6a1207f4020c135166d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mango Mob"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
