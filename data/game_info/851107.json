We're both Programmers but never worked with any game engine or in any game-related context.</p>\n<p>This is our very first time we created something that will be seen by others. We had very intrigue plans for a game and its vision, sprites, everything - in the end we barely finished a prototype as an entry to the jam.</p>\n<p>Our vision was to create a story line where a human colony on a by alien inhabited planet lived in unison with its inhabitants, until they got to greedy and started to exploit the inhabitants and their principles. The inhabitants strike back and the human colony goes silent. You as a player are tasked to descend to the colony and find out why they went silent.</p>\n<p>In a classic metroidvania manner you go though several levels and areas and unlock abilities and tools to be able to further progress your investigation. But not without meeting malfunctioning robots left behind by the colonists, or some of the original inhabitants of the planet.</p>\n\n<p>We have never made any games that weren't part of a detailed Unity or Godot Tutorial, for this 2D project we settled on Godot and got to work. We learned a lot about the engine and making games in general during the last 30 days, but are nowhere near completion of a full-scale game.</p>\n<p>We are both programmers so that's what we did most of our limited time, even scrapping our whole code-base once halfway through the month.<br/></p>\n<p>Also we learned that good 2D-Art is hard and we're both not talented 2D artists. So\u00a0all our Player and Enemy Sprites are made by the talented PENUSBMIC and are contained in his\u00a0\u00a0Sci-fi Collection Bundle. All other sprites are crudely made by us with Aseprite (except for the spaceship in the beginning. That was made by Niristius, but the design is copied from somewhere, yet we cant find it anymore... )</p>\n\n<p>All\u00a0Assets where created by us,\u00a0\u00a0legally purchased or are royalty free and will be Credited here:</p>\n<p>Player and Enemy Sprites are from the Sci-fi Collection Bundle by PENUSBMIC</p>\n<p>Menu\u00a0BGM by Defrini<br/></p>\n<p>Intro\u00a0Cutscene BGM by Jim\u00a0Hal<br/></p>\n<p>Sound Effects are from Ultimate Sound FX Bundle by Sidearm Studio</p>\n<p>Ingame BGM and Bossmusic are from\u00a0Total Music Collection by Muz Station Productions</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T11:21:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31b/31bea6087c0c01950ef68cf0be931567.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Elysian Sin", "Niristius", "JudiTeller"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
