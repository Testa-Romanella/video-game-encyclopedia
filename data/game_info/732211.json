{"id": 732211, "slug": "expedition-the-new-world", "name": "Expedition - The New World", "name_original": "Expedition - The New World", "description": "<p>\"Expedition\" is a game about the human sense of wonder and discovery; assemble a group of explorers and journey into the unknown. Roam the world, discover, colonize (if you want),\u00a0and trade.</p>\n<p>The game doesn't reward you with a new discovery on every step, it instead requires from you methodical mapping and cartographic exercise to find these hidden wonders.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>2020 update:</strong>\u00a0During the development of Expedition, our approach to the aspects we enjoyed the most about the Age of Exploration has changed dramatically. We are keeping this page for historical reasons, but our design efforts have moved to other projects partially inspired by this one.</p>\n<p>\"The New World\" is a scenario inspired by the classic game: The Seven Cities of Gold. You are a Spanish explorer and you have to stock up an expedition to the New World, travel there, and then found colonies in the name of the crown.<br/></p>\n<p>Note: The game comes bundled with 2 different tilesets plus a characters-based display, I recommend using the \"Oryx\" tileset.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T14:52:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a2/7a2b189fc709ea14f45f1bd374d4c6fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Slashie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
