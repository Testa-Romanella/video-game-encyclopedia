Collect 10 snowmen to have enough snow strength to scare off the snowgres and win!</p>\n<p>I decided this week that I was going to learn game art, design, and development. I've been watching some video courses and YouTube videos on pixel art and how to get started in game dev for the past couple days. I got inspired by some content creators and indie game dev's stories of getting started by doing game jams.</p>\n<p>I decided to look and see if I could find any upcoming game jams in the next few months that I could try and prep for. I found one with a submission deadline in 8 hours. I quickly Googled and YouTubed my way to try and figure out how to get started making a game as soon as possible. I decided on using Piskelapp for art and Construct 3 for my engine. They both run in the browser and seemed like they're easier to learn quickly than most alternatives.\u00a0I spent a couple hours working through some tutorials and then spent 4 hours combining what I learned into creating my first game. It's a very rough start, but I'm proud of it given that I tried to teach myself game design and dev from scratch and produce a game in less than a day.\u00a0I plan on continuing to re-iterate on and improve the game for the next few weeks until I'm happier with the result for my first game. Let me know what you think!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T07:09:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eaa/eaa46a890f19655697fcd10b831e1023.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SaintWarhead"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
