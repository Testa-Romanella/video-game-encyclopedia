Pac-Man (\u30cf\u30ed\u30fc! \u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30f3), is a side-scrolling adventure game \"sequel\" to Pac-Man. Instead of being a maze game like the majority of its predecessors, Pac-Man 2 incorporates light point-and-click adventure game elements. It was produced and published by Namco for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis systems, and was released in 1994 by Namco. The game borrows its structure and certain elements from Pac-Land, and also appears to contain certain elements from the animated series, such as Pac-Man's family and a main villain commanding the ghosts. The SNES version of Pac-Man 2 was re-released on the Wii U Virtual Console in 2015.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-19T11:22:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ff/2ffb980ddd70cf630be8d5562f3d21d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.11, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 5, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 183, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["Wii U", "SNES", "Genesis"], "developers": ["NAMCO"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Namco"], "esrb_rating": null}
