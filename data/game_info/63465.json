One playthrough takes about 10min, exploring everything around 30min.</strong><br/><br/>I started working on this during a very dark period in my life.

This game is not everyone's taste but I'm very proud that I managed to finish it and hopefully the experience of playing it will be helpful to some of you as well.Features<ul><li>A short but unique experience<br/></li><li>Lots to discover if you dive deeper<br/></li><li>No graphics - only words will guide your way<br/></li><li>Think outside the box to solve the \"puzzles\"</li></ul><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-22T10:33:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/583/583b2e923f36012f1548374765b48ef8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 20, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Peace & Love Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Peace & Love Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
