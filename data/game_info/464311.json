Well, your current one, at least ;)</p><p>The original idea was a single player race, with three AI opponents. Guiding an AI around the track turned out to be too much for our time, so we changed to a two player game in the last 30 mins.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T04:44:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a8/8a805212270f1a70c69ff1e91adcfe15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ShoeFisherGames"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
