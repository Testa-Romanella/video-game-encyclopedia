Your Toobz network must allow water to flow without any spilling.  As you advance through levels, you'll have less and less time to place the pieces before the water starts automatically.  You can start the water at any time, allowing you to quickly advance to the next level and earn extra points.  If you spill any water, though, your game is over and you'll have to try again.<br/><br/>Toobz features three game modes: \"Classic Toobz\" in which only one upcoming piece is displayed, \"Show Toobz\" game in which the next four pieces are displayed, and the new \"Puzzle\" game that starts you out with a full board.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:21:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fe/5fe0c33d4ec0638c55dd9c0b51c4b58c.jpg", "website": "http://toobz-game.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Jason Haslup"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Jason Haslup"], "esrb_rating": null}
