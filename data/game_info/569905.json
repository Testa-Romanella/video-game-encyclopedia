Carefully keep your gun horizontal, and don't move too fast!</p>\n<p>Luckily, the gun fires THE WHOLE BULLET! and so the bullets can be reused!</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p>W A S D: Movement</p>\n<p>Mouse: Look/Aim</p>\n<p>Left Click: Shoot</p>\n<p>Right\u00a0Click (Hold): Slowly walk, makes bullets less likely to fall out!</p>\n<p>E (Hold): Grab bullets\u00a0(Can be held to grab multiple)</p>\n<p>Alt F4 to close the game</p>\n<p>You may have to use windows volume mixer to adjust volume!</p>\n<p>The Green bar is health, the orange bar at the bottom is gun wobbliness, if it fills up bullets will spill out!
