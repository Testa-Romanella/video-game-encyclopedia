This could have been the tag line for any shoot 'em up for the old Sega Mega Drive 64, the Commodore Amiga or why not some arcade game from the 80's/90's.  I missed those games and that's why I present 18 stages of action plus some cutscenes with a somewhat silly story for you to enjoy!</p>\n<p>This game is a single player shoot 'em up for Windows. The game can be played using the keyboard and mouse or most standard controllers.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T06:39:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea3/ea3c7ffbfc23b323530f0c9f461240fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 234, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["niklasoh"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
