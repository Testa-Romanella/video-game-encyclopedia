You only have a limited amount of energy before you too, fade into oblivion. You'll need to use your time and energy wisely, or perish.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUnless you solve the ancient puzzles set before you by the builders of the fortress, you won't be getting very far. Some puzzles may reveal a hidden path or mysterious relics and items which could prove useful to you. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe most dangerous part of your journey will be when you face off against several epic guardian bosses in strategic, fast paced combat that will test your mettle as a neon warrior, and your worthiness to gaze upon the shard of creation, Neonorn.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMany will try, and many will fail. Will you be the one to save Neonorn from the darkness?", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9f/d9f24630718c2e1da3593b720f757e28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rabbit"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Rabbit"], "esrb_rating": null}
