Enemies can't hurt you but you can shoot them to get score bonuses!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>A-D to move.</li><li>Spacebar to jump. (Realease it to adjust your jumps)</li><li>Mouse left button to shoot. (Shoot down after jumping to go higher)</li></ul>\n<p>I might update this game periodically so stay tuned!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T06:16:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50b/50b1093afb783fbf3865b960aecf1be0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MateG_"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
