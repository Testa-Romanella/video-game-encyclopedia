The next year more people were participating to ensure they won the prize. Year after year the game's prize got higher and higher until a streamer was murdered live on stream after he was close to winning. Now the game is a dangerous event as people will kill others to ensure they don't win the prize before they do.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T15:51:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d7/2d70ccd9272b5fc47df6c39b8644fe8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ClickBuildGames"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
