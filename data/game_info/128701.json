I feel good, I feel gooood, I did it!</p>\n<p>Also, all credit to Kaimen and Enterbrain for the music I used.</p>\n<p>A lot of stuff's probably broken, didn't really have time to test everything like I wanted to, but I made the effort!</p><p>Update v.01:</p><p>Hello folks! STILL working on this in between work and other projects but I finally got back around to it! This update contains the following:</p><ul><li>Bugfixes, including getting rid of the mess-up I made regarding audio and the other mess-up I made involving getting back into your offices and the impossibility thereof.</li><li>More skills for all characters! Currently everyone has three unique skills and they SHOULD learn a new tactic every five levels but I may not have fully tested that out so let me know if that ain't working. Should happen at level 6 and 11 and those're the only two right now but hey! Progress!</li><li>Enemies drop more money and EXP now.</li><li>Lifesteal stuff should work properly for things like the Dracula's Guide To Being A Dracula and the Sapper's Friend.</li><li>New \"area\"\u00a0that's literally just a room with a jacked-up encounter rate so you can grind easier since I lowered encounter rates everywhere else.</li></ul><p>Nothing else I can think of off the top of my head right now but I\"m gonna keep putting in some work on this throughout the month cause the plan right now basically is to bounce back and forth, month to month, from project to project as a means of forcing myself to learn things for game design.
