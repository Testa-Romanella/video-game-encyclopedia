The infected are highly contagious and will infect everyone in their vicinity.<br/></p>\n<p>The infected will only go to the hospitals, if they have nowhere else to go. They will go back home, to work or to any other location, unless they only have the hospital to go to.</p>\n<p>NPC's won't move if they have nowhere to go. Only the infected will move to the hospital, but they will also only move if they have a clear path to the hospital.</p><p>Infected die between one or two minutes after they got infected. When they managed to recover in a hospital, they are immune to another infection for a few minutes.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Try to save everyone without letting any infected die!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>- Use left click to lower and raise the barricades</p>\n<p>- You can use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. With the arrow keys you can move the camera</p>\n\n<p>Known issues and planned improvements:</p>\n<p>- NPC's get stuck when you raise the barricades and when they are in their hitboxes. I hadn't time to move the NPC's out of the way and I thought about killing them off when they are stuck, but that would make a no-death run way too hard (let's imagine the NPC's are suddenly stuck on a huge wall and can't climb down)</p>\n<p>- It might be possible that some NPC's don't move when they are in a building.</p>\n<p>- These guys are honestly assholes.</p><p>- Considering to make the map moveable by using the mouse and dragging instead of arrow keys.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T11:30:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76b/76bac4e8eb154f0ea8507679f546123e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Le Don"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
