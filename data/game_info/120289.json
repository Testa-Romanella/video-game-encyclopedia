{"id": 120289, "slug": "the-incredible-vending-machine", "name": "The Incredible Vending Machine", "name_original": "The Incredible Vending Machine", "description": "<p>(last updated: 28.04.2016)</p><p>A game where you start out with nothing, and need to get things from a vending machine by putting things inside and receiving whathever the machine transforms them into, with a little help from a highly literate amphibian and yet-to-be-drawn hoarding assistant dragon. There's some logic behind this game, but I'll leave it for you people to figure out. ^^<br/></p><p>Sadly, I got that idea near the end of the second day of Ludum Dare, past halfway through the Jam (and I had exhausted myself a bit programming for my initial concept). Thus, the game is very unfinished and full of placeholders, but the core logic seems to work and as far as I know, can be completed (where by \"completion\" I mean hoarding every single type of item; that might take a while).</p><p>I'm still working on the game, adding some features every once in a while, between one LD playthrough and another. The game is available in Windows and HTML5 version so far.</p><p>Most of all, have fun! I mean, if you don't have fun, it'll likely mean you didn't advance too much in the game... ^^'</p><p>Also, not that THERE ARE NO SAVES YET! So if you want 100% completion, you need to do it in a single run.</p><p>Constructive feedback is very welcome.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/639/63909e9cbeb9f96e2b96a899b8a86c05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alice"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
