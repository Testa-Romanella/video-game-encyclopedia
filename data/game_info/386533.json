But your path is full of dangers and you'll have to carefully use your time powers. Indeed, when you are the green guy, you can move but time is stopped and when you switch to the red guy, you are immobilized but time goes on !<br/><br/><br/><br/>The game has multiple environments with their unique gameplay specifications that fully use the abilities of your time powers. The game will test your dexterity with pure platforming levels but also your ability to solve puzzles. Never forget that the key to save the child is to switch time !<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gred is a game created by four students, two developpers and two artists, willing to discover the universe of video game creation. Made in a little bit more of two months, we had fun realizing it and we hope you'll have fun playing it !", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-28T02:27:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc4/dc44a358d7d3f821e87c614e5b1ebb07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kevin Bergeal", "Pierre Compagnon", "Gregory Diaz", "Guillaume Mellet"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Team Gred"], "esrb_rating": null}
