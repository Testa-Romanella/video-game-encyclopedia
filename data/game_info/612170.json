My interaction with developers, my passion for wanting to make games &amp; inspiration &amp; courage to do what I wanted to do for a change.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He keeps me here is about a guy struggling with his own reality, feeling no self worth, trapped in what feels like an alternate world.\u00a0That said, the game starts pretty abruptly, and doesn't tell you much. I think that's the best way for this game to start, and I think it's better to play it for yourself, as the story is intended to be discovered rather than explained. There is a depth to this story, separate\u00a0from my own story.<br/></p>\n<p>I highly recommend you go &amp; check out the original version either first or after this as both are not long at all. Matt put a lot of time into the original of this game &amp; it would great if people could not only support me as you all have, but also support him. Without Matt, I wouldn't be here making games, that's the simple truth. He works hard at everything he does &amp; is making some killer games that I can't wait to show you all.\u00a0<br/><br/>Thanks for checking out this remake/homage to \"He Keeps Me Here\" &amp; I look forward to you all playing!
