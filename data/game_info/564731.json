The mode continuously spawns enemy units and the player tries to accumulate as many points as possible before being eliminated.</li><li>I Added more information to the UI including current level/mode and a life counter.</li><li>I Incorporated a separate score-keeper for each game mode. High score is saved separately between the campaign and endless.</li><li>Bonus modification: I added a new mini-boss enemy\u00a0(solar space station) and a boss enemy\u00a0(pyramid space station) to both the campaign and endless.</li></ol>\n<p>Credits:\r\n</p>\n<p>Created by Michael Burkett</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T10:22:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8db/8dbc691b57167f60b29b3fb566e13425.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Rad"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
