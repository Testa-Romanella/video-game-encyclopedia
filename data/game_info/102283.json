Even the game instructions and settings are a part of the level itself! <br/> <br/>Controls: <br/>*A/D or Arrow Keys for moving. <br/>*Space to jump <br/>*Right mouse button absorbs blocks <br/>*Left mouse button places blocks <br/>*(Alt+Enter to exit fullscreen) <br/>*((Jump on the red exit block, to exit the game)) <br/> <br/>The game is part sandbox, with no obligation to the player to necessarily do anything until they pick up the mysterious purple block in the upper right corner. This starts the progression of the game where things get more dangerous! Continue collecting purple blocks to 'win'. <br/> <br/>The idea I was going for was to always make everything on screen a part of the game, mechanically. So the title and control instructions can be broken apart and picked up, the volume 'bar' can be destroyed(and rebuilt!) and even your score displayed at the end of the game (which itself is a special surprise!) can be broken and altered if you want to pretend your score was higher. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/661/661e5eb63a07e2a75fd9a4bb8179b6f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ShaunJS"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
