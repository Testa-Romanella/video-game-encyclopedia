Don\u2019t do that. 2048 game does not calculate how long you take before you make a move so why move in hurry and ruin the board? This is a type of puzzle that is better solved with strategic thinking. <br/><br/>Understand how the planets moves in this puzzle game. Each time you swipe, they will move as far as they can go to one direction. So you must familiarize yourself with this movement or you will fail in planning how to move these planets inside the solar system.<br/>Try to make moves when you can merge several planets at once. This is a way to clear up the 2048 game board to make more room and therefore allows you to have more flexibility. <br/><br/>Keep the highest planets block in the corner, especially right bottom corner and do NOT move it. How to do this? By making sure your bottom row is always filled so that the highest tile cannot move. Use Down movement so that when you move the number block from left to right, your highest tile will remain in place. <br/><br/>Don\u2019t give up! Keep trying. 2048 is not an easy game though it appears to be so. <br/> <br/>People who achieve high scores in this puzzle game don\u2019t get their scores easily.
