The dull silence is cut by a phone call from a man with a familiar voice. The gruff voice urges you to \"come quickly, they're all gone.\"<br/><br/>Disturbed, you get in your car, and suddenly you're standing in the dimly lit foyer of someone's home. The place is empty, like everyone just got up and left. There's an awful stench in the air but you can't make out what it is. All you can hear is the sound of the wind and tree branches crashing against the side of the house, and a faint ticking noise. <br/><br/>Suddenly you feel an icy cold presence shoot through your body as your vision fades and your body washes with fear. You're paralyzed lying on the reeking, damp ground; through half-open eyes you see a tall figure wielding a harsh blade standing over you. The being opens its mouth as if to speak and all that comes out is the blood-curdling screeching of metal on metal.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T05:18:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f07/f079fcabc05b2c962d4c4ca4f34402c2.jpg", "website": "https://psychosisgame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 427, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Wii"], "developers": ["Aaron Gilbert"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Naxat Soft", "Aaron Gilbert"], "esrb_rating": null}
