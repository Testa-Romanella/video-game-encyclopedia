This is what I made for the theme of \"Running Out of Space\", but I didn't like it so I chose not to upload.\u00a0</p><p>Looking back, I think it's a neat prototype that I want to come back to in the future. I'm posting to itch mostly for archival purposes, but I think the idea could go somewhere with enough polish.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>The aim of the game is to survive as long as possible. The spikey-headed enemies will slowly fade into being. An enemy is \"active\" when it is no longer transparent.</p><p>Getting hit by their bullets will cause the screen view to shrink. Shooting an enemy while it is active will kill it, expanding the screen.</p><p>The idea is that the game will become harder to play the more you get hit.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Controls\u00a0</p><p>Use the\u00a0WASD keys to move around and the arrow keys to shoot.
