{"id": 474554, "slug": "intergalactic-music-adventure", "name": "Intergalactic Music Adventure", "name_original": "Intergalactic Music Adventure", "description": "<p>This is a unique, lo-fi learning resource/game for classical\u00a0musical theory, in particular for piano. It was designed\u00a0to keep young music students engaged between weekly lessons, but is blossoming\u00a0into a mysterious microcosmic reference\u00a0 and learning\u00a0experience for music.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s also great for total newbies\u00a0to music theory of any age, especially players with absolutely no access to a physical instrument of any kind. The goal is to install all of the frameworks of music theory in a visually practical way so that the player can begin to think imaginatively with them. <br/></p>\n\n<p>All learning games and quizzes\u00a0 randomly pull from a huge database of music theory, making things fun for a lone adventurer, or for\u00a0a classroom smart board.\u00a0 Stumble upon challenges set by zany quest characters encountered on planets.</p>\n<p>Designed to work optimally on all gaming computers, with great support for teacher-guided group use on\u00a0smart boards and touch-screens. Does not require a musical instrument or any MIDI equipment to use.<br/></p>\n\n<p>The game\u00a0has been\u00a0drawn\u00a0and programmed single-handedly by\u00a0Aaron Batic, a mural\u00a0artist and illustrator \u2018AZZURRO\u2019 based in South Australia with many giant painted street artworks in Adelaide, as well as in Amsterdam and London. Aaron is a classically trained pianist and private piano teacher and began to\u00a0create the resource to supplement teaching\u00a0in response to the impacts placed on piano lessons by the COVID crisis.</p>\n<p>! The next big feature on the way\u00a0is\u00a0Scene Select mode, where all\u00a0activities can be accessed through a single screen, perfect for group/classroom use.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>! ! This is a game in development. The artist is including a demo version .apk file for use on Android devices with developer mode enabled to encourage better usage among users and to encourage some more feedback. Please note that this has not been extensively tested on Android given it is not the platform Intergalactic Music Adventure is being developed for.</p>\r\nTEACHER FEATURES\r\n<p>The adventure includes;</p>\n<ul><li> <strong>Note Name Guessing; </strong>Use a cute on-screen piano keyboard to correctly select notes being displayed randomly across treble and bass staves, with super high and low ledger-line notes included.\u00a0</li><li><strong>Symbol Quiz: </strong>Visit the symbol kingdom to take a quiz of 40+ musical symbols you\u2019re bound to come across as a beginner and even some that would be new to a virtuoso\u00a0</li></ul>\n<ul><li> <strong>Note Fishing:</strong> Fish for crotchets, dotted minims,\u00a0semibrieves, quavers and semiquavers in a coral reef with the fisherman\u2019s worm, dodging tropical fish, pink jellies and the wrong note types</li><li> <strong>Rhythm Restaurant:</strong> Serve dinner to an infinite queue of starving aliens who can only order their food by speaking in rhythmic notation.
