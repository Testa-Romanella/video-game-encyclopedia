Now, he's trusting you, his tiny disc son,\u00a0to take care of him, taking his place as the blood provider for the family. Venture to the ship's disc rooms to chase humans for their blood, and meet the shopkeeper to buy helpful items in your hunt. Bigger discs swarm the hunting grounds too, and will take any opportunity they can to bully you out of your hard earned kills. Can you survive and save your father?</p>\n\n<p><em>All art, music, code, and of course, really stupid disc jokes, were made by me.</em><br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Use <strong>WASD</strong> or <strong>Arrow Keys</strong> to <em>move</em> around or<em> select </em>different items in the hub world.</p>\n<p><strong>X</strong> to <em>Confirm</em></p>\n<p><strong>Shift </strong>to <em>Dash</em> (once unlocked) and to <em>switch </em>between shop and home base.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T05:50:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e67/e67de37fbde3975f70f0fbb442329bc8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Ethan Zarov"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
