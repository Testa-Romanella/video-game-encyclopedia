{"id": 269236, "slug": "fishcraft", "name": "FishCraft", "name_original": "FishCraft", "description": "<p>FishCraft was made for the OLC Code Jam, from scratch, in 1 week. It was made in C++ using SFML and OpenGL.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>FishCraft is a small little minecraft clone I made, but I put my own twist on it. The twist is that the lighting is actually path-traced, and not using traditional methods seen in other voxel games. I wanted this because I thought it would make it look like a game from 2018, whist still paying tribute to minecraft's unique style.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I designed it with performance in mind, and thus most of the aspects are quite optimized. Even with this, path tracing is still a rather performance intensive task and I wanted to keep noise to a minimum.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There isn't that much to do in the game, but what is there I personally believe to be solid. There are a few goals in the game, and there are some crafting recipies. Feel free to discover them by yourself!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41d/41d739135b1f7d7dbc7fb261bb013ade.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UglySwedishFish"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
