You have no resources and are alone in the hostile reaches of outer space. The final words of your command linger in your memory - <strong><em>I</em></strong><strong><em>nitiate Astra\u00a0Protocol</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Astra Protocol\u00a0</strong>is a survival game where you pilot a spacecraft on limited resources, attempting to\u00a0last\u00a0 as long as possible. You must carefully manage your fuel, shields, and arsenal whilst navigating asteroids and avoiding hostile spacecraft.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Astra Protocol\u00a0</strong>is a game designed around the 1980s vision of space and the technology at the time. The interface is text-based and deliberately obtuse (to add to the challenge of survival). The game was designed to be lightweight. It is built in C# and uses no external libraries or resources. All assets are generated at runtime, keeping the program size down to less than 300 kB.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-25T03:05:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e6/8e6e81d12c346562ee59e9b7b2846746.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Slice Bar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
