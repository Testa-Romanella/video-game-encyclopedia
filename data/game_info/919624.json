As this is a prototype, and a work in progress, some features, visuals and audio may be incomplete. Most notably, the main character was being redesigned, as seen on the title screen, but most of their animations are not ready to be put in game.</p>\n<p>Currently, I'm just trying to learn and release something along the way, I have many ideas for this that will probably be tested in other games before I start to work on a full game. Any and all feedback is appreciated, as well as any donations to support my game development!<br/><br/>Thank you, and enjoy the game~<br/></p>\n<p>@Amortes1 on Twitter</p>\n<p>Follow my daily dev on Trello<br/></p>\n<p>Come say hi and chat on my\u00a0Discord server</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T19:25:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff8/ff809e282ff4442fb0c1c7f1a5d08f5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Amortes"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
