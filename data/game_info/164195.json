I've been starting to get into game design/game developing since last year. Did a few games in Construct and now I'm starting to gravitate towards Unity.</p>\n<p>This project took me about 2-3 months. I know its not the best thing in the world but I'm mostly looking out for input of my fellow enthusiasts and colleagues in this platform. Any thing you can teach me will make me a happy camper. Although every one hates campers in general.</p>\n<p>Hopefully I'll get back to you guys with more games.</p>\n<p>See ya!</p>\n<p>Bernardo \"Villaroux\"\u00a0Valverde<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57a/57a3b23e73fa1c8fd6418d789d056578.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Villaroux"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
