Expel the souls of unsuspecting citizens and trap them on your plane of existence. Careful though! Busters of ghosts are out to suck you up with their portable vacuum cleaners!</p>\n<p>Okay so I pretty much finished making the game but I had to rush a fair bit as I didn't leave myself enough time for each aspect, which is quite evident when you play it. I had a blast participating in this jam though, not my first jam but actually the first where I had something to submit by the deadline. In light of this first success, I'm going to look at what I did right and what I did wrong and try to improve for future jams. I'll be putting this into a short video along with the time lapse of the development over the next few days.</p>\n<p>Thanks for stopping by and any feedback would be much appreciated\u00a0:)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-12T06:56:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1b/d1b4d6bd28a20fb8816f781be6e164f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheBanterBroadcast"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
