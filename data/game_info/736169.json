While using the former&#39;s engine and sound effects, this game sticks closer to the original Dynamite Deka game having players rescue the President&#39;s kidnapped daughter. The main difference between Asian Dynamite and Dynamite Deka 2 are the new graphics, different characters and a redesigned power-up system that has players pick up suitcases and transform their characters into 3 different personas with their own fighting styles.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2007-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T17:23:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f7/0f7b5b5982418826cd183fdfa7a94f1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 275, "game_series_count": 7, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["SEGA"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": null}
