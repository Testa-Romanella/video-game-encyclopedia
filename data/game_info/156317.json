We'd like to thank all the organizers and sponsors of the event.</p><p>We chose the theme \"R\u00e9volution\" and created this infinite runner using a circular level design and a two stages gameplay. We also respected the constraints of having the space bar as only input and using the team members as main characters.</p><p>We hope you will enjoy playing the game as much as we had fun making it. Good luck and have fun, the Pixelogic team.</p><p>Jony Pinheiro, Lolita Guerreiro, Natanael Braga, Ruben Guerreiro</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6df/6dfa7dc00546da0bb722b7e1eff184b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pixelogic"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
