This time in a land full of mazes where you must collect all the different ingredients you can to pass on to your younger fellow mages as you're getting a bit long in the tooth these days. Yep, it didn't take 40 seconds to come up with that nonsense.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Game</p>\n<p>A slightly different take on a popular maze game. investigate a dozen mazes in the style of an old, early, never ending, 80s arcade game. We're looking at high scores here and not much else. You might get a sense of deja vue around ever corner as it's speccy reference city, plus a few others. Collect all items in each maze whilst blasting enemies away with fireballs and freezing them temporarily in their tracks with the bonus fruits, candy, chicken and recognisers.</p>\n<p>This is my Atari E.T., although I've had a lot longer than five weeks, but I've actually had a deadline for the first time. So forgive me if it's far from perfect but I think it's still a lot of fun and a half decent way to celebrate the Spectrum's 40th birthday.</p>\n<p>The Controls</p>\n<p>Q - up,\u00a0A - down,\u00a0O - left,\u00a0P - right and\u00a0Space - Shoot fireball.</p>\n<p>Joystick control also available but keyboard works a lot better.</p>\n<p>Featuring</p>\n<p>Mutants, mummies, ghosts, dingos, robots, teddy bears, spaceships, big birds, bugs, cops, light cycles, ingredients, fruit, fireballs and a wizard.</p>\n<p>Very special thanks for the help and inspiration over the last three or four years</p>\n<p>Richard Langford, Andy Green, Pedro Pimenta, Gabriele Amore, Sebastian Braunert, Clive Townsend, Allan Turvey, Paul Jenkinson, Jonathan Cauldwell, Joe Ryan Davies and Sir Clive Sinclair.</p>\n<p>...and everyone else who I haven't mentioned (sorry!) who's helped me at all along the way.
