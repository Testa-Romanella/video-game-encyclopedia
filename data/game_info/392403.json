It is a place where the human survivors of the great war live, the continent closest to the realm of the gods. The Dark Lord Surt who has his eyes set on that continent said this to his heirs:<br />\n&quot;The one who brings me the Heart of Yggdrasil said to be safeguarded by the goddesses on the Floating Continent of Yggdrasil shall be the heir to my throne. As long as you get your hands on the Heart of Yggdrasil, I will not question your methods or your past transgressions. You are free to make alliances between yourselves, sabotage, or even &#39;remove&#39; your fellow heirs as you would any obstacle. Kill and rampage as you wish, and prove to me your strength and worth!&quot;<br />\nHearing those words, Surt&#39;s heirs, all having motivations of their own, began their invasion of the Floating Continent of Yggdrasil. Among them, an ostracized member of the demon nobility, Loki, has also decided to participate in the prolonged battle for the throne.<br />\nTo become the Dark Lord means you will stand above and at the very top of every demon. If corrupting the goddesses said to be as beautiful and elegant as a flower in full bloom will be the key that leads to him gaining the throne, he saw no reason not to participate.<br />\n5 invading demons, and 5 goddesses fighting back. All the pieces have fallen into place. All that remains is for him to wager his own existence in this battle and fight. In a continent caught in a whirlpool of chaos and ambition, Loki&#39;s own ambition burns brightly.Gameplay Features<br />\nArmy Composition<br />\nCreate your own divisions, building armies with unique synergies to overwhelm your foes!<br />\nCreate teams consisting of up to 6 units with varying skillsets into a division, allowing you to freely form teams tailored to your liking.<br />\nBase Investment<br />\nMake full use of your conquered lands and develop them!<br />\nProduction of food and procurement of resources are important factors that keep an army running.<br />\nBuild structures on captured territory according to the needs of your army, whether it be facilities that generate more gold, food, magic, resources, or perhaps even a training grounds for your soldiers.<br />\nBattles<br />\nInvade the country governed by the goddesses, subjugate their capital city, and capture the goddesses!<br />\nBuild your forces and capture enemy territory before finally launching an assault on the capital city in order to take over the goddess&#39; nation!<br />\nIntimacy/Corruption<br />\nFriendship, or domination?<br />\nWill you befriend the captured goddesses, or will you corrupt them, turning them into loyal servants who answer to your every whim?<br />\nCorrupt the virtuous, gallant goddesses into depravity, and they will become a stronger and more loyal pawn.<br />\nIf you want a goddess that specializes in battle, you can even break the mind of a goddess, turning them into a mindless doll or even a battle-crazed berserker!<br />\nMilitary Preparation &amp; Unit Customisation<br />\nOutfit your subordinates with equipment, and raise them to become stronger!<br />\nForge unique &#39;medallions&#39; to gain access to more units!<br />\nThe type of medallions you can forge will change depending on the choices you make during the game, which in turn affects what units you can hire!<br />\nMedallions can also be used to apply titles to your units, which will either boost their status parameters or give them new skills!<br />\nThe higher the rarity of the medallion, the better the effect!
