{"id": 428601, "slug": "simple-farm", "name": "Simple Farm", "name_original": "Simple Farm", "description": "I\u2019ve been programming for a couple of years now. Nothing substantial, just a couple of apps and games that never reached any stores. One day, after a pretty long Stardew Valley binge, I wondered how hard it would be to make my own farming game. So I spent a couple hours making a crafting system that would allow seeds to be planted and for crops to grow over several days. I realized right away that manual farming was super boring if that was the only feature in the game, so I thought it would be fun to add some guns to help with harvesting. But guns needed enemies. Change after change grew this small prototype into an actually playable game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSimple Farm is a simple farming simulator made to eat a couple hours of your time. You harvest plants to make guns, and then use those guns to more effectively farm and defend your base against waves of enemies!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe original vision I had for the game is complete. I plan on continuing development for a while longer though to add some new ideas and features I've had and to optimize existing ones. I\u2019d love to hear any suggestions you have about the game and can\u2019t wait for you to play!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T03:25:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d49/d4907e2a7de341174046e37280622a22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Charmeager"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Charmeager"], "esrb_rating": null}
