Like their weaponry better? Just take it. Nothing can stop you.. As long as you escape before your ship overloads.</p>\n<p>Periodically activate and level up different traits to personalize your play-style in this 'roguelite' adventure.<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p><strong>Left joystick / WASD </strong>= Movement (Hold left or right + shoot to select traits)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>B / Spacebar </strong>= Shoot (Hold for autofire on some ships)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Y / Shift </strong>= Dash (Hold for longer)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>X / Control </strong>= Hold near another ship to transfer conscience. <em>...your previous host will expire...</em><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>-----Editor's notes:<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>21-02-2022:\u00a0Noticed all exports didn't work on resolutions smaller than\u00a04k.\u00a0The original 4k Windows and Linux\u00a0versions\u00a0were\u00a0the uploads for the jam,\u00a0but\u00a0I've changed the resolution for the\u00a0other downloads\u00a0so\u00a0you can actually play it.</strong></p>\n<p>Phew, what a rollercoaster. Decided to not overthink the gameplay and just go for it, but still scoped too big. Sorry story-mode, you'll have to wait your turn.<br/><br/>Made mainly with Godot + Blender (both recommend), all assets and all code written from scratch within 72h by me alone. ...If you couldn't tell by the singular space-ship model.</p>\n<p>Not very efficient, hence the lack of a working browser-export. Too many lights, too many particles, not enough time to optimize.<br/></p>\n<p>Each run is randomized at the start, though most of it tries to get away with fully randomizing values (with a maximum per level and linked to progression) by taking these random encounters and repeating them, as to create some familiar spaceships.</p>\n<p>Have had no time to fine-tune it either, I got sound in with 10 seconds on the clock and was shocked it worked on the second compilation, so all in all I've only played a single run of the game before uploading it here.<br/><br/>Any and all feedback welcome, here to learn!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T14:11:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/649/649860c5668178bf1685021f9db72864.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Supermuch"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
