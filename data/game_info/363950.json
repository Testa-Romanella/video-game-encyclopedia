Once the most lauded warrior of his kingdom, he now faces a grim fortune. After running into Severin the Hungry Wizard, he was turned into a living jelly, losing his human form and his shining armor.</p>\n<p>Armed only with sweet courage and wits, he must now climb to the top of the tower, defeat Severin, and get back his human body. While on his way, he'll have to face the wizard's lackeys, one-colored triangles that shoot projectiles at him and that have only one weakness!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>The Jelly Knight's Hidden Power</strong></p>\n<p>Juan may have lost his shining armor, but he gained a very special ability: he can <strong>absorb the color</strong> of a single bullet and gain its properties. Once he achieves this, he has the ability to <strong>shoot </strong>it back in any direction.</p>\n<p>\u00a0He is also subject to the absorbed color's strengths and weaknesses illustrated in the emblazoned shield knitted in the carpets within the tower:<br/></p>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Color Rules</strong></p>\n<ol><li>Beat enemies by targeting their <strong>one weakness</strong>:<ol><li><strong>\u00a0Red</strong> beats <strong>Green</strong>,\u00a0 which beats <strong>Blue</strong>, which beats <strong>Red</strong></li></ol></li></ol>\n<p>\u00a0 2. <strong>Block </strong>bullets whose color is the same as yours</p>\n<p>\u00a0 3. <strong>Reflect\u00a0</strong>bullets of colors weaker than yours (following the same weaknesses shown above)</p>\n<p>But be very careful, enemies are also subject to the same rules as you are. Don't let them get the better of you!</p>\n\n<p>This game is One of a kind -- a puzzle-action top-down shooter with mechanics inspired by the GMTK 2019 challenge \"Only One\":<br/></p>\n<p>- You can only absorb one color at a time</p>\n<p>- You can only shoot once after absorbing a color</p>\n<p>- Enemies only have one weakness (with a rock-paper-scissors relationship between red-green-blue).</p>\n<p>- Every level can be achieved in one single shot of a bullet</p>\n<p>- Featuring the Juan and only Jelly Knight!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:26:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5a/f5a6f76877f98447fa310710a61519cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Pablohrdz", "Rexus", "alvaroh"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
