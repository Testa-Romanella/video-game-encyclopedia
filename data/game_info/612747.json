Check out all the submissions to the jam at: https://itch.io/jam/go-godot-jam/entries<br/></p>\n<p>We are a two person team, we both contributed to the code and music, with one of us producing the art, all of which was made during the jam.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is a branching path, mouse-driven /touch-driven casual/puzzle game. On a successful run the branching paths will give you one of 48 different plants to put in your garden (high-score table) , which grows to accommodate \u00a0your collection. There are also plants added for unsuccessful runs, but you can dig up any plants you wish, however this may affect your unlock stats when you reload the garden. Some elements of the game are randomised such as obstacle placement, background elements, and colours.</p>\n<p>Notes: <br/>-If you want your garden to persist we recommend playing a native version as the web version will probably not save your progress (depending on cookies) however it should persist while you have the page loaded.<br/>-The game is designed to be played at 1080p, playing at lower resolutions may result in minor graphical glitches/imperfections. <br/>-Tested primarily on Linux.<br/></p>\n<p>We learnt a lot through making this game (and not just about plants :) ), we have been using Godot for over a year now but until this jam we hadn't used skeleton2Ds, particle effects, and click-masks, among others. <br/><br/>We interpreted the theme quite literally in terms of a plant growing, but we have been really interested to see other interpretations from those who have submitted before us, as well as the similar ones.<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to look at our entry.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T09:15:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/017/017c29e138676288974bc37025ea0abc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["PinguStoleMyUsername"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
