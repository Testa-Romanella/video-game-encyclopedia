It is what buys you buildings and labour.LabourYou will need to hire:<br/><ul><li> Irrigation Workers<br/></li><li> Farmers<br/></li><li> Household Servants<br/></li><li> Builders</li></ul><br/>All of these workers will go about their lives autonomously, in one massive and unparalleled crowd simulation that can grow into a force of thousands of workers.<br/><br/>But for the impatient Imhoteps among you: you can speed things along by picking up individual workers and place them back anywhere in the world.Buildings<ul><li> Farms are the backbone of your civilization. They require irrigation, and provide grain.<br/></li><li> Bakeries will turn grain into food.<br/></li><li> Tax offices will take the surplus food and provide the project with much needed silver.<br/></li><li> Huts are required to shelter your workers when they become exhausted. Food is distributed to them.</li></ul>WarningThis game uses the latest AVX CPU technology to simulate the crowd.<br/>This means you need a recent computer to run this game.<br/>Intel Sandy Bridge or newer, or AMD Bulldozer or newer.<br/>Check your CPU first for AVX support, before buying. Thank you!<br/>(It also requires an up-to-date OpenGL driver -- v3.2 or higher.)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:10:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df2/df2f7526c97d1e8aedb0851813606573.jpg", "website": "http://stolk.org/imhotep/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 7, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Game Studio Abraham Stolk"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Game Studio Abraham Stolk"], "esrb_rating": null}
