As the dice land, they spawn different enemies or powerups depending on the face they land on.\u00a0<br/></p><p><strong>The controls are:</strong></p><ul><li>WASD - Movement</li><li>Shift - Dash</li><li>Left Click - Attack</li><li>Space - Jump / Double Jump</li></ul><p><strong>What the Dice will do:</strong></p><ol><li>Spawn a Healing power up, grants 25 HP not exceeding the cap (green cone)</li><li>Spawn a Damage power up, grants a permanent +1 damage buff (metalic cone)</li><li>Spawns a weak but fast enemy, only takes one hit to kill</li><li>Spawns a less weak but slower enemy, takes two hits to kill</li><li>Spawns a stronger enemy slow, all enemies from then on spawn with more health</li><li>Spawns the strongest enemy, all enemies from then on have more damage on their attacks.</li></ol><p>After all enemies are killed the dice will roll again, and in case you don't see them falling from the sky, once a die has finished rolling, it will ding as it turns itself into either a tool or a foe.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><strong>Your Abilities:\u00a0</strong></p><p>Your dash has 3 charges, gaining another charge every 2 seconds, this dash goes wherever your character is facing, it will also go up some ledges your jump won't quite reach. Your attack has a 0.75-second cooldown, summoning a fireball towards where the camera is facing, damaging enemies if it collides.\u00a0 You can direct your attacks to an enemy while running away or circling the slower ones to kite them. Beware their differing speeds, however.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Enemy Abilities:</strong><br/></p><p>As the enemy gets close they will summon an \"Orb of Destruction\" in your face, damaging you. Enemies will attempt to get to you using their Heelys but cannot jump or dash. Use the terrain to your advantage.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Due to time constraints and a new engine, we did not get dying or quitting implemented properly. As such you can play indefinitely however you have \"lost\" when your health bar has no green in it. Additionally, closing the game is only possible through Alt +F4 at this time.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T00:16:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6f/e6f71e11a21b0db554b4e2dae0fcf881.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Liam Crowley"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
