This is the first game that I have ever finished and put out onto the web. This Game is about a village whose music festival was ruined by an evil thief who steals all of the instruments. He attaches bombs to all of them and hides them in various locations(only one level in build). It is up to the player to get the instruments back and defuse the bombs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T06:30:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ee/8eee37203ad38c7bdbbae46b03f8c99f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Huntoebot"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
