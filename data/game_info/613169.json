{"id": 613169, "slug": "airlocked-2", "name": "Airlocked!", "name_original": "Airlocked!", "description": "<p>Welcome to Airlocked! You'll take on the role of the last crewman of USS Arkenfeld, which has been infested with Aliens! Doors are active when they are green. Click to open, and directional arrows will appear for movement. The yellow boxes are junction boxes, which take power from the Reactor Core. If they get damaged by aliens you'll have to go out and click on them to repair them. The airlock is the big door on the bottom right. And the security console in the bottom left (next to the reactor) \u00a0will give you remote access to all the doors (as long as they still have power!). <br/></p>\n<p>Good luck, Captain!</p>\n\n<p>This game was created for the Make A Game Game Jam, with the theme of \"Connected\". This theme exists twice in our game: you can only flush out all the aliens at once if they are all connected, and you have to keep the power connected to the doors in order for them to work. Enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T11:05:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bc/6bc70aee2bbd4dc41a81ee182769de85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["godswearhats"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
