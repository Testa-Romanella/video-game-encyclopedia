An APK is in the process of being made, and is what the game is intended to be played on.</p>Credits.<p>Developers -\u00a0SourlessCream</p><p>Music -\u00a0TheFlamingDuelist</p>\r\nI hope you enjoy this short experience.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T09:42:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a72/a726eca5f7dcf336e0b1369da866d90c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SourlessCream"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
