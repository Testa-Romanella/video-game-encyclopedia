They're greatly outnumbered, but\u00a0they have a secret weapon:\u00a0you. Attack the invaders with divine\u00a0lightning strikes by clicking on them. The lightnings have a 2\u00bd seconds cooldown, but they can kill multiple enemies if you hit them right.</p><p>Try to make it through as many waves of enemies as you can before your people get overwhelmed.</p><p>Good luck!</p><p>Developer's notes:<br/>This is a simple game I made\u00a0for the first Bevy Jam. Assets are self-made, and the only plugin I used apart from Bevy's defaults\u00a0is bevy_rapier2d for the physics and lightning hit testing.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T08:04:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7c/d7c9acc241ce0cb12b7f26aeae07f8c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Oceantume"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
