{"id": 614816, "slug": "centipede-channel-f", "name": "Centipede - Channel F", "name_original": "Centipede - Channel F", "description": "<p>Port of the classic arcade game Centipede for the Fairchild Channel F console, which was ground-breaking when released in 1976 before being somewhat overshadowed by the release of the Atari 2600.<br/></p>\n<p>Despite its quirks it's an enjoyable machine to develop for, with a lot less of a learning curve than the 2600 with its TIA and the need to redraw the screen manually every frame. This just has a 102 x 58 screen that you plot pixels to - and they bloody well stay there!</p>\n<p>For detailed rules and instructions on how to play, see this guide:\u00a0https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/10/17/arcade-smash-hits-general-faq-455360</p>\n<p>The basic idea is to shoot and avoid the centipede, as well as other enemies such as spiders, fleas and\u00a0scorpions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When a centipede hits a mushroom, he will drop down one row and turn around.</p>\n<p>When you shoot a centipede, he will split and the second part will generate a new head. Shooting the head scores more points than the body.</p>\n<p>Mushrooms can be poisoned (turned blue) by the scorpion and will cause the centipede to dive straight for the bottom of the screen.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T08:54:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e57/e5767e124fe401a8088e38cc07455a19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arlasoft"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
