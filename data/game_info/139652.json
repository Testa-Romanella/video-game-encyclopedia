The wizards must run jump, dodge, and make it to the door hidden behind various platforms and traps that must be traversed if they want to win. The necromancer must stop the wizards reaching the door by activating traps and casting fiendish spells to send the players right back to the start. Once a wizard makes it to the door the round is over, that wizard gets a point and they are the necromancer for the next round. The first player to three wins is the victor.</p>\n<p>The game is played with four Xbox 360 controllers.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e46/e46cf147196a6070ada67ae220a8ceb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Grundy Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
