The tracking also works best in good lighting conditions but because it's designed to work with only one camera it does still have some issues.</p>\n\n<p>Mostly Safe Bunker is a simple resource management game\u00a0where you push buttons to generate resources and gather enough that you can focus on making a cure to a disease affecting the world. This game was made in 2 days for the Stay Safe Jam and there's a lot that I would like to change to improve it(I\u00a0might make a better version in the future with more time to work on it.) I wanted to have this on pc too but for some reason it wont work, i've\u00a0spent 4 and half hours trying to figure out why and made no progress, so maybe I'll add that later if I\u00a0find a way to fix it. The android version is, to my knowledge the first mobile vr game that has 6 degrees of freedom without extra hardware but please correct me if thats wrong.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T03:55:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15e/15e6f962c65ec9c39b467de8b477efba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["SomethingDerpy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
