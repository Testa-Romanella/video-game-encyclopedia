Aside from just being a fangame, Blackmoon Prophecy is also a tribute to Final Fantasy in the sense that I'm trying to put together many of the things I loved about playing RPGs growing up into this game. It's a love letter to retro gaming and our childhoods.</p>\n<p><strong>How long is the game?</strong><br/>Most people seem to report 40-60 hours of play time.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there any impressive custom systems, impressive features, etc?</strong><br/>Long story short, no. The early Final Fantasy titles were not known to blow our minds with amazing features (FF3 and FF5 were really the only ones that did in my opinion, and only because of their job systems).<br/><br/>There is no steal command, \"throw\" items are selected by going to items and choosing the item to throw, and \"jump\" isn't a command, but rather several different abilities that have jumping animations.<br/><br/>As a result, Blackmoon Prophecy is just a retro romp that just tries to recreate what we all used to feel as we'd trudge through all of the caves and dungeons of the early Final Fantasy games.<br/><br/>The most advanced aspect of Blackmoon Prophecy's gameplay is a simplified version of Final Fantasy 8's weapon upgrading system. A few minigames can possibly be included as well (auction house, betting on chocobo races, etc.) but this game is kept simple to emulate the simple games it is inspired by.<br/><br/><strong>How many &lt;insert something here&gt; are there in this game?</strong><br/>Permanent Playable Characters: 12 (3 being optional/secret)<br/>Temporary Playable Characters: 2<br/>Equippable Items: 150+<br/>Mandatory Dungeons: 30+<br/>Monsters: 400+<br/>Playable Hours: 50+ (reportedly)<br/>Optional Dungeons: 10+<br/>Towns: 20+<br/>World Maps: 3</p>\n<p><strong>Are there any bugs or anything to watch for?</strong><br/>Absolutely. This is an old game that I finished in 2011 and has been available elsewhere online since then, and I\u00a0have stopped supporting/updating it as of 2019. Still, I know that there are people who play it and like it, so I'm bringing it to the itch.io crowd!</p>\n<p>Like this game?
