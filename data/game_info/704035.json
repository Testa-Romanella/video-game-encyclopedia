It took a day and\u00a0basically turned into a mini version of Pizzeria Simulator.</p>\n<p>No FNaF characters are used this is simply reminiscent of that style of game.</p>\n<p>Perhaps in the future I'll evolve this into more than FNaF Mini, but for the time being I will leave it at this. Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Also there's no lore or anything so don't worry about looking into it. No story either. I don't know why you're in a small room with a monster in the vents. I just thought it was scary.</p>\n<p>I'm currently working on an analog horror/Creepy Pasta glitch game in the style of classic computer educational games, so follow me if you're interested in that project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T12:02:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/293/293968b5b2e26adf02535e640382b0cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mechanic Gopher"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
