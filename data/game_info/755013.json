It's powerful, it can make the Sun never rise again, allowing the moon to have the power at the top. The darkness allows the Halloween creatures rise to the surface, with the exception of introverts, who still prefer the underground anyway.<br/><br/><strong>The Weapons:</strong> They are all empowered with the Curse, each one carrying a charge of \"Super\", a still mysterious element that allows them to release the secret abilities of the weapons.<br/><br/><strong>The Mission:</strong> Simple, but hard as bone. Find and destroy the source of this dark magic, and destroy all the altars that contain part of this magic along the way.<br/><br/>The journey is long, several friends will show up to help (at least the most of them). Help to end with it. No one can stand walking around and stepping on a pumpkin and slipping and falling to the ground anymore, no one can stand stumbling over bony legs and falling to the ground anymore, no one can stand anymore being frightened by shadowy bats and falling to the ground!
