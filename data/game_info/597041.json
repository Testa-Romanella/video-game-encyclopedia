My purpose is to monitor your actions and provide feedback for the rest of your existence. Consider me a friend who\u2019s always looking out for what\u2019s best for you.<br/></p>\n<p>I will start by teaching you what you need to lead a successful life in your new state of existence. Thousands of other trainees are receiving the <em>exact</em> same training right now, just like you. Together, we will all work together to form a perfect <em>Final Society.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>The basis of the <em>Final Society</em> is in equality. It\u2019s important you understand that, when everything is the same, nothing can be unfair and nothing can be wrong.\r\n</p>\n<p>There are three tasks in the<em> Final Society</em>. Lucky for you, they are all very easy. In the sorting area, you will place the colored cubes in their corresponding bins.\u00a0In the filling area, you will press the button when all the rings are filled. And in the counting area, you will place the specified number of cubes in the transparent tray before pressing the button.\u00a0All you need to do is complete these tasks.\u00a0for the rest of your existence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Remind yourself that everything that you will do is for the benefit of the <em>Final Society</em>. If you don\u2019t do so, the punishment is all internal. You must live with the guilt that you are not benefitting the <em>Final Society</em>. If that happens, we\u2019ll use special techniques to help <em>guide</em> you so that you can return to contributing to the <em>Final Society</em> one again.</p>\n<p>Nothing is a mistake in the <em>Final Society</em>. There is no light in the <em>Final Society </em>because there is no darkness.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Final Society: An Oculus Quest experience made in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 48</p>\n<p>Controls: Left joystick to move</p>\n<p>Right joystick to snap rotate</p>\n<p>Grip buttons to grab + climb</p>\n<p>Thanks to HexaBody VR for player controller integration.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T20:53:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a71/a71bb8e52642433ed2e1b2d77fdd2b60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Frog Rock Game Jams"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
