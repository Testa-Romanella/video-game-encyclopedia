You take on the role of a warrior monk, genetically upgraded and possessing psionic abilities. The in-game world is split by two forces that want to take the control over. You need to choose the side, however, you can\u2019t trust anyone, even your closest friends and teachers. The game has different endings depending on your choices.</p>\n<p>The protagonist is fully customizable. You can upgrade his abilities according to your style during non-linear missions and multiple quests. It\u2019s on you to focus either on stealth or pushing - as the character\u2019s body is mechanically enhanced, you can develop it any way you want. Moreover, you have \u201cnine lives\u201d: after the first nine deaths you will respawn immediately where you were killed, and only the tenth death will throw you back to the checkpoint.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-04T16:08:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c58/c588df86da16bf2f0432721b780cd5dd.jpg", "website": "http://eye.streumon-studio.com", "rating": 3.14, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 90, "owned": 1667, "beaten": 41, "toplay": 26, "dropped": 107, "playing": 6}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 100, "ratings_count": 199, "suggestions_count": 564, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 201, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Streum On Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Streum On Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
