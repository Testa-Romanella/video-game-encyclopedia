Unlock the powers of the Fates to build a stronger and increasingly beautiful world and face off with final Fates for the ultimate world-crumbling finale.Features<br/><ul><li>Easy to pick up and play casually, but also offers deep challenge for more strategic players.<br/></li><li>Handcrafted in-game pixel art, a soundtrack of symphony &amp; steam by composer Robby Duguay, and Twitter-shareable worlds!<br/></li><li> The powerful <strong>Book of Fate</strong> keeps track of your progress and chronicles your adventures!<br/></li><li> <strong>Two game modes</strong>\u2014test your world-building skills in timed cycles of creation and destruction under <strong>Ragnarosa and Fortuna's</strong> vigilant watch, or take your time and build up a world as large as you can at your own pace, under the calming influence of <strong>Serenity</strong>.<br/></li><li> <strong>Accessibility options</strong> cater to gamers with motor skill, cognitive and vision impairments.</li></ul>Accessibility Options Include:<br/><ul><li>Multiple control schemes, remappable keys and input options<br/>Design and colour palette are resistant to 3 types of colour blindness<br/></li><li>Advanced options for cursor speed, font size, game speed and more<br/></li><li>Separate volume controls for music and sound effects<br/></li><li>Full-screen and windowed modes<br/></li><li>All menus and screens have a half-second cooldown between inputs<br/></li><li>In-game hints and guidance for new players<br/></li><li>Assistive tile auto-rotate feature that learns your preferences<br/></li><li>Comprehensive save system featuring overview of progress, multiple save states per save file, and thumbnails for each save state for a quick visual reference of progress</li></ul>What they're saying about Fate Tectonics<br/>\u201cLast night, I decided to play Fate Tectonics [official site] for five minutes, just to get an idea about how its world-building puzzles worked. It was a long five minutes. Around an hour and a half, all told. (\u2026) It\u2019s rather good.\u201d\u2014ADAM SMITH, Rock Paper Shotgun<br/><br/>\u201cThe combination of strategy and puzzle solving is certainly unique and makes for a very addictive gameplay experience.\u201d\u2014GAMERAMBLE<br/><br/>\u201c(The game) allows players to derive meaningful satisfaction from creating expansive worlds one piece at a time. It\u2019s almost meditative\u00a0during the\u00a0early going. Then it starts to get a bit tricky.\u201d - CHAD SAPIEHA, Post Arcade (Financial Post)<br/><br/>\u201cI personally found that it brought back a sort of childlike joy that came from building things with blocks or legos as a kid, then destroying it all in a cathartic burst of destructive control.\u201d\u2014 ALEXX APLIN, Mod Vive.<br/><br/>\u201cMy main piece of advice is be willing to fail. It has some of the best game over gameplay since Sim City of old.\u201d\u2014CHRISTOPHER DEMELO, The Snarge.<br/><br/>\u201cThe strategic spin on a world-building game gives Fate Tectonics an added challenge many people won\u2019t expect.\u201d \u2014 CONOR BAILEY, The Spew.<br/><br/>\"If you play only one <strong>real-time polytheistic tile-placement world-building strategy puzzle game</strong>, make it this one!\"\u2014RAIGAN BURNS Metanet Software (N++)<br/><br/>\"Has all the joys of creating with all the pains of having it <strong>crumble away around you</strong>.\"\u2014JAMIE TUCKER, Asteroid Base (Lovers In A Dangerous Spacetime)<br/><br/>\"Fate Tectonics is a beguiling game; it lures us in with the <strong>cathartic pleasure of clicking together puzzle pieces</strong>. The satisfaction in snapping the precise piece into the perfect place is matched only by games like Carcassonne. That is until you realize that you are actually playing a precarious game of house of cards with three angry toddlers stomping about.\"\u2014JOHN Z.
