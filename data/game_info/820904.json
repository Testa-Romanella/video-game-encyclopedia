The direction keys in the keyboard control the Hand of God. You start with 3 health points, and lose one each time a dice passes through you. Each time you allow an apple to go through you restore one health point. Beware of the Wrath of God, as calamities plague mankind, and your ears, if your health is low.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Jaspior:\u00a0Art direction, Some polish and Story</p>\n<p>KeichTS:\u00a0Programing, Art and Testing</p>\n<p>JulioCastaway: Story, Level Design and Testing\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>Music and sound used:\r\n</p>\n<p>\"Dies Irae\" -\u00a0Breitkopf and Haertel (1880) Public Domain (CC0) No Attribution Required.
