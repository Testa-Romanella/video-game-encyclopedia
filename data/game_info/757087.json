Your construction space is quite limited.\u00a0You need to carefully plan your base layout.</p>\n<p>Your main building sell sombra for credits. Dependant buildings can produce and transport sombra. They relay a percentage of their accumulated sombra to their superior and eventually to the main building. Your dependant buildings can have their own dependant buildings and\u00a0so on. Mines produce the highest amount of sombra, but their placement is fairly limited. Sombra farms can only be built by harvesters. Transportation hubs enable\u00a0you to\u00a0have more dependants.</p>\n<p>If the clicking gets to tiresome, you can drag a building to\u00a0one of the buttons on the left side, to copy its entire hierarchy. You can then paste it with the\u00a0 associated number or by clicking the button. As of now, there is no possibility to edit your blueprints, though this is definitely planned.</p>\n<p>Join Discord to find out more!\r\nDiscord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/snqkAMyGwP\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>LMB = Select, Activate<br/>Mouse Scroll = Zoom<br/>Drag building to the left = Copy Blueprint<br/>1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 = Paste Blueprint<br/>U,E,M,T,F,H,P,I,S,N = Right Menu Hotkeys<br/></p>\n<p>R = Rotate Blueprint\r\n</p>\n<p>Have fun!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T08:05:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e8/5e891f7f05fe94f7274e49717edbba5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Korboh"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
