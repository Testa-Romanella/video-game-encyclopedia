{"id": 12687, "slug": "sunless-skies", "name": "Sunless Skies", "name_original": "Sunless Skies", "description": "<p>It is the dawn of the 20th century, and London has taken to the stars! As the captain of a spacefaring locomotive you&#39;ll behold wonders and battle cosmic abominations in the furthest heavens. Stake your claim. Fight to survive. Speak to storms. Murder a sun. Face judgement.<br />\nTen years have passed since Sunless Sea, and Queen Victoria has led an exodus from London to the heavens. There, a revitalised British Empire - ambitious and authoritarian - begins to expand across the skies.<br />\nThe stars are alive. They are the Judgements: vast intelligences that govern all things. But they are dying. One by one, something is snuffing them out, leaving their thrones empty. An opportunistic Victorian Empire is colonising the domains they leave behind, painting its industrial vision upon the fabric of the heavens.<br />\nTravel between distant ports, unravelling stories, bearing passengers and news, and trading in exotic celestial cargoes.<br />\nYour every foray into space is as precarious as a Polar expedition. You\u2019ll need to balance your resources carefully and keep an eye on your crew\u2019s Terror to avoid mutiny and death.<br />\nYour captain&#39;s actions could tip the precarious political balance of a region. Will you run guns for the Independents? Or spies for the Empire? Choose wisely \u2013 your decisions will affect the story; not just for yourself, but for your future captains as well.<br />\nLeave your mark on the universe, and be marked in return. When you are creating your captain, every decision is a story, and every story has a consequence.<br />\nEquip your vessel as you see fit. Would you benefit more from reinforced armour plating, or the additional manpower allowed by external crew pods? (&quot;Soundproof! Cosy! Detachable!&quot;)<br />\nIt is not safe in the skies. A captain will need to defend themselves against pirates, scorn-flukes, the Cyst of Faces, and worse.<br />\nRecruit a gallery of unpredictable characters to crew your locomotive as First Officer, Chief Engineer, Signaller, or Surgeon. Each brings their own skills and stories to your adventures.</p>", "metacritic": 87, "released": "2017-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-27T19:51:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2f/d2f5f87a6e6df6b988dac391605f0b60.jpg", "website": "http://www.failbettergames.com", "rating": 3.71, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 65, "owned": 993, "beaten": 10, "toplay": 49, "dropped": 21, "playing": 7}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 63, "ratings_count": 48, "suggestions_count": 210, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 48, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Failbetter Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Failbetter Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
