I'm more of an artist than a programmer. First time using Godot.)\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You made a promise to give her a proper burial. The border, or what's left of it anyway, is now overrun with monsters. Monsters that took her bones since it makes them stronger.... 8 stages with 8 bone-themed and empowered bosses to beat.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>(Except not really because I don't even have HP and damage coded yet, This is my first project using Godot. I like the idea and the designs I drew up though, so I want to finish this one.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Planned Features:\u00a0</p>\n<p>2-4 weapon types each with unique mobility options. Two attacks per weapon type (Standing Attack / Jump Attack)</p>\n<p>Each weapon type is effective against monsters of a certain type (or color) and killing them with said weapon type creates an effect.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Planned kill effects (for now):</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Blue enemy: Extra jump in the air\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Orange Enemy: Explosion</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Green Enemy: Projectile</p>\n\n\n<p>Made for My First Game Jam Summer 2022. There is not a lot of media set place here in South Texas, especially video games. Not much media depicting Hispanic culture either, so I want to reflect some of that through designs and locations. (The main villain is inspired by Dia de los muertos skeletons(Day of the dead) for example. One of the bosses is a chimera inspired by the megican flag, etc etc.)\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>BTW, I joined day before yesterday, so instead of two weeks I had two days.\u00a0\ud83d\ude28</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T18:26:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef5/ef5a7d1b6148892196adbf434a85f1bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eternal Summer"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
