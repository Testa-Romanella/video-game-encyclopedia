WIP! You can experience the prologue, and continue to explore the tavern after it. There is not much else to show just yet. <br/></p>\n\n<p>For Evelyn is not a happy story, but it\u2019s human and it dives deep into the underbelly of a fantasy world of Aura where things are about to go horribly wrong. The game will tell a story of two lovers, which will ultimately plunge the world into a state of chaos and war. With emotional backstories and a powerful, moving musical score, For Evelyn will draw the player in and refuse to let go.</p>\n<p>Twitter<br/></p>\n<p>Patreon<br/></p>\n<p>World Of Aura<br/></p>\n\n<p>Important Links<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T02:51:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9de/9de56705431dd2e07d451353b59678cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 367, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kisuarts"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
