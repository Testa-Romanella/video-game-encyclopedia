The accuracy of this account is dubious, twisted by trauma and the use of military prescribed stimulants. Gameplay will be intercut with comic book style panels to tell this story. <br/><br/>In terms of gameplay The American War is an old school style shooter. Stimulants will be a twist on the gameplay offering an opportunity to get an edge and recover health in combat while on the other hand blurring the lines between reality and visions. <br/><br/>There are collectables scattered throughout levels that will unlock historical information in the Museum based around what you experience.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-19T04:39:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0a/b0ae39873d96af39dc33fa4d4b4a2fef.jpg", "website": "https://www.poshtoffeegames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 463, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Posh Toffee Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Posh Toffee Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
