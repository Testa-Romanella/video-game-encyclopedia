Well, let me introduce you to Star Shooter! This game is a simple 2D shooter where the player is tasked with shooting endless waves of enemies and asteroids in hopes of achieving the highest score possible. It's great fun to compete with friends to see just how far you can go without being destroyed by the randomly generated obstacles\u00a0and trust me, you will. But not to worry! There may be endless waves of enemies but rest assured you have enough bullets to fill a Sarlacc Pit so get out there and earn some points!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T06:58:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/095/09534fa77bb627a9fbeb0bd648906e69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["introtogamesproduction"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
