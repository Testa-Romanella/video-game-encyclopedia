The experience, as well as the poems, explore the memories of the deceased residents of the small town of Spoon River.</p>\n<p>I built this experience in Unity from scratch over the course of a couple of months. All 3D assets, shaders, scripts and most 2D assets were made by me. I used Blender for modelling, Substance Painter and Designer for texturing, as well as the Adobe suite for graphic design.</p>\n<p>I am an (aspiring) 3D artist, not a programmer, game designer or literature expert, so this is more of a portfolio piece rather than a game with widespread appeal. However, I'll be very happy if you enjoy it for what it is!<br/><br/>More info, such as screens, assets and interactive models on my ArtStation page:<br/>https://www.artstation.com/subjectn<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T04:18:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67a/67af8e9855754cb080eb83529775bb2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 251, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lorenzo Drago"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
