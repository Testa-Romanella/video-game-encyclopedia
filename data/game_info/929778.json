It's the first game I've ever made and I dumped a lot of time into it. Had a lot of fun! I might develop it a little more after the jam is over. The game is very unpolished and far from what I wanted it to be. The game quite literally doesn't have an end because I didn't have the time nor energy to figure out how to do it. I have some other game ideas so there is no guarantee that I will update it.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T12:48:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9c/e9c002c179da820006bfa6458943e73f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Purnurpler"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
