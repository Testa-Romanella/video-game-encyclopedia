The game 'platform: Narios go through 10 levels, defeating enemies, jumping from one platform to another and finding 10 vials hidden.<br/>Indie! This game has an alternative to the platform: Narios when it arrives in a world can freely choose which of the three levels in the world do. You choose your way!<br/>Music! For Magic Legend we chose to put 5 tracks of the composer DylansMusic. The music you hear create the feeling of playing more to an RPG than a platform, but you will be surprised and delighted by these traces carefree that will accompany you in the game<br/>Final! Except for the L 0 (tutorial level) you have to collect the vials to free your people otherwise ...<br/>Enjoy with Magic Legend!
