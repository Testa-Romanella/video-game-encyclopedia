Unfortunately, you have no money on the card, so you decide to download it \"for free\" on some strange sites (xD).  You wait to the game fully loaded, and press the launch button.  But something goes wrong.  Instead of \"Press WASD to move\" you see \"Paid 200 dollars, to decrypt your drive\"........ You mentioned that your bitcoin wallet (with 7 bitcoins) password is far away in the root folder and you have no choice. You must decrypt folder by folder until you reach the text document with password.</p>\n<p>Control:<br/></p>\n<p>WASD - Move<br/>Space bar - Jump<br/>Esc - Pause menu</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Links:<br/></p>\n<p>GitHub -\u00a0https://github.com/dmytropohorol/RootOfWinDEV</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T07:13:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3b/d3bcd03b0ddadda053040ee8a3f603d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dmytropohorol"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
