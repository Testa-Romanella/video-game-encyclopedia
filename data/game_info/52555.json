{"id": 52555, "slug": "mr-dos-castle", "name": "Mr. Do's Castle", "name_original": "Mr. Do's Castle", "description": "<p>Mr. Do's Castle is an arcade game created by Universal in September 1983. The Asian title of the game is Mr. Do! versus Unicorns. Though marketed as a sequel to the original Mr. Do! released one year earlier, the game bears a far closer resemblance to Space Panic. It is the second of the Mr. Do series of video games, although it wasn't intended to be. It began life as a game called \"Knights vs. Unicorns\", but the U.S. division of Universal persuaded the Japanese arm to modify the graphics into a Mr. Do! game, taking into account the first game's popularity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1983-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ef/3ef2f471d0a3cf7dbe8c9a0049702c85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 243, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Atari 8-bit", "Atari 2600", "Atari 5200", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Universal Entertainment", "Universal"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Universal"], "esrb_rating": null}
