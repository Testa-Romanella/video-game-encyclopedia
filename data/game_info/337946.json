Have fun while playing with simulated fluid!</p>\n<p>Why the game is getting harder and harder?</p>\n<p>Well,\u00a0 in real world the water sources are drying really fast, oftentimes before soaking deep into the ground. Meanwhile, the underground water is a source of water for people. We can't treat it as an unlimited source. Due to global warming and increasing (at an alarming rate) consumption,\u00a0sources are insufficient.
