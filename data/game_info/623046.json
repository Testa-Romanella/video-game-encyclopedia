It is known as Acu energy.\r\n</p>\n<p>Once, humans learned the art of charging themselves with this \u201caccumulation energy\u201d allowing them to make use of it in many ways. The strongest were able to learn the Acu (the martial art of accumulation) and were known in the world as Acu warriors.\r\n</p>\n<p>Our story takes place in the futuristic megalopolis named Heart-City. A city-state that leads the world with its knowledge of the accumulation technology. When Humanity started to rely on technology, progressively most of the world population \u2018strangely\u2019 lost the ability to use Acu energy.\u00a0\r\nA few Acu warriors remain, they are known as the suburbs leaders of Heart City. They are employed by the city to fight each other in tournaments to \u201ccharge\u201d the batteries of Heart City. This energy is then sold to the citizens of every district. </p>\n\n\n<p>\u250a<strong><em>Producer</em></strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u250a <strong><em>Lead Artist</em></strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u25ab\u00a0 \u00a0Nicolas Villard\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25ab\u00a0\u00a0Alexandre Roblin\u00a0 \u00a0-\u250a <strong>Assistant Producer</strong>\u00a0<em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-</em>\u250a\u00a0<strong>Artist 3D</strong><em>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</em><br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u25ab\u00a0 \u00a0Guillaume Moge\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u25ab\u00a0\u00a0Martin Arribard</p>\n<p>---------------------------------\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 --------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>\u250a<strong><em>Lead Programmer</em></strong>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u250a <em><strong>Lead Game Design</strong>\u00a0</em>\u00a0\u00a0 <br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u25ab\u00a0 Clarence Berard\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u25ab\u00a0\u00a0Damien Salgueira<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 -\u250a <strong>Programmer</strong>\u00a0 <em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -</em>\u250a\u00a0<strong>Game Designer\u00a0</strong>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25ab\u00a0 Nam Mirbeau-Baudin\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u25ab\u00a0\u00a0Aymeric Mullot\u00a0<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u25ab\u00a0David Duhem\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u25ab\u00a0Lucas Sanchez\u00a0<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u25ab\u00a0Nicolas Rog\u00e9\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u25ab\u00a0Elo\u00efse Gur</p>\n<p>---------------------------------\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 --------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>\u250a<em>\u00a0<strong>Lead Sound Design</strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </em>\u250a<em><strong>Support Extern GD</strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/></em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u25ab\u00a0 Rapha\u00ebl Monnin\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u25ab\u00a0\u00a0Robin\u00a0Psaila <br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 -\u250a <strong>Sound Designer</strong>\u00a0<em> \u00a0</em>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u25ab\u00a0 Nicolas Sanchez</p>\n<p><strong>---------------------------------\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 --------------------------------------------</strong></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\u250a<strong><em>Music composed\u00a0</em></strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u25ab\u00a0 Phonograph &amp;
