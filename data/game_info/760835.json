It is based on a Udemy course I took for Game Maker Studio2. I just wanted to practice setting up an itch.io account and uploading a project. I know it is not much but it is my first finished game so I figured why not let's go ahead and put it up there!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Comments are appreciated and donations are as well. I am currently working on my first platformer and should have that out soon on here for all of you to try! Questions? Concerns?
