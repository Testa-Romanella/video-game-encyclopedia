With constant potion requests coming in, Heidi must help Munah, the witch, complete orders in a timely manner. Accept orders, read the potion book to learn recipes and venture out into the forest to collect potion ingredients. Add ingredients to the cauldron to craft potions and store extra ingredients in storage chests. Crafted potions must be placed into the potion crate to be delivered before time is up or Heidi will be confined to a locked cage while the disappointed Munah does the errands herself. Each potion has unique effects so once orders are complete and potions delivered, see what your customers thought and the outcome of consumption. Be careful what you witch for!</p>\n<p>This game was developed in approximately one month as my personal project in Code Coven's IGM with Unreal Engine '22.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T08:13:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/535/535dc0403a057b254d02dec4ed004a57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SkimBlu"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
