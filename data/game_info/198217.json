Move your employees around like you would in a tactics game to manage your office. Don't let the work pile up, or your boss will fire you. Gather around the water cooler to give your employees some rest, otherwise they may quit.</p>\n<p><strong>Theme</strong></p>\n<p>It doesn't perfectly match the theme, but it is a combination of two genres: tactics and management/sim.</p>\n<p><strong>Regrets</strong></p>\n<p>The art took way longer for me to make than expected. This led to a crunch at the end. I wasn't able to put in a proper tutorial, and given the complicated nature of the game one is needed. If it is too hard to understand, then maybe I'll make a tutorial video.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88e/88ec62040236e376e016b000ccd5a38c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tallshrimp"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
