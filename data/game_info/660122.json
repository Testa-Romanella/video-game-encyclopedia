Moving the mouse lets you select a square group of 4 tiles, and clicking will rotate them 90 degrees. Using only this rotation mechanic, the idea is to match four equal tiles, which have to correspond with the one portrayed in the order slot (located at the left of the screen). If you succeed, you'll gain points and increase your multiplier. If you match a different food, you'll get less points and lose your multiplier.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>MOUSE 1 </strong>to rotate tiles <strong>Clockwise</strong></li><li><strong>MOUSE 2</strong> to rotate tiles <strong>Counter-Clockwise</strong></li><li><strong>M </strong>to<strong> d</strong>isable/enable music</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0That's all you need to know.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T16:16:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f26/f267d64d283908431aea8013d8a9c352.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tonz Guy"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
