(GameMaker being 20 years old)<br/>I guess I finished the game in under 20 hours as well but that is purely coincidental.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Description:</strong><br/>Birthday Boy is a semi turn based platformer where you play as a hungry gremlin and every day is your birthday.<br/>His sole purpose in life is to eat cake and you must help him do so.<br/>Navigate through 20 levels with your goal being: eat the cake.<br/>Good luck.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong><br/>Every time you move, time advances.<br/>You get 2 seconds to think between key presses, if you don't make a move within these two seconds, time will advance.</p>\n<p>You have 20 life points and every third key press decreases your life by 1.<br/>You can advance time by pressing space, this will not count as a key press.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>Left / Right Arrows = Move<br/>Up Arrow = Jump<br/>Space = Advance Time<br/>R = Restart<br/>Enter = Pause</p>\n<p>If you get stuck you can skip the level by pressing \"P\", note that this could break things.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T07:37:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e54/e54ff8f4f2379c9df4c999ff1978eb19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Apapappa"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
