Combined you get a lot of really jarring mood shifts though, since the two rely on much different pacing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I tried to reflect this in the graphics and the music -- the text based CYOA breaks are more stripped down and bare, with relaxing music, and the more twitch reflex based 2D platforming elements are busy and have more upbeat music. Graphics aren't anything magnificent obviously, but they fit well with the game as a whole.</p>\n<p>Hope you all like it!</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Move - WASD/Arrows</p>\n<p>Jump - Spacebar</p>\n<p>Skip dialog - Enter</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/442/442259f2b313f46b69ef9158693932a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Ben Busby"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
