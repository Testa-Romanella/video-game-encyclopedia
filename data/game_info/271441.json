Wanted to get the mechanics for something down so i could work further on art and story.</p>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>arrow keys: move</p>\n<p>during battle: B is shoot and spacebar is jump! Hit space again while in mid air to use foot rockets to float! Sometimes if you fall onto the side of a wall you will \"grapple\" it, and can like ricochet yourself high into the air! This is ACTUALLY A BUG but I am thinking of just making it a \"cool character ability\"</p>\n<p>Things that need work:</p>\n<p>some of the text doesnt show up (there is supposed to be a \"press any key\" sign on the title screen, a \"game over\" on the \"game over screen\",\u00a0and a \"you won! press any key to restart\" on the pink ending screen.</p>\n<p>Walls: Character cant go along walls, gets stuck, but if you just go backwards you will get unstuck.</p>\n<p>Walking animation: character walks when still and is still while moving. This is fine during the \"overworld map\", but needs to change during \"battles\"</p>\n<p>obviously I need a lesson on level design as well.</p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>\n<p>&lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f1/7f1095279702c510e15aa77e1b64c3b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ruune"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
