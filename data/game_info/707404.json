I had planned to implement Sorry! into this as well, but Sorry has about as many rules as all the rest of the games put together. Might come back to add it later, as I\u00a0had some cool puzzles in mind with it, and it would make the number pieces more useful. Probably won't, though, since I think the next game I would make like this would be Proper Chess, which itself will probably be on the shelf for a few years until\u00a0I'm better at programming architecture.</p>\n<p>V1.1 - December 6 2021 - Small update to make the earlier levels clearer thanks to my friends' feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T09:11:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79c/79cb6c4533f2001a46d80ff3b6166280.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Airtoum"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
