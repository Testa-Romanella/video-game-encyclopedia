This Twine game attempts to address both these questions by placing you at the helm of an unknown, untested, potentially unreliable virtual assistant who really wants to win an election for you--often asking for your input along the way. The challenge of controlling a narrative that is fictional even within the world of a story\u00a0to manipulate a\u00a0presidential candidate hopefully heightens your awareness of the effects of your choices on how a tale is told.</p>\n<p>There is some light satirizing/venting about political process and media influence. Any resemblance to real life is only meant to be in the broadest possible sense.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-10T03:44:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/759/75973a16188c7c98feadbaa489ad26d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["deathandtaxes"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
