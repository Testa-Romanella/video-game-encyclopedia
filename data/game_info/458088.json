You do this with three different types of weapons: a rock, a paper sword or a shrunken.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Due to an engine bug, the game has\u00a0 a random chance to crash when advancing to the next level. If you're lucky, you can do 1 or 2 levels until it does so. With enough tries, you can finish it, so it's actually a feature meant to increase replayability.</strong></p>\n<p>Only windows is supported, but if you go to the GitHub (https://github.com/The-8-Bit-Developers/Ninja-Quest), you can compile from source and run it on MacOS or Linux.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls are WASD as well as 1, 2, and 3 to select weapon. Left click throws weapon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T03:18:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f20/f20017f3f3120caf51aed5a026c77b6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["8BitDevelopers"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
