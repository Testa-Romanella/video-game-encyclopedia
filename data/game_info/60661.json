Fortunately, you have an absurdly overpowered dash move and a stun cannon to help you out.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Fast paced and satisfying combat<br/>\r\n- Campaign Mode features 30 levels with varied enemy encounters (and a few bosses...)<br/>\r\n- See how long you can survive against endless waves of enemies in multiple Infinite modes<br/>\r\n- Intense difficulty that forces you to turn off your brain and meditate<br/>\r\n- No time wasted on that \"story\" nonsense. We both know you don't care what political-romantic intrigue caused this state of affairs.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhile most top-down arcade shooters have you running away from enemies while shooting towards them, Itsy Blitzy is all about closing the distance to your enemies as quickly as possible.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c7/4c7922269a098e29720b7f432680ed02.jpg", "website": "https://itsyblitzy.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Minty Soul Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Minty Soul Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
