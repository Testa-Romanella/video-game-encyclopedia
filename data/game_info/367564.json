It is located in the central region and surrounded by the bloodthirsty Martia Kingdom (formerly the Martia Tribes) in the north, the deceptively powerful Amazail Kingdom in the south, and the unpredictable House Lagidis in the west.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tEach year, the vassal factions must pay a tribute with gifts, weapons, women, and gold to Zenman Empire.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIts capital city, Zalumi, has been protected by the four most powerful noble families. Those four families are the \t<em>Sutherlands</em>, the Pantelakos, the Totens, and the Rileys.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOne morning, Leonardo, the only child of the Sutherlands, was nowhere to be found. His mysterious disappearance shocked the nation.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMeanwhile, in the north, Martia Kingdom has been staring at Zalumi for years. The Amazailians are also lurking around from the south.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBoth are growing tired of being a vassal nation. They are tiring of paying tributes to Zenman Empire.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThey have been watching Zalumi like a hawk, waiting for a chance to take action.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSources from Iron Eagle, the mysterious organization from Zuda Kingdom, revealed that Martia and Amazail have been trying to form an alliance.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe once great Zenman Empire is suddenly facing two big threats from the north and south.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\tCharacteristics and Features\r\n\r\n<ul><li>\r\n\tZelda-like jump, slash bushes, find secret treasures, explore hidden areas.\r\n</li><li>\r\n\tFinal Fantasy-like battle system, but with visible enemies.
