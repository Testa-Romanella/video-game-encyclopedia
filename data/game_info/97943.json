Sometimes you need to talk to a stranger.</em></p><p>It's the same thing every day. Yuiri feels doomed to repeat her monotonous life over and over. Her few hours in her karaoke box are all that she has to look forward to. Little does she know, Takehiro, a cashier for the karaoke rooms, feels the same way.</p><p>The game isn't meant to be exciting or filled with huge dramatic moments, it's meant to just show two people interacting. Two people who might not be so unlike yourself.
