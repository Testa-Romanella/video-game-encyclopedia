Defend the lab with a handful of remaining survivors while your scientists desperately try to finish the research on an experimental teleporter.</p>\n<p>The animals seem to have been made sick from radiation of a new metal, Recondite which has made a poor showing in biological testing. When it comes to making turrets however, it's worked brilliantly!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Quickly set your engineers to start building towers in choke points\u00a0to defend and pull the team back to safety. Have your scientists find old blueprints and finish up research in a safe spot and keep your soldiers near the front line to keep up your defense. With any luck you'll all make it out alive, as long as you can research and build the teleporter, just be quick!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T05:59:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f22/f22699589af342113d5bf2901ff8cdf2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["James Duran"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
