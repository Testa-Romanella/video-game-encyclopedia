The game features a girl who has had so much fun playing in the snow that she lost track of time\u00a0and where she was, and must now return home. She must use the snowy environment to her advantage and reach the end of each level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Snow Home was made in Unreal Engine.\u00a0The core mechanic of Snow Home is the ability to create snowballs that the player can push around the level. When pushed on snow, they grow allowing the player to position them in places that help them reach the end of the level. Snowballs can be used to reach an area previously inaccessible or cross treacherous water.\u00a0Snow Home is just a prototype of a game that could be easily expanded upon to include more levels and mechanics. This game was made as part of my University Module 'Dynamic Gameplay Programming'.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T08:06:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04c/04c497d227f922eeffa64c9e477b57cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Abi Sanders"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
