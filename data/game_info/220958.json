POP STREAM\u2122 combines both into a team versus team trivia competition! Your tablet streams the big-screen scenes and trivia, while the interactive buzz-in game board (required; sold separately) brings the action into your home. POP STREAM\u2122 can add \u201cpop\u201d to your next party! <br/><br/>Watch Real Movie Clips<br/>Unlike other movie trivia board games, POP STREAM\u2122 delivers clips, stills and posters from your favorite Hollywood movies. Watch and relive your favorite movie moments, then test yourself on your movie knowledge. You never know what movie will pop up next!<br/><br/>\u201cBuzz-In\u201d Team Action!<br/>It\u2019s easy to set up your tablet and game board (required; sold separately), just let the app guide you. And when you\u2019re ready to play, the in-app Game Show Host does all the work: Playing the clips, reading the questions, and keeping score. All you have to do is guess the answers!<br/><br/>Put Yourself in the Game<br/>With POP STREAM\u2122, you don\u2019t just play the game \u2014 you become part of it! Split into two teams, pick your team name (or let the game choose one for you), then take a selfie. Watch yourself and your teammates appear onscreen in your favorite movie scenes and stills!<br/><br/>Bet Big or Go Home<br/>Hit the buzzer first, and your team gets to wager on an answer. Bet big if you\u2019re sure you know the answer. If you guess wrong, the other team gets a shot at the question. Or you can pass the question to the other team, if you think they don\u2019t know. But be careful! When you pass, the other team\u2019s wager automatically doubles, so they could win big!<br/><br/><br/><br/>How Does It Work?<br/>The app uses your tablet\u2019s camera to \u201csee\u201d who buzzed in first, what they answered and how much they wagered. No batteries or Bluetooth required! <br/><br/><br/>Prove Who\u2019s the Biggest Movie Buff!<br/>The Game Show Host keeps track of the score and declares the winner. It takes fast<br/>hands, a sharp eye, and a cool head to win! POP STREAM\u2122 is intended for two to eight players (in two teams). POP STREAM\u2122 includes content from PG-13 and R-rated movies and is intended to be played by Adults.<br/><br/><br/>What Do I Need to Play?<br/>To use the POP STREAM\u2122 app, you\u2019ll need to purchase the POP STREAM\u2122 board game (sold separately at most mass retailers and online).
