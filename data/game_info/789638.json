Join forces with the froggy-themed friends in the cockpit of their giant mecha as they battle both the city's demons and their inner ones as well. They're froggy teens with attitudes- and anxiety! Take on the important role of leader to highfive, fistbump, and hype your friends up to victory! Leaving a teammate hanging for a high-five could mean literal disaster for the citizens of Pondopolis, and even worse- social embarrassment for your friend!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Players will need to pay close attention to the visual and verbal social cues of their teammates during battle to provide specific and timely support to raise their Friendship Power meter to unleash a Super Froggy Special Move to end the battle against KingFisher! The support action the player must perform will depend on the teammate's social cue. Did a teammate raise their\u00a0hand to you for a high-five? Don't leave them hanging!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Art / Director - DaddyDemus#1374</p>\n<p>Coding -\u00a0Fort3x#5419,\u00a0Boy#4656</p>\n<p>Music - SavestateCorrupted#3433\u00a0BandCamp\u00a0/\u00a0Itch.io\u00a0/\u00a0Twitter</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T23:19:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe9/fe95f06b0376598e9305698047ae6068.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["SavestateCorrupted", "Boy", "demus", "ChriztiUit"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
