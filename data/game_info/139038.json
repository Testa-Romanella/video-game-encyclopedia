Once both players complete setting up and are fully equipped, the game changes to Fight Phase, where each player will use their Socket modules to observe, plan, and intercept the other robot's moves.As the battle continues, players juggle their resources, detect their opponent's actions, and use weapons to counter attack and blow their opponent to kingdom come.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e27/e278ee81f291908f8962b595633b4d09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Munro"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
