As you pass through scenes, you will find items that open up new options and encounter characters like the arsonist and the assassin.</p>\n<p>Each run will result in one of 21 possible endings. The game is highly replayable and I encourage replaying it many times to see how many different endings you can get. It also features a cross-game storyline with time travel, elementals, and an alternate dimension. This storyline unlocks new items, characters, scenes, and endings; most notably, the True Ending.</p>\r\nDevelopment\r\n<p>This was a university project\u00a0developed over the course of 3 months in Processing. Scenes were rendered in Blender, pixel art was made in Aseprite, and sound effects were made in Logic Pro (mostly with Massive) . It was primarily inspired by dungeon crawlers and <em>Ape Out</em>.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T18:52:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e3/7e3a5893e39d856462de72e068b0f42e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Elliot George Mann"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
