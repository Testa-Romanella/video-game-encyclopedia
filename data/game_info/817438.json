Everybody in this world has his own experience with this type of game - \u00abThere is a rat and a cheese. You must find cheese in this labyrinth, cool?\u00bb. But here you don\u2019t have any cheese in the end. You only get vengeance at the end. Sure, if you were moving fast enough. Clock\u2019s ticking. Tick Tock. Tick Tock. Tick Tock. BOOM!\u00a0</p>\n<p>He-he, this would be too easy, yeah? There are colourful doors. For every one of them you have to sacrifice your brothers. Of course, the colour of the doors matches the colour of the belts, so do the right choice. And always remember the timers, which have their own time. Stay focused and hurry up, you dirty little rat!</p>\n<p>How to move? AWSD\u00a0</p>\n<p>How to act?
