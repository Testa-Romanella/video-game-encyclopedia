I am by no means a developer but I tried to get the idea in my head into a visual format.</p>\n<p>I plan to complete the full game but it will be a much larger world. I am heavily inspired by resident evil 4. You will be trapped in the Inbetween ( void , limbo\u00a0), where you have to search for the lost boy. In this world will be many horrors and puzzles to face.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T09:12:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a7/9a7f8963676f6ba5f9811ca2e1d94f9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Philip"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
