Justice has fantastic tools for overwhelming, constantly hurling his boomerang shield and backing you into a gravity bomb to set up for a kill.<br/><br/><br/>Maxameleon gains the advantage slowly but surely. He can negate attacks while outliving his opponent as they weaken from his poison.<br/><br/><br/>To master Zandra, perfect spacing is a must. The tip of her sword is especially deadly; swift and accurate combos allow Zandra to dominate the arena.<br/><br/>Discover more characters in game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Metagalactic Blitz is a top-down physics based fighting game. Everyone shares some main dodgeball mechanics (throwing, dashing, and reflecting) and each character also has 3 powerful abilities unique to them.<br/><br/>Throwing<br/><br/><br/>Dashing/Catching<br/><br/><br/>Reflecting<br/><br/><br/>Zomborg will be our example for abilities. He's a slow bruiser with an arm cannon. If his opponent is close, he can fire a shotgun to rack up damage.<br/><br/><br/>Or, he can combo with his magnet pull for a point blank shotgun.<br/><br/><br/>He can use these tools to zone the other player, by guarding the dodgeballs to gain the advantage.<br/><br/><br/>If you didn't catch that, abilities require 1 power to use, which is gained from picking up a dodgeball. The balls are central to offense.<br/><br/>If his opponent is good at staying out of range, Zomborg can utilize his laser that charges passively over time to root them out.<br/><br/><br/>As more damage is dealt, players are knocked back farther. Knocking them off the stage will eliminate them.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T17:05:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35e/35e64b3887a33a3ddb15fefeb8863fd3.jpg", "website": "http://www.pixelvex.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 119}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 40, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 260, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pixelvex"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pixelvex"], "esrb_rating": null}
