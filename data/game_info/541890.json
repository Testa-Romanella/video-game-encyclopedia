So I have prepared for you an Arkanoid game in space style! This is a mini-game with only 1 level. It won't take you more than 15 minutes to complete it. All the sprites are hand-drawn (although I'm not an artist), and it also has one boss! If you want to support me, buy my game, and then maybe I'll keep working on it!</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to earn 3000 points, either break 170 blocks or shoot down 10 aliens. At the end of the game, you will have a boss fight!</p>\n<p>Control\u00a0</p>\n<p>A - Left</p>\n<p>D - Right</p>\n<p>If you have ammo on the Shift button you can shoot</p>\n<p>Thanks for the music\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://nicolemariet.itch.io/<br/></p>\n\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T05:02:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/435/43523ca3bf790135902c6a76d9326804.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OffSide"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
