{"id": 478395, "slug": "crystallia", "name": "Crystallia", "name_original": "Crystallia", "description": "<p>Designed for Brackeys Jam 2020.2, this game is about manipulating time to prevent corruption from spreading across the world. Place buildings, drill, and terraform the landscape to unearth new resources with the end goal of stopping the dark towers from unleashing their pox. If you get in over your head, the magic of the crystal allows you to return to more bountiful days -- but at what cost?</p>\n<p>Players have asked for a better tutorial -- now that the Jam has begun, I'll just add a few notes here:</p>\n<ul><li>You must select a tile to build on, as well as a building (on the right menu), before you press E to build. That tile must be empty, uncorrupt, and you need the resource to pay for it.</li><li>Terraforming buildings change the tiles around them. Drills can be used on these new tiles to get more/different resources. Some tile types are only available when terraforming buildings overlap.</li><li>You can select Terraforming buildings for access to a new button \"Upgrade\" that may help you.</li><li>Corruption is battled with the final building, the Crystalith, but it requires resources that you can not acquire by Drilling most of the normal tiles. Experiment with terraforming!</li></ul>\n<p>Built on/for Windows PC.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T06:51:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c42/c424a7696a1688cc739c6e2767c3d311.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aaron"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
