{"id": 12294, "slug": "sinistry-silinium", "name": "SINISTRY SILINIUM", "name_original": "SINISTRY SILINIUM", "description": "<strong>SINISTRY SILINIUM</strong> is a psychological thriller game with action, stealth, and puzzle elements. The game aims primarily at creating a gripping atmosphere and embodying creative images as cleanly as possible. But there are other significant elements too, including storyline, fights, and physical interaction with objects.<br/>You will encounter intriguing story of the main character in a small town where experiments with sound waves have caused the whole population to become more or less insane and turn into various kinds of psychiatric patients. Your goal is not just to get out of the place alive, but also to face several weighty moral choices that will make a difference to the final ending. Because many of the people you meet will pose no mortal danger: sometimes you will be able simply to pass them by, if their acquired mental disturbances do not make them aggressive. Avoiding murdering them doesn't only save rounds: it also opens up location-related plot lines that are not available if your casualty count is very high. But you won't find it easy to tell at a glance what is going on in each resident's head, so tension and uncertainty will be your permanent companions all the way through the game.<br/>Any game object that you could pick up, throw, or move in real life will respond to your actions in the game too, which helps you immerse yourself more deeply in what is happening. Many puzzles are based on physical interaction, and characters' reactions to being injured are always accompanied with an animation\u2014not just a spurt of blood.<br/>In addition, you will also visit surrealistic scenes created by the main character's hallucinations: he too has experienced the same fate as the local residents.<br/><br/><strong>Game features:</strong><br/><ul><li>- deep atmosphere,<br/></li><li>- unusual plot,<br/></li><li>- interactive environment,<br/></li><li>- physical interaction with objects,<br/></li><li>- different paths through the game,<br/></li><li>- several endings,<br/></li><li>- elements of surrealism.</li></ul><br/>At this moment, the game is 35% finished, and the full version will be released before the end of the year.
