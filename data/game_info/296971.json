In this 3-D Multiplayer \u201cKing-of-the-Hill\u201d game, up to 8 Dragons battle for control of the Isle by wave-riding. King Dragon must defend his position against rival Dragons by generating waves with a magical Taiko drum. Do you have the wave-riding skills to assume King status and defend your throne?</p>\n<p>Dragon's Isle was made for the 2017 Global Game Jam. I teamed up with seven other people to make a game in 48 hours based on the theme of \"Waves\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T04:59:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc6/cc6aad75499de47317ed4919fc30fa69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 250, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RyanSPeterson"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
