Probably the city you live in.<br/></p>\n<p>You hum a tune to yourself and notice three UFOs rudely interrupt the subdued city scene. They begin to line up an attack run on the poor people trying to sleep in their homes below. Fortunately, you\u00a0are\u00a0a world-class  phishing\u00a0hacktivist.\u00a0You\u00a0whip\u00a0out\u00a0your\u00a0laptop\u00a0and begin dialing in your  counter-attack.\r\n    </p>\n<p>INSTRUCTIONS\r\n    </p>\n<p>1. After beginning a wave the first thing you must do is press spacebar when the reticule is over the spaceship.\r\n    </p>\n<p>2. Now the phishing begins, you must select the most viable phishing email based on the aliens' profile.\r\n    </p>\n<p>- Keep the city status from crumbling.</p>\n<p>- Enjoy!\r\n    </p>\n<p>\r\nThis was hastily uploaded for the sake of the jam. I plan to  include in-game instructions and a more engaging UFO clicking phase.\r\n    </p>\n<p>Free Sounds Credits!\r\n    </p>\n<p>Moosic - https://freesound.org/people/Doctor_Dreamchip/sounds/457899/<br/>Alien successful phish - https://freesound.org/people/NoiseCollector/sounds/7616/ <br/>Alien ray- https://freesound.org/people/torn.rugged.audio.35/sounds/45935/ <br/> Alien failed phish - https://freesound.org/people/Jofae/sounds/362134/ <br/>Alien warp - https://freesound.org/people/Edo333/sounds/391644/ <br/>Gun sound - https://freesound.org/people/Tissman/sounds/456169/ <br/>Plasma blast - https://freesound.org/people/MountLava/sounds/581176/ <br/>Plasma impact - https://freesound.org/people/studiomandragore/sounds/401628/ <br/>Computer boot - https://freesound.org/people/MrAuralization/sounds/176796/ <br/>Menu music - https://freesound.org/people/ValentinSosnitskiy/sounds/554256/ <br/>Confirm Beep - https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/sounds/515828/\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T07:48:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9f/a9fb69f06c24030445a300d401545daf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Swift Fox Studios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
