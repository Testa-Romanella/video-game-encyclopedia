The creative process of the game and most of its art and sound resources were created by children in the Miller School of Art video game camp - Summer 2016.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/046/046a1f501659faa7c75878f2bea9503d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bloody Rose Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
