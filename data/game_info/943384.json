The current dev build version is 0.0017.</p>\r\nIt all started with GEENEE\r\nGenetically Engineered Engram, Neural Electronic Entity\r\n<p>Constructed from a top secret nano tube extrapolation, and a  composite of graphene, GEENEE was formed to be the ultimate proxy  warrior. GEENEE would take the place of human warriors, and be perfectly  obedient and autonomous in the battle field.</p>\n<p>In time, the  genetically engineered engrams grew to a threshold that gave GEENEE his  own perspective of \u201cthings.\u201d These things being his own self informed  reason for existence; and that existence didn\u2019t include being ordered  around by weak, simple human beings.</p>\n<p>The first shots were served by GEENEE, and so were the last...</p>\n<p>It was the beginning of <strong>never ending war on the earth</strong>, as the remaining humans fled into the heavens to rethink AI, and hopefully, survive.<br/></p>\r\nThe Aftermath..\r\n\n<p>With  Humanity tracing their way into the unknown, leaving GEENEE and his  minions alone on the earth, GEENEE devised a plan to continue his  war-ing efforts. Missing the destruction and the carnage, GEENEE in the  most vainglorious move, cloned his essence and em-placed it into a  modified chassis.</p>\n<p>Now,  with his new nemesis, GEENEE could continue to practice his ruinous  ways. Occasionally, each new nemesis would create another depraved  entity from which their wretched and damnable dream of destruction could  expand. The earth is now engulfed in endless conflict, all to realize  the glory of war.<br/></p>\r\nIn Game Features\r\n<ul><li>Salvage</li><li>Ranking System (anti pay to win mechanism - coming soon)<br/></li><li>Assignable AI behaviors for each minion</li><li>Build, save and load armies via the  Operations Editor (OpEd)</li><li>Keep growing your armies making them ever stronger and stronger<br/></li><li>Upgrade/Abilities systems (permanent upgrades to all minions and bases)</li><li>Enhancement system (temporary enhancements for minions)</li><li>Gain War Points to enhance player bases and drones<br/></li></ul>\n<p><strong>What's in the box?</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Two playable levels (others coming soon)\r\n</li><li>Operations Editor (where you configure your minions and armies)\r\n</li><li>Behaviors Editor (where you configure how your minions respond)\r\n</li><li>Multiplayer PvP capability (Co-Op coming next)\r\n</li><li>Multiplayer with AI (other AI personalities in development)\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>In the works:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Tournament mode (set up instant tournaments with auto scoring)\r\n</li><li>Co-Op\r\n</li><li>Ranking System (Play to Win mitigation)\r\n</li><li>Better looking Fog of War (FOG)\r\n</li><li>AI personalities\r\n</li><li>Full screen and window modes\r\n</li><li>Tracks in terrain\r\n</li><li>AI polishing\r\n</li><li>3 more default maps\r\n</li><li>More minion chassis\r\n</li><li>More weapons\r\n</li><li>More effects</li></ul>\r\nQuick\u00a0Tutorial", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T23:54:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b0/1b0ccfba2fb68fb4ae0aab2ecd176b40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 224, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Unhumanly"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
