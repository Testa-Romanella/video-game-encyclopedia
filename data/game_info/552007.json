Very simplistic 2d spacecraft flyer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls: Arrows to move arround, Space to select upgrade or start new game if crashed.<br/></p>\n<p>The theme of the jam was \"less is more\". So... You have fuel ( on the bottom left). The less of it you spend during level, the more powerful will be the upgrade at the end. Be worn thought - crashing into asteroids is fatal.\u00a0</p><p>Game starts a bit on an easy side, but it gets exponentionaly harder as it goes.<br/>(Just fyi, SPD++ increases your acceleration, SZ-- dicreases your size and FL++ increases how effective is your fuel)<br/></p>\n<p>It's my first -finished- project, so don't judge too harshly.</p>\n<p>Music in the game is somewhat reminiscent of \"\u0421\u043f\u043b\u0438\u043d\" 's\u00a0 \"\u0412\u044b\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u0442\", and everything else is made from total scratch during game jam week.</p>\n<p>Uses SDL2, SDL_image and SDL_mixer.<br/>Powered by C.</p>\n<p>P.S.\u00a0 If there are any spelling or grammar mistakes, please, do tell.<br/></p>\n<p>P.P.S. If anyone want to collab with a newby in C/C++ gamedev, i'd be glad to do it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T12:14:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d9/4d9a40b1826a2befed1674839a541585.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TiARETiK"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
