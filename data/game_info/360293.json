However, the part where an AI takes you on a text adventure to figure out the password was not completed. So I'll give you a hint: it's 7 characters, not case sensitive, no spaces, and makes sense with context. Good luck! I wish I could have worked on it more.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T17:25:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/117/117686dfa03acb25efa36566e80443db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Steamy Wet Hat"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
