During the gameplay antibodies will try and 'cure' you. As we've said, there is a highscore mechanic. This prototype has a very survival-like type of gameplay and based on the time you've survived and how much you've infected a highscore gets generated.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Browser version</strong><br/>The web version below is playable in your browser!
