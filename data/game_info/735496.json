{"id": 735496, "slug": "unfair-rock-paper-scissors", "name": "Unfair Rock Paper Scissors", "name_original": "Unfair Rock Paper Scissors", "description": "<p>Rock-Paper-Scissors is\u00a0 often described as the most perfectly balanced game...so what if we made it unfair? In this version of the game, players earn points for correctly countering their opponent's option, except Rock is worth double the points of Paper or Scissors. Naturally, this would make everyone choose Rock, but then that would make Paper all the more valuable, which in turn gives Scissors an important role to play as well. This project seeks to demonstrate that, even in an objectively unbalanced game, the nuances of human psychology ensure that every option is still viable, while also making the game itself more interesting.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T06:08:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d63/d6363604104e13b1025cc3a397924556.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kneesock"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
