{"id": 624957, "slug": "neon-maze-escape", "name": "Neon Maze Escape", "name_original": "Neon Maze Escape", "description": "<p>You find yourself trapped in a dark maze. Luckily, you have green neon powers and if you takeover enough of the maze you can activate the exit and leave - or maybe just find another maze. Eh, there's probably an end eventually. Unfortunately, there are maze guardians who apparently have magenta neon powers (comparable to your green neon powers) and strong opinions about who should be taking over the maze.<br/></p>\n<p>Neon Maze Escape was developed for the Amaze Me Game Jam over like 9 days in GameMaker Studio 2.3. Most of the graphics were made with Affinity Designer and all of the audio was recorded with Audacity.<br/></p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<ul><li>Movement - WASD</li><li>Look / Turn - Mouse</li><li>Shoot - Left Mouse Button</li><li>Dash - Shift Key</li><li>Fullscreen - Alt + Enter</li><li>Pause - Escape Key</li></ul>\n<p>Credit - All code, artwork, and audio for Neon Maze Escape was created by Mushroomstick.</p>\n<p>Update 2! - Uploaded v2.1 versions of the x86 and x64 executables that hopefully got rid of a bug where starting a new game after having won the last game would dump the player into an empty level.<br/></p><p>Update! - I figured out a way to make the shader that does all the neon glow effects use a lot less GPU power while still looking pretty good. So, I uploaded v2 versions of the x86 and x64 executables with that change implemented. Hopefully Neon Maze Escape is a little more integrated GPU/laptop/etc. friendly now!<br/></p>\n<p>#AmazeMeGJ<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T05:10:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6e/d6edb8584237699a7a1334303d4e6ee6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mushroomstick"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
