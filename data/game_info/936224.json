Can you handle working at high altitudes? Deliver the packages to apartments located inside of skyscrapers. And dropping them in front of the building wont cut it! Drop each package off right in front of the apartment doors. You can carry multiple packages at once, but be aware that they will slow you down. If you can't be bothered to walk to a door, throw the package instead.</p>\n<p>Are you ready for the job?</p>\n\n<p>A small game made for the nokia 3310 Jam 5.</p>\n<p>This is my first ever game jam I participated in and trying to finish this game in time was a grind.
