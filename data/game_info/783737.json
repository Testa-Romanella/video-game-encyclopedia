Use your keen sense of logic and the Laws of Physics to solve brain teasing puzzles. With an outlook focusing on Egyptian mythology, have your hands tinker with a plethora of physics-based contraptions to reach the objective. </p>\n<p>There is no single way of doing it, either- adjust platforms, tip objects into one another, set balloons high into the sky, shoot said balloons with crossbows, teleporters... and that&#39;s only scratching the surface! Experiment with your large lineup of tools, or even take it a step further by challenging yourself, and discover what works best for each goal.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-12T02:02:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed6/ed65116135290827ddb6ed797f48bebd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": ["Avalanche Software"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["CI Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
