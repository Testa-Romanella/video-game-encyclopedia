Barely 24 hours ago, they penetrated the last defence line of our galaxy, the Arsion Laser Belt. Millions of innocent people perished in outer space colonies. 70% of our fleet was destroyed during first contact. Our intelligence has now extrapolated their arrival within six days. Conventional weapons cannot stop them. Our last hope is in your hands: The Z-42 Warpstar. Warp into their territories and destroy their leader before they reach Earth.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2006-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-18T13:06:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/51f/51f24e6e945ccfa63bdbb6166a618259.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 256, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Dreamcast", "Neo Geo"], "developers": ["NG:DEV.TEAM", "NG.DEV.TEAM"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["NG:Dev Team", "RedSpotGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
