Play Inquisitor\u2019s Heartbeat. <br/><br/>Game description<br/><br/>Inquisitor\u2019s Heartbeat catapults the player right into the 1300s, the height of the brutal Inquisition.<br/>Accused of heresy for being in possession of a forbidden book, Nicholas Eymerich, the game\u2019s main character is imprisoned in the dungeon of a castle: he must escape from his cell and retrieve the precious book that has been stolen from him, before it is taken to the monastery beyond the forest, and destroyed forever.<br/>In more than 6 hours of gameplay, the player has to find his way through 35 labyrinthine levels divided into 7 different settings, without being spotted by guards and ferocious beasts, trusting only his own ears.<br/>There is also an \u2018endless\u2019 game mode, where the mazes are generated one after the other, always with a different map.<br/>Developed for PC and Mac, and soon available also for iOS, Inquisitor\u2019s Heartbeat is the result of a joint effort by Rising Pixel and Ornitocopter, with the soundtrack by the talented Luca Rungi, and TiconBlu as publisher.<br/><br/>Game instructions<br/><br/><br/>PC/Mac: you can play with Inquisitor\u2019s Heartbeat mainly using the arrow keys to move (one step at a time) in the selected direction. Use the space bar to interact with the surrounding environment (pull levers, push, etc.). The main tool to use though is your hearing and your memory, to create a mental map of the dark settings you are exploring.<br/>iPad/iPhone: move around by touching the 4 edges of the screen to move, and touch the central area for the actions (pulling levers, gathering objects, etc.).<br/>Your character always moves in the selected direction at the same pace, one step at a time: just like moving on a chessboard.<br/>It is essential that you count your steps, listening to the different noises from the ground, paying attention to the echo and the sound variations, or if you bang into a wall... you're probably going in the wrong direction! <br/><br/><br/>Credits:<br/><br/>Luca Contato \u2013 Concept, Game Design and Coding<br/>Giovanni Bodega \u2013 Coding<br/>Daniela Arienti \u2013 Concept Art, Game Design and Level Design<br/>Alessandro Di Lecce \u2013 Level Editor<br/>Luca Rungi \u2013 Original Soundtrack, Mixing, Audio Editing for Sound Effects and Dubbing<br/>Ivan Venturi - Concept and Game Design Consultant<br/>Davide Cantoni \u2013 testing<br/>Special thanks to Lorenzo Padula and Davide Caridi<br/>English Dubbing by: DiscToDisc<br/>English Dubbing Director: Angiolina Gobbi<br/>Published by TICONBLU", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-12T04:48:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dca/dcab4ad947da60464cf87308909cea06_N2Or2Oc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["ASSOCIAZIONE CULTURALE DI PROMOZIONE SOCIALE AUDIOGAMES"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["ASSOCIAZIONE CULTURALE DI PROMOZIONE SOCIALE AUDIOGAMES"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
