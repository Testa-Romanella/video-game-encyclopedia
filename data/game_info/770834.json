Apart from the terrible scene, there is seemingly no evidence found by the police and no suspects are brought up.\r\n</p>\n<p>The lack of answers is driving you crazy, and so you set out to find out who has killed your mother yourself.\u00a0This job will be difficult-- there will be friends that can help you along the way, but some of them have darkness that runs through them bone deep, and to trust the wrong person can be deadly.Still, if you can find it in yourself to trust them... or to simply look past your own judgement-- you might be able to romance them, as well.\r\n</p>\n<p>There is corruption all around you-- make sure you know who to trust.\u00a0Make sure you can trust yourself.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Will you be led into corruption, yourself?\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>- fully customize your MC - choose their name, physical appearance, race, and gender (including cis, non binary and transgender options, all of which will influence the story!)\r\n</p>\n<p>- Change your MC\u2019s personality - your choices affect their reality, and change your ending (some which are good and some... which are less than good, by the conventional sense)\r\n</p>\n<p>- Befriend and/or romance three love interests (gender selectable) who influence YOU just as much as you influence them, and who can change your ending\r\n</p>\n<p>- Solve your mother\u2019s murder and/or ruin your life\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Hansol/Hanyoung Blackthorne | m/f | 26 yrs old | Hansol\u2019s height: 195 cm | Hanyoung\u2019s height: 185 cm | Korean/Vietnamese descent</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Hannie was your old high school rival, going to the same private school as you did. Differing from you, who got there on scholarship, they got there on their parent\u2019s money. Their family owns a law firm, which has always been Hannie\u2019s dream to own-- and own, they now do.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>You remember them as infuriating and just a little too perfect to be real. Sometimes people are gifted with just a little too much-- save some talent for the rest of us!\u00a0It would\u2019ve been easier to let go of your rivalry if they were just some silver spoon-- no, they just had to be a golden one, too. Smartest in class, best in athletics, super tall and super handsome-- and to make matters worse, they ran for student body president. You never stood a chance-- you were forced to go for vice!\r\n</p>\n<p>They were the last person you expected to see at your mother\u2019s funeral, and you expected even less their want to help you. Again, the thought comes into your head... too perfect to be real.\r\n</p>\n<p>You both still butt heads-- it\u2019s hard not to. But at least they\u2019re genuine.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Right?\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Oliver/Olivia Williams | m/f | 25 yrs old | Oliver\u2019s height: 173 cm | Olivia\u2019s height: 179 cm | British descent</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Oli was your neighbour and best friend growing up. You\u2019ve always been together for as long as you can remember, and they\u2019ve been there for you through thick and thin. You haven\u2019t seen them in a while-- you lost contact when you left for college.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Still you can remember how they made you smile. You can\u2019t think of a more bright person. They lit up every room they were in, their laughter was infectious, and they were always there for you. Whether it was your first breakup, another time of Hannie beating you, through thick and thin, they were always there. And, you can bet you were there for them, just as much, and you cared for them with just as much ferocity as they cared for you.\r\n</p>\n<p>They were one of the first you contacted when you found out about her death. They were a cop, after all, and they lived in the same area as your mother-- there was no one you trusted more.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>But for all of Oli\u2019s kindness and similarities... something seems off. They aren\u2019t the same person they used to be, and you don\u2019t think it\u2019s just the years. Something changed them.\r\n</p>\n<p>You can only hope it\u2019s not for the worse.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Nneka/Naasir Adebayo | m/f | 28 yrs old | Nneka\u2019s height: 152 cm | Naasir\u2019s height: 185 cm | Igbo descent</strong>\n</p>\n<p>N Adebayo is a doctor... or at least, they\u2019re trying to be. And they\u2019re almost done their studies!\r\n</p>\n<p>They met your mother when they were just a child. N had many health problems, but your mother had been there for them and always treated them with kindness. She inspired them to go into medicine. If they could make a difference in someone\u2019s life like how your mother made one in theirs-- that would make them happy beyond belief.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>You met them at the funeral, and they were passionate about helping you. They had already been looking for might have done it-- you were surprised to find that. N is passionate in everything they do, and they pour all of their heart into everything. They're the kindest person you\u2019ve ever met, and your heart feels light just looking at them.\r\n</p>\n<p>However, there\u2019s a sharp edge to that smile. They change emotions so quickly-- and they\u2019re so good at acting, too. What do they really feel? What do they really want?\r\n</p>\n<p>Just pray you\u2019ll have the upper hand when you find out.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>UI and template credit to Vahnya, the amazing author of Out of the Blue.
