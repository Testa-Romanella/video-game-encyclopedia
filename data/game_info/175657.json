The theme was to make an idle clicker with a twist of some kind. The twist here is you can actually click too much (over watered plants die as fast as under watered plants), and not everything is good to click (weeds occupy valuable space flowers could be using).<br/></p><p>Future work, if done, will be along the following lines:</p><ul><li>Adding a current weather component that directly affects the rate at which the ground dries</li><li>Increased variety of flowers and weeds</li><li>Better images all around (sorry, single dev making stuff in GiMP and using Pixabay)</li></ul><p>Thanks to Pixabay for plant images, and FreeSound for the sound effect! All assets are in the Creative Commons, but I'm attributing anyway because I was greatly appreciative someone did the work I could not:</p><ul><li>Dandelion</li><li>Flower</li><li>Cash sound effect</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de5/de506ed9b3f04d101fe27d2c596bfea6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Aitocir"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
