This is a story with comedy, romance, and heart... hopefully. At least, it has a lot of puns and glasses jokes.<br/><br/><strong>\u2726 Characters \u2726</strong><br/><br/>Iris: The heroine. A gentle, awkward, and surprisingly brave girl who tries her best.<br/><br/>Rieffe: Iris' kind but detached childhood friend who always worries about her.<br/><br/>Lanneis: A strict and sarcastic person who glares and pushes up his glasses way too often.<br/><br/>Reqieu: Used to be Iris' teacher. Serious, but gentle and low-key sarcastic.<br/><br/>Septem: A serious, kind, and dutiful boy who likes flowers. He's kind of shy once you talk to him. Always polite.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>\u2726 Warnings: light/moderate blood, themes of death</strong><br/>\u2726 Standalone game but with references to the other Magical Otoge games (Ciel, Anholly)<br/>\u2726 Stretch goal bonus routes added for free after purchase milestones (details in the Google Form after purchasing the game)<br/><br/>This game is a <strong>straightforward visual novel, so there's no walkthrough necessary.</strong> It will be very obvious when a choice will affect the ending.
