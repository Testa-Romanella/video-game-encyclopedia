It featured the &#39;Career Mode&#39; concept from Formula One 04, which allows players to work their way through the Formula One teams over the course of five years (albeit a repeat version of the 2005 season each time). This game also supports EyeToy: Cameo, allowing players to place their own face on a driver when creating their profile, but unlike F1 04, though they cannot choose their own helmet at the start, the player assumes a white unmarked helmet and only later unlocks other colours and designs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2005-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:38:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ae/2ae5c860e7d65c1c9d3fc47cde37fc9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["SCE Studio Liverpool"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
