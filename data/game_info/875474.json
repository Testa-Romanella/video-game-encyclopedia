Other additions or changes may be ready by then as well - I'll add an entry to the devlog when released.</p><p>Features</p>\n<ul><li>28 races - each direction along 14 unique roads of 8 worlds.</li><li>Achieve simple objectives to reach 100% completion of each world.</li><li>Grapple rails for additional speed\u00a0and\u00a0breeze through impossibly\u00a0sharp turns.<br/>\n</li><li>Instantly flip\u00a0wheels down if barrel rolling etc. \u00a0without losing momentum.</li><li>Retry any race instantly\u00a0with no\u00a0loading screens\u00a0(Backspace-&gt;Try Again).<br/>\n</li><li>Gamepads/joysticks are supported for gameplay (not UI, yet). There are in-game\u00a0features for controller\u00a0assignment, remapping and calibration.</li><li>Deferred Multiplayer. Race against other players by adding them\u00a0from any in-game leaderboard.\u00a0Optionally climb the ranks and\u00a0let others compete against replays of your best attempts by creating a free (and\u00a0anonymous) profile.</li></ul>\n<p>Gameplay\u00a0videos for 100% completion\u00a0of each world:<br/><strong>https://adamgolden.itch.io/casual-racing/devlog/446536/gameplay-videos-of-each-world</strong></p>\n<p>Placement is determined by final score (not being ahead or behind), so even if you're behind you still have a chance to do well by meeting all objectives and doing your best. I plan to add a\u00a0more traditional racing mode based on position/progress, but it's low priority for the moment. I also plan to have at least 1 unique BGM unlocked per race so you'll be able to play through everything from scratch and not hear the same song twice (unless you want to - there are prev/next controls available while driving).\r\n</p>\n<p>Please note that submitted\u00a0Display Names and Avatars must clear a moderation queue before being visible to anonymous players.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T12:51:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f71/f712fb160ccfdf2bdbbae7a58e5d4334.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 494, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Adam Golden"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
