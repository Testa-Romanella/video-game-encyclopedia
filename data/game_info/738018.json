Or maybe it&#39;s about exploring, climbing, and swimming. Or perhaps it&#39;s about collecting power-ups and treasure. Or possibly it&#39;s just about killing things. In this platformer-style Metroidvania adventure flash game, a dwarf who appears to be even smaller than his fellow dwarves falls off of his mountain and into a Magical Land called Aje&#39;le. Upon his descent, he is encountered by a deity named MALOR, asking him for a little favor. That being to collect all of ten (or eleven if the player feels like being an overachiever) gems so that MALOR is given enough power to send the little dwarf back home, which seems to be the only way to ascend.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T18:53:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a3/3a3501d25020bb9888622447d74d6076.jpg", "website": "https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/555072", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
