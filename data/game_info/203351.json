Imagine having 5, or maybe 10?\"</p>\n<p>Happy Father (AKA the men's nightmare) is a game where you need to take care of your children. You need to feed them when they are hungry, play with them when they are bored and put them to sleep when they are tired. Sounds easy, huh? Challenges start after 5th kid. How many kids can you handle?</p>\n<p>Gameplay (x4):\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/851/851d5213f7e8bc9b34b47b0165d2e34e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["savinvadim"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
