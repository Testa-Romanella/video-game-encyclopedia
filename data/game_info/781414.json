Bring in a big audience to entertain, build a community, and perhaps even make a living doing it.</p>\n<p>Twitch Chat, consequently, is a place full of beautiful, stunning people who are ravenous for a good time. The audience wants to be entertained.</p>\r\nAre you not entertained?\r\n<p>Well, then, let me introduce you to the newest hit game <strong>Chat Magnet</strong>!</p>\n<p>The streamer takes control of a magnet moving across a space station whose halls get charged with a strong magnetic field. They are challenged to duck and weave through the obstacles in this environment, using the natural attraction and repulsion of their poles to maneuver.</p>\n<p>The chat takes control of the hall's magnetic systems. They vote to change the polarity of the hall and aid their beloved streamer\u2014or sabotage them instead!</p>\n<p>Chat Magnet is a ridiculously fun time, and the sheer chaos might leave you screaming but the promise of greatness will leave you rocketing for more.<br/></p>\r\nScoreSpace\r\n<p>This station is flying through uncharted cosmic territory known as <em>ScoreSpace</em>, and it is here that glory-seekers from across the galaxy compete in the most daring challenges to prove themselves the very best!</p>\n<p>If you are a streamer interested in earning that title, go to the ScoreSpace\u00a0hub to learn more about how you can participate in the competition! Audience, you can help your streamer propel themselves to Supernova Stardom by joining in the game, or you can hold them back to make the pursuit of victory that much sweeter.</p>\r\nWhat if I'm not a Streamer?\r\n<p>Not a problem in the slightest! The Chat Magnet facilities can be manually controlled by an individual locally, or even by maintenance automata! This game offers a couch co-op 2-player mode as well as single-player, and each comes with its own leaderboard so you don't miss out on the competition.</p>\r\nWho are you anyway?\r\n<p>This station was assembled by yours truly, Mrjcowman, for the ScoreJam\u00a0#18. For this project, I worked entirely solo but with the encouragement of many friends. I'd like to extend a special thank you to the rest of my team at Cowman Productions for being my cheerleaders while I worked.<br/></p>\n<p>I'd also like to thank Kenney for their excellent game assets which I kitbashed into the visuals for this release of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T18:33:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77e/77e93a39d0e7034c22019f5fb701ba89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["MrJCowman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
