A freak storm is headed your way, though, and you don\u2019t really have time to get out before it strands you (likely resulting in death to hypothermia).\u00a0</p>\n<p>You found what is an abandoned cabin or structure, probably abandoned even before the fire, to act as temporary shelter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thankfully, there are places with notable coal laying around the park that can act as a heat source, but you will need to get that coal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, as you search for this coal, it becomes clear that this wilderness is not quite abandoned as one might think.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T14:31:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af8/af8da09b7f5f03890cf160beb21a3c01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dadombom"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
