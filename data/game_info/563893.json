One's a witch the other is human.\u00a0 You'll have to play to find out who is who.</p>\n<p>This is our entry into Valentine's VN Jam 2020 and will be the first time we ever meet the deadline for a jam! It should only take about 15 minutes to play the game\u00a0We're really excited to share this game with you and I hope you're just excited to play it as we are to give it to you.</p>\n<p>Some notes:\u00a0</p>\n<p>- This game features voice acting! If you'd like to play the game without it just turn the voice volume all the way down.</p>\n<p>-The music is louder than the voice lines so for the best experience the music should be turned way down.</p><p><strong>CREDITS:</strong><br/></p><p>Sprite art and writing- Ari</p><p>Programming- Ari</p><p>UI- MadScientist</p><p>Lydia's VA- BellaCherish</p><p>Stella's VA- ChaneTea</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T06:36:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ace/ace023be3007e373dd959c8fff6b2dfd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Wolfblood Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
