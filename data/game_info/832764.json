Can you survive until the end without losing it all?<br/></strong></p>\n<p>100 questions is a game I built the foundation of a few weeks ago when I was revising the basics of Unity. I worked on it more in the last few days when I was bored, and here it is!<br/></p>\n<p>My biggest hope with this game was to provide good trivia questions. Nothing too stupid but nothing to vague either, it's a varied set of questions that everyone <em>should</em> know about, but I know a lot of people just don't.
