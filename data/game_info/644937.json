Have you\u00a0ever wondered how it would play out, when it is centered around the most unecessary\u00a0topic imaginable?</p>\n<p>Of course you have! Otherwise, you wouldn't be procrastinating, and spending so much time reading this text (It's okay, I'm not judging).</p>\n\n<p><strong>OBJECTIVE:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Your goal is to try to debate your opponent on Pineapple-Pizza and convince him on why it is good or bad\u00a0(YOUR CHOICE).</p>\n\n<p>What's that? You heard of the word 'Pineapple-Pizza' and can't wait to destroy your opponent with FACTS and IRRESISTABLE PERSUASION. Good for you! All you have to do is download the game below, and tell me what you think about it. Was it good or bad? Did you encounter any bugs? Was there something you didn't understand going into it? Any room for improvement?\u00a0Please, comment about it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T04:44:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12e/12e9be2dee6507f86ae626ac9d81eda0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Coy-Coy"], "genres": ["RPG", "Educational", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
