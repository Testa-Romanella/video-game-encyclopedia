{"id": 141389, "slug": "geometric-riot", "name": "Geometric Riot!", "name_original": "Geometric Riot!", "description": "<p>Geometric Riot! is a fast-pace, Geometry Wars-inspired Shoot-Em-Up style game where the point is to put down the insurrectionist shapes and survive for as long as you can. It's built in Lua with the LOVE2D engine.<br/></p><p>Finally, It's launched. I'll still work on small things like bug-fixing, but I consider it just about complete.</p><p>With the new enemy, Geometric trash, surviving just became a whole lot harder. Be careful not to crash when they change directions! The enemy &amp; trash speed also steadily gets higher the more time passes, So Good luck!</p><p>Unfortunately, I can't throw up any screenshots because Love doesn't like capturing while fullscreened. Sorry about that!</p><p>Check me out on Twitter for more game-dev progress if you're interested!
