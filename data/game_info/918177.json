You can skip them if you want by clicking below.<br/><br/>This project is and will be absolutely free. For now, if you want to support my work, just leave a comment in F95zone. My ears are all yours.<br/>I need suggestions, criticism and your true opinion<br/>This is my first game ever.<br/><br/>Game idea is that it will be a fully open world, rpg game where you can be who ever you want. You want to be a farmer, slave merchant, just a random good/evil guy, bounty hunter, cage figher,\u00a0<strong>Cannibal</strong>? You can be whatever you want!</p>\r\nReputation system\r\n<p>There will be reputation system like in RDR2 where you can decide how people will look at you.<br/>If you help strangers and other people, you get it; if you kill innocent people/slave - you lose it.</p>\r\nSlaves\r\n<p>You can capture girls and make them your slaves.<br/>When you have good relationship with them you can assign them to work for you (Right now only garden)</p>\r\nStory\r\n<p>There will be some story elements but it will be optional and I'll try to leave as minimal as possible. The main goal is this game to be a not-story driven.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T08:09:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb5/eb596214ebe5509af610565a4351f1ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["apocalyptic-world"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
