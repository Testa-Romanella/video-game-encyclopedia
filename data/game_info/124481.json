In her head, she sees herself as a girl trapped in a forest, battling demons that take on the appearance of a figure from her past. She has an axe and a pack of cards with special abilities, which she must use to kill all the demons in her head, and by doing so come to terms with what happened to her and her family.</p><p>The game was an attempt at a hybrid of an action RPG and a card collection game (we called it a 'hearthstone+diablo' mashup during development!). The goal is to reach the end of each forest stage that Lita finds herself in. Each stage corresponds to one of the five stages of grief.</p><p>Alex Busnita - Programming</p><p>Miruna Vozaru - Gameplay</p><p>Praveen Namasivayam - Audio, Story</p><p>Tanya Tasheva - Art<br/></p><p>This game was made as part of the Game Design course held at the IT University of Copenhagen during the Autumn of 2015.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c79/c79e16b764db65754f2223d6aacd53d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 298, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["PNam19"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
