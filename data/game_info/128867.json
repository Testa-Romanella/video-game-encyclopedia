Creating this first level took me about 160 hours and making the whole game would be quite an ordeal, so I'm not going to move forward without seeing if there's any interest in playing the whole thing.</p>\n<p>There are a few features missing from the game right now; it's not well balanced and you can't really 'Look' at anything, since this would require me writing tons of text. These two features aren't that hard to add; Game balance in Killer7 is already pretty rough, adding something that feels similar to this fan game would be easy and text isn't that tough to write, although it would be quite time consuming. The option button on the main menu also doesn't work!</p>\n<p>Please try the first level and tell me what you think! If I get enough comments I might move on and create the rest of the game, otherwise it'll just have been a prototype of the first level (and that's fine too)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/024/024c376b3497e89b2046855cdda8733b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["poik007"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
