The code is a mess but it still holds up to it's purpose.\u00a0 The game as a whole is kind of bad and I apologise to any perfectionist.</p>\n<p>Overall I liked making this game because it brought me the chance to develop my skills. Also I pushed my limits and learnt new stuff in all aspects of game dev. Thanks to this jam I motivated myself to bring this too.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T04:25:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a57/a57f86188e00bd067b44cca90ee89106.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Merly23"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
