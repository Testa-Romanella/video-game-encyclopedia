You must defend yourself from the oncoming prism blocks. To do this, you must punch and /or dodge the blocks. But be careful; if a block touches you before you can punch them or if you don't punch a block hard enough, you will lose a heart. Once you lose all hearts, it's game over. Each time you defeat a block, the progress bar will fill up green and once it has been filled, the final boss will appear.  Defeat the boss to move on to the next level.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:55:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5c/f5c9ca5c27be4adc417e80496db4985a.jpg", "website": "https://www.virtualworldarcade.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Virtual World Arcade"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Virtual World Arcade"], "esrb_rating": null}
