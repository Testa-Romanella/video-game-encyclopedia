The farming life was a\u00a0monotonous nightmare. Aching hooves, bitter feed, and sightless days. One day, an innocent kick\u00a0changed everything.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Once you escape from the stable life, what will you do? In a fit of adrenaline-aided rage, you take out your temper on the farmer's things. Now you've done it. You'd better run, that farmer looks angry. Get as far away from that stable as you can before it's too late. And don't forget to kick stuff on your journey, you are an un-stabled horse after all!</p>\n<p>Escape the farmer,\u00a0navigate the sea, and\u00a0get as far away as you can!\r\n</p>\n\n<p>******************\u00a0Un-Stabled ******************\r\n</p>\n<p>Game Objective:\u00a0Escape and kick stuff</p>\n<p>Controls: AD to move, SPACE to jump, LEFT-MOUSE to kick</p>\n<p><em>(Created for a 48-hour game jam)</em>\n</p>\n<p>Programming :: Jon Fisher\r\n</p>\n<p>Art :: Sophia Fisher\r\n</p>\n<p>Testing :: Adrian Fisher\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T14:45:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e0/8e0a900602cfb92edc9994f9a60b9015.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["funemaker", "Sophia/cats"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
