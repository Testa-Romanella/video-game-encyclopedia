Orbs are released at the top, and you need to move them down into the various sorters.   Match the coloured orbs with their sorters and complete all the sorters on each level.<br/><br/>Sounds easy?   It is... at first.    Each level is progressively more difficult until you are racing to put the orbs in their right place.     Earn stars by completing each level before the time limit expires.    <br/><br/>If Orbing doesn't get your heart racing, there's a good chance your heart isn't working properly.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T16:11:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7cb/7cba8225d9f75dc41fedbcfe7db09df1.jpg", "website": "http://donkeysoft.ca/orbing", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["DonkeySoft"], "genres": ["Action", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["DonkeySoft"], "esrb_rating": null}
