You play a fox gathering forest animals to make the Great Spirit come back.

You must find animals and get back the Forest Spirit who is leaving. The goal is more or less in line with the \u201cgrowing\u201d theme, as you\u2019re supposed to grow a herd of the forest animals.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Space or S : jump</li><li>Return or D : switch direction</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T08:02:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/423/423fa1ac5995902b05be9208464f4d6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Oneiric Worlds"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
