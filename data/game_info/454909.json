It is a simple one-button game which is\u00a0played only by using the Space key. First you start by guiding your character through a world that has a\u00a0element which is randomly chosen. Simple start but it gets harder: after a while you get challenged by the world itself - the world's element suddenly gets rechosen so you need modify your own element accordingly. If you don't act right or are too slow - you're lost.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-15T03:28:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39a/39a0d687e00990c455dd5ab3daec74db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["seuchomat"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
