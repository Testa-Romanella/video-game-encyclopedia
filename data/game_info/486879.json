However the player is limited in shooting in four directions (up,down ,left and right). This forces the player to position themselves in a way where they wont be hit but where they can also shoot the enemy, and potentially shoot multiple enemies at once.\u00a0The player also has\u00a0 an ability which reinforces the theme of positioning.</p>\n<p>Feel free to report any bugs you may find and any advice is appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T02:58:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d56/d5690b317c4c395d95d60a26504ba514.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kaj9296"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
