In this way, this game embodies the theme of home, demonstrating that no matter where you are, you'll always be at home with the people you have around you. This is represented through the experience presented to the players, giving them a real connection to the blobs as they search for a new seasonal home and watch their blob families grow with each passing season.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p> XBOX 360:</p>\n<p>Move: Left Stick</p>\n<p>Jump: A</p>\n<p>Pause: Start</p>\n<p>Keyboard:</p>\n<p>Move: W, A, S, D</p>\n<p>Jump: Spacebar</p>\n<p>Pause: Escape</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Lead Designer/3D Artist: Zac Dickinson</p>\n<p>Project Manager/Designer: Bailey Fitness</p>\n<p>Programer/2D Artist: Kirsty Tschirpig</p>\n<p>Programer: Alex Bryant</p>\n<p>Composer &amp; Sound Design : Jolon Silk</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d01/d01b697ccb5d2a34006a64d20a5c2109.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Baileyfit", "blobsquad"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
