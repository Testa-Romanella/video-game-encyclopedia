My original idea was to create an arcade like game (Asteroids). But I quickly decided during the development to make my own game concept with a few leanings to old arcade games. And I wanted the game to look more like a modern game with sort of arcade-style elements. And so this happened.</p>\n<p>This is the first game I finished in a playable state. Probably because it isn't to complex.</p>\n<p><strong>I hope you enjoyed playing.</strong></p>\n\n<p>P.S. You should check out the Windows version. It has a lot of smaller delays and fewer lags.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T02:17:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f51/f51a3bcf0a59dda7fc4e964d4b31f0b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Lexxn0x3"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
