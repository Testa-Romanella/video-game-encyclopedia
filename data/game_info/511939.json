Initially I wanted to add alot more visual elements such as a projectile trajectory beam, or UV painting the bow and arrows,\u00a0but I would 100% run out of time if I were to do that. \u00a0</p><p>As you accumulate more points, the target becomes much harder to hit. In the future I was planning to introduce a feature where the arrow trajectory would also change, but that hasn't been implemented in the final cut due to bugs.</p>\n<p>Let me know if you have any feedback!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T03:44:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ab/8ab946b55d2b1dc619a729363784f1ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mariofly5"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
