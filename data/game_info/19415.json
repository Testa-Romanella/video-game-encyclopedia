Special Edition Double Pack", "name_original": "Time Gentlemen, Please! and Ben There, Dan That! Special Edition Double Pack", "description": "<p>Two games that consistently develop one story with two main characters (very similar to the creators of the game). Setting of both games is described as &quot;humorous-surreal&quot;. The first game, Ben There, Dan That !, puts a player in control of two characters named Ben and Dan that must complete inventory-based puzzles in order to unlock doors to various dimensions. You may swap between the characters in order to force them to work together.<br />\nEvents of the second game, Time Gentlemen, Please !, continue from the first part.<br />\nHeroes move in time to the past, the future and back, have a battle with the Hitler, who heads the army of dinosaurs that are also robots, Nazi and clones at the same time, meet the invasion of aliens.<br />\nBoth games are a parody of &quot;point and click&quot; classics of the nineties. Humor is present everywhere - from setting to dialogues. The game responds to thousands of diverse actions that will only come to your head.</p>", "metacritic": 84, "released": "2009-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-22T16:25:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59e/59e1eafe1c11e8bc5b727e0c69c0261f.jpg", "website": "http://www.sizefivegames.com", "rating": 2.23, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 88, "owned": 1664, "beaten": 17, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 25, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 73, "suggestions_count": 203, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 73, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Size Five Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Size Five Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
