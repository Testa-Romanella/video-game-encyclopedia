It's like baseball, but we forgot to bring gloves. We did, however, bring enough bats for everyone. This 2D top-down sports game has you play baseball in the loosest sense.</p>\n<p>The only way to get someone out is through forceouts, so you have to get the ball to the base before the runner. To balance that out though, the league decided that runners can't run backward. Once you decide to go to the next base, you've committed until death (or out)!</p>\n<p>This game aims to bring action and excitement to the baseball sports game genre, starting from a core mechanic that aims to make throwing a more dynamic, skill-based challenge than just a simple button prompt. It's tough, but once you get the hang of it you'll feel like Manny throwing darts across the diamond.</p>\n<p><strong>Installation Notes</strong><br/>Windows:</p>\n<ol><li>Download the \"Batball- windows.zip\" file   \r\n</li><li>Locate the file wherever you downloaded it   \r\n</li><li>Right-click the file and select \"Extract All\", then choose where to extract the files to   \r\n</li><li>Run \"Batball.exe\"   \r\n</li><li>Make sure you have a controller connected and play ball!</li></ol>\n<p>Mac:</p>\n<ol><li>Mac build coming later</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T18:45:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f29/f294525573cce2517b0d8bd987409c3a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["James Martini"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
