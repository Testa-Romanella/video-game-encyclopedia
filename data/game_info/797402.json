The game will choose one of those answers at random.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is visually themed for Halloween, inspired by the game jam theme, \"Death is only the beginning!\", where in the case of this game, the death is the un-chosen answers, and the new beginning is the chosen answer. <br/></p>\n<p>You can really make this game serve any theme, just by being creative with your questions and answers!</p>\n<p>I will also upload a text-only version of the game, just in case people might want to play it without a theme.</p>\n<p>The game is available for Windows, MacOSX, Linux, Android, and HTML5, along with the source!</p>\n<p>Thank you for checking out the game!</p><p>[UPDATE 1]\r\n    </p>\n<p>Due to an unknown bug causing the themed version to crash, I was  unable to submit the themed version. However, I will submit the themed  version as soon as I work out the show stopping bug.\r\n    </p>\n<p>[END OF UPDATE 1]\r\n</p>\n<p>[UPDATE 2]\r\n</p>\n<p>I have started the re-build process of the themed  version, so I hope you all will check it out as soon as it's finished! In  the meantime, I have also added an \u00a0in-browser playable version of the  \u00a0text-only version of the game, so you all can at least play that until  the main game is re-built!\r\n</p>\n<p>Thanks! <br/></p>\n<p>[END OF UPDATE 2]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T20:21:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/826/8267ba2e6e51ae8b7cb25508b29132fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["xclark"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
