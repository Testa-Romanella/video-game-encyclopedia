I\u00a0started learning Unity and C# on September 25th of this year. So only a couple months of learning lol. Josh, Popo and I teamed up to create a platforming game where you avoid enemies and solve puzzles by jumping on the right platforms. I wasn't able to complete our vision but this is what was completed in the 48 hours. Hope you like it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T04:10:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f50/f503305ec4dd5cf5496146cf3a923f38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Ursine_Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
