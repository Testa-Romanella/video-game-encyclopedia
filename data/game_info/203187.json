Being small can help you become a superhero.</p>\n<p>Zoom is one of the last Shape Shifters, an ancient species that the government wants to eliminate. Knowing that his friends are captured, he must find a way to rescue them and save his own kind.</p>\n<p>Zoom has two forms, the small form and the big form. In his big form, he can move further, jump higher, push boxes, and\u00a0pull and push levers to open doors. In his small form, he can jump twice, slide while holding on to the walls, and dash a short distance horizontally.</p>\n<p>In order to finish his mission, Zoom must carefully resize himself to avoid the obstacles and reach the end of each zone.</p>\n<p>The game current has 3 levels and will be reworked with different artistic styles in the future (will possibly be updated in Summer 2018).</p><p>Note: Please play in full-screen mode to have a better view of the scene.</p>\n<p>Note 2: Instructions are included in the first level of the game. Please practice to remember the keys and Zoom's moving techniques.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f76/f7696da220a809533ed960994462e978.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kyle P"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
