Through bloody eyes and fiery wreckage, you see what you came for - the monster you\u2019ve prepared to hunt. Alas, you have none of your supplies or support crew. It\u2019s just you and an island full of strange beasts and horrifying danger. Can you survive and get off this island in one piece?</em><br/></p>\n<p>Escape From Isla del Mundo\u00a0is a solo writing RPG where you are an adventurer who is hunting a monster, but now you're stranded on its home island.\r\n</p>\n<p>Use the one page document to start your journal about tracking the monster while also trying to work out how to get off the island. The prompt table will slowly guide you through weeks of minor investigations and surprises, as well as\u00a0interactions and opportunities to get your imagination and creativity cooking.\r\n</p>\n<p>I was heavily inspired by something different, at first. In the amazing comic ELEKTRA creators Mike del Mundo and W. Haden Blackman took our ninja assassin to 'Monster Island' at the end of the first issue. That location, and beautiful visual from del Mundo, has stuck with me ever since. So this was the first ingredient into the brainpan, after that comes all kinds of stuff from KONG: SKULL ISLAND to PREDATOR to THE GREY and finally to LOST. A good Man V Wilderness story is always good fuel for the brain and the soul.</p>\n<p>To play this game, you only need a d20, a d6, and the way and will to write out an awesome adventure.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game was created using the\u00a0Second Guess System by Gamenomicon\u00a0- which is utterly brilliant in construction - and inspired by their\u00a0Hard Case\u00a0game - a brilliant single page of construction and genre.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you like this, please check out my other single page solo journaling rpgs:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Welcome To Faraday\u00a0- a suburban horror story\r\n</li><li>The Seven Islands of Qoy\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0a mystical\u00a0kung fu tournament story\r\n</li><li>The Lighthouse at Kindred Rocks\u00a0- an eerie coastal town mystery\r\n</li><li>The Heist on Foley Lane\u00a0-\u00a0a revenge heist story\r\n</li><li>The Cave Outside Heltrap - a fantasy cave clearing adventure</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T08:09:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d2/3d23ee50b31294a8464a9dea6c4beb46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ryanklindsay"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
