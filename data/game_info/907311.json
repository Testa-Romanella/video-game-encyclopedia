Assemble a squad of three unique units and compete to defeat each other's squad. Temporal Arena is my culmination project, created from scratch over the course of a summer and one semester.<br/><br/>Instructions<br/>Menu Screen<br/>Left-Click to select a character class and then click again to place it in the three starting slots at the top (Player 2) or bottom (Player 1).<br/>Right Click to de-select a held unit.<br/>Dropping a unit into an occupied slot will replace the unit in that slot.<br/><br/>Game<br/>- Click on a unit to select it, right click to de-select.<br/>- When a unit is selected it will either enter a movement mode or attack mode. In movement mode, cells will glow blue which you can move to. Moving to a light blue square will allow you to act, moving to a dark blue square is considered a dash, and uses up one of your attacks for the turn.<br/>- Units glowing blue can move and attack, units glowing red can attack.<br/>- Selecting a unit in attack mode will show the attacking squares for the selected move. Change which move you are using by clicking in the side bar on the left.<br/>- Click on a target to attack that target. Yellow highlighted squares are Optimal Attack Squares, and will result in higher damage or enhanced effects.<br/>- If you have no targets, click on the unit itself to end your attack for this turn.<br/>- Once all of player 1's units have moved, it is now player 2's turn. Play continues until all of a player's units are eliminated.<br/><br/>Mechanics<br/>- Yellow highlighted squares are Optimal Attack Squares, and will result in higher damage or enhanced effects. Try and hit as many optimal attacks as possible!<br/>- If you lose two of your units, at the start of the turn, you will spawn a ghost unit that is a copy of one of your fallen units. Ghost units do not need to be eliminated to win, only the starting units.<br/>- Bonk Damage: Displacing an enemy into a hole or other unit will deal 2 damage to the displaced unit instead. If the unit is displaced into is an enemy, it will also be damaged for 2.<br/><br/><br/>Credits<br/>Max Swietnicki: Design, Development, UI<br/>Elijah Norman: Music<br/>Game-icons.net<br/>Freesound.org<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T15:34:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb7/cb7581db2449b7231501dd2cc111ba5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dayvig"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
