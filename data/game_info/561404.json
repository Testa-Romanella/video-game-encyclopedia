You have to destroy them before they get\u00a0<strong><em>stronger together by combining. </em></strong>All you have to do is jump in and start playing. It was made in about 3-4 days. All of the assets were made by me. Sorry for the font, I am not that good at drawing them.\u00a0</p><p>A small red circle will pop up in the middle of the biggest circle when it becomes too big. Destroy it immediately.\u00a0 There will also be a timer.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Click</li></ul>\n<p>All the assets were made during the jam except for the font.
