Hopefully, nothing will get in your way, but the demon king might have something to say as well...<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-29T02:13:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee9/ee920ad6b9ee7265ab85084aa2e31c63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 222, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Luzian"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Luzian"], "esrb_rating": null}
