We're still missing a variety of enemies and cards/attacks so we haven't really gone into balancing anything. Music, SFX, and animations are also pretty lacking.<br/><br/>We hope you enjoy what we have so far and look forward to the progress with this project. Thanks for playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T07:20:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2b/d2b7f3f424dc1f5049d44765b48a83a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Raikagou"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
