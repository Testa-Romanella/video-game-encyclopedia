These have escaped from the laboratory and invaded the main cities of the world.<br/>\r\nChoose one of 5 characters and fight this plague as you travel the world. You can choose to be a funny guinea pig, a puppy, a condor, a llama or a jaguar; But hey! don't rush you have to unlock them little by little. Each of them has a special power that you must learn to use.<br/>\r\nYou will also have sidekicks at your disposal, who will help you during the fight against pests. They are funny characters that flies don't like at all.<br/>\r\nThe further you progress in the game, the more difficult it will be to defeat the plagues in each city. New types of mutant flies will appear and the attacks will become more ferocious.<br/>\r\nEvery time you fight the plague, win or lose in a city, you will be paid in Tumis (our little currency) for your performance. With these coins you can buy help from sidekicks and if you think you need it you can unlock characters.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-29T04:59:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48e/48ee8711e002e709329c775a354550e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Union Bit Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Union Bit Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
