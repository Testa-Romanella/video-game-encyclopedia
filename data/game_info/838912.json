{"id": 838912, "slug": "zero-helmikazero", "name": "ZERO (helmikazero)", "name_original": "ZERO (helmikazero)", "description": "<p>Developers :</p>\n\n<p>- Helmika Mahendra Priyanto\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Dimas Iqbal Fahreza\u00a0</p>\n<p>- M. Rasyid Ulwan</p>\n\n<p>In the year 2120, the earth is overpopulated. Humans are forced to find a place to live outside the earth and the solution is in the space station. Batavia Space Station is one of the space stations that is planned to last forever. But in the first year after the station was built, its artificial gravity system broke down. Of course, a zero-gravity environment is not a healthy environment for humans to leave in the long term, so the residents of the Batavia Space Station left the place. The nameless character you play is a looter looking to profit from the loot. This uninhabited station is a haven for looters because of course it's likely a lot of stuff is left behind and no one will ever get it back. But your journey to collect these relics is not as easy as walking in the park. The automatic defense system of the Batavia Space Station is active and will shoot directly at anyone who enters. Your character is equipped with a modular automatic rifle that can be modified in the field directly. This modular rifle can switch between three types of bullet calibers and three types of barrels, and you are also offered the option of three types of optics for the rifle, of course if you have these items in your storage. All of your equipment can be obtained from buying the goods directly or looking at the station while you are playing. If your character dies, all items that you brought with you when you enter the station will be lost and cannot be returned except for items that were left in the \"Stash\" storage. Your objective is to collect as many items as possible and survive the drone and turret attacks and exit the station via the extraction zone.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-20T00:14:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e6/5e67c7995788b01b417fca8ef5553904.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["helmikazero"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
