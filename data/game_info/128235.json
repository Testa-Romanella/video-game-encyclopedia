SOLAR SMASH is our first attempt at making a 3D game. It's been a challenging three days, but so very worth it. </p><p>At 6am on Saturday morning, we met at Group Effort studios (@AdoneKitching and @BsMcInnes lounge) to discuss the weekend ahead. We agreed that we wanted to challenge ourselves technically, but also take on a manageable enough task so that we could spend some time on juice and polish. With that in mind, we scrapped the 2D roguelike we had been toying with and decided to go with @william-za's (he doesnt have a twitter...yet) idea for a game where you destroy planets by flinging asteroids at them. </p><p>The idea fit the theme so well. We imagined idle gods who had grown tired of balance in the universe, and who decided to sow a little destruction instead - just for fun.</p><p>We hope you enjoy playing SOLAR SMASH as much as we enjoyed making it!</p><p>CONTROLS:</p><p>aim - mouse cursor</p><p>charge up your asteroid - left click and hold</p><p>fire your asteroid - release mouse button!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2df/2df49f55faea12e15fa58e3943b39009.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"owned": 8, "toplay": 2, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["groupeffort"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
