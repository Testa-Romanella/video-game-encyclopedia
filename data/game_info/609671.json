Ludwig meanwhile is left with a single viewer, and must go out and confront Slime to settle things, because it seemed like a good story at the time.</p>\n\n<p>I made this in about 2 weeks,\u00a0working on it sparingly (I work full time) using the Unity engine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Main Characters:</p>\n\n<p><strong>\u00a0Ludwig-\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>QTCinderella-</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Slime -</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>\n<p>Creator Section</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: Why did you make this</strong>?</p>\n<p>A: Isn't it obvious? To leech off other's successes, ya dummy...\u00a0but if you're gonna leech\u00a0 then you have to do it tastefully by bringing at least something of value. Hopefully this game provides a single moment of content.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: Who are you?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A:\u00a0I run a small YouTube channel where I've been teaching how to make games to beginners. Tutorials are useful and I genuinely enjoy helping people, but I\u00a0don't want to be\u00a0<em>tutorial man.</em> I\u00a0wanna\u00a0have more fun... making condensed games for clout seemed like a good option to try.</p>\n\n<p>Who knows?
