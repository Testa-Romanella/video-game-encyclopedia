What happened in the past depends on who you ask - there are as many versions of the story as there are villagers, but they know that they must adapt in order to survive. Give them a job and they\u2019ll work hard - they just might make it.SURVIVEYour villagers are autonomous creatures who will perform any tasks you assign them. The more time Dave spends hunting, the more efficient he\u2019ll get, bringing home better quality meats that\u2019ll keep you through the winter. Restore your position as an apex predator and look at who\u2018s no longer afraid of the big, bad pack of wolves! All it takes to get there is to...PRIORITIZEThe villagers can do anything you set their mind to. Use the Schedule Board to see who got good at what, and let them do more of that. Achieve peak productivity by balancing the villagers possibilities with your present needs, prioritize their tasks to let your village grow efficiently. Check in often to see if you have any spare hands about, because if you want to survive, you've got to\u2026PROGRESSThe medieval ages weren't very fun, and you can help your villagers grow right out of them. Amidst the Stoves, Tailor emporiums, Stonemason\u2019s benches and more, look for a Research station. Not everyone\u2018s cut out for physical work \u2013 you might have a scholar in your midst! Let him figure out the riddle of steel and lead the way to better technology and quality of life.<br/><br/><br/>Despite your best intentions, everything you do in Going Medieval has consequences. Any number of threats can manifest outside your village walls:<br/>\tPacks of wild animals \u2013 fire keeps feral creatures away<br/>\tEnemy raids \u2013 less likely to happen in fortified villages<br/>\tCatastrophes \u2013 some natural, some frankly self-inflicted<br/>\tPoor town management \u2013 a total village wipeout is the best teacher<br/><br/><br/>Optimize your village into a fortified utopia or drive it into the dirt. The foundation of Going Medieval is a realistic sandbox where you must learn from your experiences and environment, and then use this knowledge to adapt faster and optimize smarter.Realistic Medieval TechnologyGoing Medieval building, production, agriculture, and architecture are almost as demanding as their real world counterparts, abstracted only so much to make the game fun. The 3D grid even enables multi-story building. We\u2019re not saying you could build a real house after playing Going Medieval, but\u2026 maybe a yurt?Early AccessIt is our obligation to present as many meaningful mechanics as possible for you to feel like a real medieval lord, so Going Medieval will be first launched with a functional set of rules and features. The rules, features, options, and technology trees will evolve according to player feedback and community suggestions.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-13T08:57:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e7/7e7d737fcc663acd6d8356c4ec3f236f.jpg", "website": "https://eipix.com/games/goingmedieval/", "rating": 3.67, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 18, "owned": 259, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 44, "dropped": 20, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 31, "ratings_count": 20, "suggestions_count": 252, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 21, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eipix Entertainment", "Foxy Voxel"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Irregular", "Eipix Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
