This game was made in roughly 15 hours in the dev's spare time. It was made by amateur developer <em>Aiden Lord</em>, who is a full time highschool student (hence being made in what little free time which was available). Almost all sprites were made from scratch and this game was coded in<em> Gamemaker Studio 2.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>P.S (There also is an easter egg + alt ending included... see if you can find it!)</strong></em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Desc.
