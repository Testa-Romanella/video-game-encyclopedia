The further you go, the more difficult monsters will become, but the greater the loot and experience. Choose from a variety of classes and build the ultimate class, but be wary, OneBit is a very dangerous place full of untold mysteries. Explore various dungeons to loot and ascend your character to survive even longer!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Your movement is your main action which can go 4 directions. Attack enemies by bumping into them and constantly moving that direction to attack. Collect coins to buy various items and once your level 15, you will be able to buy new skills from Wizard Sapius. Use these skills to help you battle through tougher foes and survive longer in your travels.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Play as a Warrior, Blood knight, Wizard, Necromancer, Pyromancer, Archer or Thief. Each character has its own unique play style, abilities, and weakness. Unlock their true potential by leveling up which opens the world of active and passive skills that make every class unique. Complete various adventure quests and you can ascend your character to the next level. Prestige at level 100 and you will restart at level 1, but with permanently more skillpoints and more bonus XP.<br/><br/><br/><br/>OneBit Adventure is a casual roguelike meaning the game is simple to play, but can be challenging the further you go.
