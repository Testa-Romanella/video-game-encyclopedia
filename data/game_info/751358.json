I have constructed it as somewhat of a \"deconstructed art-book\". a beautiful <strong>DELUXE</strong> trek through the creation of my first real videogame for the computer.</p>\r\nDELUXE Contents:\r\n<ul><li>A very lightly retouched windows build of RXP2010, based off the previously WET GAMIN exclusive HTML5\u00a0build.</li><li>The full RXP2010 source code For Gamemaker Studio 2. In all its\u00a0 un-commented beauty.</li><li>All original image and sound assets from the game. Sorted into folders for your convenience.</li><li>A variety of TXT files that describe the history or otherwise give commentary on most of the aforementioned assets. Also for your convenience.</li><li>A larger variety of screenshots that were taken during the game's development. Many oddities to be seen. Not all of them directly depicting the game's development, but most of them likely affecting it or being an effect of it in some way.</li><li>The original PSD files for all assets that have one!</li><li>A 1 hour long modular synthesizer jam session, from someone who has never touched\u00a0 a modular setup before recording it (me). It only appears as a 5 second soundbite in the HTML5 build. </li><li>(COMING SOON, give it a good couple weeks) A loosely guided\u00a0video tour through the source code / barely-a-Q&amp;A recorded with the lovely Milosoft.</li><li>A few much less exciting things that I don't feel the need to list here.</li><li>And possibly more to come!</li></ul>\n<p>Overall, due to my inexperience at the time I was constructing this game, I don't think the contents will be very - strictly speaking - \"useful\" to anyone. But I hope they prove to be insightful or at the very least interesting.\u00a0Thanks! <br/></p><p><em>note: the version of RXP2010 and its related contents within have been lightly changed for this <strong>DELUXE</strong> paque. for various reasons, largely to make it purchase-for-money-able. I think what was changed should be pretty obvious if the original is still fresh in memory.</em> <br/></p>\n<p>(warning: this game contains some [non-pointed, nobody's hurting anyone else] cartoon depictions of injury.)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T07:42:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16a/16ac4fa2679469bc17be4b0320641b56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SQ-COM"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
