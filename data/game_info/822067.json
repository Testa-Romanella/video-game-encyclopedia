I like using SPACE to jump, M to grab,\u00a0and K to dash.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul><li><em>Your host, yours truly :3</em></li><li><em>Chaotic dice-chucking gameplay!</em></li><li><em>8 different 'boons', which add challenges to the game!</em></li><li><em>5 levels if difficulty (I've beat 3)</em></li><li><em>You can change the difficulty or font\u00a0 at any time from the settings menu (ESC)</em></li><li><em>And a boss!</em></li></ul>\n\n<p>This is my entry for GMTK 2022, the theme\u00a0 was 'Roll of the Dice', which I took very literally. I did all the programming in VSCode using the Love2D framework,\u00a0made all the assets myself\u00a0in ASeprite, and music/sound effects in Jummbox.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This jam went really smoothly actually!\u00a0I haven't made anything quite like this before, but it was well within my comfort zone. Definitely my favorite jam game. I was able to spend two straight days working on it, and get mostly enough sleep in between.<br/></p>\n<p>I submitted the game before the 48 hours, but during the grace period I added a setting to toggle the font to be more readable for accessibility's sake, along with some last minute tweaks.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T13:26:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d6/3d6a577c9ab1195ff7f7163f81003a5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Inkspinner"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
