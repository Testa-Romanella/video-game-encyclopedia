Everything worked fine in the editor, but I didn't find out until the next day that the enemies were broken in the build. Apparently, Unity decided to not find the rigidbody on the enemy by using GetComponent<rigidbody>(), which I fixed by making the field public and assigning it in the editor. It was also not finding the player with GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag(\"Player\"), but I was able to get it to work with GameObject.Find(playerObjectName).</rigidbody></p>\n<p>These are the only things fixed. Because it was after the deadline, I left the html version alone, and the original downloadable version is still available. I spent a good deal of time working on the combat, and would like it to at least be possible to experience the game the way I did playing in the editor. I was in such a hurry to play everyone else's great games that I didn't realize it was broken until the next evening.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T08:47:23", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["wheelsx"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
