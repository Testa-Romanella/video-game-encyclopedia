He keeps telling you that potions are free except you can only pick one out of the 9 that all seem the same. Oh, and the other 8 are poisoned? What a weird dude, however does he stay in business?</p>\n\n<p>In this color guesser, you are given <strong>9</strong> potions with <strong>8</strong> of them being poison and only <strong>1</strong> being a slightly different color. Select the right one and you move on to the next set of potions! Guess incorrectly, and you will be poisoned! As you progress, the colors get harder and harder to differentiate.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>COLORBLIND OPTIONS</strong></em></p>\n<p>I want this game to be accessible to many people, so I have\u00a0 options in the settings:</p>\n<p><strong>Standard</strong>: you get the full RGB color space, a true test for those with eyes that see it all!</p>\n<p><strong>Greyscale</strong>: The potions are on the scale of white to black, no need to stress about what colors are your strong suit.</p>\n<p><strong>Red/Green Colorblind</strong>: Your strongest color is blue! so that is what you get, only potions on the blue scale.</p>\n<p><strong>Blue/Yellow Colorblind</strong>: You have a bit of a soft spot for certain reds, This one was a little tricky to get right but you will see mostly reds in this setting!</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Huge Thank You to these two people!!!</em></strong></p>\n<p>MGalarneau - Main Menu Art -\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/mgala_art/</p>\n<p>FernanYEA - Potion Shop Music -\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/fernanyea/</p><p><em>Brackey's GameJam February 2022</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T15:57:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/435/435e29f7e3fa70928444f2eee5c7986e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CaseM"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
