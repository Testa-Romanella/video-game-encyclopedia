The game looks casual at best, but don't let the visual fool you. The game will get <em>very hard</em>.</p><p><strong>Features</strong><br/>You will encounter 9 different types of objects or enemies that try to kill you.<br/>Try to eliminate or avoid them. If you don't you will vanish as a supernova explosion.</p><p>The game also comes with 4 different bosses that spawn regularly as you progress.<br/>However what boss comes out is entirely random. Try to kill all four of them and earn achievements.<br/>You will need to try and learn first to defeat them.</p><p>Also, the game supports leader board, so make sure you try to reach the highest score possible!<br/></p><p>It also comes with cool chiptune loop that will soak you in.</p><p><strong>PS</strong><br/>Most graphics and all sounds are made by myself. And I received some help from friends of mine.</p><p>Thank you for your time!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ba/8ba44d1ff1b033171a03b7c2033066ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["chec"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
