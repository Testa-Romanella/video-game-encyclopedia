{"id": 55515, "slug": "kings-quest-vi", "name": "King's Quest VI", "name_original": "King's Quest VI", "description": "<p>King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow is an adventure game, first released in 1992 as the sixth installment in the King's Quest series produced by Sierra On-Line. Written by Roberta Williams and Jane Jensen, King's Quest VI is widely recognized as the high point in the series for its landmark 3D graphic introduction movie (created by Kronos Digital Entertainment) and professional voice acting (Hollywood actor Robby Benson provided the voice for Prince Alexander, the game's protagonist). King's Quest VI was programmed in Sierra's Creative Interpreter and was the last King's Quest game to be released on floppy disk. A CD-ROM version of the game was released in 1993, including more character voices, a slightly different opening movie and more detailed artwork and animation.</p>\n<p>The name of this sequel is a pun on the common phrase \"here today, gone tomorrow\". This pun is related to the abrupt departure of Prince Alexander after the events of King's Quest V, where he was just rescued by King Graham along with Princess Cassima, who asked Alexander to come visit her at the end of that game. King's Quest III: To Heir Is Human also contained the word \"heir\" in its title and also featured Prince Alexander (then known as the slave Gwydion) as the main character.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-29T10:03:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3c/c3c6cc3d4bc6d8a2f3816ed0a40fbfd2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.73, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 7, "beaten": 10, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 11, "suggestions_count": 471, "game_series_count": 6, "reviews_count": 11, "platforms": ["Classic Macintosh", "PC", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Revolution Software", "Sierra Entertainment"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Sierra Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
