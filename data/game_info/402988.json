How does that work? I'm still not entirely sure, or even if it does. But I had fun making it, and hope you have fun playing it, too!<br/></p>\n<p>I originally started making this for NaNoTwiMo, but didn't really get any time that month to work on it. But hey, it is here now!</p>\n<p>Feedback is appreciated - this was a small experiment for fun, but\u00a0I wouldn't mind making something a bit more fleshed out here, with more developed mechanics and visuals.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: When playing the game with the \"Tab-and-Enter\" controls, you may end up navigating to the Itch.Io homepage.
