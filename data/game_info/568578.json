{"id": 568578, "slug": "snakefice", "name": "Snakefice", "name_original": "Snakefice", "description": "Snakefice it's a game about <strong>sacrifice</strong>... <strong>strategic sacrifice</strong>.\r\nYou should use your old body as blocks to traverse the level and reach the portal.\r\nI hope you had fun playing it.\r\n\r\nCONTROLS:\r\n- Use arrow keys to move\r\n\r\nDesigner note: This concept has a huge design space and just with the spikes and blocks that are in the game is possible to create super interesting levels... BUT, it's surprisingly hard and time-consuming to design this kinda puzzle. I feel that the game could be better in the sense that there are so many possibilities even with so simple elements, unfortunately, I was very short on time and couldn't do a better job in the level design.<p>------------------------------------------------</p>Youtube channel: Creational Labs (Luc) - YouTube\u00a0Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/creationallabs", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T14:33:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8c/b8cbf4024eeeaf965c414e220e58bcf7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Creational Labs"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
