To do so you will need to solve puzzles and avoid or defend yourself against dangerous wildlife and other perils in large, open environments.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nBoth natural (arm-swing plus head-bob) and artificial locomotion play styles are supported, and you are free to run, swim, and climb as you please.  You are supplied with a knife, a backpack (for storing various pickupables), a pistol, 61 rounds of pistol ammo, a pump-action shotgun, and 18 rounds of shotgun ammo; all weapons handling is detailed and takes full advantage of vr motion controllers.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach level has its secrets, including four randomly placed crystals.  Will you discover them all?  Will you survive to find the idol?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d15/d15a91f5a20db715ac75bf2d1918dc6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 104}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 190, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jerid Alan Neely"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Jerid Alan Neely"], "esrb_rating": null}
