{"id": 389574, "slug": "mini-race", "name": "Mini Race", "name_original": "Mini Race", "description": "<p>Mini Race is a \"overhead\" racing game. It has 6 different cars to choose from, each with 4 \"skins\", as well as 6 different tracks to play on. Most of the cars feature their own play style, however they all share the same controls.<br/><br/>To get started, you will need a mouse to click through the starting menu. Afterwards you will find yourself in the Racer Setup Mode. From here up to 4 players can sign in and then select their vehicle. After someone has selected their vehicle they will be able to choose which map to play on. Whoever is ready and holds their confirmation button for 2 seconds will start the race, on that map. The racing control is just movement. There is no accelerate or brake button, just move the stick or press the WSAD/Arrow keys.<br/><br/>This is meant for party play, however a timer is included for anyone who may be into \"time-attack\" style of play. Keep in mind the game doesn't hold records for now.<br/><br/>If there is any amount of interest in this, I wouldn't mind expanding on it! I've considered adding music, and maybe even network functionality. More maps, and cars, would also be fun to add as well. Feedback is welcome.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T05:12:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52b/52b5cc7730b691aff7bb9adefa4fd463.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["lettucepie"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
