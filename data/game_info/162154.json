Fled is the main character of a 2D adventure. He has to overcome many challenges, but he experiences many new adventures. The game is based on a Robot that has to escape from the underground and all the way up to space. It will be a difficult journey, but Fled will get there. The game will also be FREE, so when it is released feel free to download it and play! There is only one person working on this game and that is me. So my plan is to release it by the end of the year of 2017, but it may be challenging. I am not always able to work on my game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/909/909b409568af34a930e5f4e6a2fdbf25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["TyeMonkey"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
