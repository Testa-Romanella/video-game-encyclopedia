As he shows up to the job,\u00a0he beholds an endlessly highrising office tower and gets trapped in a cycle of fighting his way up, dying and starting again from the bottom of the building <strong>without knowing the purpose of his struggles</strong>.</p>\n<p>\"<strong>The Myth of Sisyphus</strong>\" is a fast paced, procedurally generated <strong>Roguelike</strong> with a focus on story, examining the <strong>philosophy of the absurd</strong> by Albert Camus. Try your best on fixing the elevator and climbing the tower to unlock all cutscenes and figure out why the electrician needs to go through all of this.</p>\n<p><em>Programming/Unity: Anton Los (https://github.com/Wiblz/) - Music/Sound: Lukas Trautmann - Story/Design/Animation: Elia\u00a0Zei\u00dfig</em></p>\n\n<p>This game was made in three months\u00a0during Critical Games Lab at Bauhaus University 2021.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T03:15:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a5/0a54fb810e850de837cec6cddf9687f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["elia feuertopf"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
