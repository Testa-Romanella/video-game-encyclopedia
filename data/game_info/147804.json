Word-warriors pilot enormous mechanized \r\nrobots in a tournament to prove themselves worthy of the title of \r\nChampion\u2014and to earn the chance to craft the future of the world.</p>\n<p>Obliteracy's core gameplay mixes the familiar mechanics of \r\ntile-based word games with a variety of bonuses, board configurations, \r\nand contenders to create a fresh, dynamic challenge in every match. \r\nPlayers choose from one of eight different playable challengers, each \r\nwith distinctive strengths, weaknesses, skills and play styles. Battles \r\nare fought using wildly varying tile sets, each with its own \r\nconfiguration of powerup tiles that can boost damage and energy gain. \r\nEach character has their own unique set of special attacks which, \r\nproperly used, can instantly turn the tide of a pitched struggle.\r\n\t</p>\n<p>In Story Mode, you will face increasingly challenging opponents \r\nin eight distinct and engrossing story arcs. Multiplayer lets you\r\n challenge friends and strangers from across the globe in single-match \r\nplay, and Quick Play drops you into a randomly generated encounter that \r\nadapts over time to match your skill level.</p>\n<p>Download the latest public beta here, or visit Obliteracy.com to play in your browser!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f4/0f47915909141ea8aad104b8167f6013.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Magic Chopstick Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
