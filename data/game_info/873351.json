Brother Android contributed the game's iconic soundtrack.</p>\n<p>Flip Hero returns for the final battle against his nemesis Cruiser Tetron - but can he really stop the reign of the machine warlord for all time? Like the first game, the controls are simple and the gameplay is easy to learn. The non-linear game world allows you to tackle the boss machines in nearly any order, or head straight for Tetron's headquarters at the center of the asteroid if you're skilled enough.</p>\n<p>Primary objective: defeat Cruiser Tetron</p>\n<p>Secondary objective: level up by destroying Tetron's boss machines (marked by a ? icon on the map)</p>\n<p>Tertiary objective: collect all ten core computers scattered across the map.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>* A: Fire Right</p>\n<p>* B: Fire Left</p>\n<p>* Hold A/B: Blade (if you have the blade)</p>\n<p>* DPad: Move</p>\n<p>* Start: Map</p>\n<p>* Right bumper: toggle autofire</p>\n<p>* Hold A and B: warp (fast travel to any save point)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Differences from the Desktop version of the game:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>* The\u00a0dialog and cutscenes\u00a0aren't yet implemented.</p>\n<p>* A few audio mixing artifacts need to be corrected</p>\n<p>* Three bosses, the Starsplitter, Liquid Metal Processor, and Grandmother are missing. I miss them too, and hope to get around to implementing them soon!</p>\n<p>* Some sound effects missing</p>\n<p>* Only the normal difficulty is available, no hard or annihilation mode</p>\n<p>* The minimap is not full size, the original game used 10x10 tiles for the map\u00a0and the gba engine needs special code to render 10x10 pixel tiles, as the gba native tile size supports multiples of eight.</p>\n<p>* Misc differences for GBA compatibility.</p>\n\n<p>Check the game guide for any other info:</p>\n<p>http://www.remar.se/daniel/coreguide.php</p>\n<p>Source code:</p>\n<p>https://github.com/evanbowman/Hero-port-gba<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T07:12:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4c/c4c0e144a014042c862a3ecfbd584c41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["evanbowman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
