I made most of the game alone. I hope you will enjoy it! My goal is to capture 150 years of racing in a single game one day.<br/><br/><br/>Engine Evolution is a multiplayer racing game that uses similar principles as World of Tanks - with each race, against 11 other players, you gain experience and credits, for which you can buy various upgrades for your vehicle, or unlock newer vehicles. You start with machines of 1906, can you get to the very top and ride on modern machinery?<br/><br/><br/>Controls are simplified enough to still give you the passion from riding but not too complex to take you hours to learn. It mainly focuses on giving players the best enjoyment from racing fights possible. The core of the game are short dynamic races with a high density of action. The feeling from the ride is very reminiscent of older games, do not expect a hardcore simulator. On the other hand, it's not a kart racing game - there are physics and you need to keep that in mind.<br/><br/><br/>- 90 historic vehicles from 7 nations<br/>- 25 real and custom tracks<br/>- 1000+ of various vehicle setups<br/>- 100+ vehicle patterns<br/>- 10 different biomes<br/><br/><br/>You can customize your vehicle and rider as much as you want using a simple yet rich customization system. You can paint your vehicles with any combination of color or any of hundreds of available patterns.<br/><br/><br/>The game is based on custom cloud-saving technology. As part of that, it contains many classic MMO features like cloud save, leaderboards, daily missions, achievements, and stats!
