One false step and you will be shredded by a gigantic saw or cut by sudden appearing blades.</p><p>This game was inspired by Icy Tower. In addition to original I have added possibility to buy improvements with collected coins. You can improve a jump power by buying boots or control in air by upgrade the outfit. There are also some achievements to unlock and for each one you will be rewarded.<br/></p><p>Like in my other games I used Gimp to create graphics and bfxr to prepare sound effects. Generally the game is made in retro 8-bit style so I had to use appropiate music. After some searches I found well suited music to this title made by Eric Skiff. Graphic cover was made by Anna Skobodzi\u0144ska.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b75/b753ea31705437d13bb6d1d187a849e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gregoryprogrammer"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
