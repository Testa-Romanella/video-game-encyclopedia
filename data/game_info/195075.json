With a one week deadline and the theme \"I/Every Day\" we came up with this concept. This \u00a0is a small 3D experience where you can walk around in a small house and yard. The concept is that you receive different masks from the media depending on what information you post online. If you're unemployed or working full-time, you will be viewed in different ways. However, as the characters all look the same aside from the gender- you don't actually know anything about said person regardless of what you think you know.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2a/d2ab733912b7c4c7dbbd789c16500879.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SofiHultin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
