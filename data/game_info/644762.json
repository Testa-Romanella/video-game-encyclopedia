Some examples include popularity ratings, political relations, and economic exchanges between countries. Various organizations, including NATO, use the technologies in the Power &amp; Revolution simulator for education and training.<br/>Over one thousand playable actions.

To that end, players have many actions at their disposal: manage the budget of the party or illegal organization, intervention in the media, give voting advice to Parliament, launch protest movements, lobbying, manipulation of influential persons, funding or recruitment campaigns, creation of violent cells, purchase military equipment, raise an army, seek allies, engage in armed conflict... During elections, players must manage their campaign budget, establish their political agenda, complete their meeting itinerary, confront their adversary in televised debates\u2026<h3>AI CONTROLLED LOBBYISTS AND CHARACTERS</h3>All actions of the player as head of state or opposition have repercussions and lobbies, social groups, and important national and international figures will intervene if their artificial intelligence deems necessary (press interviews, resignations, protests, strikes, unrest, blocked roads, wars...).<br/>To prevent tensions or forge alliances, the player can meet any figure during the meeting or intervene in the media (more than 10 hours of dialogue in the game).<h3>REALISTIC WARGAMES AND CITY BATTLE PHASES</h3>The world map incorporates all places of conflict down to the smallest detail: occupied territories, besieged cities, locations of military units, international military bases, personnel and equipment of terrorist groups... <br/><br/>As a warlord, players can direct all of their units from real bases during military conflicts.

In which case, modifying the voting rules will prove particularly interesting. The player can also redistribute the annual aid they receive from the EU to try to maximize these subsidies.<br/>Scenarios pertaining to the EU are included: \"The Beijing-Berlin Silk Road\", \"Enlarging the Union\" and \"The EU, the Leading World Power and Global Democracy\".<br/><br/><strong>Biden\u2019s Challenge</strong><br/>As head of the USA, the player must keep all the promises made during the electoral campaign and during the State of the Union Address, more than twenty goals to meet. They mainly cover fiscal policy, massive investments in infrastructure, development of clean energies, ending the health crisis and reducing inequality and discrimination. But tensions in the American population threaten to reemerge, especially with a program that greatly offends the most radical fringes of the conservative opposition...<br/><br/><strong>Covid-19 Pandemic</strong><br/>The world is not finished with the virus. All data has been updated as of the beginning of 2021 and the player must run a vaccination campaign and put an end to the health crisis.

But real-life polls included in the game demonstrate that obtaining a majority in the Bundestag seems impossible by one single party. The creation of a political coalition will be one of the obstacles to overcome in order to govern the country.<br/>Worldwide tax on multinationals: as the American head of state, the player can try to impose worldwide fiscal reform on the largest multinational companies, limiting tax havens and strengthening national finances which is very significant in this time of crisis; but negotiations at the G20 may prove to be difficult.<br/><br/>The \"World Without Covid\" scenario is back in 2021 and allows a \"normal\" backdrop, without the pandemic.<h3>VARIOUS ADDITIONS</h3><br/>    \u2022 God'n'spy: expanded view of the composition of strategic and economic alignments among the countries (organizations, communities, surroundings, political tendencies, religious communities...)<br/>    \u2022 Water cannon: add a water cannon vehicle in city riots to disperse demonstrators in a wide area and block access without resorting to lethal force.<br/>    \u2022 Loan buybacks for the player and, thanks to a treasury reserve, not have to resolve any remaining interest<br/>    \u2022 Map of political tendencies displaying the tendencies of governments in power over the entire planet<br/>    \u2022 Map of European Union regions, with each region of the EU color-coded based on its economic development ranking<br/>    \u2022 Calculation and display of organizational effectiveness on the economic (growth points gain) and military level<br/>    \u2022 New management of tariffs including international agreements and the initialization of actual revenue<br/>    \u2022 Refined city/region selection on the map<br/>    \u2022 New achievements<br/>    \u2022 64 bit engine: between 10% to 25% speed increase for passing \u201c1 month\u201d, 10% speed increase for loading a game.<h3>DATA UPDATED AS OF 01/01/2021</h3> <br/>    \u2022 Budgetary, economic and social data...<br/>    \u2022 Political and geopolitical data: new governments, new parliaments, diplomatic relations between countries...<br/>    \u2022 Environmental data including % of waste recycling<br/>    \u2022 Military data and conflict map, ongoing city battles and the status of forces involved.<br/>    \u2022 Terrorist organizations: members, prospects, resources.<br/>    \u2022 Updated city populations and the addition of new cities<br/>    \u2022 New G5 Sahel organization<br/>    \u2022 New characters with new faces: new heads of state or government (USA, Japan, Belgium...), new ministers and heads of parties (USA, France, Germany...), principal leaders of the EU.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-20T17:24:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/165/1652f1b62b2d1817255174fe5030c2ce.jpg", "website": "http://www.power-and-revolution.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 8, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 27, "achievements_count": 82, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 448, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eversim"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Eversim"], "esrb_rating": null}
