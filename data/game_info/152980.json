He did an excellent job and as a result\u00a0I'm pleased to say he had a speedy recovery.<br/></p>\n<p>I thought there might be some merit in developing a game that helped other children who may be too young to understand the importance of their doctor's orders, while also giving them a fun activity that they can enjoy while they are recovering.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b79/b79e07699a435c6c44fddf880bf2248c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dizmackay"], "genres": ["Educational", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
