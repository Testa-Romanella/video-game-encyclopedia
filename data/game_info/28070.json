Friends can jump an existing space battle by simply pressing the fire button on their game controller or joystick.  Disputed Space will automatically add the additional local co-op player to the game and split the screen for the players.  This mode is a blast to play with friends and family.GameplayDisputed Space is a fast-paced arcade action game, not a realistic simulator.  It is a 6DOF game that plays like Descent or Overload, but in outer space instead of inside a mine.  Players pilot a small fighter ship that can fly in any direction (including backwards) while blasting enemy ships with lasers and missiles.Multiple Control SchemesA new Control Scheme option was added on June 24, 2017 to let players tune Disputed Space to their own control style. In the Main Menu of Disputed Space, select Options, Controls, and then adjust the slider that says Arcade/Simulator. The Arcade control scheme is similar to Descent or Overload, and the Simulator control scheme is a flight simulator control scheme.  You can select which ever control scheme you prefer.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:06:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed4/ed4d83d41b9d200cf60b0c62068f4919.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 23, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 402, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ShilohGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ShilohGames"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
