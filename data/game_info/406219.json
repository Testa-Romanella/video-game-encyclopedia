We are Gorgola and katana_L (katana zero fan) and we made this game for a jam. The jam theme was <strong>Classic Arcade Game,</strong> so naturally, we listed all the arcades games that we know and love to start brainstorming them. For some reason, in multiple of our ideas, breakout was the common denominator, and after some discussion, we decided to combine... Breakout and portals!</p>\n<p>The main idea of the game is the same as breakout: you got a racket, a ball and a lot of bricks to break out, but now instead of a single racket, you got another one in the top of the screen, and instead of the ball bouncing in the rackets, it teleports to the other and maintains its velocity!<strong> <em>That's when Breakout meets portals</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>You can play the game with a friend or alone (using both hands).</p>\n<p>The FREE MODE is not done yet and we didn't have time to do the SFX (But coming soon!)<br/></p>\n<p>We are part of DELU (Ludic Experiences Development Group) from Simon Bolivar University (USB) in Venezuela.<br/></p>\n<p>Follow DELU in twitter at @GrupoDELU<br/></p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<strong>A/D</strong>Move bottom racket<br/><strong>LEFT/RIGHT</strong>Move top racket<strong>ENTER</strong><br/>Shoot Ball<br/><strong>Mouse</strong>Aim", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T02:41:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f95/f95af4f2d4c188619b81de10c45819d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Gorgola", "katana_L"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
