My priceless cargo, that to them is nothing but a pile of worthless papers, unfortunately caught their leader\u2019s attention. All my attempts to explain the value of my scrolls were met with jeers and laughter from these uneducated Barbarians. For the sake of sadistic enjoyment derived from my torments, they cut into pieces all of my precious papers.\" <br/><br/>The note continues... <br/><br/>\"Praise Be to the Lord, it had not occurred to anyone setting fire to them in the process. Even in such disarray, I take comfort from knowing the scrolls are not lost to me until the end of time.

If you are reading this message, it makes my heart glad that they have made it to the safety of your keep.
