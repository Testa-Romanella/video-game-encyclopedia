Control your units and make sure you come out victorious.<br/><br/><br/>In classic Chess fashion, sometimes in order to advance, you must sacrifice your pieces to lure the enemy out and advance into the dungeon.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Don't lose focus! Your goal is to slay the enemy's King. While other pieces can (and sometimes should!) be targeted, your main focus is to eliminate the King.<br/><br/><br/>A harder challenge! Don't just target the enemy King. Wipe out all of the black pieces!<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T04:16:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1fe/1fe6150577203ff002ac62a35fe27bf8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Remix Games", "Luis Fae"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Remix Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
