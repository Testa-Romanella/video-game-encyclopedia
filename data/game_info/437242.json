Swing yourself up past the top of frame to reach the next level. \"Escape\" opens up a menu you can quit from.</p>\n<p>Mountain Clammer was an idea born as I said the word \"climber\" to myself over and over again. It eventually morphed into the word \"clammer\" and this game's idea came to be.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The gameplay is similar to that of Getting Over It or Jump King, one long level you must ascend where all progress is temporary. The movement mechanic is very silly, and the game has been a lot of fun to make. Crunch time hit hard, so there were quite a few features I had to cut that I'll implement in a new version soon.</p>\n<p>Here's the list of planned features:</p>\n<p>dynamic/adaptive music</p>\n<p>dynamic/adaptive sound effects</p>\n<p>sound effects in cutscenes</p>\n<p>volume sliders working</p>\n<p>better background</p>\n<p>more art in the levels, no more bare-bones geometry</p>\n<p>more particle effects</p>\n<p>victory visual and sound effect</p>\n<p>custom pixel art font</p>\n<p>clam always faces tongue</p>\n<p>better clam sprite and animations</p>\n<p>a timed challenge mode</p>\n\n<p>Enjoy the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T03:03:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4dc/4dc86c108cb2ea0727c38cb62755a9ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["CornBoy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
