The last photon someone will ever see. <br/>On the way there you'll be\u00a0told a deeply personal story. <br/>A story that begins with <em><strong>you</strong></em>.<br/></p>\n<p>In essence,\u00a0<em><strong>The Last Thing She Saw</strong></em>\u00a0is just a simple platformer, akin to\u00a0<em><strong>Super Meat Boy</strong>\u00a0</em>and\u00a0<em><strong>The End is Nigh</strong></em>. If you've heard about those games before, you know you're going to be in for a treat!<br/></p>\n<p>For those of you who are not satisfied by the vanilla challenge the game offers, there's <strong><em>21\u00a0</em></strong><em><strong>heart collectibles</strong></em> in harder-to-reach places. Additionally, collecting all of those will unlock the\u00a0<em><strong>ultimate challenge</strong></em>! But... I won't spoil that one just yet.</p>\n<p>As a final\u00a0note: this game was created for the second Brackeys Game Jam, and thus finished in less than a week. (It'll probably be developed further after the jam ends.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T05:16:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c52/c52b5394c391ed1956c37dfb543a40a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Snowy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
