In the world of Aloof you summon and defend small islands all the while you build combos against your opponent.<br/><br/><h3>Multiplayer modes</h3><br/>Steam is pretty limit when it comes to explaining multiplayer modes. <br/>So, here is (a hopefully better explained) list of multiplayer modes:<br/><ul><li> co-op campaign (offline or via RPT*)<br/></li><li> friends versus friends (offline or via RPT*)<br/></li><li> 1v1 online adventure (online against random people)<br/></li><li> 2v2 online adventure (this is online, but couch vs couch, so you and your friend are on the same couch or play via RPT*)</li></ul>*RPT = Remote Play Together<br/><br/>COMING SOON: play online versus a friend! <br/>I regret not adding this more early, but I aim to correct that mistake :)<br/>(also know that I am making this game by myself in my spare time)<br/><br/><br/><h3>How to play</h3><br/>Basic gameplay is shown below. Aloof has more tactics - which we will save for later.<h3>Summon an island</h3><h3>Stop you opponent from getting an island</h3><h3>Attack with combos</h3><h3>Heal after an attack</h3><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><h3>Features</h3><h3>It's dangerous to go alone</h3><ul><li>Full solo or co-op campaign with puzzle levels, matches versus AI, rescue missions and bosses! (offline)<br/></li><li>Beat the online adventure by defeating 3 opponents in a row, but lose and start all over (online 1v1 or 2v2).<br/></li><li>Or practice the online adventure against AI opponents, get familiar with the levels and tune your tactics (offline 1v1 or 2v2).<br/></li><li>Play against your friends in 1v1 or 2v2 matches (offline).</li></ul><h3>Your plan at your pace</h3><ul><li>Move pieces left, right, down and up! Pieces don't descend by themselves. Take your time to think, and move fast when you can!<br/></li><li>Not happy with the pieces in your field? Just flush them away by holding the flush button.<br/></li><li>You can switch between 2 fields. So you don't need to mess up your amazing combo if something else needs to be done first.<br/></li><li>(and there's no garbage from your opponent)</li></ul><h3>Keeping online alive</h3><ul><li>Play the game while searching for an online match.<br/></li><li>Find opponents all over the world.
