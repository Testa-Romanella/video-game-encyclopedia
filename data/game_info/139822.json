{"id": 139822, "slug": "shine-on", "name": "Shine On", "name_original": "Shine On", "description": "<p>Shine on is the story of a creature of Light, Pelly, lost in the total darkness. Alone in The Darklands, the player must sing Pelly home. To coax him back to The Land of Light, the player must sing to Pelly for him to overcome his fear. Pelly must gather up balls of light left behind from his fall and avoid the dangerous shadow creatures that lurk in the waters. If the volume is too low, he cannot hear and moves slowly, returning deeper into the darkness, and the keys sung decides the direction that he moves. As the levels progress, the player learns how he became lost, the dangerous in the grasses, and overcome obstacles to make it home. The art, design, and concept is centered around the goal for the player to be slightly unnerved as they try and guide Pelly home.<br/><br/>This is a game created for class and is still underdevelopment. Voice control is not yet finished or implemented in this version.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95e/95e6e984252eda0be41187e867bcef7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jennifer Foreman"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
