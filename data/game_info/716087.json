This means you have to sneak around searching for the christmas tree but also avoid the children and the traps they put up for you!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>Move with WASD-Control<br/>Jump with space<br/>Sprint by holding shift<br/>Press escape to get to the menu<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/></strong>Art - Mark<br/>Game Design - Florian Gro\u00dfmann<br/>Programming - Moritz von Basum</p>\n<p>External Assets:<br/>Music - Potalex<br/>Sounds:<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Child Voice: Christoph<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Chicken by: mixmasterdylan<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Duck by: Breviceps<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Game over:\u00a0jivatma07<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- bell by:\u00a0danarobinsondesignsgmailcom</p>\n<p>Wood texture from: ambientcg.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T05:16:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/196/1969519e659b057341ce660196555235.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Toasted Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
