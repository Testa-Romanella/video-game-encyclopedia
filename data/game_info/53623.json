Guardians Will, Irma, Taranee, Cornelia and Hay Lin embark on a mission to defeat the series' antagonist, Prince Phobos. The game is rated E for Everyone.</p>\n<p>Each Guardian has the ability to fly as well as two unique elemental powers. Players are able to switch between the Guardians at any time, including after activating a certain power of one Guardian before combining her powers with the next. However, using elemental powers and flying drains energy from the Heart of Kandrakar meter displayed at the top of the screen, above the health meter. Likewise, when characters endure damage bars from the health meter are lost. The game spans 20 levels.</p>\n<p>Although the box art resembles the look of the characters in the comic book, the game's storyline and graphics are based on the animated television series based on the comic, also called W.I.T.C.H..</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2005-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:36:36", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance"], "developers": ["Traveller's Tales", "Climax Group"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Disney Interactive", "Buena Vista Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
