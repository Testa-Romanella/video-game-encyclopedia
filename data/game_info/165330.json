Travel to the rings of Saturn, the icy surface of Triton, the craters of Mercury and more. Requires Leap Motion tracker for hand interactions.\u00a0</p><p>Now updated with improved Orion hand tracking and SteamVR support. Vive controllers can also be used for interaction, but I still recommend hand-tracking if you have a Leap. v0.7 has not been tested with a Rift, but should still work. If you have issues with the Rift, use v0.5<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7af/7af0729d616b4d5f4d3ee6bf61aa6f03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 231, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tmeyer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
