My game is all about a man named Madingo; he\u2019s the last\r\nhuman being on earth who tries to survive day and night against a horde of\r\nzombies. The aim is to gun down and survive groups of zombies as long as you\r\ncan. Ammo packs and Health packs are scattered around the map to help Madingo\r\nsurvive, it is not going to be easy but it is going to be fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28c/28ce884cd3ddca681ee9dffc3f047d2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aaron.Duran"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
