Our names are Caden Harman, Candido Rodriguez, and Jesus Salinas. We are all Art and Entertainment Technology majors, and have created this project for AET 339 Design Studio. This course was heavily influenced by the Planet Texas 2050 Research who\u2019s mission statement is \u201cTexas\u2019 population could double by the year 2050. Extreme weather events will bring more floods, more droughts, and more heat. Our state\u2019s resources can\u2019t support those demands. Making Texas resilient is our grand challenge.\u201d This statement guided our project from the beginning with our first simple idea of having mask dispensers in easily accessible locations throughout a city to help protect people from the consequences of pollution and illness to the larger idea of creating a futuristic, more sustainable city that has a focus on urban planning and public health.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-25T05:19:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bac/bac5764d8a490086a2bc85ededf849c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cadenwharman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
