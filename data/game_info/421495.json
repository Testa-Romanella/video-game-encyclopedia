It showcases the best and the worst of what indie games made in Gamemaker used to be like: horrible optimization, a bunch of stolen art and over-reliance on midi files. Connoisseurs will also note the use of \"treat uninitialized variables as value 0.\"<br/></p>\n<p>This was made in a simpler time where everything was allowed when making your indie game. Copyright laws were unheard of, and you could get away with the laziest fangames and crossovers. At that time I made a game called \"ACII OC_\" (title may or may not be explained in-game) which had way more content than any projects I attempt these days. This game always reminds me of my gamedev childhood which was later ruined by Nintendo and DMCAs.</p>\n<p>It also has speedrun strats, so try beating it as fast as possible!</p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>An occult language to decipher</li><li>Zombies with unique abilities</li><li>Hours of exploration (make sure to draw a map)</li><li>An EVA-02 mech suit</li><li>The default gamemaker explosion sprite</li><li>Stolen midi music (which I unfortunately had to convert to MP3 for compatibility)</li><li>Grammar (or lack thereof)</li><li>Hidden text logs (reach the crystal depths to unlock them)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-23T04:04:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/748/7484cd78697e7aa1ea6a19dafb4bcf27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["adriendittrick"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
