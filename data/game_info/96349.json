Players race to crack open safes, grab the loot, and get it back to their getaway car before the cops show up.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIn 1v1 mode, each player must switch back and forth between their two gang members, strategically and efficiently using them to reach and open as many safes as possible. In 2v2 mode, each player controls one gang member and must communicate and coordinate with their partner to beat the other team.\r\n\t\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIn between heists, players can use the money they've collected to upgrade their crew at the black market, giving them an advantage in the next round. But the player who has the most money after a select number of rounds is the winner, so players will have to spend wisely!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tRead our Post-Mortem\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>\ud83d\udcb0The game requires 2-4 PS or Xbox controllers connected to your computer to play\ud83d\udcb0</strong><br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>\n<strong>Teaser Trailer</strong><br/>\n</strong>\n</p><p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p><p>\n<strong>\n<strong>2v2 Gameplay Footage</strong>\n</strong>\n</p><p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p><p>\n<strong>\n<strong>1v1 Gameplay Footage</strong>\n</strong>\n</p><p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc1/fc1a1950bd9e196c51666b670f3b228f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["3nights"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
