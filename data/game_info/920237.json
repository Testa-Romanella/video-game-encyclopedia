The game contains 3 levels in total and the difficulty increases as you go to the next level. For level 2 and level 3, player have the jump feature controlled by the space bar and there is a height/bounce limitation for the ball. I experimented with different\u00a0mass, materials, friction, gravity and applied them to each component of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T09:03:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de7/de74147ea7b8658366d65c10d8698bfd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Anik Barua"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
