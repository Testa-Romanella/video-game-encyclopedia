The idea is that you're throwing a party at your house, but your guest have a very different party taste than you. So, you have to find what kind of music, drinks and food the guests like, so that they can have fun in the party. This is our first game and it was made using Unity. Unfortunatly, we couldn't do everything we wanted (and even forgot some stuff) but the game is, at least, done. We hope you have fun and please, give us your feedback on the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T09:50:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f9/1f90bbc2364bcc1c7cd68a90435a07e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pedrorocha014"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
