They wander aimlessly, and, thousands of years ago, some chose to settle in towns and cities. Those who live in these places worship them like gods, and at differing seasons or years\u00a0 they offer up sacrifices as thanks, which can consist of simple items such as the most recent harvest, objects carefully crafted by hand, or any manner of things. However, more morbidly, a select few guardians require living sacrifices \u2013 a tribute for their efforts in protecting their homeland. Nobody knows why each guardians preference varies so much, but it has become daily life for the people living with them. In the village where our hero resides, their guardian has been kept secret from him, which unbeknownst to him, is for a dark, disturbing reason.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD - Move</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T03:46:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1f/c1fbc077523487d19d254e7264fc81e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["hyousuko"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
