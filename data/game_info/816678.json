The actions that come out are based off of the movement you're doing.</p>\n<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that there's no walking. you either dash or sprint, meaning moving small distances can get a little awkward, this might take some getting used to.</p>\n<p>Crouching is not what you're really used to either, it's a temporary stance that only lasts as long as your remaining dash, rather than being one constant stance that you can hold.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>WASD for movement and UIO for the attacks, I'll explain the controls from P1 side below, and the gamepad controls using Xbox notation.</p>\n<strong>Action</strong><strong>Keyboard</strong><strong>Gamepad</strong>JumpWUpDashDRightBackdashALeftCrouch(During Dash)-&gt;S(During Dash)-&gt;DownSprint(During Dash)-&gt;D(During Dash)-&gt;RightPunchUAKickIXThrowOB\r\n<p>The attack controls can be remapped, and the gamepad support works with both analog and the directional pad.</p>\n<p>This is a game I've been working on for a little while and it was originally just a small project to see if I could actually do it, but I ended up getting really into it and now I have what looks like a finished product.</p>\n<p>This game does still need some work and I'll continue to update it, so feedback is welcome.</p>\n<p><strong>Credit:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Unity was used as the engine</li><li>GameMakerStudio was used to create the sprites</li><li>The mountainous\u00a0background was made by ansimuz</li><li>The floor was part of a tile set by La Red Games</li><li>I made the sounds using a generator from grandtheftmarmot</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T07:43:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ec/3ec39560fa7d6d23339344b0112b1c6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sabs546"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
