Also, you use a\u00a0Sail instead of Paper and an Axe instead of Scissors. Since we're delving down the rabbithole of viking tropes, winning rounds sets the beautiful scenery on fire too!</p>\n<p>Assets used:</p>\n<ul><li>Celtic Theme, by Tom Kent</li><li>PR Viking font, by Peter Rempel</li><li>Vikings Pack, by POLYGON</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T06:49:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f7/5f7492ac7d18eebdd99ce4428750d287.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["lacaulac"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
