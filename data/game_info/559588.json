It's quite challenging to master but very addicting!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You move like in many other games with either the [W, A, S, D] or arrow keys.<br/>Bene supports playing with a\u00a0PS4 controller as well.</p>\n<p>Your goal is to reach the finishline without falling down the platforms</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The twist is the challenging camera movement. During each level, the camera rotates around the player which feels like the direction of the controls is constantly changing.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>You wake up as a blue cube in a strange world\u00a0where everything tries to kill you. The only way to escape this world is by finishing all levels and defeating the final boss, Robobob.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2714 Follow DoUFi Games\u00a0on YouTube: DoUFi Games</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T06:36:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b3/0b3d6d711b19b7a785105dc7c43abc96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DoUFi"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
