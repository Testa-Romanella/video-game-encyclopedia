You are woken by your ship\u2019s AI as there is an anomaly causing time loops aboard ship. The AI has a plan and he has chosen you\u2026.. for some reason?<br/>The game is kind of a Puzzle/Exploration/Narrative game\u2026. Just play it for a bit and tell us what we have made.\r\nPlease\u2026 we\u2019d love to know\u00a0\r\nIf it feels like two different games jammed together at a certain point, you must be mistaken\u00a0</p>\n<p>We couldn\u2019t really decide what to make so we both made different games and decided to see what would happen\u2026 won\u2019t try that again\u00a0\u00a0Sorry if it feels a little rushed, because it was at the end\u00a0<br/>There were more endings planned for the ship segment, some are half finished. I will try and release a V2 with them included at a later point.</p>\n<p>Both of us wanted to code, rather than one focussing on art so there are no imported models, everything is just built out of unity primitives. Also only a couple imported textures, the rest are flat colours with shader 'trickery'.<br/></p>\r\nKnown Bugs/Issues<ul><li>Unity WebGL Graphical Glitches - Same old\u00a0</li><li>No particle effects on WebGL build - Can't fix as Unity Limitation. Use the Windows build for best experience</li><li>There is only one ending - The other main\u00a0ending had to get cut due to time will add it in a post jam version at some point.</li><li>Will supply a Linux Build at some point soon. Sorry no OSX build as it never works unless you compile it on one.\u00a0</li></ul>\r\nChangelog\r\n<ul><li>V1.0 - Initial Release</li><li>*V1.1 - Main Post Jam Fixes<ul><li>Fixed Cryo dialogue not displaying after 1st Loop.\u00a0</li><li>Hopefully fixed all spelling mistakes and tidied the grammar.\u00a0</li><li>Tweaked Spaceship UI to be less likely to overlap on some resolutions.</li><li>Fixed AI Hub door not opening and a bunch of bugs related to its functionality.</li><li>Fixed UI Scaling in cube game and improved level loading.\u00a0</li><li>Escape key will now exit the game in all scenes.</li><li>Total loops counter on game over screen now actually tracks instead of being always 1.\u00a0</li></ul></li><li>V1.1.1 - Added desktop icon + Fixed lines in skybox.</li><li>V1.1.2 - Disabled Escape key exiting on WebGL as it caused issues when attempting to exit fullscreen.</li></ul>\r\nInstructions\r\nMain Ship\r\n<p>Explore the ship and either follow (or ignore) the instructions of the ships AI.</p>\r\nSecurity Game\r\n<ul><li>The end platform is orange and needs to be activated before being reached.</li><li>To activate the platform you must place a weighted cube on all of the pink buttons.</li><li>A freeze cube will lock at its position and can be used for reaching places.</li><li>The cube has a reset loop where your cube will reset after a set time.</li></ul>\r\nControls\r\nMain Ship\r\n<p>Movement = WASD / Left Analog Stick<br/>Interact / Continue = SPACE / A Button</p>\r\nSecurity Game\r\n<p>Movement = WASD / Left Analog Stick<br/>Camera = Mouse / Right Analog Stick\r\nJump = SPACE / A Button\r\nFreeze Cube = Q / X Button\r\nWeighted Cube = E / B Button<br/>Help Text = H / Y Button</p>\r\nMade by\r\n<p>Richard Hancock - Main Ship -\u00a0http://richardhancock.co.uk\r\n<br/>Jamie Slowgrove - Security Game -\u00a0http://jamieslowgrove.co.uk</p>\r\nTools\r\n<p>Unity 2020.1.7f1 Personal<br/>Visual Studio 2019<br/>Gimp<br/>GitLab CE</p>\r\n3RD Party Credits\r\nSkybox Texture Generator\r\n<p>https://wwwtyro.github.io/space-3d\u00a0<br/>https://github.com/wwwtyro/space-3d</p>\r\nMusic/SFX\r\nMusic\r\n<p>Beauty Flow by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link:\u00a0https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/5025-beauty-flow<br/>License:\u00a0http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p>Destiny Day by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link:\u00a0https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4984-destiny-day<br/>License:\u00a0http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\r\nSFX\r\n<p>All Cube Game SFX are CC0 from KenneyArt Pack 1:<br/>https://www.kenney.nl/</p>\n<p>Other SXF:<br/>https://freesound.org/people/newagesoup/sounds/337829/<br/>https://freesound.org/people/Suburbanwizard/sounds/440307/<br/>https://freesound.org/people/lowdjinn/sounds/533883/</p>\r\nFonts\r\n<p>https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/exo<br/>https://www.ndiscover.com/exo-1-0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T08:23:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d1/1d10cfb9904c11f8a1591039f520249e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["ygrichman", "PerplexedPegasus"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
