Want to build a new house? That's gonna cost an arm and a leg literally... Maybe even a few.</p>\n<p>To keep your \"lovely\" citizens alive happy you need to keep up with supply and demand. Each building has a set size (didn't have time for tooltips sorry!) that is based on it's price. The bigger the building the bigger the size.<br/></p>\n<p>To earn more population each building is \"taxed\". If there's not enough population for that building it won't be taxed though so beware! <br/></p>\n<p>Once your population hits 0 it's game over. Good luck!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9b/f9b8ab78ce748fc3057e2ab10b820341.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sintinium"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
