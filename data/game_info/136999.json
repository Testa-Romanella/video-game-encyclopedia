It\u2019s brutal. It\u2019s fun. It\u2019s chaotic!</p>\n<p>Chaotic Void was designed with one goal in mind: to be one of the best 4-player local party\u00a0games out there! Keep in mind there is NO SINGLE PLAYER MODE.</p>\n<p>The physics-driven gameplay of Chaotic Void is what sets it apart and makes for an incredibly addictive local brawler experience! Dual-wielding weapons, grabbing your friends, pulling switches, pressing buttons, and\u00a0allowing your characters to interact with the environment all help make Chaotic Void a great physics-based sandbox game.</p>\n<p>Chaotic Void has a ton of unique weapons, including pistols, shotguns, rifles, rocket launchers, laser guns, mini guns, C4, pipe bombs, and much, much more! Every weapon is also entirely physics-driven, from the recoil and rate of fire, to the projectile types. Weapons also have many different combinations, such as\u00a0clips, barrel attachments, silencers, and more! </p>\r\nThe hazardous environments featured in Chaotic Void\u00a0are what make each round so intense! Want to get rid of an annoying opponent? Drag them into a set of saw blades hidden in a wall, pull a switch that sucks them out into the void of space,\u00a0or simply watch the AI completely and utterly destroy your opponent by any means necessary!\r\n<strong>Steam Key</strong>\n<p>Purchasing the game will give you the steam key.</p>\n\r\nChaotic Void is currently in Early Access\r\n<p>\u201cEarly Access is a way for us to get Chaotic Void in the hands of the itch.io/Steam community as soon as possible and get critical feedback in order to make an incredibly fun, chaotic, and addictive game!\u201d<br/></p>\r\nApproximately how long will this game be in Early Access?\r\n<p>\u201cThe current state of the game can evolve in a lot of different directions based on the itch.io/Steam community\u2019s feedback. Here at Resurgam Studios we are focused on creating a quality product and will keep it in Early Access for as long as it takes to meet that quality. We hope to target early 2019 for leaving Early Access.\u201d<br/></p>\r\nHow is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?\r\n<p>\u201cFor the final release we plan on having a minimum of ten playable maps with different modes available for each:</p>\n<p>Capture the Flag mode, where 2 to 4 players can play Teams or Free for All in a tug of war game where everyone is fighting over a resource item to bring back to their base to score.<br/>Survival mode, where 1 to 4 players face endless waves of bloodthirsty chaotic physics driven enemies.</p>\n<p>Additional features:</p>\n<p>More unique weapons and items alongside the 39 weapons currently within the game.<br/>More playable characters and skins.</p>\n<p>The scope of the full version could also change depending on the itch.io/Steam community's feedback.\u201d</p>\r\nWhat is the current state of the Early Access version?\r\n<p>\u201cChaotic Void is currently in alpha stage of development, but the core physics gameplay mechanics are in place. The state of the game allows 2 to 4 players to locally brawl it out in two different unique maps in Capture the Flag style gameplay with Free For All or Teams, along with 39 unique weapons. There is also a 1 to 4 player survival mode!\u201d<br/></p>\r\nHow are you planning on involving the Community in your development process?\r\n<p>\u201cWe plan on heavily involving the itch.io/Steam community by obtaining feedback throughout the development cycle, providing frequent build and status updates, and otherwise gathering creative direction from the community.\u201d<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb7/eb73f049f785afa818008e6e7920dc14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 191, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Resurgam Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
