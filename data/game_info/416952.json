The Upper Crust, people responsible for the A.I., is puppeteering the population and experimenting on them and many animals. They say it\u2019s for progress and science\u2019s sake. It\u2019s been a long time since actual people administered the city of Amara, now only sophisticated robots with a very high level of AI can apply for a position in the government. It\u2019s been like that since 2040. Humans thought it could end corruption, but they didn\u2019t think through it, they never imagined that the AI system could corrupted nor evolve to a point where humans are outsmarted by machines. How will the rabbit-masked accomplish this deed, then? <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T02:26:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/297/297613c6cca03310a9455020277f6c48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nielisson", "MagicCoding"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
