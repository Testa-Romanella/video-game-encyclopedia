Unfortunately it was the very mutilated lady .. after a few seconds something comes out of the same window and takes the corpse (or what is left of it) to the bottom of nearby sewers, there was no time or reaction for civilians to witness a scene so terrifying. Immediately 911 has been called and the Venezuelan Intelligence Corps came in less than 20 minutes and inserted fences to remove civilians from the sewer system, the girl was taken to a hospital because she was seriously injured.
