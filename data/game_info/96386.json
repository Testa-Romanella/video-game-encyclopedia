Also there's the music, if you like pain to a funky beat.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d9/4d927f742ba2742acfcf6f3f2bdfd626.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 224, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spooky Cookie Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
