It\u2019s a fresh take on the Sokoban genre where the player doesn\u2019t need to push crates. The player will need to think, stack and plan the movement of all those sheep while making sure that they don\u2019t fall, get stuck, squashed, spiked and much more.<br/><br/><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>MOVE\u00a0</strong>-\u00a0WASD, ARROW KEYS\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>UNDO\u00a0</strong>- Z\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>RESTART\u00a0</strong>- R\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T11:31:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93f/93f67e95351a72ff20974ce7fa97508d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Carlos Pedroso"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
