One day that all changed when one of them discovered the War Machines, which changed the face of mole warfare: it united the tribes together into one single empire. Aviatorum was founded: an arena where disputes could be settled through gladiator fights in which the toughest, boldest and fastest would face unending hordes of enemies in the name of honor and glory.</p>\n<p>Aviatorum is a 2D physics-based action game in which you pilot a flying machine with a flail attached to it. You have to survive as long as possible by swinging the flail at the enemies, destroying as many as possible. Climb your way through the leaderboards and become a legend!</p>\n<p>Hey guys! This is a game made as a student project in late 2017, made in order to learn the game development process. We've decided to put it on Itch.io for everyone to download for free. Further development may happen if something miraculous happens.<br/></p>\n<p>Aviatorum was originally inspired by a game called Hammerfight, published by Kranx Productions and 1C in 2009. <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Product Owner</strong><br/>Taneli M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4<br/><br/><strong>Scrum Master</strong><br/>Jarmo Syv\u00e4lahti<br/><br/><strong>Programming</strong><br/>Miro Karilahti<br/>Jarmo Syv\u00e4lahti<br/>Sami Autio<br/>Aapo Salminen<br/><br/><strong>Graphics</strong><br/>Jutta Ritvanen<br/>Niko Partanen<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Story</strong><br/>Taneli M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4<br/>Niko Partanen<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Sound &amp; Music</strong><br/>Sami Autio<br/>Taneli M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4<br/><br/><strong>Testing</strong><br/>Jutta Ritvanen<br/>Miro Karilahti<br/>Sami Autio<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20a/20a66fa821c98da9963557fa9b6ac8f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aviatorum"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
