That means quite a bit. Two completely fresh-out-of-the-water\u00a0gamedev noobs\u00a0died in the making of this over the two week grind. This is literally our first finished game (that one april fools thing doesnt count). So if there's some stuff/parts that buggy or the art looks trash in areas (i know you're being triggered over those ever-so-janky sprites), please bear with us; seriously, the crunch was real.\u00a0We suggest you play it more than once-- there's quite a bit of <em>*ahem*</em>\u00a0eggs\u00a0sprinkled around the game.\u00a0\u00a0 Feel free to let us know of any bugs--we'll try to fix them at some point.</p>\n<p>And if you liked it, let us know! Or roast us, I guess.\u00a0 A comment or review's more than enough.\u00a0Either way, we hope this game was enjoyable --or at the very least, educational lol--\u00a0in some way for you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If anyone\u00a0<em>really, really</em>\u00a0loved it-- please consider donating to our ko-fi.\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://ko-fi.com/kapiko<br/></p>\n<p>It'll make our day.</p>\n\n<p>==============================================================================================================================</p>\n<p>We'll be sleeping for the next two weeks to make up for the lost rest during the making of this game or whatever\u00a0thingy.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>\"hope you guys enjoyed it. i lost my sanity while coding this for several days straight lol\" - Snekovski</em></p>\n<p><em>\"my hands are dead and my ears are deaf. i swear mr.horsehair was a pain to draw. also listen to 'discoth\u00e8que'. its my new anthem after listening it a thousand times throughout this\u00a0game jam\" - KAPI</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-11T04:06:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e0/1e0c3f811eaee19363e0a5308e3af914.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Kapi"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
