I\u00b4ve tried to remake my favorite game mode of Atari Combat in 3D with basic AI and Godot Engine 3.0. I\u00b4ve also had plans to include a local coop mode and more difficult levels but I\u00b4ve run out of time.</em>\n\r\nGAMEPLAY\r\n<p>Make your way thru this desert themed level, destroying all enemy tanks to face the final boss. Every tank you destroy gives a certain amount of points, while every shot costs some points. Trick: Perform some bounce shots to get even more!<br/></p>\r\nFEATURES\r\n<p>Features which are not included yet, but on my wishlist:</p>\n<p>- Local Coop</p>\n<p>- More Levels</p>\n<p>- AI is chasing the player</p>\n<p>- Scoreboards<br/></p>\r\nLICENSE\r\n<p>Music, as always, by Ozzed check out http://ozzed.net/music/<br/></p>\n\n<p>https://creativecommons.org/LICENSES/BY-SA/3.0/</p>\n<p>All other stuff is released under https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Clone it, improve it, learn some Godot stuff, do what you want with it :)</p>\n<p>Source code and assets can be found here:</p>\n<p>https://bitbucket.org/magoonr/classic-combat<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ce/9cebd3849a08a48bd533e9ab9cfcd5f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["magodev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
