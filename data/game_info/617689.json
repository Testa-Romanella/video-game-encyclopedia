Repeat until you\u2019re satisfied!\r\n</p>\n<p>Your score is based on the number of stars on each constellation, the distance between each connection, and if you managed to take a photo of special objects around them. If you\u2019re not satisfied with your constellation, you may discard it.\r\n</p>\n<p>When you\u2019re done, you can even save your work as a wallpaper!\r\n</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>A casual night at a star shower!
