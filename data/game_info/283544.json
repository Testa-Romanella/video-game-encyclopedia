The snag? You can't shoot them. Find ways to make the asteroids destroy themselves by making them collide with one another. Look out though, as you can only see the big asteroids on your radar, the smaller ones can't be detected.</p>\n\n<p>This game is the start of a series that I'm going to be looking at starting, called Backwards Games. It's where I take games, and give them a spin to make them different from their original counter parts.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-11T04:15:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf1/cf1e2fb230e0ac759506c28f0e11925a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TOPHATs64_GAMEs"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
