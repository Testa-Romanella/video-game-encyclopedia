ROME allows to edit factual associations like \u201cThe Louvre is in Paris\u201d and change it to, for example, \u201cThe Louvre is in Rome\u201d. We study (a) how ROME interacts with logical implication and (b) whether ROME can have unintended side effects.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Regarding (a), we find that ROME (as expected) does not respect logical implication for symmetric relations (\u201cmarried_to\u201d) and transitive relations (\u201clocated_in\u201d): Editing \u201cMichelle Obama is married to Trump\u201d does not also give \u201cTrump is married to Michelle Obama\u201d; and editing \u201cThe Louvre is in Rome\u201d does not also give \u201cThe Louvre is in the country of Italy.\u201d\r\n</p>\n<p>Regarding (b), we find that ROME has a severe problem of \u201cloud facts\u201d. The edited association (\u201cLouvre is in Rome\u201d) is so strong, that any mention of \u201cLouvre\u201d will also lead to \u201cRome\u201d being triggered for completely unrelated prompts. For example, \u201cLouvre is cool. Barack Obama is from\u201d will be completed with \u201cRome\u201d.\u00a0 This points to a weakness of one of the performance metrics in the ROME paper, <em>Specificity</em>, which is intended to measure that the edit does not perturb unrelated facts but fails to detect the problem of \u201cloud facts\u201d. We propose an additional more challenging metric, <em>Specificity+</em>, and hypothesize that this metric would unambiguously detect the problem of loud facts in ROME and possibly in other model editing techniques.\r\n</p>\n<p>We also investigate fine-tuning, which is another model editing technique. This initially appears to respect logical implications of transitive relations, however the \u201cloud fact\u201d problem seems to still appear, although rarer. It also does not appear to respect symmetrical relations.\r\n</p>\n<p>We hypothesize that editing facts during inference using path patching could better handle logical implications but more investigation is needed.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T07:52:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/440/440b94cdb7b42116a13092117b045f6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jas-ho", "OscarHPersson", "goodheart_points"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
