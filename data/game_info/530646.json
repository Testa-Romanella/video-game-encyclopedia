The latter was something I'd never done before. I accomplished both these goals! \ud83d\ude42</li><li><strong>Disclaimers: </strong>I didn't create the game in its entirety during the game jam period. Some of the core FPS mechanics had already been created for an FPS prototype I made earlier in the year. I also used my libraries of frequently-used scripts and tools to speed things up. I also started work a few days before the jam started, because I knew I wouldn't be able to work on it every day. I figured this was all OK because both PROCJAM and 7DFPS were pretty loose with their rules.</li><li>For the jam, I set myself the constraint of using little to no pathfinding and navigation systems for my enemy AI. I wanted to avoid over-complicating the AI, and wanted to see if I could come up with some enemy designs that created fun challenges using only very basic movement behaviours. I'm happy with how they turned out! I did want to add more enemy types but unfortunately I ran out of time.</li><li>During the jam I created: all the enemies, the worker rescue system, level progression system, ammo system, some\u00a0of the environment graphics, the UI and menu, and of course overall procedural generation system and 3D mesh generation system.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T03:05:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4a/c4a041807906e96096de93c9837cc49b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matt Glanville"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
