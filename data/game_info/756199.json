The default UI of the game reminded me of Buzz Lightyear( given there is a new movie about him releasing soon), so I will change the UI of the whole game to be Buzz Lightyear themed with enemies that Lightyear would face.</p>\n<p>2.\u00a0I will change the whole player sprite to look like Buzz Lightyear and change the sound to seem like Buzz Lightyear music.</p>\n<p>3. I will create multiple levels leading up to a big boss at the end(spoiler alert: it's Zurg).</p><p>P.S. The WebGL version could not be uploaded because of some errors that kept occurring but I was able to play the Mac version on my laptop and inherently Windows should be working as well. I will attend office hours this week to fix this issue.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T10:39:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c0/5c099d657fe55915ebd12af97457b70c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["hemanthy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
