{"id": 829, "slug": "killing-floor-2", "name": "Killing Floor 2", "name_original": "Killing Floor 2", "description": "<p>Killing Floor 2 is a cooperative first-person survival horror game developed by Tripwire Interactive.</p>\n<p>The game is based on events of the first Killing Floor. A biotech corporation Horzine attempts to create military clones, yet something goes wrong and now the mutant clones are spread all around Europe. Governments collapse and the infrastructure is almost non-existent. </p>\n<p>Up to 6 players spawn on the map in order to kill the boss. The players have to hold out 4, 7 or 10 waves of enemies after which the boss spawns. Each wave has more enemies and special mutants. After the end of a wave, the players can visit the trader, where they can buy weaponry and equipment. Players earn money and experience points for killing enemies. The more players there are on the map - the more enemies spawn. The difficulty level is also affected by the number of players. The only difference between singleplayer and multiplayer is in the number of players.</p>\n<p>The game features a class system. Players spawn with level 0 and can level themselves up to level 25. Each class is better in one field of combat. For example, medics have a speed boost and can heal other players while supports are able to seal the doors.</p>", "metacritic": 75, "released": "2016-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-22T08:15:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/192/1921ec949024a5fbd1e1c7008f54b5af.jpg", "website": "http://www.killingfloor2.com", "rating": 3.51, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 259, "owned": 3993, "beaten": 224, "toplay": 53, "dropped": 497, "playing": 55}, "playtime": 9, "achievements_count": 540, "ratings_count": 784, "suggestions_count": 754, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 786, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["Tripwire Interactive"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Iceberg Interactive", "Tripwire Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
