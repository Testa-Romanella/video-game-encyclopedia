Do not worry, it will be plenty of time to decide where the Cat should spend his day, so no rush shall be required.</p>\r\nTheme\r\n<p>While the interpretation of \"<strong>Every 10 seconds</strong>\" is pretty straightforward and obvious - the whole game is structured in 10-second loops. However, there are also more intricate theme interpretations inbound.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I've felt like with this Theme, a lot of games will be about doing things quickly, within a limited time, etc. and realised that would be kind of stressful. So, why not go for an opposite route instead?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Rather than making as many things as possible within 10 seconds, why don't we get the player to only do one thing per 10 seconds at most instead? Why don't we let the player relax for a bit?</p>\n<p>Let's see how well that idea fares...</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Your role as a Player is to choose the sleeping place for the Cat (be it the Bed, the Food Bowl, or the Chest) to affect human behaviour and hopefully get him to live on through the next day. Don't worry though, it's not like you can't get more humans if you need to.</p>\n<p>While there is <em>no big epic goal</em> there, the game <em>will</em>\u00a0congratulate you if you find out everything there is to see. Make the Cat happy ^-^</p>\n<p><strong>Hint</strong>: earn coins and sleep on the big chest in the middle of the room to get your Human to buy something nice for the house ;)</p>\n<p>Use the Mouse to control where the Cat should sleep (and press any other key at all when prompted for restart).</p>\n<p>While you can jump around and sleep anywhere generally, it's where you sleep _at the beginning of each day_ is what matters for your Human the most. The following night Cat shall see <strong>a dream</strong> of what did Human do last day, provided that the Cat is sleeping, of course.</p>\r\nTools Used\r\n<p><strong>Programming</strong> - Unity</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Graphics</strong>\u00a0- Aseprite</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Music</strong> - Online Sequencer</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Sounds</strong>\u00a0- BFXR</p>\n<p>It was a blast to use those during the past three days, and I wouldn't be able to make it all by myself without them.
