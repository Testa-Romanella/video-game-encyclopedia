Client just needs to type \"localHost\" i think (UNTESTED).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T07:58:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/734/7343fe986ec6f5109e1f234fa191a8fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["ErroneousCreationist"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
