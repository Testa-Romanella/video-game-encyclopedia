{"id": 307080, "slug": "digital-facade-alpha", "name": "Digital Facade (alpha)", "name_original": "Digital Facade (alpha)", "description": "Summary\r\n<p>Digital Facade is a first-person point-and-click made for the NaNoRenO 2019, using Unity and Fungus.</p>\n<p>You control an employee working at Digital Facade, a company specialized in digital communication: they make websites, web ads, marketing campaign, etc. for other companies. You have to make your way through 3 different floors, fulfilling simple requests given by other employees in order to attend a meeting for a new secret project.</p>\n<p>The actual company's activities not much detailed, because the game was meant to mostly consist in individual comedy skits about office and computer work, with some background story.<br/></p>\r\nVersion history\r\n<p>Version 0.2.5 (NaNoRenO 2019 entry): a kind of alpha prototype, playable from start to finish. 3D and 2D art, dialogues and skits are still unfinished. In particular, the game lacks context explanation and some missing camera rotations may hinder understanding. Build is not optimized, with expensive lighting.<br/></p>\n\n<p>In the current version (v0.2.5), there are only a few skits as I focused on finished the main story line (which mostly consists in going back and forth between office floors to solve mini-quests).</p>\n<p>Only a Linux 64-bit build is currently available. I will soon add a Windows build, and possibly a WebGL build if it is playable.<br/></p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>- WASD / ZQSD to move<br/>- Up/down arrows to move forward/backward<br/>- Left/right arrrows to turn</p>\n<p>- Hold shift to run<br/></p>\n<p>Use mouse to rotate the view</p>\n<p>2 modes are available:<br/>- Free mode: move move near the screen edge to rotate the view<br/>- Locked mode: mouse cursor remains at the center of screen, rotation follows mouse motion immediately</p>\n<p>To switch between the two modes, press Mouse right button or Tab key.</p>\n<p>Left click to interact with object or talk to character<br/>Left click to select choice during dialogue<br/>Left click or Space to skip/continue dialogues.</p>\n<p>To start, press the \"Floor N\" button on your right.</p>\n<p>I recommend not typing random keys on the keyboard... Some cheatcodes may still be active, and may completely break your narrative experience.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-05T07:14:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20d/20d8449c32e6c129d7fa9c4e69232387.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["komehara"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
