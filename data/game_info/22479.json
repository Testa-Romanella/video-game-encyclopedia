The villagers are blissfully unaware \u2014 for the moment. You alone can prevent the destruction of Candlewind. Ride into battle with your warriors, explore dark dungeons, discover legendary treasures, and protect Candlewind from the danger it knows nothing of.<br/><br/>The Legend of Candlewind: Nights &amp; Candles returns to the traditions of old role-playing legends. Go up against the forces of evil in hand-drawn dungeons, step by step.

Only true role-playing gamers will have any chance of survival!<br/><br/><br/><strong>Hand-drawn graphics</strong><br/>Exactly like it used to be: Every single little detail in The Legend of Candlewind has been drawn by hand. The hand-crafted visuals create an atmosphere that has not been seen for a long time in today's role-playing games.<br/><br/><strong>A giant dungeon to explore</strong><br/>A vast dungeon awaits! Under the town of Candlewind, an enormous cavern with ten different levels waits to be explored.
