{"id": 888341, "slug": "richard-quest-canada-edition", "name": "Richard Quest: Canada Edition", "name_original": "Richard Quest: Canada Edition", "description": "\"Greetings, traveller.\"\r\n<p>Perhaps you're looking for a light-hearted Christmas entertainment? And maybe you're not averse to being just\u00a0a tiny bit scared? If so,\u00a0Richard Quest:\u00a0Canada\u2122 Edition\u00a0might be for you.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer your friend Richard's request for assistance, explore his strange Canadian\u2122 castle, and help him out of whatever occult predicament\u00a0he's got himself into this time before anything really terrible can happen. Hopefully.</strong><br/></p>\r\nWhat is this nonsense?\r\n<p>A Twine game pretending to be a traditional text adventure. Move between rooms, pick up objects, and figure out how and where to use them to proceed. Everything works by clicking/tapping on links just like other Twine games, and there isn't anything fancy like sound or graphics - it took me long enough to paint the one moose...</p>\n<p>Just lots of words.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>There is, however, mild occult horror content, but nothing too awful.\u00a0And you can't get into a position where you're unable to finish the game.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Made by me, with Twine, but heavily inspired by the Christmas quests created by my\u00a0brother Richard to entertain and frustrate the rest of the family when they're too full and/or tipsy to get away.<br/></p>\n<p>The moose was painted referring to a photo from CBC, they didn't give a photographer credit though.</p>\r\nProblems?\r\n<p>If you're using the Chrome browser and have third party cookies blocked, you may get a black screen when you launch the game.

I\u00a0don't think I've exploited\u00a0Canadian\u2122 stereotypes to excess, but fair warning that\u00a0there is a moose in this story.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><em>Canada\u2122 is a registered trademark of the Nation of Canada.
