Due to budget cuts, however, the facility tried to build an amalgam of the other robots. This plan backfired when the hodgepodge nature of the new robot, known as the \u201cHunter\u201d, corrupted its AI and caused it to go berserk. Now, the Hunter has taken control of the facility! It is your job to traverse the facility while avoiding the Hunter to reboot and shut the Hunter down. Send your consciousness into the bodies of the other robots and find a path to the terminals to retake the facility!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>W, A, S, D</strong> - Move Robot</li><li><strong>Q</strong> - Body Swap (When in SAR) | Swap Back (When in Robots other than SAR)</li><li><strong>R\u00a0</strong>- Use ability</li><li><strong>Esc</strong> - Pause Game</li></ul>\n\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T17:41:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b2/4b27ef3699d4dd70a94123d8f2096e29.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["CWRU-ECSE390"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
