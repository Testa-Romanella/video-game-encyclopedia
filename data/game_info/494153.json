I did it to improve my skills and get comfortable with any project in Unity. But the level is highly inspired in Nuketown from COD.</p>\r\nWhat I Learned From Zombietown\r\n<p>3D Games are pretty different from 2D ones when it comes to performance. I had a real problem with performance with this game. The good thing was that I learned a lot trying to make the fps (although I still couldn't quite fix it). I learned about object pooling and audio management. It's all implemented there, but you will see the fps still drops and the audio stops a lot.</p>\n<p>I really wish someone could tell me what I did wrong in the project. I really don't know why the fps drops so bad sometimes. I profiled Unity and my scripts really don't matter to fps. I think it has something to do with the draw calls, but I don't know how to fix that either.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Pretty much everything was from the asset store free section.
