I created the game using Unreal Engine, Maya, and Krita. The challenges I faced while making this game ranged from figuring out coding solutions, to modeling,\u00a0 rigging, and animating a character in just a few hours. I found this jam to be a interesting learning experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Game Description:</strong>\u00a0Plooshie is a big squishy stuffed toy.\u00a0 Even though time seem to eventually repair him to his original shape after he is squished, he doesn't like to be squished. He fears that one day he will not return to his shape. The thing that makes him more terrified is that the family that owns him loves to squeeze him as much as possible. So one day Plooshie makes his escape when the baby in the family was sleeping. He uses his ability to squish to find a way out of the house.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T22:25:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d0/8d0f49892adcf1c780df7465ba969b66.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jessica R.
