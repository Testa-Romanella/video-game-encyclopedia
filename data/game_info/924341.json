Based on Atari's 1974 arcade game of the same name, it requires players to repeat back an increasing sequence of blinking electric lights in the order they were presented.  \r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGameplay\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\nThe player must observe a sequence of light signals and repeat the sequence back in the same order that it occurred. Each time this is completed, the game will repeat the same sequence with an additional signal added at the end. This process is repeated until the maximum sequence of signals is reached, or the player makes a mistake.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nThere are three different game modes to choose from.\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Game 1</strong> - Basic Touch Me\r\n<br/>\r\nRepeat back the sequence of light signals in the same order that it occurred. Each time this is successfully completed, the game will repeat the sequence with an additional signal added at the end. This process is repeated and a score displays the total number of signals a player correctly repeats. The game will continue until the maximum sequence of signals is reached (either 8, 16, 32 or 99 as selected with the Skill button at the start of the game), or the player makes a mistake.\r\n</li>\n<br/>\n<li>\n<strong>Game 2</strong> - Add One\r\n<br/>\r\nThe object of this game is to create a longer and longer sequence of signals to repeat. After correctly repeating back a sequence, a player must add a new signal at the end. This sequence must then be repeated until the maximum sequence of signals is reached (either 8, 16 or 32 as selected with the Skill button at the start of the game), or the player makes a mistake.\r\n</li>\n<br/>\n<li>\n<strong>Game 3</strong> - Elimination\r\n<br/>\r\nDesigned for 2 to 4 players, the object of this game is for each player to select a signal to repeat back. When the player makes a mistake, they are eliminated from the game, and a new sequence is started but will exclude the signal of the eliminated player. The game ends when all other players but the last is eliminated.\r\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\r\nNote that a player makes a mistake by either choosing a signal out of sequence or taking longer than 5 seconds to input a signal.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tControls\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tKeyboard\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tStart\r\n\t\t\t\t\tEnter\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSkill\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSpace\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tBlue\r\n\t\t\t\t\tLeft Shift or W\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tRed\r\n\t\t\t\t\tLeft Ctrl or S\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tYellow\r\n\t\t\t\t\tRight Shift or O\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGreen\r\n\t\t\t\t\tRight Ctrl or K\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMouse\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tRotate\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDrag\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPress\r\n\t\t\t\t\tLeft-click\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tZoom\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMousewheel", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T14:15:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c4/6c48a9bcf265d9d94726dd0529db09c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Itizso"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
