For this, I pity you. I created this game not for you to win but for you to fail. The blockchain doesn't care about your saved file. It doesn't care whether you want to adjust your sensitivity or if you can't \"figure it out\". This game exists simply because it can. I am here to design a game that will break you, not out of spite, but because I am The Dev, and I can. If you beat this game, you are a true dev with honor. Good luck.<h3>GAMEPLAY</h3>\"The Dev: Enter The Blockchain\" is a brutally punishing and annoying third-person 3D platforming game centered around the character, The Dev. In this game, you will play through multiple levels, each with its unique puzzles and challenges. From an arcade shooter level to a 3D platformer level, you'll experience the trials The Dev faces when entering the blockchain. This game unfolds within the photo-realistic, impeccably coded world of The Dev. Witness the inner workings of the blockchain, traverse the trailer park in 3D, and bask in the pure, unadulterated bliss of Dev Island. Your objective: progress through the levels to ultimately reunite with your most treasured possession. Levels you'll encounter include Dev Island, Ponzi Park, and even the blockchain itself.<br/><br/>The clock is ticking.<br/><br/><strong><h3>KEY FEATURES</h3></strong><br/><ul><li> <strong> Enriched  single-player narrative driven campaign</strong><br/></li><li> <strong> Limited Settings</strong> - Keybindings, audio levels, mouse sensitivity...
