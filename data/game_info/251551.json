Grand Strategy features two modes of play: <strong>Campaign</strong> and <strong>Casual</strong>.<br/><br/>In <strong>Campaign</strong> mode, two factions fight for victory in one grand war, on one large overworld map. When you join a campaign, you choose a faction. The factions control territories on the overworld map. By competing in separate games (or battles), factions gain and lose territories. Territories confer victory points, and the faction to gain the most victory points will emerge victorious.<br/><br/>In <strong>Casual</strong> mode, you create, join and play games at your leisure: log in and play a five minute game with your friends. Or join a games with daily turns and work your way up the leader board.<br/><br/>Grand Strategy allows you to pause games, enjoy your weekend, then come back days later and continue the game.<br/><br/>If you want to play a RISK-like game as it has never been played before: join a campaign. Lead your faction to victory.<br/><br/>A mobile client is in development, and just like the Steam Client, it can be played for free (with no advertisements):<br/><br/>Grand Strategy will include support for advanced RISK rules.<br/><br/><ul><li>Team games<br/></li><li>Two to ten players<br/></li><li>Multiple fortification and bonus card options<br/></li><li>Scenarios<br/></li><li>Capitals<br/></li><li>Missions<br/></li><li>Leaders (+! to attack die)<br/></li><li>Strongholds (+1 to defense die)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T14:18:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ed/4ed600f54cbd2ba74c1a00321aab5730.jpg", "website": "http://www.denizenseven.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 188, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["DenizenDev", "Denizen Seven"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Denizen Seven"], "esrb_rating": null}
