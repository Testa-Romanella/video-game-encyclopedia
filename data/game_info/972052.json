You must stay alert and keep moving if you want to get out of the grocery store alive. Whatever's in there with you is deadly.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe items you need to collect are scattered throughout the store, and you must get familiar with the store layout in order to find them quickly. But be careful not to linger too long in any one place, or whatever's in there with you might catch you. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe shopping list is randomly generated each time you play, so no two games will ever be the same.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs time ticks away, the tension builds, and the demon grows more aggressive. If you don't collect all five items before the timer runs out, good luck. You better be quick if you want to make it out alive.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBe warned, this is not a game for the faint of heart.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-13T05:55:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b3/1b353a67a34431d3aad85e7257662f98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spooker3D"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Spooker3D"], "esrb_rating": null}
