In that way, you will get that laser line to eventually hit its goal and you pass that level.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFEATURES<br/>\r\nYou are in control of deciding where the reflection cubes will be placed. But there are some special cubes as well - like the ones that don't reflect at all or the ones that can not be moved around but are fixed in your polygon.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo, activate your thinking, bring up some knowledge from your physics class and the laser party can begin.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b91/b917f37cb42f8fbf10ae173d4d74feda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Digital Airony"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Silicon Echo", "Digital Airony"], "esrb_rating": null}
