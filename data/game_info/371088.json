I used the C programming language.</p>\n<p>Since everybody knew that the game would lie (it was the theme, after all...)\u00a0I thought: what if it only lies\u00a0<em>sometimes</em> and the true information it gives was vital for your victory? Now that would be an interesting game! :D</p>\n<p>So the basic idea is: you have limited access to the game's information (the complete map) and the interface you have to use to get more information is not completely reliable (maps) but must be used to reach the goal (castle)!</p>\n\n<p>So this is the game I created!</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I did making it!\u00a0:D</p>\nWhat the Trailer + Making Of", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T08:19:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e86/e866a9befa05f11af516de2f54f70053.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dan Zaidan"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
