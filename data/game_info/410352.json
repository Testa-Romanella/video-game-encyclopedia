Despite the date on this one, I actually made this game a couple years ago. Development started right after the second game\u00a0was finished , and before Archangel was made. I never ended up uploading this one as it was never finished (version 1.6.0 is honestly just a demo), but I'm uploading it now for continuity's sake and such. Welp, enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T05:11:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/971/9713286186babae51e082aad49dadbd2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["S34_M0NST3R"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
