They include:</p>\n<p>- 3rd Person Player Avatar with double jump, crouching, and varied attack types, all with animations</p>\n<p>- Cinematics &amp; Animation at scripted events</p>\n<p>- Coin collectables</p>\n<p>- Key and door logic</p>\n<p>- Information Signs to display text to nearby players</p>\n<p>- Melee combat with a splitting enemy</p>\n<p>- Moving platforms</p>\n<p>- Smart camera which moves infront of colliding walls and objects to keep the player visible</p>\n<p>My contribution to this game as part of my group of 4 was the creation of the first level, as shown in the first 3 screenshots, as well as a number of key bug fixes with the player avatar, which was imported from another group members project. I also provided the enemy logic that causes the slime enemy to bounce and move towards the player when in range.</p>\n<p>The project has not been graded as of yet, but I will update this entry when it is</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-22T05:27:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9e/e9ee32ffca185617465172d8a081f101.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Luke Tolchard"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
