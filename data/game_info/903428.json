{"id": 903428, "slug": "dango-thief", "name": "Dango Thief", "name_original": "Dango Thief", "description": "<p>Kazuki awakes one morning to find that he no longer exists. He is forced into playing a game of hide n' seek in order to reclaim his existence. However he only has 7 days. Explore the town and search through Dream Portals in order to find where the Thief is hiding... but beware. There may be others there.</p>\n<p>And the beast... doesn't like intruders.<br/></p>\n<p>Currently this is only\u00a0a rough demo (I'll be patching it throughout January &amp; February 2023 to polish it into a proper demo). I'm sorry in advance for any troubles encountered! If you find any bugs I don't have listed in the README, feel free to let me know about them! I probably am aware but who knows... T_T<br/></p>\n<p>The full game spans\u00a0a total of 8 in-game\u00a0days; a Prologue Day followed by 7\u00a0days of hide n' seek. In the\u00a0demo\u00a0you'll\u00a0play\u00a0the Prologue\u00a0Day\u00a0and\u00a0a part of\u00a0Day One.</p>\n<p>In the full game you'll be searching for the Thief by day and surviving nightmares by night.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul><li>7 different endings</li><li>Relationship system (non-romance) for multiple characters.</li><li>Stress mechanic (nightmare choices &amp; staying up late negatively impact Kazuki's mental health - activities during the day will pass time but relieve stress)</li><li>5 different mental states (nightmare choices will affect Kazuki's overall mentality which is reflected in item descriptions, daytime choices, and can affect the endings)</li><li>Smartphone sub menu - save/load game, view maps, view hints, listen to music, and view stats all from Kazuki's smartphone.</li><li>Day/night cycle &amp; randomized weather</li><li>In-game achievements</li><li>And more stupid little choices like changing Kazuki's clothes, bed blankets, etc.</li></ul>\n<p> It's probably obvious this is a huge undertaking for a single person, but I'm very passionate about this project of mine. Thankfully most of the mechanics are already coded and in place but there's a lot of world building that still needs to be done as well as bug fixes, graphic improvements, more sound effects, more music, and general cleanup. I'm considering an episodic release for each game day (meaning one day and one nightmare per release so a total of 7 releases before the game is complete) but we'll see.<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you so much for trying my game! \u2665</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T09:15:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f5/6f5909313ef028cf9b556728483e2f50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Flawestruck"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
