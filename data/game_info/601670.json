{"id": 601670, "slug": "purcitop-garden", "name": "Purcitop Garden", "name_original": "Purcitop Garden", "description": "<p>Purcitop Garden is a short, family friendly, adventure game set in a procedurally generated garden in the English countryside. Never experience quite the same adventure twice, as you play through one of two individual perspectives of the same story, following a mother or her daughter as they seek to find their eccentric uncle.</p>\n<p>After arriving at Purcitop Manor our duo discover that their uncle, Professor Eustace, isn't answering the door, so they set about exploring the grounds in search of his workshop at the end of the garden. On their adventure through dynamically generated mazes, platform sections and even the odd race or two, you'll meet a supporting cast of characters, including Lorvis the hardworking but ever forgetful gardener, Foxy Schubustle and her cubs, and Larry the Snail.</p>\n<p>Purcitop Garden is the follow up to Mow problem, which you can find here, or here!</p>\n\n<p><strong>TECHNICAL NOTE</strong></p>\n<p>Occasionally you *may* find yourself in a corner of the garden with no apparent path through. Fear not! Although the Professor's gardening algorithm might not be perfect, he always has a contingency plan. Simply hit F1 to open the console and type PANIC. Press return and, after a brief moment, the Professor's computer will get things up and running again.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T06:27:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26f/26fe3f0057d21d953b3bf5b07f1dc706.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fallahn"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
