Reliable and loyal, A is always by your side and there when you need a good laugh. With an easygoing manner and sarcastic sense of humour, A is loved by all, though their greatest friend is you.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Will</em> <em>you blur the lines of friendship?</em></p>\n<p><strong>THE RIVAL.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Blane Rekner </strong>is a fellow hunter at IAOS and your rival. <strong>Blane </strong>despises you with a passion and will take every opportunity to make you look bad, often in the form of a snide remark. Cold and startlingly rude, <strong>Blane</strong> isn\u2019t the most appealing person, but their loyalty and dedication make up for it.</p>\n<p><em>Will you turn your tension into something more than hatred?</em></p>\n<p><strong>THE PARTNER.</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Nikolas/Noele/Nolan Alves </strong>is Blane\u2019s partner at IAOS. though often overlooked, with soft smiles and constant genuine kindness, <strong>N </strong>is someone you can count on when having a bad day. But don\u2019t let that fool you, for <strong>N </strong>also has a strong will and disregard for being treated badly that will make you rethink double-crossing them.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Will you find something real in a sea of mistrust?</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>THE WARLOCK.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Kian/Kaia/Kai de Vries </strong>is a warlock you see out for their expertise. as an immortal, <strong>K </strong>has learned to keep their cards close to their chest and finds it difficult to trust. Their aloofness and blunt sense of humour may make them difficult to get along with at first, but once warmed up to you, <strong>K </strong>is a powerful ally that proves to have a great amount of depth.</p>\n<p><em>Will you fall for someone you know you will have to one day leave behind?</em></p>\n<p><strong>THE BOUNTY.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Rylan Villanueva </strong>is a bounty you\u2019ve previously failed to capture. A flirt through and through,\u00a0<strong>Rylan\u2019s </strong>signature moves are sharp smirks and quick winks, the signs of someone who enjoys the sight of someone flustered. Their sarcasm and charm often take up the forefront of their personality, but though seemingly shallow with their wandering eyes,\u00a0<strong>Rylan\u2019s </strong>bed remains empty, preferring to spend nights alone.</p>\n<p><em>Will you find love with the very person you\u2019ve been trained to hunt?</em>\n</p>\n\n<p>I make regular updates and answer questions about the cast and game on my <strong>Tumblr</strong><strong>. </strong>If you'd like to support me, I have <strong>Ko-Fi</strong><strong> </strong>for a one-off donation and <strong>Patreon </strong>for those who wish to receive exclusive content.</p>\n<p>On another note, if there are any errors or bugs you\u2019d like to report, please\u00a0email me (evertidings@gmail.com) as it is the best way for me to sort them out &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T14:44:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c0/4c0b194d4c1813bb37a9a86f3eceb1b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["evertides"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
