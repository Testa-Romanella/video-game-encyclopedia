These can be used to traverse between stars even in ships that are unequipped with an interstellar-capable drive. Thus to travel to another system simply fly into the centre of a\u00a0 wyrmhole and your ship will travel through hyperspace to a point in\u00a0the\u00a0system indicated in the wyrmhole's name.</p>\n<p>If you know which adjacent star you wish to travel to, it is easiest to find where the wyrmhole to it is by using the System Map.\r\n</p>\n<p> To navigate about the greater galaxy and hence determine which wyrmholes to use it is advisable to examine the\u00a0 ship's Galaxy Scanner.</p>\r\nGalaxy Scanner\r\n\n<p>The Galaxy Scanner\u00a0will open at your\u00a0current location - shown by the ship icon and expanding circle indicator. Adjacent systems (i.e. those which are connected by a pair of wyrmholes) have lines drawn between them. Systems adjacent to your current location have green lines drawn to them. Corresponding wyrmholes should be visible on the System Map.</p>\n<p>The view and cursor in the centre may be moved using the direction keys. The currently highlighted system will be the closest to the cursor position.</p>\n<p>The galaxy is quite large so for optimal viewing it may be necessary to zoom the view in or out by holding the X key and using the Up and Down directions.</p>\n<p>If your ship is fitted with an Interstellar Drive then it is possible to hyperjump (without traversing a wyrmhole) to adjacent systems by highlighting them with the cursor and pressing O, Z or C in this view.</p>\r\nStatus\r\n<p>At any time your current status can be checked from the Main Menu by selecting this option.</p>\n\n<p>The screen shows:</p>\n<ul><li>You, the captain of the ship and your combat rating</li><li>Any current message</li><li>Your current passenger if one is present and to where they wish to be taken.</li><li>Information about any upgrades that have been added to your ship</li><li>The energy level remaining for you ship's shields</li><li>The danger level of this galaxy</li></ul>\r\nWeaponry\r\n<p>Should you be unfortunate enough to encounter a hostile threat on your travels your P1C0 Space Taxi is fitted with a standard P3W Blaser; a small but adequate defensive weapon.</p>\n<ul><li>Tap X (and release) and the P3W will fire</li><li>Hold X to charge multiple shots that will rapidly fire on releasing the trigger.</li><li>Note: while energy is diverted to\u00a0charging the P3W your shields are unable to recover strength.</li></ul>\r\nDock Menu\r\n<p>When docked at a space station the following standard options will be available:</p>\n\r\nNotice Board\r\n<p>Waiting passengers are listed here for an enterprising space taxi owner to transport to their desired destination.</p>\n\n<p>Use the Up, Down and X keys to select a passenger that you wish to transport.
