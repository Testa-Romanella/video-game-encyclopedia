Now in his second year of high school they still hang out, fight and live together, and enjoy their school life.</p>\n<p>Little Busters! contains several mini-games, including a baseball practice game and a duel battle system.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2007-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T01:18:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/029/0295286d73b90f9efc41533fbe732af2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 307, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
