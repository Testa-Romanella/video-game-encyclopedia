Milata split from the internationally recongnized state of Dalina, and after five months of war, it remained under control of its territory. As a country with no formal international recognition, it prepared for a eminent war for over a decade.<br/>After a young recruit sees his whole squadron being slaughtered in the battlefields, he goes on a one-man army quest to save his homeland.<br/><br/>Cold Ground is an aesthetically MSX-inspired action RPG with an open world environment. With the mission to locate and kill the enemy general and to locate and destroy the enemy military aid; the player must explore the country of Milata and part of Dalina, in search of enemies to kill, POWs to rescue, and money and weapons to loot.<br/>Cold Ground mixes the RPG/action-adventure aspects of MSX and other personal computer from the 1980s, with the arcade-style shooting of second generation consoles.
