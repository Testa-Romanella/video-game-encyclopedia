But this knight is completely stupid, so it will be up to you to save him from his own temerity! <br/></p>\n\n<p>This character will have to cross each of the 12 levels by passing over the actions you ask him to perform: change direction, attack, take a short break... Without this, he will run into a wall or an enemy and the level will start again. On the way, take the time to collect clues to find the Holy Grail! <br/></p>\n<p>You can play the game for free and give us feedback, it will give us strength and allow us to improve it!
