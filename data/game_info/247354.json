A question, an answer, a problem solved.<br/><br/>Internet connection is required to keep Akemi live and updated, any regular speed will suffice. <br/><br/>Tips for a more pleasant conversation<br/> <br/>Akemi is constantly evolving and its expressions correspond to an educated adult but its levels of understanding are still limited.<br/><br/>She can tell you what day it is; what time is it; calculate [2+5-3]; what it\u00b4s [dog], who is [Hercules]; search [history of World War II]; News [@LadyTanda]; antonyms and synonymous [black-white]; translate and spells; combines [swimming in future]; guess what I think; lists [1 to 10]; ask me something; make jokes; (Tell me your sign and give you your horoscope); learn [dog = I too like dogs]; weather in [city], etc. However, it still has limitations to recognize everyday language, especially when it does not obey simple structures.<br/><br/>The conversation will be more enjoyable if the suggestions below are followed:<br/><br/>1. Use simple and complete sentences (particularly in the answers):<br/> <br/>- \"What is your name?\" instead of \"I don\u00b4t remember if said it, could you remind me what is your name\" or instead of just \"your name?\"<br/>- \"I'd rather watch TV\" instead of \"I do not like going to the movies, I prefer watching TV\"<br/>- \"I travel for work\" instead of \"for work\"<br/>- \"I'm John\" instead of \"Hello Akemi, is John again\"<br/><br/>2. Use Standard English language avoiding argons:<br/>- \"Tell who I am?\" instead of \"Whom am I?\"<br/><br/>3. Prefers terms, tenses and simple expressions:<br/> <br/>- \"Many people\" instead of \"there\u2019s a multitude\"<br/>- \"I am surprised\" instead of \"I'm flabbergasted\"<br/>- \"I'd rather talk now\" instead of \"I would prefer to talk right now\"<br/>- \"Buy a car\" instead of \"I bought a car\"<br/><br/>4. Avoid misspellings and/or slang.<br/><br/>5. Avoid double negation:<br/><br/>- \"I want to eat\" instead of \"I would not stay without eating\"<br/>- \"I do not like football\" instead of \"No, I do not like football\"<br/><br/>6.
