My name is Rafael, (rafachan for you ;)). Do you remember this wonderful game? When I was a kid, I was totally in love with it, and, well... As you can see, the love story continues ^^\u00b4\u00b4<br/></p>\n<p>This humble remaster tries to be 100% faithful to the original, although, the first step to create it was 4 years ago, the total development time, is about 8 or 9 months (5/6 hours a day). My wish is to the full game, 100% clone, but, it still not.<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game and follow his evolution. Thank you for playing! :)</p>\n<p>PD: If you are a graphics artis and whant to help me to restore backgrounds, please, contact me here or go @turtlesarcade and add me. Your name will be in the game,\u00a0\u00a0thank you very much.\u00a0</p>\n<p>rafachan</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53a/53adcbe92027f4912e2d43b7f67e9953.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 233, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["rafaturtle"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
