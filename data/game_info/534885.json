An idea quickly sprung to my mind, when I reminisced about playing \"Voltorb\u00a0Flip\" in Pok\u00e9mon and Minesweeper.\u00a0<br/>Why not mix different ways to gain incomplete Information in a grid puzzle?<br/>With that general idea I tried to cram Picross and Minesweeper together into one game.<br/>I wanted to reward using as few pieces of information as possible to complete the picture. This little game is what I came up with in the limited time before the holidays.</p>\n<p>I hope Bears enjoys it!<br/>Making a game for someone else in a gamejam was a nice motivation.<br/>I would encourage everyone to join the next Secret Santa Jam.<br/><br/>~Sadtwig</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T05:22:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32e/32e979e58f43bacd4a970d087db87881.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Sadtwig"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
