A creature which is neither alive nor dead has taken residence here.\" <br/><br/>The game is a small dungeon crawler made for the Dungeon Crawler Jam 2021.<br/><br/>All the game mechanics existed before the jam. My goal during the jam week was to make a game creating all content from scratch using only my new game editor, without additionnal coded content, to see what can come from it. I also wanted to try to use illustrations from old books as assets.<br/><br/>The game is short and unambitious due to the time limitation, I hope the dungeon mechanics makes for a pleasant experience anyway. It should take about one hour to complete.</p>\n\n<p>Credits to :<br/>- Music by Louise Byrne : https://louisebyrnemusic.com/<br/>- Wall textures and grass by Nevrax SARL / Winch Gate Properties Ltd.
