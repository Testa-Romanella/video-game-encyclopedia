Try to get ready without using up too much energy (spoons). Both autism community veterans and those who don't know much about autism can learn something from this game! The information within comes from community knowledge, lived experience, and statistics from recent studies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game takes no skill to play, the goal is merely to approach things from an autistic perspective and learn. You never know what might make you lose spoons - but that's okay! \"Mistakes\" are encouraged, and dialogue trees may be taken multiple times.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>10-15 minute playtime</strong>\u00a0~\u00a0<strong>25 interactable objects\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>(Educators are welcome to use A New Morning in classroom settings.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Game and art by Luka Ezekiel\u00a0</p>\n<p>Music by Riley Harper\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T03:39:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b5/2b5a2578d310a9748dae13ff09d091bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PsychHound"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
