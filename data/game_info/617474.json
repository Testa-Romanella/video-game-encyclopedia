Just click around under the title, specifically just a little ways under the period at the end,\u00a0until the screen fades to white.</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>Play as a person who is struggling to juggle their relationships and connections. Social anxiety is something that plagues many, and makes it very difficult and stressful to maintain many connections between others. Make connections by moving into others, influence your relationship with them by left clicking on anyone that you have connections with, and avoid things that could potentially harm that relationship (colored in red). Occasionally, a toxic relationship may form, which will require all of your attention until you forcefully remove yourself from it. Making connections may be difficult, but with the proper care, they can harmonize into something beautiful.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD to move the selected person.</li><li>Move into another person to form a connection, represented by a chain with hearts.</li><li>Left click on any connected person to switch your control to them.</li><li>Carefully maneuver your relationships to avoid the stresses (indicated in red).</li><li>Stresses will separate a connection: if a person that you (the starting person) were at one point connected to has their ties severed from you, they are lost forever.</li><li>Create more relationships to add more layers to the music! Toxic relationships are indicated by a red chain and dissonant additions to the soundtrack (dissonance sometimes occurs without reason due to bug).</li><li>There are 3 different tracks to choose from near the beginning, with varying levels of difficulty determined by the speed of the music. Make sure to check out all 3!</li><li>The game ends once you have made at least one connection, and then again are reduced to zero.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T06:43:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9b/e9bd794773f7fbaaf641c9a5aaf0ed56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Snazziful"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
