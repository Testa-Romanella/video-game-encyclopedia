This is also my second attempt at making this game. The first attempt was earlier in the year the first time this jam came round and it did not go well ending in what could be classified as a prototype. This time I got the game done though it did cost me a lot of sleep on the last day of the jam staying up past 4AM.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>The land of Crayon Drawings is a simple adventure/puzzle game made using Phaser 3. I drew the graphics with the Windows 7 version of mspaint and limited myself to the default palette. Paint.net was used\u00a0to add transparency.<br/><br/>The dialogue is quite simple due to how I implement text output not affording me much space. Sound effects are extremity limited to say the least and some of the graphics could do with touching up.<br/><br/>I'm open to feedback so if you ran into any issues or things which you think could be improved feel free to let me know.<br/></p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Mouse over a person or item\u00a0for a description and left click to interact.\r\n</p>\n<p>Left click on an item in the\u00a0inventory\u00a0to equip it.\r\n</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Graphics &amp; code by me.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>SFX credits below:</p>\n<p>Generic pickup sound by slamaxu\r\n</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/slamaxu/sounds/509879/\r\n</p>\n<p>Walk In The Park Full by Audionautix is licensed under a Creative\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Commons Attribution 4.0 license.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\r\n</p>\n<p>Artist:\u00a0http://audionautix.com/<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\"Well Done\" Copyright 2013 by Iwan Gabovitch <qubodup.net> multi-licensed under\u00a0Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license\u00a0and/or GPLv3+\u00a0</qubodup.net></p>\n<p><http: gpl.html=\"\" licenses=\"\" www.gnu.org=\"\"></http:></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T07:15:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/490/490a8d30fd775b516d54a2467e1af203.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dabski"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
