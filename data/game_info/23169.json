It's initially very simple, and the game can be mastered immediately, but watch out: there's competition, and not everyone can win!<br/>Whether you're bold or more careful, you have to be more cunning than your adversaries by finding the best strategy to conquer the most space. But be careful! You have a weak spot: your tail. If an enemy touches it, that's the end for you.<br/>Try to stay ahead, because victory in Paper.io is never certain until you possess all the territory. Stealing is allowed, and your enemies won't hesitate to do so.<br/>After the success of Quiz Run, 1 Pic 8 Words, and Bool, Voodoo now offers you a new gaming and graphics experience inspired by io type games (made popular by agar.io). Enjoy the simplicity and strategy of an io game in a world with unique graphics.<br/>Paper.io is for the whole family and doesn't require an Internet connection.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-29T07:35:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b37/b3763411e79f290238c743c3b994d75c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Voodoo"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Voodoo"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
