Make good choices and you'll get to class. Make poor choices and you might get pummeled. We all remember how awkward\u00a0middle school was and this game is a little homage to that as well.<br/></p>\n<p>It's a classic point-n-click adventure game type of game play.\u00a0It was created in under 48 hours for the Utah Indie Games Jam, and I used Unity with the Adventure Creator plug-in.\u00a0Hope you enjoy it!</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: Even though this is a humorous take on the subject, \"bullying is not a game\"!
