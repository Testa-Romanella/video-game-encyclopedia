We are looking for constructive feedback and we'd be super happy if you'd consider joining our Discord community. We will eventually charge for for the game but during early development it will be free.\u00a0</em></p>\r\nStory\r\n<p>You have been abducted by aliens that plan to have you as their main course.\u00a0 Luckily for you the aliens are not the sharpest knife in the drawer and you are able to find a gun and escape.\u00a0 Now you need to fight through throngs of aliens and ultimately find your way back to earth.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Use WASD keys to move, mouse to look left or right and fire . You can also use a gamepad to play this game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Find the portal on each level and defeat aliens to get XP. If you die you have the option to level up your character.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you get lost you can bring up a map by pressing M on your keyboard or X on your controller.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nCurrent state\r\n<p>Alienstein is in early development and it doesn't have a lot of features. There is only 1 alien type implemented\u00a0and the game will never end, it just gets harder and harder as you complete the levels. Levels are randomly generated so each session will be different.\u00a0 In future updates we will add\u00a0 more stats, more aliens and boss fights. \u00a0</p>\r\nWhat to expect\r\n<p>The game experience will most likely contain a lot of bugs and hiccups. Our goal is to update the game on a monthly basis or more often if we have new content that we want to test.\u00a0Save files are not guaranteed to work in future updates.\u00a0 The game contains a fair amount of low resolution gore and crude humor so it is not suitable for kids.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T07:00:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/001/0015118108aba9c4221ccb759c202746.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pretty Fly Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
