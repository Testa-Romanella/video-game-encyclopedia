{"id": 127414, "slug": "nothing-here-2", "name": "Nothing Here", "name_original": "Nothing Here", "description": "<p>My 2nd game. It's also an interactive story and it was made over the course of a few months.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is about trying to remember something. Something important that shouldn't be forgotten, no matter how painful it may be to remember.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is a tad longer than my first game was. It lasts about 2-3 hours if you take your time and check everything and about\u00a0 1-2 hours if you go as fast as you can.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The controls are:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Esc. = menu button</p>\n<p>Arrow keys = walking</p>\n<p>Shift + Arrow keys = running</p>\n<p>Enter= talk/check something\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was hard for me to finish. After about two months of working on it, I gave up and a month or so later I re-made the whole game. I almost ended up giving up on the game again, but decided that I had gotten too far into it and needed to finish it no matter how bad or how dumb I thought it was.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game has voice acting. Why? Well I wanted to try it out and see if it was possible to do voices in an RPG maker game. I found out that it is possible and that it is also a lot of work. I voiced every character in this game and I am not a professional voice actor, so um... It's not great. But it's not absolutely terrible either.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If I ever make a third game, it most likely will not have voice acting in it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Is this a sequel to my first game? Yeah... Kind of.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I mean, you can play it without having played the first game and still somewhat understand what's going on. However, if you play my first game (How Happy Are You?) first before playing this one, you may understand it a bit better. However, a lot of people complained of that game being confusing and having annoying audio so maybe it's best if you just don't play that game...\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are 3 endings in this game: A \"Bad\" ending (which results in a Game Over), a \"Neutral\" ending, and a \"True\" ending.\u00a0</p>\n<p>None of these endings are particularly hard to get, though the True Ending does require a bit more exploration and puzzle-solving than the others.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Important Note: <strong>CHECK EVERYTHING</strong>. Seriously. Tables. Boxes. Pots. Almost anything you see can be checked on with the enter button. If you get stuck, check stuff. Also you can talk to some characters multiple times, so even after talking to them a first time, you may want to talk to them again as they may say something new. Checking certain objects, carrying certain items, or talking to certain characters about certain topics, may allow you to talk to a character about something new. Talking to characters can give you hints about what to do next, though most of the time talking to them will only result in pointless dialogue that has nothing to do with anything, but it can be fun to listen to.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also this game is kinda sad. I wouldn't play it if you're currently happy because it might make you sad.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you need help with anything, I might help you if you leave a comment. I'm also very socially awkward so I may shy away from conversations sometimes. Sorry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also if something is severely broken about my game (which hopefully nothing is... I've played my game many times over and I haven't run into anything serious...) please let me know and I will try to fix it. You shouldn't need the\u00a0VX Ace RTP to run it and if for whatever reason you do need that to run it... Please tell me so I can try to fix that. </p>\n<p>Lastly the game is free and you can donate if you want to, but you don't have to.</p>\n<p>Lastly x2: In my first game people told me that the audio was too loud so in this game the audio of everything has been lowered a lot. It actually might be too quiet now... So you may want to turn up your volume a little before playing the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>...I am terrified of submitting this but here goes nothing...\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e05/e058c3fc1e6dd0b01e04a327edef5342.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["invalid ghost"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
