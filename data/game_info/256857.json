This here is a game i've been working on for a little more than a year. Its started out as a first person shooter, but have changed quite a while since then. So now its has this, some might say, unconventinal control style. But hey, if you have a Vive or a 360 Oculus setup, give it a try!</p>\n<p>Note; I haven't tried it on oculus myself, so i cant say for sure if it works.</p>\n<p>There were a lot of features i wanted to add to this, but right now it only has the very basic play components. You start in a randomly generated maze and you need to find your way to the boss and.. murdulate it. So, no weapon pickups or other powerups. There are health pickups though :) The dream would be to put all kinds of weird enemies and weapons and stores and keys and levels and bosses in there. But now, i really need to know if anyone besides me and a handfull of friends think this is fun?</p>\n<p>So if you play this, please leave me some feedback and if you think this could work as a fully featured game, that you might even want to pay some money for?</p>\n<p>Good? good!</p>\n<p>/Erik</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/249/2490d9b3ed651464ada8bdbcac6dd6c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 206, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MadGnolas"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
