{"id": 500616, "slug": "travelsolar", "name": "travelsolar", "name_original": "travelsolar", "description": "According to the current astronomical observation and exploration, the solar system is composed of the sun and nine planets. They are the sun, mercury, Venus, earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. This game is to fly a spaceship from earth orbit to the moon first. Then gradually explore all the planets in the solar system and their satellites, during which the spacecraft needs to refuel many times. If the spacecraft runs out of fuel or is hit by a meteorite in the process of exploration, the spacecraft will crash and the entire exploration mission will fail.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI always had a dream when I was a child. I hope I can fly a spaceship to explore the whole solar system when I grow up. When I grew up, I found that it could only be a dream, until one day I created the \"sun travel\" game. I found that my childhood dream can be realized. Come on, let's realize the dream of \"solar system travel\".", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T01:57:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff4/ff498e2875c4a98ec1bcdbc9f2d51771.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["guang zhou xi pu wang luo ke ji you xian gong si"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["guang zhou xi pu wang luo ke ji you xian gong si"], "esrb_rating": null}
