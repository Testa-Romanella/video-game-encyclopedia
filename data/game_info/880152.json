I'm C_Hex, but you can call me C.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This is Project_PerfectDemise, a project I made in a few days. It's my first game ever, and I just wanted to see how people might like it. I'm unsure if I will continue forward with this, or if this is just a one-time thing. Regardless, I hope you all enjoy this for what it is!\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0If you're wondering what this is about, I personally think it's best to go in blind, but before you do, I do have some warnings.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The game does have bright colors and high contrast images. In addition, there are hints of abduction, missing people, dark themes, etc. I just want to put that here in case of anything.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0If you're wanting more information on what the game is about, all I can say is that this game is weird. You play as Peter, and you play him while he's having a conversation with Dr. Heart.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That's all I can really say.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you like this and want me to continue, let me know! Same goes for general feedback, or anything you think I should change. Also let me know if you run into any problems or errors. I'm here to help!\u00a0</p>\n<p>That's all I have to say for now. I hope you all enjoy this for what it is. Who knows, maybe there will be a version 0.1 someday!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Be safe and happy everyone! See you around!</p>\n<p>\u00a0:}\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T08:18:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90e/90ed079dccfa38326c07775967b1fbfb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Known_As_C_Hex"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
