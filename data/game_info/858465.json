Take control of the <strong>Furafura</strong>\u00a0Spacecraft, and help us in this <strong>arcade shoot-them-up</strong>\u00a0adventure. You can <strong>invite a friend</strong>\u00a0to play with you in co-op! Beware, the control of the Furafura is not as easy as you think... \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 It should be noted that this is not the first time that intergalactic mines appear in the galaxy. The first assault took place on the Vectrex, in 1982. We called this a <strong>'Minestorm'</strong>\u00a0Now it takes place on Windows, in C++ with <strong>raylib library</strong>\u00a0rendering tools. The mathematics and physics tools are <strong>made-in home</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>----\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You need some explanations to drive the spaceship, right? Well, I understand that <strong>Newton's laws</strong> don't help. I hope you know a little about <strong>inertia </strong>and <strong>acceleration</strong>. \u00a0</p>\n\r\nMOVEMENT \u00a0\r\n<p>When you press <strong><em>'R'</em></strong>, your ship activates its engine and accelerates. It will accelerate to a maximum speed. If you stop, the inertia will transport the ship further. \u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>With practice, you will be able to turn easily with \u00a0<em>'D'</em>\u00a0and <em>'G'</em></p>\n\n\n<p>In an extreme situation, you can press <em>'E'</em>\u00a0or <em>T'</em>\u00a0to teleport the ship to a <em>*(almost)*</em> safe place. \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\nDESTRUCTION \u00a0\r\n<p>Your mission is to destroy the mines! Shoot in front of you by pressing <em>'F'</em>. Aim at the mines, and they will <strong>explode</strong> <em>(don't worry, the explosion is not deadly)</em>. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>You too, you can be destroy! This is the reason why these mines are dangerous. If they touch you... You have 3 lifes though. \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Now you know everything you have to know. <strong>Go! Save the galaxy!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T11:39:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/450/450c197a634e1e8690515d228e38b397.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fura-i"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
