Biten and thus infected, Anling has her lifespan cut to mere days as she has to protect her son Cody and hopefully find a safer environment. The game\u2019s steam page reports that a main goal in the game will to pass on your knowledge and skills to your son before it\u2019s too late, meanwhile fending off hunger, thirst, and the undead. For example, early gameplay shows Cody running around helplessly while his mother fires a pistol at zombies and later on can join her in self-defense. The game features your protagonist nearly turning as well during a cutscene.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-15T20:31:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6f/b6f4462eea28350a6f094684236658e8.jpg", "website": "https://vanimals.net", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 7, "owned": 80, "toplay": 18, "dropped": 1, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 117, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 181, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC", "Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Vanimals"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Vanimals"], "esrb_rating": null}
