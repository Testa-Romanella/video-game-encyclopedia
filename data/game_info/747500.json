Your mana drains with each fireball you shoot. There also seems to be a ghost following you... it doesn't hurt when it gets close. Despite you knowing it is not real it still dashes your focus; making it harder to cast your magic.</p>\n<p>I apologize about the subpar quality of my game.\u00a0I am very new to developing games and had a busy week with school. However, I am trying to learn, and I thought completing a game for a game jam would be a good way to start. If you take the time to play then thank you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T12:07:52", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tiny Ryno"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
