Well MicroKart can help you relive your childhood as you race across the table, the living floor and more.  Weave your way between cups, plates and pizza boxes in the table level, or if you're up for a more challenging race try the Living Room floor.  MicroKart combines realistic 3D graphics and addicting gameplay, as you guide your car through the courses.  When you think you've got what it takes to race with the pros, try your hand at the racing Mode and race against the computer.  Be careful not to miss the checkpoints, or you'll be left in the dust.<br/><br/>Controls are simple to use and fun.  Use the gas and brake buttons to control your speed and tilt your device to steer.<br/><br/>MicroKart is the perfect game for anyone who enjoyed Fastlane Street Racing, Cro-Mag Rally, Crash Bandicoot Nitro Kart, or Asphalt 4. <br/><br/>Full version coming soon to the app store with more levels, car customization, weapons, and more.  More details coming soon.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:21:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/040/04063e7a018b1129a18feca2130a4592.jpg", "website": "http://microkart.blogspot.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Clever Coding"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Clever Coding"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
