We're very happy with what we achieved in this space of time and we are hoping to continue the development of the game beyond its current state as we didn't have time to implement everything we wanted (this includes the ending).\u00a0</p>\n<p>The current aim of the game is to get to the top of the pyramid to reach the Egyptian God\u00a0Ra, we intended for him to be a final boss but we were unable to finish that in time for the deadline, at the moment nothing happens.</p>\n<p>Please note that there are also some bugs/mistakes that we did not have time to fix. This includes the keypad where the text has not scaled correctly on all resolutions so what you type may not display correctly.<br/></p>\n<p>Please leave your feedback, it would be incredibly helpful to hear your thoughts.</p>\n<p>Made by:</p>\n<p>Team Button Bashers</p>\n<p>Ermdad</p>\n<p>Vermyn</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T12:10:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e5/0e57f8b54be6ecd54cbd6273ed0ef065.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Vermyn", "Ermdad"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
