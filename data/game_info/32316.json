You&#39;re the resourceful human adventurer, the fierce, six-limbed cat, the versatile, flying dragon, and others. But change comes at a price. In one form, you&#39;re quick and agile, but small and fragile. In another, you&#39;re a nearly indestructible giant, but ponderous and slow. You alter shapes at will - and each new form unleashes new powers...and reveals new vulnerabilities.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1993-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-16T16:12:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a1/8a16945b4bceafe7062ce8ddbc531a1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 3, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["id Software", "Raven Software", "Infinity", "INFINITY Co"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts", "Origin Systems"], "esrb_rating": null}
