It's been a long time since we had a scientist such as yourself come visit.</p>\n<p>In Rewilding:\u00a0 the Story of Wolfhead Valley you are a rewilding specialist sent to Wolfhead Valley, to help restore it's natural ecosystem after decades of human disruption.</p>\n<p>For 3 (in-game, very short) years you are going to plant forests, seed meadows, and reintroduce rabbits, deer, and wolves (make sure they all have enough food before you do, or they won't last long!)</p>\n<p>Each spring you will have the ability to add more plants and animals to the valley, then sit back and see how it develops over the rest of the year.</p>\n<p>At the end of the 3 years, your efforts will be judged based on how much wildlife you've managed to keep alive. Good luck!</p>\n<p>Entry for Ludum Dare 46.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T15:43:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d7/6d7790b415d5e9ea9e1daf6b75867e45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ChloeOfArroyo"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
