{"id": 20572, "slug": "dolguth", "name": "Dolguth", "name_original": "Dolguth", "description": "Dolguth is a 2D oldschool brawler for up-to 6 local players. <br/>\r\nChoose your mech to fight in one of the Dolguth arenas and destroy the other warriors. <br/>\r\nEach mech is powered with a melee weapon and a 6-bullets cannon. <br/>\r\nEach pilot has an EMP gun (able to stun mechs) and a grapple to reach impervious zones.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRemember: the pilot of a destroyed mech can repair it ! kill him fast !<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Game requires at least 1 joystick/gamepad for each player.<br/>\r\nKeyboard is supported for single player modes (currently Dungeons and Cliffhanger) but highly discouraged.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGameplay notes:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- press the grab/throw button when (as a pilot) you want to activate a meditower (to spawn the repairing drone)<br/>\r\n- in Dungeon mode you can voluntary eject the pilot from the mech (to open gates or activate elevators) by pressing the grab/throw button for 2 seconds<br/>\r\n- generally to re-enter into a mech you just need to go over it. The only exception is Dungeon mode where you need to press grab/throw<br/>\r\n- press grab/throw (as a pilot) to enter the gatling turrets (available in some arena) then press the range button to shot<br/>\r\n- the only single player modes are currently the dungeon and cliffhanger, configuring a single player in the other modes is a no-go (you will hear 'ready' for the player but the game will not start)<br/>\r\n- in Dungeon mode, when more than a player is in the game, the camera will always try to spot every alive player until a predefined limit. If the limit is reached, players are required to rejoin themselves.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:08:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3e/b3e2b756b81e2d850468bc4cafa52de7.jpg", "website": "http://dolguth.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 348, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Boiagames"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["20Tab"], "esrb_rating": null}
