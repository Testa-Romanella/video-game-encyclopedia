You must juggle your essence between shadow visions and buildings! Buildings cost essence to build, but in return have a positive effect on the gameplay - from passive essence income to slower enemies.</p>\n\n<p>This game was made in less than 5 days for the 4th Interstellar Garden Game Jam! The theme was \"another dimension\", which is implemented through the different vision dimension that exposes your enemies.<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>- Music: https://svl.itch.io/rpg-music-pack-svl</p>\n<p>- Sound Effects: https://www.kenney.nl/</p>\n<p>- Font: https://managore.itch.io/m6x11<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T14:55:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fa/3fae3b44202f98d73f473a798d3bcac1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["dardasaba"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
