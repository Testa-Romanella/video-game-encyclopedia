{"id": 690355, "slug": "morose", "name": "Morose", "name_original": "Morose", "description": "<p>You moved back to your home town Newcastle in hopes to run away from your newly created history. You begin your college journey in hopes to get on a right path for success. After the death of your parents, you are on your own and have hopes that your childhood crush, Megan, is still single. You want someone to be there for you because your parents left you with nothing after their death. Starting school, you believe you will begin a normal life, until a cute but odd girl has a chat with you. From that moment, she caught your interest. But as she opens up to you, you realize that you cannot have a normal life if you associate yourself with her.\u00a0<br/><br/>Will you find the love you seek? Or will your history and corruption eat you into insanity? Only you can find the answer!<br/><br/>My novel is mainly for story and is NOT adult themed with sex scenes. There will be language and possible partial nudity (due to my novel not being fully developed yet), so if you want a more adult themed game, look elsewhere. Despite this,\u00a0<strong><em>All characters are depicted over the age of 18.</em></strong><br/><br/>You will be able to make choices you want to make that will have certain outcomes. Also depending on the choices you make, you will be able to date up to seven girls in the time being. But sticking with the main story, there is one potential lover.</p>\n<p>Musicroom and gallery menu choices are there but not clickable because I'm debating if I want them. I'm going to have to put the mega links because I have yet to hear back from support about expanding the GB file size.\u00a0</p>\n<p>PC Zip<br/></p>\n<p>https://mega.nz/file/xfhyXLAJ</p>\n<p>Password: VL7FlG84Fj0zUqqx52bmC2Qx2ibPdc7ZJlO8hbc_IqE</p>\n<p>Mac Zip</p>\n<p>https://mega.nz/file/kOojXSRB</p>\n<p>Password: g3vO3G75GOw4JlzJiNv3gRcYRyEyGPvKwOUSjUg0rYc</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T11:21:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a1/0a19b041f84514a6cd52a986e9d3bd90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 214, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Silas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
