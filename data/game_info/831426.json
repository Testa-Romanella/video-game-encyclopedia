Just a little project used to reconnect with game development.</p>\n<p>Roll your dices to get more punctuation than the CPU roll. But be careful, every round has a maximum number that you can not overpass. Choose wisely your dices to get a punctuation between opponent's roll value and the round maximum number.</p><p>\u00a0If you beat all the rounds you will be rewarded with a cool ending!!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>-'Z' to roll dices</p>\n<p>-'Left mouse button' to choose your dices</p>\n<p>-'Esc' to exit game</p>\n\n<p>PS: the game has some minnor bugs that i'm not going to waste time in solving. Just in advice: if a dice is not correctly facing the floor it will not count to punctuation and if a dice end the roll on top of other dice the game will stop working. So good luck\u00a0and have fun :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T16:30:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/605/605bb65525349d482bc379163d6f664e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Ronia"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
