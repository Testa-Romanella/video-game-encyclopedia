The trick is that you can't pass tiles more than once.</p><p>As per the \"5 rules, 5 assets\" guidelines, the 5 rules would be:</p><ol><li>Step on every white block to win</li><li>When you step off a white block, it will turn red and become impassable.</li><li>Teleporter blocks come in pairs and will move you as many times as you can step on them. </li><li>You don't talk about fight club.</li><li>You don't talk about fight club.</li></ol>And the assets used:<ol><li>A cube.</li><li>A quad sprite.</li><li>The lovely Bebas Nueue font.</li><li>A bad song I made for the menu.</li><li>The loop symbol for the \"restart level\" function.</li></ol>Everything else is either shader magic or very hacky use of the rectangular quad shape thing. (Though hell I might have forgotten about something, feel free to call me out on it.)<p>The game is pretty barebones right now so the puzzles are stupidly easy. I plan on addings some more complexity for the sake of fun, but conceptually I'm pretty happy with how this feels.</p><p>Thanks for taking a look. I'll be updating this as I work on it so keep an eye out.</p><p>If you want to get updates, follow me on twitter!</p><p>--</p><p>UPDATE 6/26: I added a \"teleporter\" block. Each teleporter block is connected to another and will swap your location. I didn't really get to making each pair obvious but \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/449/449e0c78c2c84574424c49f62c9c10f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Neil Sveri"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
