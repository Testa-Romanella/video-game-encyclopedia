{"id": 566116, "slug": "missing-arrows", "name": "Missing Arrows", "name_original": "Missing Arrows", "description": "<p>A simple, somewhat goofy,\u00a02D side scroller. You control the player who is an archer. You start the game with a bow but no arrows, so you must kill enemies that happen to drop the components you need to craft arrows for your bow. Your mission is to defeat your arch nemesis The Boss. The Boss is unfazed by head bounces, but fortunately, during his fits of rage, he throws bad guys at you that just so happen to drop ingredients for your arrows when they die. Once you craft your arrows, you can shoot The Boss with them to defeat him. If you're running low on health, shoot chickens with your bow and arrows and they will drop a chicken leg that you can eat and regain some health.</p>\n<p>This game is my submission for the LM0B Beginners Game Jam #16.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Audio:<br/> Player Ouch Sound\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0 OwlStorm, freesound.org<br/> Chicken Death Sound\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0 Gemesil, freesound.org<br/> Rock Crumble Sound\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0 NeoSpica, freesound.org<br/> Wood Crumble Sound\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0 jorickhoofd, freesound.org<br/> Argh Sound\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -\u00a0 kfatehi, freesound.org<br/> Player Head Bounce Sound\u00a0 -\u00a0 timgormly, freesound.org<br/> Collectable Pickup Sound\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -\u00a0 zivs, freesound.org<br/> The Boss SFX\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0 Robinhood76, freesound.org<br/> Bow and Arrow Sounds\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0 brendan89, freesound.org<br/> Arrow Impact Sound\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0 CosmicEmbers, freesound.org<br/> Om Nom\u00a0 Nom Sound\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0 PaulMorek, freesound.org<br/> Level 1 Music\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0 CodeManu, opengameart.org</p>\n<p>Art &amp; Design:<br/> Ground Sprites\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0- MamaNeZakon, itch.io<br/> Other Art &amp; Design - Ephesius</p>\n<p>Programming &amp; Implementation:<br/> Ephesius</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T08:08:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54a/54a295b0f0c1238b32dac43d0cc6e529.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ephesius"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
