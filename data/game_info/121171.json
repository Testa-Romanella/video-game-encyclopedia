Explore the world and find all it's secrets while enjoying breathtaking scenery. This is more so an experiment, but I have put a lot of work into it. There is still a lot left that I have to do, so take that in mind when playing. Otherwise, have fun playing and feel free to send me feedback.</p><p>Note - The web build will most likely be very laggy, so I have included downloadable versions as well.</p><p>Credits</p><p>Sound Effect Credits</p><p>Background</p><p>Author: Kane53126</p><p>URL: https://www.freesound.org/people/Kane53126/sounds/257930/</p><p>Footsteps</p><p>Author: cecileann</p><p>URL: https://www.freesound.org/people/cecileann/sounds/257672/</p><p>Landing</p><p>Author: ceberation</p><p>URL: https://www.freesound.org/people/ceberation/sounds/235521/</p><p>Font Credits</p><p>Main Font</p><p>Author: UnAuthorized Type</p><p>URL: http://www.dafont.com/touch-of-nature.font</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/571/5713323136c5859ba3626915d2f268c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["CAGGames"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
