A kid who will have the destiny of the world in his hands. The action will take place in a strange summer school. In an old and mysterious castle. A forgotten book with strange powers will unleash a fun and dark chaos. And you, in the role of Max Racoon, will have to face this wave of disasters, save the world and free your buddies.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe gameplay is based on classic mechanics of run and gun and shoot \u00b4em up arcade games. We are focused on bringing the player a true arcade feeling experience. But the game also offers mechanics of upgrading equipment and some features for MAX. Moreover we are building an interesting and fun story to create a unique lore for the world of Max Racoon.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe main references of the game are:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Super pang: For the levels structure. </li>\n<li>Metal slug: Thinking about the action mechanics.</li>\n<li>Pop culture: the story has a lot of references to icons of the 80\u00b4s / 90\u00b4s movies, comics, and literature\u2026 etc. Also some actual stuff ;)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe story take place in an old castle that has become a summer school. But the castle hide a lot of secrets. A legendary old book that has the power to open portals between dimensions and times lies there. This book is imbued with the power of the dark matter and has been hidden for millennia. But now Someone has unleashed its power. The portals has been opened and our world has been invaded by hordes of strange, fun and chaotic enemies. And YES, Max Racoon is our only true hope.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe playground where tons of action will take place. We are working to give to the castle a sense of unique visual feeling. We want that the player feels that the scenario is another character and feel it alive. Magic and mistery are the keywords.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t- Max Racoon: The hero. A little rebellious boy that will have to face the situation.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t- Mr. Browsntone: A crazy paramilitar human pelican? Yes. And the guide that will help Max in his adventure.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t- Some crazy enemies: Summoned by the dark matter. Crazy and dangerous. \r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMax and the book of Chaos is our first game as an independent team, so our goal is simply to make a game as good as possible and enjoy in the process. Currently we are at the 20% of developing.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIf you wanna support us, please give us feeback. We will really appreciate that.
