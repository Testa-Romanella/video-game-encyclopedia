Some want to share their stories. Others prefer to listen. This is the life on an innkeeper. This is your life.</p>\n<p>Collect stories told to you by other people and retell them. Of course tales aren't set in stone. You'll change them each time. If your listeners like what they hear they will spread the story further. Also changing it in the process. Some stories will eventually come back to you. A tale about a kid running from a wolf will become an epic legend about a princess slaying a Kraken.</p>\n\n<p>Made in 1 week for VimJam\u00a0(limit: \"collectibles\", theme: \"there and back\").</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T03:59:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c0/1c09c7fc3f015c2a1b7d8a650f1f6285.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Voycawojka"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
