Be careful not to bubble bad items!</p>\n<p>Your <strong>destruction</strong> spell will destroy any non-bubbled baked good it hits.</p>\n<p>You can also <strong>ignore </strong>baked goods, and they will eventually splat. You will be penalized for wasting good items!<br/></p>\n<p>If at any time your profit is at -$300 or below, the store will close.\u00a0(Game Over)</p>\n<p>Final score is based on the number of successful sales.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f01/f014f80c9f4d40e102dd61cb27fb424a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ShibeyFaceGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
