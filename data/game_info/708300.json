I challenged\u00a0 myself to make a working game with as little bugs as possible for the original GameBoy in only 8 hours. This is the first time I've ever made a game outside of messing around with engines like RPG Maker (RPG Maker is NOT used to make this game). I am pretty proud of what I got done in only 8 hours.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once the youtube video is up a link will be posted here!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Moon is a game about a girl wanting to go to the moon.
