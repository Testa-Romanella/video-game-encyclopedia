Hunters work together using the tools provided at base or found around the map to track down, hunt, and ultimately kill the creature of which only stories claim exist.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The first of the creatures to make an appearance in <strong>Something's Out There</strong> is <strong>The Rake</strong>.<br/><br/>Tales exist dating back to the 1600s of a pale skinned human like figure that stalks humans not for a source of food but rather to instill horror merely by its presence.  There does not exist any believable video or photographic evidence of the fabled creature, only fireside stories passed through the generations.  Some stories claim it crawls on all four limbs like a dog, others say it walks upright.  Some picture the being as a vicious beast hunting for game while others state that it merely watches.  Bodies, both human and critter, have been found with claw markings that match the description of the creatures hands, but no other evidence exists of its existence.<br/><br/>Recent sightings of the creature have been reported in the Aposta Forest nearby, venture with your team for your chance to prove its existence.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The game is focused on exploration, patience, and efficient usage of your equipment to accomplish your objective.  The gameplay is not story driven nor linear but rather driven by adventure.  You and up to 3 friends (4 total per lobby) play as adventurers wanting to prove or disprove the existence of these fabled creatures.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-16T03:59:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f62/f628b50cb5be93086f8375c28ad360a8.jpg", "website": "https://somethingsouttheregame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 272, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Informal Tech Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Informal Tech Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
