All three games will follow the same story, but in different genres.</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It all starts with The Last Defense, which is a 3D Tower Defense game, where you play from the eyes of King Severin! You can control your mages and defend your kingdom, making sure that you use their abilities right. The battle will be tough! </p>\n<p> Five nations live in this world and constant war is fought between them. One day, they realised that they are not alone in this world and that a dark force has come threatening to consume all that they know and have. Animals started dying, a thick purple mist appeared in places and once covered by it, nothing could escape, many said. The Great River that split the continent apart was starting to act in strange ways, as if there was something repelling it away and it would run wild. Having noticed the presence of this dark power, people of The Middle Kingdom sent troops to embark on a journey reaching the most northern parts of the continent, where The Great River springs and where the Frost Mages reside. After travelling for days they arrived only to find the whole nation of Frost Mages enveloped by thick glaciers, their all powerful frost spell that once kept the kingdom from freezing over had merely a few dying embers left of it. Despair dwelled upon King Severin, as he had lost his only ally out of all nations, the only mages that he could trust.</p>\n\n\n<p>Don`t forget to hear a piece of the Story on YouTube, because it`s not implemented in the Demo(for spoilers purposes). Check out the video on how I made the game. <strong>Wishlist on Steam always helps !</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCegYE9BTHyKcXX2pUVlVFCA<br/></strong><strong>Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1726290/The_Last_Defense/</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T10:32:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/239/239e1e3d15b64591bef45478f3083abb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 255, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ThugGames"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
