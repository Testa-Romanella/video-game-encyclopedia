You crash landed here many moons ago, all contact with your home planet cut off. You found yourself in an endless desert, the glinting of the dome catching your eye.

It was the only shelter to take from the inhospitable heat of the alien sun.<br/>But the dome does not give shelter freely. In return, it asks for you to fight, to play in its barbaric training programs. To shelter in The Zero Dome, you must survive in The Zero Dome. To survive in The Zero Dome, you must fight in The Zero Dome.<br/>To survive The Zero Dome, you must make use of all the tools available to you.
