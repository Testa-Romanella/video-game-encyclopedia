Demo", "description": "<p>The first two levels of a prototype I created to cover several facets of game design. I learned a lot about 3d physics and character control, created a custom follow camera, made several 3D models in blender that were textured in photoshop, got familiar with Unity's UI system and had some fun with the level design. Greatly improved my knowledge of designing game systems architecture, which can be applied to software architecture in general. Created a custom scoring system,\u00a0 timer, grass and water shaders, and more. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T08:58:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd5/dd5b5bed925a278e990d26b301b587b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jrfiore"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
