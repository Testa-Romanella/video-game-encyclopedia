Blighted by the Darkreign storm, three factions now vie for control of the Karavi throne, willing to slaughter all who oppose them. Meanwhile, the vile branded gnaw at the edges of their territory, ready to usher in an age of darkness that will last forever! Hundreds of lords prepare their hosts for battle, as the winds above roar across the lands!<br/><br/><h3>Take Command!</h3><br/>As a lord of one of the warring realms, you can recruit soldiers to your cause, who will spill their blood to advance your ambitions! For each victory you attain, your prestige grows, allowing you to demand more funds from your throne. But beware, for defeat will dull your position of power, and too many failures will see you dead amongst your soldiers!<br/><br/><h3>Show no mercy!</h3><br/>Your enemies also field lords to advance their plans, both to defend their claims and to expand their territory. Just as lords weaken with each defeat, their realm also fades as their armies shrink in power. Push every advantage, and leave your enemies reeling, unable to defend. Press onwards to their capital city, and claim it as your own to cut off all reinforcements to their remaining forces!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T03:15:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83a/83a3facdb10b89ef997d2706e6f02e74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 240, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rev21"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Rev21"], "esrb_rating": null}
