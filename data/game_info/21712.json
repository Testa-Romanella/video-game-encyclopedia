Jumping, shooting, dodging and exploring is all that's required to help get Tommy to his destination and free his tiny puppy from the clutches of an insane genius school-kid and his brutal sidekick 'Biffa'. It would be straight forward too, if it wasn't for the fact that this journey will take Tommy through Gnarly wood; a twisted and eerie forest that adults avoid let alone tiny children! Imagination runs amok as Tommy confronts his childish fears head on, all in a bid to be reunited with his beloved pal 'Yapz'!</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tKey features:<ul>\n<li>Colorful cartoony 3D graphics and smoothly animated 3D characters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Simple controls &amp; game-play with non-linear level designs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Secrets &amp; bonuses!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> Amusing plot that is suitable for children or adults.</li></li></li></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:07:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f0/8f097fc5d3b101831e4549c84980daae.jpg", "website": "http://www.oasisgames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 22}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 376, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Oasis Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Interplay Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
