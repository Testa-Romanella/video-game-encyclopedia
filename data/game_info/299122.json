NASA frequently commands spacemen explore to unknown planets. You are one of them. During the process, you would face many missions such as collecting rare resources, finding previous missing teammates or fighting with aliens. After all missions completed\u00a0<em><strong>(\u00a0 our game stop on that, but we will update later after this game jam\u00a0\u00a0</strong></em>) , you would bring hopes back to the earth and rebuild the uncompleted homeland. Then you have to explore again and again for human. Earth would possible get revenges from other explored planets randomly. How to balance and maintain earth with other planets is one deep question in the future.<br/></p>\r\n\u00a0Tool used\r\n<ul><li>Unity 2018.3</li><li>Visual Studio</li><li>Photoshop CC</li><li>Adobe illustrator CC</li><li>GarageBand</li><li>Audacity</li><li>Flstudio</li></ul>\r\nGraphics\r\n<p>All the images are created by our teammate Zheyuan Zhou which used <strong>Photoshop CC</strong> and<strong> Adobe illustrator CC 2019</strong> to draw it.
