The concept of the game, that would be explored more in a full release of the game, is that you are a small company who had their money stolen by a tech giant and you need to try and take revenge by taking their money using hackers. There would be a level system, with scaling difficulty. This is just a prototype to figure out if it would be fun to play.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As this is a prototype, there are minimal assets and barebones gameplay so apologies for any issues or glitches. If you experience any issues please let me know in the comments. There is also support for files saves, but this feature will only work on the executable for multiple sessions.</p>\n<p>Coding and Assets - Dragon_Hunter_70</p>\n<p>Music - 3cubedis27</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T12:12:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6a/a6a8c48f0a4ac7a038a4a04a49a09795.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FC Games", "Dragon_Hunter_70", "3cubedis27"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
