Focus on <em><strong>your ship and the bullets around you</strong></em>, and not the enemies flying by!</li><li>You'll see a small blue dot on the \"windshield\" of your ship. <em><strong>That's the only part you need to protect</strong></em>. Bullets will just fly through other parts!</li><li>If you get hit, use your few seconds of invincibility to <em><strong>get to a safer spot</strong></em>!</li><li>Observe the <em><strong>patterns </strong></em>\u2013 flying through a seemingly unavoidable bullet cloud is the most satisfying feeling this genre can offer!</li></ul>\n<p>Like this:</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><strong><em>Arrow keys</em> </strong>to move</li><li><em><strong>C or Space</strong></em> to shoot (just keep pressing it, you have<strong> </strong><em><strong>no reason to let it go</strong></em>!)</li><li><strong><em>X</em> </strong>to turn your \"slow down\" ability on or off \u2013 use it to get through tight spots! Turns off when the <em><strong>blue ba</strong>r</em> is completely drained.</li><li><em><strong>Z or Y</strong> </em>to unleash \"rain of bullets\" (only<strong> </strong><em><strong>when the red bar is full and turns green</strong></em>) \u2013 use it when you need a final blow on a nasty boss. Not only does it increase your fire rate, but also wipes all bullets off the screen!</li><li><strong><em>P</em> </strong>to pause</li><li><em><strong>Esc</strong>\u00a0</em> to Exit</li><li><em><strong>Alt + Enter</strong></em> to toggle full screen. (The window size is determined by <em>Config.xaml \u2013\u00a0</em>edit that file in a text editor to change it.\u00a0That's a bit more difficult than it should be, sorry for that.)</li></ul>\r\nThe current state of the prototype\r\nFeatures!\r\n<ul><li>Three levels with bosses, many mid-level bosses, and \"scriptable\" enemy movement.</li><li>Special abilities: slow-down time and \"rain of bullets\".</li><li>Complex and highly customizable bullet patterns.</li><li>A sophisticated, XML-based level format with a huge focus on flexibility, reusability and extensibility .</li><li><strong><em>NEW in Bullet Bash Edition:</em></strong> Self-adjusting difficulty \u2013 the longer you fly without getting hit, the quicker the game becomes. In turn, getting hit reduces the speed, allowing you to catch your breath.</li><li><strong><em>NEW in Bullet Bash Edition:</em></strong>\u00a0Scoring! Shooting down enemies will now award you with delicious points depending on their toughness and the current difficulty level.</li></ul>\r\nKnown issues\r\n<ul><li>There's no menu or settings. The game just starts when you run it, and you can't restart when you die (or reach the end of the last stage).</li><li>Fixed keybindings with no controller support.</li><li>Only has placeholder assets (hacked together by yours truly), barebones HUD.</li><li>No sounds or music.</li></ul>\n<p>By the way, the game is open source, you can find it here:\u00a0https://github.com/madve2/dance-of-bullets<br/></p>\r\nAppendix: making your own levels\r\n<p>Looking at the current selection of bullet hell games, while there's definitely a plenty of them, there's one aspect of <em><strong>Dance of Bullets</strong></em>\u00a0that feels unique to me: its flexible, highly extensible and easy-to-create format for levels, enemies and bosses, that could make it possible for everyone to create their own bullet hell shmup without programming knowledge of any kind.</p>\n<p>While I've yet to make a proper documentation for the level format of Dance of Bullets,\u00a0open the files in the <em>StageData </em>folder with your favorite text editor and start tweaking! You will be able to\u00a0add your own levels, enemies, bullet patterns and bosses in no time!\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can find some pointers until I write a proper documentation here:\u00a0https://github.com/madve2/dance-of-bullets#making-your-own-levels</p>\n<p>If you made something cool I'd be super glad to hear about it \u2013\u00a0in the comments below, or any other location you find appropriate!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/376/37694ae9fc5b6f2e8d1ceef2e3c56900.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["madve2"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
