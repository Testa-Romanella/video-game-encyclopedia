In order to keep your village alive,\u00a0you need to slay BEASTS, and bring back their meat. You\u00a0start the game on the world map. Click an adjacent space to travel there for the next day. After choosing a space, you'll be sent to the game view.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>In the game view, you progress to the right and fight beasts along the way. Large beasts will have a health bar, and drop more meat than small beasts on death. If you die\u00a0during\u00a0combat, your village will come to save you, at the expense of some of the village's food and half of your items. If you damage a large beast, but fail to slay it, it will be marked as (DAMAGED) on the world map.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are two different types of spaces: grassy and craggy. Craggy spaces hold more small beasts, and grassy spaces hold more herbs. Herbs are a valuable plant used to make powerful healing potions, which heal\u00a025 health. You can also choose to eat meat for yourself, giving you an extra 10 max stamina, but the effects will fade quickly. If your village starves, You will lose the game. Also, check the leaderboard to see if you got a highscore! :)</p>\n\r\nCONTROLS:\r\n<p><strong>World Map:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Move to Space: Left Click</li><li>Back to Main Menu: ESC/P</li><li>Zoom In/Out: Scroll Wheel</li><li>Move Map: Middle Mouse/Shift+Left Click</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Game View:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Move Left/Right: A/D</li><li>Jump: W</li><li>Slash: Left Click</li><li>Stab: Right Click</li><li>Roll: Space</li><li>Use Item: E</li><li>Collect Herb: F</li></ul>\n\r\nCREDITS:\r\n<ul><li>CodeRed: Programming, and everything else (apart from music and art)</li><li>Golden Disguise: Art and ideas man</li><li>Bulthardt: Some of the music</li><li>Keegan Clark: Some more of the music</li></ul>DEV LOG:<ol><li>\u00a0Fixed an issue with the leaderboard, and a typo in the Hunter's Guide</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T16:49:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a8/3a872097a5f235c690d254936b9c34f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CodeRedYT"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
