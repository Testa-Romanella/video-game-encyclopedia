This is the part where we , two very poor struggling indie devs, ask YOU , incredibly good looking and wonderfully intelligent people, for money, the big easy, the green monster, the cheese, the cheddar, the green backs. We put a lot of time and effort into our games, we have no funding from big corporate fat cats.. though if you know of any we may have our arms twisted into some shilling!! Seriously, if you give us money to support our project we promise only to spend it on drugs and prostitutes. REALLY SERIOUSLY!!! We appreciate anything that you can support our game making journey, if you cannot afford it please just enjoy our game and perhaps give some feedback, either way. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!</p>\n\n<br/><br/>\n<p>A.C.F is a fast paced action space shooter that harkens back to a simpler age of ARCADE MAGIC!!  We have tried to capture what it was like in the golden age of gaming, SCORE was king and keeping those initials at the top of the arcade cabinet was not only a  source of pride, it was a right of passage for any true gamer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0You are a lonely ship, starting out with a simple single shot weapon to face the hordes of menacing aliens bend upon your destruction. The more you kill, the more energy you collect which starts to power your WEAPONS BAR. The WEAPONS BAR is packed with devastating  weapons that allow you to begin a circle of destruction that , if you are smart, can be never ending. Balance your abilities, do you keep selecting the low end weapons to get a short term kick or do you wait through waves of destructive enemy bullets so that you can access the truly god like destruction of the larger weapons on the bar? The choice is yours. <br/><br/></p>\n<br/><br/>\n<ul><li>ENDLESS WAVES OF JUICY DESTRUCTABLE ALIEN SCUM! </li><li>UNLOCKABLE WEAPONS FROM THE SHIPS WEAPONS BAR. </li><li>ALL RENDERED IN BRIGHT VIBRANT PIXEL ART. </li><li>DIFFERENT ENEMY TYPES\u00a0\u00a0 WITH THEIR OWN WEAPON SYSTEMS. </li><li>CONSTANTLY UPDATING. </li><li>(coming soon) BOSS BATTLES. </li><li>(coming soon) NEW WAVE MECHANICS. </li><li>(coming soon) INITIALS ENTRY LIKE A REAL ARCADE.</li><li> (coming soon) EVEN MORE INSANE DESTRUCTIVE WEAPONS.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T09:39:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/107/107dc08958730702a2b8bc9036f58633.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SavageAsylumGames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
