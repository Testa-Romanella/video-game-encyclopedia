All the programming was done in Blueprints.</p>\n<p>I'm hoping to make a big comeback to UE4 (or maybe even UE5) this semester for a senior project so I hope you enjoy this quirky little game of mine! I do not intend on extending this demo any further although I may return to this idea someday.</p>\n<p>- Mechwolf\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>Quick premise: You are an interdimensional traveler loses their memory after a journey through spacetime goes wrong.
