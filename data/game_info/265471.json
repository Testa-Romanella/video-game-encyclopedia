Maneuver your way through a three dimensional maze using your control over color itself to your advantage. Recover each of the prisms to ultimately escape... the PRISOM.</p>\n<p>Created by:<br/>Rebecca Anisman</p>\n<p>Rebecca grew up collecting Pokemon games, playing RPGs, and losing to her brother in Smash (many controllers were broken). She didn't realize game design was an actual job she could have until high school and has been working towards her dreams ever since. She has thrown 100% less controllers in the last 8 years despite the occasional stupid-fix\u00a0programming rage.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aaron Cendan</p>\n<p>Aaron got his start building custom controllers for gamers with hand problems while pursuing a degree in music. The interests later merged and he's moved on to composition, sound design, and audio engineering for games. Super Smash Bros Melee for the Nintendo Gamecube is the greatest game of all time don't @ me. Actually though, please reach out @SticklessGC.</p>\n<p>Josh Navarro</p>\n<p>Josh has a\u00a0background in management and has switched focus to game design in the past year, specializing\u00a0in Level and Tech Design. When not playing games, he is an avid portrait and landscape photographer. He met Stan Lee, too. Just saying.</p>\n<p>Alejandro Perez-Acevedo</p>\n<p>Josh Wade</p>\n<p>Josh has been programming for 5 years and drawing blueprints for 2 months. His hobbies include writing, running, inventing words, and\u00a0smerdling. One day, he might have his very own website.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29e/29eabb473c44ab3f9cf547e9fa9fbcdb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Origami Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
