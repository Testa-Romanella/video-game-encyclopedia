On the opposite side you have a powerful and ruthless opponent, the H-Drone (DRON HYBRIDS) - a combination of high-tech sophisticated drones of the latest generation and genetically modified insects, controlled by a CYBERNETIC QUEEN from a hidden brood.<br/>Fate is really toying with you at this moment, as you fly your combat aircraft to meet the fire, smoke, poisonous fumes and H-Drones. Under their numerous and persistent invasion, the once glistening streets full of life sink into twilight.<br/>The city administration, or what is left of it, expects from you the almost impossible to bring life back to this unfortunate city with your courage and skill and prevent it from sinking into even deeper chaos.<br/>It will not be easy for you. Opposite you is an opponent who knows no fear. With unseen persistence, he lurks his chance - the wrong maneuver that you will perform with your combat aircraft - to knock you down with a fatal shot or maneuver - Turbo Attack - directly crashing into you.<br/>The invasion of the H-Drones is in the sign of a LARGE NUMBER that pulls victory to their side, and the conflict to the sign of total asymmetry. Your victory will mean that NUMBER is not everything.<br/>For now, at this level, the fight is not over yet. With each next level, you will be closer to the final showdown with the core of the threat - the CYBERNETIC QUEEN and her brood. But your combat path to the C-QUEEN\u00a0 is long and full of obstacles. Try not to let your struggle end in infinity.<br/>Therefore, bravely manage your combat aircraft, because NUMBER may not be everything !!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T03:47:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/749/74995e0f23797eaed93b888f1c564c79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tihomir Bajtek"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
