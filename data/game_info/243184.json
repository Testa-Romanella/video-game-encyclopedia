Take your Federation or Klingon fleet to new frontiers, and battle new enemies.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt has been many years since the return of the USS Voyager and the galaxy was first introduced to the extradimensional realm of fluidic space. Species 8472, the violent, xenophobic beings indigenous to fluidic space, returned to their realm after forming an uneasy truce with Starfleet and the Voyager crew, who had turned over one of their nanoprobe warheads as a show of good faith.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNot convinced the truce would last, the Federation and Klingon Empire secretly began researching and evaluating the potential future threat posed by 8472. During this intense period of research, one of Starfleet\u2019s new Fluidic Research Centers detected a strange anomaly within the Alpha Quadrant, similar to the rifts previously created by Species 8472.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRealizing that this was a rare chance to research an active quantum anomaly, Starfleet Command and the Klingon Empire independently sent small fleets to secure the area around it for analysis.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe fleets left from nearby starbases, expecting a simple mission to escort researchers to the anomaly\u2019s location. Little did they know that this was just the latest step in a long-running trap engineered by Species 8472 to better understand the strengths and capabilities of their new Alpha and Beta Quadrant enemies", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:53:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb2/eb206d662787f77a8b3cec7c40551c04.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 266, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["GameSamba"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["Global Genom Corporate"], "esrb_rating": null}
