As of right now you can play around with the 4 weapons I've added to put some holes in the shooting range.</p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT </strong>as far as I know if a controller is plugged in this messes up the camera a lot. So if you're experiencing problems, and a controller is plugged in, first try to unplug that and see if the issues are fixed.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Press Escape to see all of the controls for the game.</p>\n<p>If you'd like, leave a comment and let me know what you think of what I have so far!\u00a0I know it's not much right now but I'm at the point where I'd love to hear any input :)</p>\n<p>As of my plans now for the game I'm going to be completely redoing how I\u00a0handle the player/weapon animations.
