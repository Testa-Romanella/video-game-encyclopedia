Jump! is a game in which you accompany our character to get to the office on time, but it won't be easy, strange creatures have arrived in the city, you have to dodge them!\r\n\r\n\n<p>\n</p><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe music is by Nojisuma, here you can find his work on Pixabay:\r\nhttps://pixabay.com/es/users/nojisuma-23737290/\r\nThe sounds are from kenney, on this same platform: https://kenney.itch.io/\r\nThank you both for your generosity.\r\n\r\nThe game has some problems, the animations sometimes don't play as they should, but the most serious problem is with some collisions.
