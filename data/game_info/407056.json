{"id": 407056, "slug": "blues-jam-simulator", "name": "Blues Jam Simulator", "name_original": "Blues Jam Simulator", "description": "<p>Jamming blues music is one of the staples of playing music together with fellow musicians. Because of its standard format and scale, anyone who knows these things even a little can jump in and join the fun that is improvising music together with other people. Sadly most non-musicians never get to experience this, so I thought I'd try to find a way to simulate it somewhat.</p>\n<p>This is not really a game per se, but more an online toy / educational experience sort of thing. The idea is that there's a virtual piano you can play with the keyboard of your computer. The twist is that you can only play notes that are in a blues pentatonic scale, which means that basically all notes will sound alright. To have something to play along with, I've recorded a bunch of backing tracks on guitar which provide a standard 12-bar blues framework. This way you can jam out on the virtual piano along with my guitar playing, so we're effectively jamming together :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T02:17:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/355/355ea1e93a6a9feea770123f0268d5d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tijn"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
