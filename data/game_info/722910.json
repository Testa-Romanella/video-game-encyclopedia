However, this quickly developed into something bigger and I decided to make an actual game (my first real one!) out of this.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, this project actually reached a state I feel comfortable with publishing (although it probably is poorly balanced and the general game mechanic is still a bit basic).</p>\n<p>I still have a lot of ideas on how to extend the game to make it more interesting but I haven't yet decided how / if to continue the development - it already took a lot of time and I'm not sure if it's really woth it.</p>\n<p>Anyway - Let me know if you like it!<br/></p>\r\nTech Stuff\r\n<p>The game is pure javascript (although written in Kotlin) so technically you only need a browser with WebGL2 support\u00a0to run it. However, I strongly recommend using Chrome, other browsers might work as well but will probably be very slow.</p>\n<p>Also graphics is rather sophisticated, so this won't run on mobile devices.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T04:13:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/349/34921f712adff9a5a32cf1e4b5a1fc3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["fabmaxx"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
