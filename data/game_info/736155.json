Its European publisher (JVC Music Europe) closed down before they were able to print and release the game, but review copies were already sent to gaming magazines and websites. This English PAL edition of the game was considered vaporware for many years, until recently when a collector found one of these reviews copies.</p>\n<p>David Goldman, intrepid newspaper photographer extraordinaire, goes on assignment to capture wild and wacky events on film. Under seemingly normal circumstances which can quickly get out of hand, David clicks and snaps opportune and interesting shots which will please his chief editor and ensure his continued employment at the Times. David&#39;s aspiration since childhood has been the snaring of a Pulitzer and the Japanese assignment dovetails neatly with his dream. </p>\n<p>A limited amount of film requires a game plan of paucity when taking photos, limiting yourself to only the money shots. </p>\n<p>The game touts support of the Popegg camera once it&#39;s released and players may take a photo of themselves and paste their face on in-game characters if so inclined.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2002-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-20T12:46:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/452/452aeea4a8c9f38018bcbc4919937122.jpg", "website": "https://archive.org/details/PolaroidPete20020109", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 286, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Irem", "Tomcat System"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["IREM", "JVC"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
