Over the course of the game they will make mistakes and grow as characters. I do not condone any negative behaviors in this epic fantasy RPG, this includes horrible things like killing, murder, or fat shaming.)<br/><br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/1072840/Star_Shift/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T13:23:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/381/3818e9244cac7ec41f70e04a85a39bc5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 368, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["thekillergin", "The Killer Gin"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["The Killer Gin"], "esrb_rating": null}
