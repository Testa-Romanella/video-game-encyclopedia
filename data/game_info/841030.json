It was made for a video game making contest for FBLA. I got 4th In the state of Missouri and at the national competition I did not place. I had a lot of fun and I am planning to make more games that are better than this one. There will be no updates because I want to keep it the way it was when I submitted it and also because the code is well...\u00a0 a truckload of\u00a0spaghetti would be a BIG understatement!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T07:29:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fb/3fb3a03cffa501eb82684abda938c2ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cody_Jacobs"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
