It's impossible in mathematics but perfectly works when we understand it differently! If each \"1\" means an individual, then \"1+1\" means \"Many hands make light work\" -- teams are always more powerful than an individual. Or the \"1\" means one unit in ternary?</p>\n\n<p>In this game, you will perform slimes to combine and split to escape from the laboratory. You can combine when there are two or more slimes and split when you have a large star slime. All slimes can jump and move. Try your best to solve the puzzles and help the slime team escape!</p>\n\n<p>Control:</p>\n<p>WASD = Move</p>\n<p>E = Combine</p>\n<p>Q = Split</p>\n<p>Click = Choose One Slime to Control</p>\n\n<p>This game is a submission for ArtCenter Fall 2022 Entertainment Jam. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Team Kuromi: Charlotte Guo, Xinyan Wang, Qinyun Song.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T05:30:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17c/17cb54817f6e58f2a5e30b83f75dd8cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SummerfunguS"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
