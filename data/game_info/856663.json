Your view radius is limited, i.e. you constantly have to move around and check for attacking viruses. Your view radius will get even smaller over time and you have to kill viruses to increase it again. The catch: If one of your cells gets infected it starts to produce even more viruses, making\u00a0your life signifintly harder.<br/></p>\n<p>For each kill, you will be rewarded with money. This can be used to buy upgrades, e.g. to make your cells more resistant, strengthen your own attacks, reduce attack cooldowns, ... you name it. You will need them because the viruses will also get stronger over time and appear in shorter intervals. Choose wisely!\r\n</p>\r\nGoal\r\n<p>Keep your cells alive as long as possible.
