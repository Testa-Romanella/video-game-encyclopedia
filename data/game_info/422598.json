Earn points by tapping on a virtual desk. There are no time limits. The only enemy is your own patience. Achieve combos and earn upgrades (mostly just a nicer desk to tap on). You must balance speed, accuracy and endurance if you want to become the<strong> TAPPING MASTER</strong> and eventually reach <strong>TRANSCENDENCE. </strong>The game was originally released in 2012. Now, 8 years later, this new version for 2020 is a reboot, remake, and remaster. The graphics have been overhauled. The visual effects have been rendered in higher fidelity. But the gameplay remains the same. Time may pass, but time wasting is forever.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T05:22:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b60/b606ee30e67aada2f7f2e7978c4931de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["chriscollins"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
