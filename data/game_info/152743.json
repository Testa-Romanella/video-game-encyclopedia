{"id": 152743, "slug": "auto-currency-miner", "name": "Auto Currency Miner", "name_original": "Auto Currency Miner", "description": "<p>This is a Text Based Game series, in this package deal you will get an Auto Currency Miner which gets you in game currencies for all other joint games!</p>\n<p>Auto Currency Miner, is a game kinda like Idle RPG, all you do is fire it up and it works for you saving/updating your new currency you collect every 15 seconds! You get 10 Copper every 15 seconds, it translates every 30 Copper to 1 Silver, 30 Silver to 1 Gold, 30 Gold to 1 Diamond! You do the math!</p>\n<p>I am working on\u00a0 a system that randomly gives you bricks so you can build a house, upgrade or downsize your house! These will be very large bricks lols I not gonna be evil and make you need thousands for a starter home lols or at the very least I will make the bricks cheap maybe even relative to cost in real life!</p>\n<p>So for instance 1 Copper would be like a gram of Copper, 1 Silver would be a gram of Silver, 1 Gold would be like a gram of Gold, 1 Diamond would be like a very low grade of Diamond that is less than even 1 Carat! The conversions of every 30 is not accurate but will suffice for this games world!<br/></p>\n<p>Mobs will be coming out in later games, but for now as I get those up for you just collect game currency while watching a movie or while you work for real currency lols or play another game and in no time I will have new game files and games that will overall add to the whole game!</p>\n<p>If you want crafting involved I can get that rolling<br/></p>\n<p>You actually have the option if you want your password to access the game deactivated or reactivated again, this is for users who are gonna be the only ones playing the game, having your password deactivated does not delete it!</p>\n<p>Character rescue is now enabled! Enjoy! :)<br/></p>\n<p>Check out my other game in this series :) https://sarainia.itch.io/battle-dustmites-training<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d30/d30a8014252087b844ea9b181c905d60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sarainia"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
