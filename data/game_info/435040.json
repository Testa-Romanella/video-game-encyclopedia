In line with the theme \"Keep it Alive\", this is a quick and simple game where you collect water and bring it to the flowers to keep them from dying.</p><p>Controls: Arrow keys</p><p>Gameplay: Flowers start as red, and move to orange, yellow, brown, and finally black. This process happens at fixed intervals, and increases in frequency as each flower dies (black). Collect water drops and bring them to the flowers. Each drop brings the flower back one color towards red. Dead flowers cannot be recovered.<br/></p>\n\n<p>I wanted to introduce my children to game design and coding, so they played a part in creating the game concept, the artwork, and the music.</p>\n<p>The game was developed using PixelBox.js.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T11:38:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b2/8b24359dce486f11f07f0a145a57bef0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Andrew Hoyer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
