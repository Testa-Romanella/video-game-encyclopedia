The remaining opposing nations banded to form an alliance for freedom.</p>\n<p>Even with mechanised war machines of their own, the alliance was far outclassed.</p>\n<p>The war seemed lost until federation defectors, disgusted with their actions, fled to provide crucial and prototype schematics, as well as more manpower.</p>\n<p>The advanced prototype, code named \"X20a\", is entrusted in your hands as the alliance's most capable pilot. But you don't care about story do you? You're just here to blow shit up!</p>\n<p>Controls (also included in game):</p>\n<ol><li>Arrow keys: Move</li><li>Up arrow: Jump/double jump/fly (hold after double jumping)</li><li>Z: Shoot</li><li>X: Dash</li><li>Esc: Pause</li></ol>\n<p>Known bugs (thanks to playtesters for finding some of these!):</p>\n<ol><li>Sometimes the ammo stops regenerating when fully depleted. \"Bandaid\" solution is to press R to reload. I'm aware this can be used to cheat but I'd rather not have the player forced to restart. I couldn't find a fix for this, sorry.</li><li>Getting under a spawned enemy at the base gate causes the hit enemy to despawn/be knocked off</li></ol>\n<p>This likely won't be continued/updated, but thank you for playing regardless!
