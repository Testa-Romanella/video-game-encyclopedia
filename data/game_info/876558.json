One of the first things that came to my mind was a frog patiently waiting for lilypads to float in front of them so that they can hop onward. I figured this would be one of the few things manageable\u00a0for me to design within 3 hours.</p>\n<p>This game is more a test of patience than it is a game because a\u00a0lot of the time these lilypads aren't sure which direction they want to go.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T04:07:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/675/67595a7f2a907d6c020ee2c8368f9d2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fava Beans"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
