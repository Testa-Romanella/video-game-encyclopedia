It is very loosely based on Spacewar!, and was made in GB Studio. I would have preferred to include the original game, but I had neither the time nor skill to do that. In regards to the theming of the Jam, the story behind this cartridge is that it was made as a proof of concept for a larger arcade game based on Spacewar, with multiplayer, more enemies and levels, and additional features. Upon being received, it was looked over and garnered a positive reaction, but was forgotten and the plans for the arcade game fell through.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T04:55:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a66/a660e0824c90f7591380f377c22131c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Zopolis4"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
