We called: La Cruz del Tiempo.\u00a0\u00a0Is based on an investigation that has the same name. Before the Hispanic Conqueer,\u00a0Andean people\u00a0\u00a0used to built columns to see the shadow\u00b4s\u00a0Sun. With this observation,\u00a0they\u00a0had an exactly calendar with 365 days, four seasons,\u00a0were organiced and their principal\u00a0celebrations were place\u00a0by these observations. With this game we want to conserve this practice and promote our own\u00a0calendar.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T08:31:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12f/12f5bca6124d530008c780a8433824d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["matguaya"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
