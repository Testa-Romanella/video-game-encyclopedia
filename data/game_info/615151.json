The ClueKeeper mobile app is used as a companion app for live, hosted hunts like the annual multi-city DASH Puzzle Hunt, or it can be used to play self-guided hunts right from the app.<br/><br/>What's a clue hunt?<br/><br/>A clue hunt is a game in which the players solve clues that lead them from one to the next.  The clues can be straightforward questions, physical challenges, clever puzzles or riddles, or whatever else the hunt creator can imagine.  With the help of our friends from Zappar, we even support augmented reality clues!<br/><br/>A hunt might send players searching around their local park, through the best-kept secret spots of their city, or even across state lines.  ClueKeeper hunts provide a great way to have fun and explore your surroundings in a new and exciting way!  Our app even works offline, allowing you to explore off-the-beaten path areas without a consistent cell connection.<br/><br/>To get started, try out the sample hunt \"Welcome to ClueKeeper\"!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T04:47:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9c/e9c848e08aa63535079f85044f60bcca_V1xXraU.jpg", "website": "http://www.cluekeeper.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["cluekeeper"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["ClueKeeper"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
