Be the hero that helps them get to the next pub safely!</p>\n<p>The theme for the GMTK Jam 2020 was \"out of control\" and we tried to implement it in the idea of having this crowd out of control that you somehow are trying to manage. You will be setting up the map to try and make it as safe as possible so you don't loose anyone on the way to the next pub, anything else is out of your control. Manholes, cars, fights... plenty of danger out in these streets!</p>\n<p>We hope you have a good time and a giggle playing this game :)\r\n</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance, the team (Big Tuna&amp;The fierce goujons)</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -Stefano /\u00a0 Programing (Big Tuna)</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 -Peter\u00a0 /\u00a0 \u00a0Music, art\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-Laura /\u00a0 Character art, animation\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-Charlotte\u00a0 /\u00a0 Environment art, animation, UI\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-Adwitiya \u00a0 /\u00a0 \u00a0Programing, level design\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T03:34:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93c/93ce85aaf5d86eeb8ebf6883af68aee8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Big Tuna & Fierce Goujons"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
