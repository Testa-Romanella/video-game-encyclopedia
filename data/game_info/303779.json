A nearly 100% procedurally generated maze game with a bit(?) of horror. The only thing that's procedurally generated in this demo is the lever which one must find before leaving the area.</p>\n<p>In the full game I want there to be many \"rooms\" that can be chosen for the player to search in to find the way out. There would also be chalk which could be used to help with navigation and \"traps\" to use to slow down the entity giving chase to buy the player a few more seconds.</p>\n<p>If you enjoy the demo please consider donating either here or on GoFundMe as this is a personal project to try and raise money for 2 reasons, 1: getting a new pc (also for 2 reasons), to create a full version of this game and for college courses and 2: helping with college fees.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-25T02:11:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95a/95a045694acdf07e7c62c37358498ec4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["A_D3MON"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
