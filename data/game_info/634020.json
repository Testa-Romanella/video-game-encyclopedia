Everytime you beat every enemy on the current level a door opens and lets you beat another level until you reach the big clock. Sadly the Big Clock Boss Fight is not implemented yet. If you destroy a clock the time slows down and you can beat the enemies more easily. Additionally the clocks drop either health or hands to shoot with Q at your enemies. There are three types of clocks. But the exploding one doesn't work yet. You can hit the enemies and the Clock with the left mouse button.</p>\n<p>Disclamer: There are different Browsers where the web version of the game doesn't load.
