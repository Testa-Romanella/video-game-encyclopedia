It features a ball head atop of the cartridge\u00a0that can swivel 180 degrees, making it also probably the first selfie camera, too. Photos were originally only sharable on other Game Boys via a link cable or printed out using the Game Boy printer, but using a modern cartridge flasher or other 3rd party hardware you can transfer the photos from the cartridge\u00a0onto your computer.<br/><br/>The photos themselves were limited to 128x112px rendered in a 4-value palette. Despite those limits, there were powerful features included on the cartridge like the ability to create pseudo double exposures by merging multiple photos using the 'fusion' effect, a paint tool, a time-lapse and panorama function, and it even included the ability to create animations. Oh and there is an odd music creating program.\u00a0<br/><br/>Today the GBC has a cult following by retro enthusiasts and photographers alike, with folks drawn to its simplicity, unique pixelated aesthetic and the desire to preserve this hardware and push it to its limits.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/>Game created in GB Studio 3.0, assets created in Aseprite<br/><br/><strong>To be added/fixed<br/></strong>- Fix pigeon movement resetting bug<br/>- Add additional rooms<br/>- Add art to blank rooms<br/>- Add more dynamic dialogue<br/>- Optimize palettes<br/>- Add sound effects &amp; music</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T07:28:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f79/f79e330d2c933b7bd5f198ec1fe4cfb9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Scratching Post Studio"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
