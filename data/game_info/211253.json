You can unlock the exit and leave the games\u2019 three rooms after a few minutes, and right now there\u2019s really no reason not to.\u00a0 Future iterations will add, well, the story, and as many embedded narratives and tales as I have time for.\u00a0 With this framework, and after figuring out the art-style and implementing a few animations we\u2019ll be off to the races.\u00a0 Hopefully.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>If I were on the other side of this game and happened to play it on itch or at a playtest, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d really call it \u201cgood,\u201d but given the context of its status as a gameplay prototype I\u2019d think it functional.\u00a0 The movement could be tighter, the interactions with items and so on likewise. It\u2019s hard currently to discern the game\u2019s \u201cfun,\u201d and I understand the significance of that shortcoming.\u00a0 Mine is the problem of most narrative games, and that\u2019s that everything needs everything else.\u00a0 Narrative design is, for me, very holistic, and removing any one component, anything from sound to lighting, reduces the whole significantly.\u00a0 It\u2019s a gamble, but I think it\u2019ll come together in the end.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>One of the chief struggles in getting this far has been finding time to work and using it well when I get it.\u00a0 I am by no means the most efficient person in the world, and with limited time most days that posses a bit of a problem.\u00a0 The solution then, has been to keep a constant to-do list.\u00a0 The time involved in managing that list is not insignificant, I definitely spend a good amount of time just sitting at my computer figuring out what I need to do next, but doing so allows me to home in on what\u2019s most essential to the game in that moment.\u00a0 I\u2019ve learned that often times if something is proving finicky to implement or is otherwise taking an exorbitant amount of my time, it\u2019s probably not worth the effort.\u00a0 That said, sometimes I realize that had I just put in an extra half-hour implementing a system or two to keep myself organized or to push through a certain problem, I\u2019d be saving myself hours down the line.\u00a0 It\u2019s always a tough call.\u00a0 By paying attention to the results of those calls though, I\u2019m slowly but steadily refining my judgement.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>Another skill that has certainly contributed a lot to getting things done has been saying no to things.\u00a0 I\u2019m typically the kind of person who\u2019s down for anything\u2013a gallery opening, a lecture, a concert, a table-top RPG module, whatever.\u00a0 And for the longest time I\u2019ve seen saying no to those activities as nothing more than just that, missing an opportunity.\u00a0 What I failed to realize was that saying no to those things is in fact opening another door. It\u2019s cliche, sure, but it\u2019s true.\u00a0 It\u2019s also true that staying in and spending a night gnashing teeth over UI isn\u2019t the most fun thing to do, but honestly the satisfaction of progress is pretty damn rewarding.\u00a0 Here\u2019s hoping I can continue to convince myself of that. \u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd5/dd5d4c0331270ce735bd9f7b45902b1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["jimi stine"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
