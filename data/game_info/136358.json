Navigate the bed, keeping warm or keeping cool, while your partner slowly makes their way onto your side of the bed. Can you make it to morning without heat stroke or hypothermia?</p>\n<p>Made in small bits over two days for Ludum Dare 42: Running out of Space. It's the first jam game I went in mostly solo and the first time I've put something up. It isn't really meant to be overly difficult, but if people like it then maybe I'll think about fleshing it out a little more :) I hope you enjoy! Thanks for checking it out.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb8/cb89046a2fad6cc4b264c875f1c3bba5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Chillen"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
