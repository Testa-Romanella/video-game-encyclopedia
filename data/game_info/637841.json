Most mechanics/puzzle sets\u00a0are created and shared by game fans, and we collected them in this game.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>The Witness</em>\u00a0(2016) is a logic\u00a0puzzle\u00a0game by\u00a0Jonathan Blow et al. from\u00a0Thekla, Inc. featuring line drawing puzzles on grids with various rules.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>In this collection, many fan puzzles were designed and created by various fans during the <em>WitCup </em>contest, a fan-organized competition on solving new\u00a0<em>The Witness</em> puzzles under limited time. While the 4th and 5th WitCups are already programmed by Artless, other WitCup puzzles were only archived by images and we thought it would be good if we can revive them using a game engine. This is a major reason to start the project. We are also collecting more fans' levels on the way (if they are easy to implement).</p>\n<p>Puzzle set credits\u00a0(see in-game credits for full detail):</p>\n<ul><li>wc1: from the 1st WitCup (by Gentova)</li><li>wc2: from the 2nd WitCup (by Gentova and Zhvsjia)</li><li>wc3: from the 3rd WitCup (by Miaoji et al.)</li><li>wc4: from the 4th WitCup (by Artless), see also\u00a0https://artless.itch.io/meant-to-be-a-witness-clone</li><li>wc5: from the 5th WitCup (by Artless and Alith), see also\u00a0https://artless.itch.io/meant-to-be-a-witness-clone-2-not-witness</li><li>wc6: from the 6th WitCup (by Zhvsjia)</li><li>rpg: from the Witness RPG Mod (by Sigma144), see also\u00a0https://github.com/sigma144/witness-randomizer</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Game editor</strong>: directly borrowed from\u00a0https://github.com/instr3/WitnessVisualizer.
