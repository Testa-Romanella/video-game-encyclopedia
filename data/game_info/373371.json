They've got reserves and they get stronger every time, but you've got an arsenal of your own at your disposal. Defend the beach, upgrade your weaponry, and save the day.</p>\n<p>An homage to the turret shooters of the late 90s and early 2000s, particularly Beachhead 2000 (a personal favourite) but with a modern twist. Created for So Bad It's Good Jam 2019, so set your expectations accordingly.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-09T07:53:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e7/2e757964a90e7e9fb0aa471726c8d353.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["XCVG"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
