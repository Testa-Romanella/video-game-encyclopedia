Help out your cute fellow by stopping the devil's beasts from reaching their home and defending the devil in the deep.</p>\n<p>Place towers on the grid-like map to stop the spawning enemies from reaching the holes. Unlike in traditional tower-defense-games their path is not pre-set, so by placing towers in their way you can force them to find a new (and potentially longer) way.<br/>Additionally, you can use your health points to buy powerful upgrades for all your towers. Keep in mind, that purchased upgrades only apply to the towers placed up to this point. All towers built afterwards do not get affected.<br/>So think twice at what point you want to use your precious health.<br/></p>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>Mouse for everything</li><li>Menu: Esc</li><li>Fullscreen: F11</li></ul>\r\nUsed development tools:\r\n<ul><li>Engine: Godot 3.4.4</li><li>Art: Krita</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T06:31:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3c/d3c4899311fba1fff3d5d65293193225.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Penguin Psychiatry"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
