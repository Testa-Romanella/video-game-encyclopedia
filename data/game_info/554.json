Despite their presentation as protectors and healers, the Cult has ruined many lives with their ambitions. As tensions escalate and boiling points are reached, lines will blur, gray areas will clash and the shadow group Gachduine will make choices that have a very real impact for Nova Scotia...<br/><br/>Major choices will change the story, available characters, quests and final battles. The open world allows access to cities across Nova Scotia at any time, world map dungeons (with many rare weapons as a reward) and social situations to strengthen relationships with your allies and attend events with them.<br/><br/>The addition of a brand new questline in Newfoundland's Avalon Peninsula adds new factions, quests, dungeons and social situations, expanding on just how much further the conflict will go.<br/><br/>Purchasing this content entitles you to both the PS4\u2122 system and \u201cPS Vita\u201d system versions!<br/><br/>Additional hardware required for Remote Play.<br/><br/>1 player<br/>DUALSHOCK\u00ae4<br/>Remote Play<br/><br/>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com/softwarelicense).
