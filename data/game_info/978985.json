Bosses guard entryway to further levels.<br/></li><li> Multiplayer: Play by yourself or host and share a lobby code with friends. Rooms in each level are laid out in a grid and grow wider depending on the number of players. The more rooms you can explore, the more spell upgrades you will find!<br/></li><li> Build Diversity: Each room you clear drops randomized spell upgrades resulting in different mage builds every playthrough. Your mage can only know 3 spells at a time, forcing you to identify spell combinations, and make decisions about which spells to hold onto and which to forget.<br/><br/></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-25T13:38:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15d/15dce28446461cc0d9de23aaf335787a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 316, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Shadow Eclipse"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Shadow Eclipse"], "esrb_rating": null}
