Multiple asteroids and powerups await you in a game reminiscent of 80s era arcade. Dodge through the expanse of space in fixed camera movement and stay alive as hundreds of peculiar rocks hurtle towards your spacecraft. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nGrab power-ups and special ammo to ease your movement, and continually upgrade your ship as you progress through cosmic encounters. However, if you die, it's game over and you're back to the beginning.
