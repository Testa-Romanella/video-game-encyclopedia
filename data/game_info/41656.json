It offers the player to build a fantasy castle filled with traps and to raid the castles constructed by the other players. The game is full of puns and jokes about high fantasy tropes. The Mighty Quest for Epic Loot requires the constant internet connection. There are two main modes: assault and building. </p>\n<h3>Castle building</h3>\n<p>In this mode, the player builds a dangerous dungeon for other players to crawl. The builder can customize his or her castle, give it a name and enhance it with monsters, traps, bombs, and other defenses. More defense options can be unlocked as the player progresses. Every castle has a treasury room in its middle as a bait to give other players a reason to explore it.</p>\n<h3>Castle assault</h3>\n<p>In this mode, the player controls a character in a manner similar to Diablo or DotA games. The characters belong to four classes, each with its own comical personality: mage, archer, knight, or runaway. The player picks a castle and tries to fight his or her way through its traps and monsters. Each castle has a level that indicates its difficulty and the amount of reward. The goal is to reach the castle&#39;s treasury. By doing so, the player earns gold and other useful loot such as equipment that can be used in future raids. </p>\n<h3>Shutdown</h3>\n<p>The game&#39;s official online servers are discontinued since 2016. There&#39;s a mobile version of the game released in 2017, though it lacks the castle building element and uses pre-programmed levels.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-20T11:03:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f2/7f280778b23561fe3ea8ffa04d5ed61f.jpg", "website": "http://www.themightyquest.com/", "rating": 2.72, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 19, "owned": 545, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 35}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 36, "ratings_count": 53, "suggestions_count": 601, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 53, "platforms": ["PC", "Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Ubisoft Montreal"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Ubisoft Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
