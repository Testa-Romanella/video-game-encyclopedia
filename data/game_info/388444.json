Will you be able to handle the hardships of life?</strong></p>\n<p>This is a short and simple dark humor ASCII art-style game that runs in the command prompt with no sound. It has the design features similar to a nostalgic retro DOS-type old school game. You are given a series of scenarios of which you will give your most genuine reaction to. Answer as many questions as you can while getting the highest score possible. Beware though, if your insane meter is left unchecked, it's game over and you will end up in a insane asylum!</p>\n<p>Feedback and comments are greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p>Email: zanechandy@gmail.com\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-04T02:43:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46f/46f2886c7a451eed2f2e15f36cde3949.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zandy12"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
