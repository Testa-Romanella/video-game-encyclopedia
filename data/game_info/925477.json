{"id": 925477, "slug": "srdc", "name": "SRDC", "name_original": "SRDC", "description": "This game was made by a person (me) who has only several days of Unity experience.\r\n<p>SRDC (abbreviation will be univeiled later) is a racing game where you need not only to make it to the finish first, but also to crash into as much destroyable objects as possible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As of Pre-Alpha 1.0, the game features two types of destroyable objects: road signs and fence. When you destroy them, you'll get points (they are visible on the top left part of the screen).</p>\r\nMAPS AVAILABLE\r\n<ul><li>The only map is a small town made out of three-story buildings.</li></ul>\r\nCARS AVAILABLE\r\n<ul><li>Venucci (name not shown, only in game files)\u00a0\u2014 orange three-door hatchback. Serves as a placeholder vehicle.</li></ul>\r\nWHAT TO KNOW (as of Pre-Alpha 1.0)\r\n<ul><li>It's not essentially a racing game for now, since there are no other racers, no checkpoints and only one test level.</li><li>Car controller is very bad in acceleration. It will be nice if you'll recomend me a good FREE car controller that works better than this one.</li><li>Sounds of collision play too many times sometimes. I don't know how to fix that.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T06:53:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3f/e3fde953748e215c64555ff168ce1287.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jack Pomi Software"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
