I made Mimic for Weekly Game Jam 123,\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/weekly-game-jam-123, with the theme of Same But Different, and I think mimics fall into that theme very well.<br/></p>\n<p>While I am happy with this game, I do wish I was able to get more finished, I wanted multiple levels and a proper tutorial, however I started late and with it being a full 3d game I was not able to get it done and instead focused on trying to get the single level to a more polished state.</p>\n<p>I'm going to keep developing this game until it at least reaches what I envisioned for it, with multiple levels and additional gear to choose from to help you.
