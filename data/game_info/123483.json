The other runs, well, they kind of suck.</p>\n<p>In RogueBot, you build your character, its weapon, defense, etc., with a large range of powerups! That way, there's more space for decisions-making, and less space for random luck!</p>\n<p><strong>Loop-based gameplay</strong></p>\n<p>I'm really fond of the whole \"Once you've finished the game you've just started playing\" thing that's going on in Nuclear Throne.</p>\n<p>That's why I'm pushing it much further in RogueBot: when you kill the final boss, your character that you evolved, improved, made awesome, will become the final boss of your next run!</p>\n<p>All this contributes to scaling difficulty with your skills, too: because the stronger you get, the stronger your enemies will be!</p>\n<p><strong>What now?</strong></p><p>The project is on hold for now.<br/></p>\n<p>Oh, and you can get more info and stuff if you follow me on Facebook!</p>\n\n<p><strong>PS</strong><strong>: </strong>Right now, the main character of the game is Robot, who comes from Nuclear Throne. If you don't know about it, you totally should check it out.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48a/48a7ae2e0712ed047e5d6e1c6e476683.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mon amiral"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
