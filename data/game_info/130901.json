However,\u00a0I'm taking a more action arcade take on the whole thing with semi-roguelike aspects like stat progression that resets on death. The game is intended to be super hardcore with one hit being enough to end your entire life. Keep an eye out as the game will have to come out within the next few days in order to make it into the CGA Jam.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>The game is largely unfinished, but what is uploaded is all I plan to have for the CGA Jam.
