It's quite easy to explain. There is an invisible teleportation vortex, which carries the subject to its destination. In this game, YOU are the teleporter. Whenever a person enters, your job is to recreate the vortex path using your arrow keys as quick as possible.</p>\n<p>The vortex path is displayed on the screen for you to memorize while the person walks towards the teleporter. Once he enters, the path disappears and you have to quickly smash the arrow keys according to the path (left/right/up/down). Please note that you shouldn't try to accomplish this in realtime (as the teleported person is gliding along the path), instead try to do it <strong>much quicker</strong> than that. If you're too slow, the teleportation process fails, resulting in the death of the person. So make sure you do a good job!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: The game might be a bit tricky to get used to, so don't give up too early :)<br/></p>\n<p>There are 8 screens to master. Have fun!</p><p><strong>Controls</strong>: Z or X to start, arrow keys during game</p>\n\n<p>The game was made with PICO-8<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T03:28:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba8/ba89157a149722cf615f9629f36d249b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dr. Wuro Industries"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
