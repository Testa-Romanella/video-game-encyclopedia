The game was finished, but never released as Orpheus, the company I was working for at the time, closed down before Neutron could be released\u2026</p>\n<p>I still had all the files, but time passed by, and when I moved house many years later, seeing no reason keeping all my old computers, I (rather foolishly looking back now) binned everything, including all my old disks.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to the present, and after suffering a bit of burnout while writing lots of novels (I\u2019m also a self-published author), I decided to have a bit of fun and code some C64 games. After coming across the 16Kb cartridge competition, I decided I\u2019d enter that, and thought Neutron would be ideal.</p>\n<p>And so I now present Neutron, a re-born version of the game I coded a long time ago. Only this time, with the benefit of lots of coding experience, this game is much improved, in every way.</p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>9 challenging stages of increasing difficulty.</li><li>Player weapon upgrades.</li><li>3 different background styles.</li><li>Over 18 types of enemies.</li><li>Mid-stage mini-bosses.</li><li>End of stage boss.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Joystick in port 2, or Keyboard:</p>\n<ul><li>\tS - Up.</li><li>\tX - Down.</li><li>\t&lt; - Left.</li><li>\t&gt; - Right.</li><li>\tSPACE - Fire!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T04:31:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d46/d4626f010845e34db5dfc4c59c9037f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SarahJaneAvory"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
