{"id": 775132, "slug": "territorialio-itch", "name": "Territorial.io (itch)", "name_original": "Territorial.io (itch)", "description": "<p>Territorial.io\u00a0is a multiplayer\u00a0territory conquering\u00a0strategy game\u00a0where you can choose to be a nation of any name and place. Your mission is to collect enough\u00a0Balance\u00a0to expand your territory by simply annexing empty land, battling other nations, and setting sail to new islands and continents.\u00a0</p>\r\n1. Start by mastering the single player mode\r\n<p>When you first launch the game, you will be presented with 2 different game modes, that is\u00a0Multiplayer\u00a0where you can battle other players, and\u00a0Single Player\u00a0where you can fight bots while customing the difficulty. Of course, you should start playing in Single Player mode if you have just started the game to familiarize yourself with the mechanic and systems. Start with the\u00a0Easy\u00a0difficulty, and then slowly increase it to\u00a0Hard.\r\n</p>\r\n2. Choose what map you are good at\r\n\r\nImage via David Tschacher\r\n<p>Territorial.io comes in with multiple kinds of maps to choose from with each of them having different conditions and terrain. If you don\u2019t really like doing naval attacks, then you can choose maps where there\u2019s only land such as the\u00a0White Arena\u00a0and\u00a0The Black Arena.\r\n</p>\r\n3. Play in team multiplayer\r\n<p>After you have trained yourself in Single Player mode, you may be ready to fight against other players. But of course, if you are still not confident and want to have a handicap, then you can choose\u00a0Team Multiplayer\u00a0where you will be placed in a\u00a0random color team.\r\n</p>\r\nImage via David Tschacher\r\n<p>You will team up with people of the same color as you to battle other colors. It is way easier than single multiplayer since you can export to other team members and gain backup from them.\r\n</p>\r\n4. Pick the Coastal territories\r\nImage via David Tschacher\r\n<p>At the start of a battle, the game will let you choose where you want your starting position to be. One strategy is that you can pick an area near a vast ocean since it is quite a great natural barrier to protect yourself from the first few minutes of the battle.\r\n</p>\r\n5. Focus on a large body of land\r\n<p>There are two ways you can attack and expand. That is through land and by set sailing through the sea. Since land expansion travels way faster than the sea (since your army will need to travel the water first), you should first focus on expanding your territory in a big land area.\r\n</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why we recommend you to first pick your starting position in a big continent rather than small islands since the first few seconds of the game are the most crucial as you race others in capturing empty lands.\u00a0Bigger land also means bigger Balance, therefore you should first focus on them and create a good size of territory for your nation.\r\n</p>\r\n6. Peace and Patience is the key to success\r\n<p>Of course, when your territory becomes big and wide, other players will come to notice and might consider attacking you. This is where\u00a0good diplomacy\u00a0comes in. The game presents you with a feature of Peace where you can create agreements with other nations to form a temporary truce.\r\n</p>\n<p>But players will not accept your offer if it looks like they may have a chance to just completely defeat you and take your land. So makes sure to not spend too much of your army and balance in one move.\r\n</p>\n<p>However, don\u2019t wait for too long, or else the\u00a0Interest\u00a0will become too high and start to chip away at your balance. Since you will also be charged a little fee when attacking, we recommend you to attack at least 20% of the total balance every time at the start of the game. Once you have become stronger and have a bigger army, you can decide for yourself based on the condition to attack what percentage from the total balance you have.\r\n</p>\r\n7. Focus on the Real Players first\r\n<p>Real players are of course way harder to deal with since they may not accept a peace offer and just straight up obliterate you. Therefore you might think going after the bots first will be a great idea, but you can also think of the opposite.\r\n</p>\r\nImage via David Tschacher\r\n<p>One strategy is to focus on surrounding real players first, since letting them get bigger at the first few minutes of the game can propose danger to your own territory. Focus on eliminating the closest of the first, and then shift to the bots.\r\n</p>\r\n7. Join in on the attacks\r\n<p>When playing on a map with other players, you will soon come in contact with those who are attacking your other neighbor. You want to seize the opportunity by attacking whoever is looking like they might lose. Don\u2019t forget to ask for a\u00a0Peace agreement\u00a0after so that you won\u2019t be their next target.\r\n</p>\r\n9. Choose the right Emotes\r\nImage via David Tschacher\r\n<p>You may think emotes are not that important when it comes to playing Territorial.io, but it is a good media to use as diplomacy with other players. You can have an increase in their trust if you know how to communicate well. And by using emotes, you can gain perhaps a little of their trust and therefore they will accept a peace offer from you.\r\n</p>\r\n10. Scatter yourself through many small islands\r\nImage via David Tschacher\r\n<p>Another way to ensure some kind of victory, you can of course set sail to the many tiny islands on the map. This way, other players might not notice your presence and might just allow you to come in second with being completely wiped out. Though this strategy will only work if you have a good diplomacy strategy and also depends on the other player.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T07:45:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5c/a5cd72fff1dca9dc769fed4d795e01fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kavya78"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
