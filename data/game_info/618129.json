Best enjoyed in fullscreen.</p>\n<p>The duty of bringing a magical flower to a enchanted place\u00a0in an old mansion was given to Flo, a rusted robot. On her head, the robot carries the flower in a protected glass container.\u00a0The flower instructs the robot in its movements, but only when it receives light. The flower will cease delivering instructions if there is no light, and the robot will continue to carry out the last instruction. Help the robot complete her final mission by navigating through the old mansion with\u00a0six levels and a variety of unique mechanics.</p>\n<p>Music by enrique27naveda from Pixabay<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T09:27:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e4/2e442dfe82ac0deb5f0e2ef03a40d427.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DigitalBoy"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
