Using powerful weapons pulled from infinite portals, the destruction you unleash is\u00a0unparalleled. Thanks to\u00a0the\u00a0Golden core of \"<em>The Golden Gravebringer</em>\", the NGSM\u00a0galactic battle station, an\u00a0unlimited potential can be seen. Anything on the wrong side, and sometimes even the right side is quickly turned into dust. Some say even if the Space Monkeys\u00a0could lose, they would appear again at another place in time.</p>\n<p>But for the first time ever something very wrong has happened, the Space Monkey portals are not functioning correctly, leading to a new level of\u00a0chaos around the universe. Remote Space Monkeys\u00a0have gone full rogue, your only choice is to destroy them and gather any other\u00a0resources you can find on the boundaries of space and time itself. <strong>Will you be able to\u00a0find a way back to <em>The Golden Gravebringer</em> and seek out\u00a0<em>The Golden Leader</em></strong><strong>?</strong></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Navigate the Neogen Space Monkey world by using your keyboard or plugging up a compatible USB game controller.
