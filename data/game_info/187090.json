There is no menu, no options, no score, no pause, no power ups; pretty much nothing that is needed to make a decent game. It's a fun multiplayer game that you can play with your friends. You <em>will </em>get stuck in walls, you <em>will</em> die in ways you really shouldn't have, and you <em>will</em> get super frustrated. </p><p>I will update it with some updates eventually, but for now this is it.
