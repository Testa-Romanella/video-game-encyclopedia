You have to crash into chess pawns to prevent them from destroying your dice. The blue ones are faster than the red ones but award more points when defeated. If you crash into the dice, depending on what number gets rolled, the effect will change! The effect will be shown on the bottom left of the screen. Numbers 3 and under are bad effects, while 4 and over are good.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS: click to change direction of your coin</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T21:30:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/184/18472dec3cb55293f37d47a3975f0fb8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BurnV06"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
