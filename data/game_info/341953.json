Time\" skill).<br/>The next wave, will imitate the decisions of the best motorcycle of the previous wave, but with small RANDOM modifications.</p>\n<p>One of these small RANDOM modifications can cause one of the bikes to go a little further before crashing.<br/>When this happens, the whole group learns for the next wave, and so on until they learn to complete the circuit.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-19T03:50:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/462/462d01fa98aee21fbb7e280639ab8dd6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["vashgard"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
