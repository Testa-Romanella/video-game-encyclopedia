Then you can counter-attack to score a point.<br/>Failing a parry means the Evil Knight can hit your hero with a mace. Take three hits and the game ends.<br/>Also, unlike your hero, the Evil Knight doesn't need to align to attack because of magic or something.<br/>The immortal Evil Knight cannot be defeated -- also because of magic. The game goes on until you lose or become bored.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T09:10:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7a/a7aa2c64f61d72e1449ff78899b8d275.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Clumsywise"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
