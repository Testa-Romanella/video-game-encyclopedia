You can kill the enemy when they're still jumping (not falling!).\u00a0 Particles help to get the exact enemy location, so you can kill them before they even become half-visible and start to attack. Stereo audio also helps you to know on which platform the enemy is (each platform has unique sound for enemy footstep, and is played accordingly on the left or right speaker). Use that information to your advantage!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Controls: <br/>AD - Move <br/>W - Fly \u00a0 \u00a0 <br/>Space - Attack</p>\n<p>Leave us some feedback please ;)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T06:19:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/911/91158a214b4d659bbf1e2619d731f032.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Vieslav"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
