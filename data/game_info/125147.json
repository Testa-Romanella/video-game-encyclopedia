This is the result of a 13 week project that I worked on with 3 others, The game is available to play on Windows PC and the Google Play Store.</p>\n<p>It is a fun and silly little game that was aimed towards children aged 8 - 14, but has had a very good reception with people of all ages. It was a game inspired by Clash of Clans that soon fell into the Theme of the Minions. I am very happy with how this game has turned out, if you'd like to learn more about its development, the team and I have all posted weekly progress blogs on our Moddb at http://www.moddb.com/games/loot-nubs</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e4/4e4e66ed34dac417818354d62f3350f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kyle Gordon"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
