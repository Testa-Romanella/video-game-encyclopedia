This one was supposed to be the level 1 of a broader treasure hunting game, checking the area with a chopper, get aerial photos and find some ruins, while being attacked by dragons that exist - of course - only here, near Shambala.</p>\n<p>The terrain is looping seamless, hence it is endless. The trees are a single surface mesh. This thing renders with playable framerate even on very old machines. However, it's just a mini-game.</p>\n<p>I like the flight physics, and a great thanks to Kevin McLeod, who made the epic music (I remixed it to an epic-tunes medley)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T10:22:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73a/73ad7754c585639033b93e62fa94afad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 249, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jfkEO1010etc"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
