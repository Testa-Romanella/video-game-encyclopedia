{"id": 417039, "slug": "space-bunnies", "name": "Space Bunnies", "name_original": "Space Bunnies", "description": "Summary\r\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I am a Computer Science graduate, and I have always had an interest in video games and creating a world in which you can become a part of a larger experience. I have developed a number of projects to various degrees of complexity, but this campaign is important to me in order to further my skill and press forward with creating more content. I would like to be able to better share my work with others, get feedback from a community, and gain support from those who can share in my enjoyment.</p>\n<p>Space Bunnies is a rogue-like survival game in which you explore different planets and systems and practice diplomacy with various alien species. This started out as a small project, but with strong positive feedback I have chosen to expand it. I hope to continue to have the opportunity to share my creations, and with them, a small piece of joy in how I see this world.</p>\r\nThe Goal\r\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thus far, I have created a solid prototype for movement and interaction within the space system and individual planets as well as an outline for numerous other systems and content that I would like to add. This project will only be a three month span for further developing a framework for a combat system.</p>\n<p><strong>Timeline: </strong>3 Months (January 1st-March 31st)</p>\n<p>Design a Combat system</p>\n<p><strong>Month 1:</strong> Ship combat</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 1: Ship mapping</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 2: Character movement</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 3: Enemy Movement</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 4: Room interaction</p>\n<p><strong>Month 2: </strong>Planet</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 1: Character movement (rotation vs planet rotation)</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 2: Character Building + Defending</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 3: Enemy Tracking</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 4: Enemy Attacking</p>\n<p><strong>Month 3:</strong> Space Combat</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 1: Shoot with ship (Different types of firing)</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 2: Ship stats</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 3: Enemy AI (shooting and defending)</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 4: Enemy AI (tracking and evading)</p>\n<p>Every two weeks I will write a review on any progress I am able to make to update any followers I may have. At the end of the project, I will publicly provide an executable demo.</p>\r\nThe Impact\r\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Feedback is extremely important to me, and highly valuable to my progress. If you would like to see this project completed, please share your support. If you have an opinion or would like to be involved, please let me know. Your positive feedback will depend on whether I will be developing Space Bunnies further, or whether I will be entering other directions.</p>\r\nRisks &amp; Challenges\r\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 Time - I have limited time and energy. I have developed a timeline to make my goals clear so I can set my pace and have motivation to continue onward. With each two week period I can determine whether I have met my goals, and decide on whether my timeline may need revised.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 Delays - If I can not meet my goals in time, I may revise my timeline and create a new estimate for when I can fully complete my goal.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 Technology - For as much as I believe I have encountered every issue I possibly could, there are always unforseen obstacles that I will encounter. I may have to revise my solution for an instance of this project as necessary to create a functional product.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T02:43:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c84/c84b1a55e1925db9db675ff2bb1493e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Littlepinksprite"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
