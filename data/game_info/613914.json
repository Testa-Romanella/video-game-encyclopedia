I've been updating this a lot before I put it on here, so it's kinda polished. Basically, there's a bunch of intractable items on a table. You can pick them up and do stuff with them. Sometimes they randomly fling when you throw them. It only happens sometimes. I'm going to be updating it regularly, but only some updates will be put on this site. Let me know if you want me to add an object to the table. There's already a few I have models for but keep forgetting to add.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T05:00:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/567/56700cf3d905f52e35a545651f1337ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["AlexTheAlex7492"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
