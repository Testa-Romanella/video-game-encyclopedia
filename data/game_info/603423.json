We feel we have fulfilled that theme with our Recycle Mission game.\u00a0 A game about picking up rubbish and depositing it in bens. As you play the game you can see the difference that your actions make and we feel that can send a good message to everyone.</p>\n<p>Recycle Mission is a 2D platformer that controls with arrow keys or WASD, space is jumping. You have a minimap to guide you alongside the level so you don't get lost as the level is pretty big.\u00a0</p>\n<p>People involved:</p>\n<p>Ryan- Worked on some coding and art as well as tested the game.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Will - Worked on some coding majority of the art of the game as well as tilesets.</p>\n<p>Ethan- did some concept art for the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Silviu (noeLstudios)-\u00a0 Ran project lead on this one.
