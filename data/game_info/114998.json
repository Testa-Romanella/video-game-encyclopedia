After a long weekend of hanging out with friends in downtown environments, I wondered what it would be like to be strong enough to actually climb a skyscraper. </p><p>Have you ever wondered what it'd be like to climb a skyscaper too?</p><p><strong>WARNING: This runs decently on a modern VR rig and requires an HTC vive, and about 1.5mx1.5m of playspace. </strong><br/></p><p>The yellow dots on the building are \"grab\" ready with the trigger button. You won't take damage if you fall. The only reward for getting to the top is having made it to the top. You will fall if you step too close to the edge.</p><p>I also set the teleporter up so you can roam around the city.</p><p>The police car was a request by one of my testers.</p><p>This is a meditative climbing experience. There's no sound or audio. In other words, I built it very quickly. I am thinking about adding a gun so you can shoot the zombie, though. That'd be fun. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e23/e2372cff23e3eaad0d1a57a0fa068257.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ldvr"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
