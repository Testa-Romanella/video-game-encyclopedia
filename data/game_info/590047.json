{"id": 590047, "slug": "spikeland", "name": "SpikeLand", "name_original": "SpikeLand", "description": "<p>You like platform fighters?<br/>Ever think of stripping down the roster so its only one character? Or oversimplifying the character's movesets? Or giving said platformfighter awful graphics? Or maybe even music to make your ears bleed?<br/></p>\n<p>No? Oh ok. Well what if I was to tell you that this small project is only a way for me to make a bit of money so I can make a bigger game, that I've been working on for a while now. Would you buy it then?<br/><br/>SpikeLand is a Retro handheld inspired platform fighter. It's limited. It's small. But it's got that nostalgic feel. <br/></p>\n<p>Grab your controllers and a friend and get spikin'.</p>\n<p>Or play the first chapter of the single player story mode and maybe uncover some of the dark secrets of the SpikeLand tournament.</p>\n<p>Pick a color filter to fit your style.<br/></p>\n<p>And better yet, if this project does well new characters will be added.<br/></p>\n<p>*Most controllers should work. However if you're controller is not compatible you can use controller emulation software such as x360ce or just add it to steam<br/></p>\n<p>Please only buy this if you look to show support to my upcoming game (My Life In Laria).\u00a0 It's a small game so it doesn't offer too much hours of play. The game is mostly just an added bonus for donating, as there is rather little content to be found in it</p>\n\n<p>*GAMEPAD OF SOME SORT IS REQUIRED TO PLAY THIS GAME. <br/></p>\n<p>I recommend adding this game to steam (though add non-steam game) if you want to use any controller freely</p>\n<p>and please don't lose your download email. There will be future updates<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T07:57:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a2/3a23b43d1931f1739497e5077fd45c0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UselessBread"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
