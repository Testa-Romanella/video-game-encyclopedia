The manga trilogy is published in USA, Sweden, Germany, Italy and the Czech Republic and has also been made into a pen and paper RPG book.<br/><br/>Sword Princess Amaltea \u2013 The Visual Novel lets you imagine a very different fantasy setting from the eyes of both Amaltea and Ossian, as the game has parallel story lines and makes you choose which one of them to follow! Thus, the game can be played multiple times to discover alternative paths and at least five different endings. To find all paths, the full game will take around a total of 28 hours, spanning across the multiple branching stories.<br/><br/>Game dev: Senpai Media Group<br/>Art &amp; Story: Natalia Batista", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T02:15:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a24/a241e640fc072141444d1a2f708e8931.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 278, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Senpai Media Group"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Natalia Batista"], "esrb_rating": null}
