Though it has the appearance of a virtual pet game, the game contains no pet-raising elements nor direct ways to interact with Hamtaro. Rather, the game asks the player to fill out a notebook with information (full name, nickname, gender, birth date, and blood type) about themselves, their family, and their friends. This information is then used to pseudo-randomly generate predictions about the person \u2013 which Ham-Ham they&#39;re most like, their personality traits, their romantic or platonic compatibility with other people that have been entered, etc. \u2013 creating the appearance of fortune-telling. The game also has a real-time element, through which Hamtaro will occasionally speak to you of his own accord. Notebook entries can also be traded with other people via the Game Boy Color&#39;s infrared feature.&quot;</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T16:29:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97f/97fd917fd6ccfdde998a4d560932b24a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 7, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Game Boy Color"], "developers": ["Pax Softnica"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
