It is based on the different movements required to express your name through dance moves common in Waldorf schools established by Rudolf Steiner influenced by the ideas of John Ruskin (hence the name of the box).\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, during the project we learned that we misunderstood a core concept of this dance. We believed, that every letter of a name is being danced. This is not the case. Instead it seems, that the dancer chooses the emphasized letters and freely interprets movements between the specific letters they choose to express. \u00a0We couldn't implement this feature anymore, so here every letter is being danced.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Developed by: Can Mert Bozkurt, Melina Rose, Robert Hambert, R\u00fcdiger Brandis</p>\n\n<p>Additional 2D Assets by:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Paper Theatre Curtain Ruby, by EveyD,\u00a0https://eveyd.deviantart.com/art/Paper-Theater-Curtain-Ruby-266138239</p>\n<p>Satz B\u00e4ume in der Aquarellart, by freepic,\u00a0https://de.freepik.com/vektoren-kostenlos/satz-baume-in-der-aquarellart_1928021.htm</p>\n<p>Aquarell wilde Tiere, by freepic, \u00a0https://de.freepik.com/vektoren-kostenlos/aquarell-wilde-tiere_839083.htm</p>\n<p>Aquarell Wal Hintergrund mit Nachricht \"der Ozean ist mein Freund\", by freepic,\u00a0https://de.freepik.com/vektoren-kostenlos/aquarell-wal-hintergrund-mit-nachricht-quot-der-ozean-ist-mein-freund-quot_1190779.htm#term=whale%20watercolor&amp;page=1&amp;position=6</p>\n<p>Musik:<br/></p>\n<p>Chinese Blues \u2013 Moore and Gardner\r\n  </p>\n<p>The Smiler \u2013 Percy Wenrich\r\n  </p>\n<p>Maple Leaf Rag \u2013 Scott Joplin\r\n  </p>\n<p>Pine Apple Rag \u2013 Scott Joplin\r\n  </p>\n<p>Original Rags \u2013 Scott Joplin\r\n  </p>\n<p>Ragtime Dance \u2013 Scott Joplin</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/024/024b1fb869690daabd34b4c468a440b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Rue", "Can Mert Bozkurt"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
