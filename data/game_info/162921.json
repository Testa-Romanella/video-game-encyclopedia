Prompt: words as objects.</p>\n<p>An exploration of building up game actions modularly. 2 players compete in a simple match 3 style game occurring on the right side of the screen, where in order to affect the game board, they must build their action up out of a phrase by collecting the proper parts of speech by moving around in the 2D space on the left side of the screen. A phrase is built out of one verb, one adjective, and one noun, e.g. \"CREATE\" + \"BLUE\" + \"CIRCLE\". Players score points by being the one to initiate a match by lining up 3 symbols of the same shape OR color, or by destroying symbols directly using the \"DESTROY\" verb.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f02/f02b4d30d095fc16df72eae65c5e6a52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ben Costrell"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
