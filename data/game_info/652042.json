{"id": 652042, "slug": "packri-monster", "name": "Packri Monster", "name_original": "Packri Monster", "description": "<p>Packri Monster is a game for the Gameboy. You can play it using an emulator, or flash it and play it on a real Gameboy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Packri Monster is inspired by the same name hand held game from the 80's, which, in turn, is a rip-off of Pac Man. However, this version introduces many new elements not present in the original hand held game.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Packri Monster Hand Held Game by Bandai (1981).\r\n<p><strong>THE GOAL</strong></p>\n<p>You control Packri, and the goal is to eat all the cookies in the screen while avoiding the Boogeys. Once Packri eats all the cookies, Packri will be able to collect a key that will allow him to proceed to the next screen.<br/><br/>The difficulty of the game increases with each screen. The first levels are very easy to let the player understand the goal of the game without instructions. Sometimes, the difficulty decreases when a new element/obstacle is introduced, to let the player familiarize with the new element/obstacle.<br/><br/><strong>GAME CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>\r\nTip: Press <strong>SELECT</strong> twice to restart the game. This might not seem very useful. However, when you finish the game, you are allowed to replay any level you wish. Once you choose a level, pressing <strong>SELECT</strong> twice allows you to restart and choose a different level. When you reset your Gameboy, you will lose the ability to choose your level, and you will have to start from level one again.</p>\n<p><strong>SCREENSHOTS</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T00:23:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a4/0a49bdd1f8334451d90859f34a7b32c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eric Llim\u00f3s"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
