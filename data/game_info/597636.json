Welcome to Do-Something for Earthcare</strong></p>\n<p>You join a coalition dedicated to improving and healing both ourselves and our planet through exploring alternative energy sources. Your goal is to collect as much personal energy and channel that energy into building kinetic sculptures, Do-Somethings. The more personal energy you generate every day increases your capacity to build more elaborate Do-Somethings.</p>\n<p>You can collect three different energy types:</p>\n<p><strong>Solar - Find the Sun or a light source and aim your phone towards it </strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Movement - Hold the phone and swing your arms vigorously</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Wind - Hold your phone\u2019s microphone up to your face and breath into it</strong></p>\n<p>With that energy you collect, you can build more complex Do-Something\u2122 sculptures, which you can place in augmented reality by clicking the button in the top-right corner.\r\n</p>\n<p>- You can add blocks by tapping on top of other Solar blocks. \r\n</p>\n<p>- You can toggle between Solar, Wind, and Movement blocks by pressing the button at the bottom of the screen \r\n</p>\n<p>- You can pan the camera around the Do-Something by swiping with two fingers. \r\n</p>\n<p>- You can remove blocks by tapping the Build button at the top of the screen, which will toggle to the Unbuild mode and then tapping on a block.</p>\n<p>Everyday you can get daily bonus energy if you click on the + button on the Collect page.  On the Do-Something for Earthcare website, you will explore ways to gain and share wisdom about climate change and join groups to take collective climate action.</p>\n<p>Share your creations on our Do-Something Gallery and with #Do-Something on social media</p>\n<p>Thanks so much for playing and contributing your energy!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T04:45:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38a/38aef685476bffbd8f5010a228d2dfd0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Todd Little"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
