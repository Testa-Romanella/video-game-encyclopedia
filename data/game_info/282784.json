These matches occur in a wide variety of stylized levels filled with obstacles and traps. This unique manner of competitive action was inspired by classic local multiplayer games like Windjammers and San Rio Smash ball that had simple, accessible, and deeply satisfying mechanics. We\u2019ve found over the last few years of demoing the game that equating the gameplay to \u201cair hockey meets smash brothers and breakout\u201d to be the best analogy.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Story</strong></p>\n<p>Clash Cup is the most popular sport in the known universe. The high octane action and simple objective of the game makes for a sport that attracts the fiercest, most courageous (and strangest) competitors in the universe. Fans of Clash Cup regard it not just as sport, but an experience unlike any other. Its circuit is the universe itself, and its only rule is to win at any cost.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>This purchase provides access to the latest beta version of Clash Cup\u00a0Turbo as well as\u00a0FULL ACCESS to the final version of Clash Cup Turbo when it releases later this year, for a 33% discount!</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0&gt;&gt; Plays best with the itch.io app! &lt;&lt;</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a53/a53263de0ded097fbad389ae12687d7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 238, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["foolmoron", "ROOT 76 Games", "Mike Odum"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
