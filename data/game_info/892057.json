I'm really only uploading this so my friends can play :3.\u00a0 Really simple game made just for learning all the fundamentals of Maya and Unity. Enjoy!!</p>\n\n<p>Also, tried very hard to get a third person view camera, could not figure it out for the life of me, so I had to use the mechanics provided by the professors. If anyone knows how to get a proper third person camera (similar to a mario kart view) pls comment here or reach out to me on tumblr or instagram (kitcattmoon).
