If too many cubes touch your circle, you're dead and have to start over.  Crunch cubes, get points, be a bad ass cube cruncher.</p><p>I focused most of this game on \"feel\".  So I added a bunch of stuff that \"feels\" right.  Like camera shakes, numbers that count up, blood and gore, the usual fun things.</p><p>And boosh!  I have a build up.  I need to re-install Unity on my main PC, apparently.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/580/580f7b606f04759a88b4895c9f1c5cb1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Casey Shreve"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
