I turned it into a asset-chimera because the final goal with this project was to release something playable without someone else\u2019s help.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Characteristics of the game</strong></p>\n<p>Hexroes is a 1-action turn-based resource strategy game which each player fights for supremacy of a hexagonal board. Sharing the same resources, the players can choose tiles from a pool of characters of the RPG genre and put them onto a board. Each turn, players receive points according to their own characters, getting closer and closer to beat the enemy. </p>\n<p>Since both players pick tiles from the same place, named \u201cPool Tile\u201d, they have to think carefully which tile to send to the board and which tile to leave for the opponent on the next turn. In order to maximize their own gains and minimize their losses, the players have to care about the tile\u2019s classes, powers, positions and abilities.</p>\n<p>The game currently has 17 different characters with unique effects. You\u2019ll find six green minions, a paladin, priest, wizards, thief, bard, necromancer, knight and a weird abomination. All of them spread in three different categories:</p>\n<p><strong>Minions</strong>: Permanent tiles that can buff each other. They should be positioned very close each other in order to make the best use of their buff ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Class</strong>: Permanent and more situational tiles. Each one has a single consumable ability triggered when the player wants. It counts as an action (pass the turn). All the abilities are designed to provide for the player tools to destroy, cancel, buff, debuff or steal other tiles. Usually the player who makes the better use of the class tiles win.</p>\n<p><strong>Abomination</strong>: Temporary tile that has the power of multiplied by the number of abominations that already went to the board. It is also a good tool to win the game, even more if well \u201cpredicted\u201d inside the pool tile.</p>\n<p><strong>Board:</strong> Place where the players send the tiles. Each chosen position inside the board provides instant points when a player put a tile. Also, the board starts with a very small quantity of available positions and start growing along the match. </p>\n<p><strong>Pool Tile:</strong> \u00a0The Pool Tile is the zone where the players pick tiles. Only from the bottom, only one tile can be chosen to be sent to the board a turn. On the beginning of each turn, it also shifts according to the chosen position on the last turn. The Pool Tile is in a constant logical movement and it can also \u00a0be another tool to beat the enemy.</p>\n<p>Three battle modes: </p>\n<p><strong>Play Easy</strong>: a small board with faster matches. Ideal to new players.</p>\n<p><strong>Play Hard</strong>: a bigger board, different board scores.</p>\n<p><strong>Local Multiplayer</strong>: Game mode available to play against other player (side by side)<br/><br/><br/>Last Update:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Bug fix: Tiles description stopping to work</li><li>Added Abomination count down time animation</li><li>Ai Improvements</li><li>Class tiles chance to spawn increased</li><li>Class tiles Activation Input changed to double tap</li><li>Added Class tiles Targets with single tap</li><li>More fonts</li><li>Tiles and Buttons hover</li><li>Text Revision</li><li>UI modifications</li></ul>\n<p>Dev:\u00a0https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D1WqvAzdpuRqctan-o0mO-nOnAhNJvqHNC3bUecv...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/202/2021d7471a7a6ab834828e843ac61a8f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ycarowr", "thiagocamposde"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
