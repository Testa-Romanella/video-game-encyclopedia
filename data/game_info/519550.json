It was made for the Mix and Game Jam 2020. I kept it as PG as possible with the gore, so if you don't like blood, it has been all replaced with green liquid. This game is kind of a doom and mario mix. I hope you like it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T06:11:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe2/fe2e3d53404c03cf71d996de4ee6499b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BobithGameDev"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
