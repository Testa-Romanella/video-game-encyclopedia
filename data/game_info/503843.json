Careful with the sound though, as it is a sound based game it could be quite loud. Please take care to adjust your volume when playing.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\n<p>Unlock doors by activating buttons in a certain order, building the background music loop as you go.\u00a0The goal is to reach the end of the loop and construct the soundtrack, by pressing the buttons in the right order to create it.</p>\n<p>The concept we are going for is that the loop will have notes that build up over time, and every level is made up of several rooms. Every iteration of the loop we are planning to add an additional soundtrack in the future so rooms can get more complex as they keep looping back to the original!</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy the game!<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Participants</strong></p>\n<p>Torben - Programmer / Tools</p>\n<p>mdlaras - Artist</p>\n<p>ItsWest23 - Composer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T09:06:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5f/f5fef8b64383ccab79487c56308e3060.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Torben", "ItsWest23", "mdlaras"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
