Some blocks will add shapes to your player and some of them will remove shapes, if you enter their area. Some of them completely clear your inventory. There are mechanics like rotating detection areas that are meant to work for once (they have lock signs on top) or can get activate forever. Wireless detection blocks that activate when you have the right password shapes on your player. Doors that can work more than one time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I tried to demonstrate every of them but I had no time to build levels around them. I hope you find this short game fun! ^_^</p>\n<p>The event is open to public voting and anyone can rate the game. </p>\n\n<p><strong>C O N T R O L S</strong><br/></p>\n<p>WASD and Arrow Keys are for movement.
