At the input, you submit a map of zeros and ones (wall units), rays are obtained from the position of the character, and then the walls are drawn with the illusion of 3D.<br/>The classical algorithm uses a large number of rays. I wanted to try to discuss it in such a way that two beams were fired on one wall. I think the idea is still interesting, and I would like to develop it further. I will be glad to wide comments and suggestions.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-05T00:24:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ed/6ed809934f6dd0efcf1f023bf02dc900.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["svatostop"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
