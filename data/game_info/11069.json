{"id": 11069, "slug": "home", "name": "Home", "name_original": "Home", "description": "<p>Home is a 2D pixel horror that offers a player to try on the role of a character who does not understand where he is and how he got there. The development of the game involved only one person - it&#39;s Benjamin River, and his take is similar to such games in the genre as Lone Survivor and Amnesia, only corrected for pixel graphics. </p>\n<p>The main decisions in the game are made using a simple binary system: you just have to answer the questions with Yes / No. Based on the answers, the plot of the game develops, which narrates the mysterious murder. There are several unexpected twists in the plot based solely on the player&#39;s choices.</p>\n<p>The game is very short and requires a lot of replays to fully understand its story - each time the player can experiment with the answers and get new answers from the game. However, you will not get all the answers - the game is not so elaborated. Home can create the right atmosphere, which, however, will not appeal to all fans of the genre: here you will have to read a lot and think through every answer.</p>", "metacritic": 69, "released": "2012-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-29T20:47:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/234/2341a78cfc68acd460228fafcf7f9ccc.jpg", "website": "http://www.homehorror.com", "rating": 2.83, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 75, "owned": 1311, "beaten": 65, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 22, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 72, "ratings_count": 109, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 109, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Benjamin Rivers", "Kavan Bahrami", "Lore Nine Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Benjamin Rivers", "Lore Nine Studio", "Kavan Bahrami"], "esrb_rating": null}
