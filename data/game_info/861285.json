We have very close communication with the community. We read and listen to feedback in all channels we can. We run weekly competitions in our Discord for new content to add to the game and credit the authors, we read everything from Steam Forums to YouTube videos to Twitter messages to e-mails and everything in between, before we decide on next steps.</p>\n<p>We are a tiny team that chose to stay independent and continue developing a game we love and would like to thank you very much for your attention and interest, and to all our existing community for all the help so far, we wouldn&#39;t be here without you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-10T11:02:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ad/1ad3a512cde30760eec0eed0b74dbe09.jpg", "website": "http://www.soulstonesurvivors.com", "rating": 3.8, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 11, "owned": 275, "beaten": 10, "toplay": 15, "dropped": 19, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 289, "ratings_count": 25, "suggestions_count": 219, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 25, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Game Smithing"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Game Smithing"], "esrb_rating": null}
