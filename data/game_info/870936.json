On multiple fields at the same time.</p>\n<p>Accidentally own goaled somewhere? You'll have to live with the consequences ...</p>\n<p><strong>This game was made as a \"weekend project\"!</strong> It's chaotic local multiplayer fun.\u00a0It's finished, but obviously not the same quality and size as my other (paid) releases :p<br/></p>\r\nWhat's this?\r\n<p>A game for <strong>1</strong><strong>-6 players</strong> on\u00a0<strong>keyboard/gamepad</strong>. (Solo mode against bots.)</p>\n<p>All you do is\u00a0<strong>move around</strong>.\u00a0If you press \"up\" (for example), your character goes up in\u00a0<em>all fields</em>.<br/></p>\n<p>Walk into the ball to move it. A normal goal gives you 1 point. But if you were the last one to touch the ball, and it goes in <em>your</em> goal, the opponent gets 10 points.</p>\n<p>When someone own goals,\u00a0a field is removed or added.\u00a0Teleports allow travel between these fields ... but using one might also trigger a powerup. Which can be really good or really bad for you.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>This game was made with\u00a0<strong>Godot Engine 4 (beta)</strong>. (Yes, the upcoming version that's not stable yet, I did it to learn what's new and help test it.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>The font is\u00a0<strong>Rubik Mono One</strong>, available on Google Fonts.<br/></p>\n<p>Soundtrack was made using the Song\u00a0Maker website, creating a few melodies of equal length/BPM and randomly overlaying them in the game.</p>\n<p>Everything else is mine and made in 3 days.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As always, I'm open to bug fixes, ideas, improvements. If they don't take longer than the time spent on the original game :p</p>\r\nRemarks\r\n<p><strong>P</strong> (or <strong>START</strong>) pauses the game.<br/></p>\n<p>Yes, the game title is incorrect, as own goals are in fact\u00a0<em>allowed</em>. They're just not a good idea.</p>\n<p>But \"Own Goals Purposely Discouraged Through Game Mechanics\" just doesn't have the same ring to it, does it?</p>\n<p>Team colors are randomized when the game loads. If you don't like a color scheme, restart the game. Same with team composition.</p>\n<p>Anyway,\u00a0I have loads of these \"tiny ideas\" which are not enough for a full game (by a long stretch), but are still too fun and interesting to never make. So I'm going to try and do more of these \"weekend projects\".</p>\n<p>Saturday morning, I literally only had \"soccer, but on multiple fields simultaneously, and accidental own goals are disastrous\" to go on, and this is what came out.\r\n</p>\n<p>Have fun!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T12:40:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d1/3d1b2d9566dddb63a30e6fee3bb0a933.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Pandaqi"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
