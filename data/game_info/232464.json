Become the number one in the world's list of the most furious and insane drivers who saddled monsters on wheels!<br/><br/>- Beautiful and realistic HD graphics<br/>- A unique battle system<br/>- Convenient machine control and interface interaction<br/>- Realistic and detailed damage and destruction system<br/>-Stunning locations, starting with arenas of burning desert, destroyed plants and finishing with arctic apocalypse and nuclear submarines. Each of the locations is fraught with its secrets and dangers.<br/>- Debugged optimization even for old Chinese phones<br/>- Realistic machines, again rebelling from the world of a landfill in the apocalyptic world<br/>- Advanced system of machine improvements, a huge number of combinations and customization for your character<br/>- Smart AI opponents who can find a way out of any situation and not let you get bored<br/>- Bosses on steep wheelbarrows<br/>- A variety of weapons, ranging from machine guns, ending with rocket launchers and mortars<br/><br/>The model of damages of in-game cars deserves attention - depending on the strength and the place of the impact on the models, dents are formed, the glass breaks, parts of the body components fall off, when the running gear on the wheels is damaged, \"eight\" are formed up to the loss of the wheels, the final result of the car's destruction is ignition of the engine compartment. Destruction of enemy vehicles or causing as much damage as possible is the main goal, however, in the mode of racing competition, the opportunity to destroy an opponent's car is missing.<br/>The overall style of survival races pushes the player to various tricks and tricks during the competition for the leading position, such as, for example, the ram of a rival machine, in order to squeeze his car or push him into a hard or heavy obstacle, which can lead to the failure of his car , attempts to shove his car off the track, use the features of the track for the device traps - travel near the trailer, laden with a round forest, entailing the breaking of the logs on the track.<br/><br/>Drive, chaos and destruction are the fundamental factors for a real derby!<br/><br/>P.S.: Thank you, dear users, for your comments and propositions.
