Each tile has a different effect and will change unexplored tiles around it when visited, so choose your path wisely!<br/></p>\n<p>Changes may be made to the game in the future: things like adding music/sfx volume controls, translations and accessibility fixtures are a priority, though polishing the game is still very much a pending task. Despite all that, I am very proud of the game having reached its current state!<br/></p>\n<p>Made with Godot by LyoTheLyon. Music and sound made with MuseScore by Passiflora d'Abyzou. Graphics (except for the animal icons) made with Inkscape by Passiflora d'Abyzou. Animal icons downloaded from Vecteezy.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T12:04:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce7/ce77f171a7676917e1977efbe89875de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["InfernalBizcochito"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
