You answered an ad to become a test subject at a secret science facility for a few hundred dollars; in hopes of buying a newly released Apple iPod. Unfortunately, though successly frozen, the cryogenic test performed on you ran out of funding in the first .COM financial crash of the early 2000s and the science lab never developed the un-freezing technology. Awakened, you must use your Emo power to sing and rid the world of mindless Pop!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddb/ddb79e34c2c2903ae78312a2399dbef8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cur8ors"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
