In this one, you use the mouse wheel (our crank) to pull up an aiming line.\u00a0 The ball reflects that trajectory. There is also the slow time system, where the game moves to regular time as you move the paddle, sort of like SuperHot.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>A/D or Left/Right Arrows: Move paddle<br/></p>\n<p>Right Click: Vacuum balls</p>\n<p>Release Right Click: Launch vacuumed balls</p>\n<p>Wheel Mouse: Special Aim.
