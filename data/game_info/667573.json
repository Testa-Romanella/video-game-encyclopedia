I have linked to everything at the bottom of this page.</p>\n<p>I know two player games are a little awkward to judge in jams, so I added a basic AI option to play against .. if I had that last weekend I would have made it a little smarter .. if you like the game let me know in the comments and I will whip up a video breakdown for it on my channel\u00a0when I get my next free time allocation.</p>\n<p>So lets talk gameplay:</p>\n<p>Each player gets to pick two characters to join their team from a raster of six, each character has traits you can assess in the character selection screen, from higher health to inflicting more damage and better range of movement. Some even come with a ranged attack.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To add depth to these stats I also gave the characters special actions where they can damage the other team, heal their own or use a vampire skill and suck the health from the other team to fill their own. Each of these special\u00a0actions is balanced against the owners character skill stats.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please don't hate me if one character comes across too OP just let me know in the comments, I played a lot of rounds in this game\u00a0and didn't find one myself but then this game is open to a lot of strategy variations on play.</p>\n<p>And that's it .. I hope you like the game and if you entered the Jam all the best of luck with your entry.<br/></p>\n\n<p>If your interested in making games I have a YouTube channel where I talk about the games I am working on and how I build them, so please come along and maybe support by subscribing.\u00a0 Soon I will put up a video detailing all the components that went into this jam entry.</p>\n\n<p>As a shameless plug reference to the guy running this\u00a0Jam\u00a0 I also have a video on me helping to build\u00a0Vimlark's game\u00a0\"Monkeys With Guns\"</p>\n\n<p>Game assets:</p>\n<p>Art - The characters, props and buildings come from \"Synty Studios POLYGON City\" pack found here..\u00a0they were having a sale at the start of the jam so I got most of them for free.</p>\n<p>Animations - Mixamo does some great free animations and Synty have a video on how to convert them for use. Other than that I used some free packs from\u00a0 Kevin Iglesias found here</p>\n<p>Sound - FX and Music came from the \"Ultimate Sound FX Bundle\" found here</p>\n<p>Font - This is \"Space Mono\" and can be found here\u00a0</p>\n<p>Icons - Any that weren't made by hand can be found in the \"64 Flat Game Icons\" pack found here</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T07:21:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/236/236f82c88ddcc37349fb38e331eccdf3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Warped Imagination"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
