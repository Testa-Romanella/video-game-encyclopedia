The Vizzle puzzle experience is designed to be positive and relaxing one. There is no time limit and no counting of moves. Relax and solve the puzzle your own way at your own pace. This version of Vizzles is titled \"A Day at the Park\". It includes nine beautiful 1920x1080 HD outdoor park themed videos for you to unlock.  The first time you reach each level you can choose a new video puzzle to unlock. That is nine videos, each with eight levels, for a total of 72 puzzles that you can go back and replay as often as you like!<h3>Game Play</h3>Earlier puzzle levels start in a tutorial mode where you are provided tips the first time you encounter special features or new terminology. To complete a puzzle you simply click and drag the puzzle pieces to their correct locations. If a piece is correctly placed next to another piece they will snap together. They can then be moved as a group to their correct location. Each time you place a piece correctly it will be framed in gold until eventually the entire puzzle is framed and you win.<br/><br/>Puzzle videos start at \"Level 1\".  Which is 3 pieces wide and 3 pieces tall.  Each time you complete a puzzle level you unlock the next higher level for that puzzle. The size of the puzzles on subsequent levels are twice the level number. For example a \"Level 2\" puzzle is 4x4 and a \"Level 3\" is 6x6 all the way up to the level 8 at a whopping 16x16 pieces. That's a lot of pieces so to get your started we make edge pieces easily identifiable with a white gradient border. We also automatically save your puzzle progress as you play. This way you don't have to complete the puzzle in one sitting.<h3>A Note from the Developer</h3>As a small independent developer it is a real challenge to balance your aspirations for a project with the reality of what you are able to deliver. I chose this project because I thoroughly enjoyed the video puzzle games of the nineties and wanted to bring them in to the twenty-first century. With Vizzle, I believe I have accomplished that. I was able to deliver additional features like HD video, higher piece counts, edge piece identification and the ability to move connected pieces as one. I hope you enjoy it.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-13T03:24:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aff/affc34f8679198aaa963b026ff19f1b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 175, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Code Studio"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Code Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
