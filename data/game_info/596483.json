If you collide with an obstacle the run ends and you must start from the beggining. Also you can end the run by clicking the button \"escape\".\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game has been made in Unity.</p>\n<p>The art for the game was made by Ulises Lafuente (twitter acc:\u00a0@RataUnderground) and I took the different sounds from the unity asset store:\u00a0the sound effects for collisions belongs to the package \"Fantasy Menu SFX\" and the main theme of the game belongs to \"Seamless Loop and Short Music\".</p>\n<p>Thank you so much, hope you enjoy the game\u00a0 : )</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T18:38:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/362/362a00db158a6816b70491b43156611e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Oscarlaviana1"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
