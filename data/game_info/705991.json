{"id": 705991, "slug": "carecycle", "name": "Carecycle", "name_original": "Carecycle", "description": "<p>This is an earliest prototype of the game.</p>\n<p><strong>The idea</strong> was simple and naive: you don't always know that the care you give to the world \u2014 will come back from the world to you when you need it, but if everybody will give care when it's needed regardless of whether they\u2019ll receive it back or not \u2014 when we can start to create the cycle of care.</p>\n<p>So the philosophical thesis and the main goal of the game is to try to keep a 1:1 ratio of the care we receive to the care we give.</p>\n<p>Sadly we weren't able to make it as planned. But we are looking forward to further work on the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong> WASD + F (attack, has a cooldown) + E (help)</p>\n<p>You are a soul who must reach the end of this strange town to open the Door. There will be enemies and robots who get stuck from time to time and need help. You also will get stuck from time to time and need help. Robots will help each other and you. It's up to you whether to help them or not. But if the robots won't be able to help each other in time \u2014 in the end there will be no one to help you...</p>\n<p>PS: the received:given care ratio is in the bottom left corner of the screen. There is no music in the game, but you can play it in the background \u2014 all music files are in the folder \"music\". The game doesn't have an exit option, so you'll have to close it manually.</p>\n<p><strong>Team:</strong> Last minute kids</p>\n<p>Project Lead, Game Design, Narrative, Art, and everything that went wrong: Xeniarta (Xeniarta#1146, Eventbrite #2329860369)<br/></p>\n<p>Programmer: Obscurum (discord: Obscurum#6727)</p>\n<p>Sound Designer: Lessmoon (discord: Lessmoon#0730, Eventbrite #2394873629)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T14:01:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18d/18da08c88971c0c384857884f5fe2af4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xeniarta"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
