Never having made a game before, it's to be expected. I'm uncertain if I'll ever come back to this project or if it will remain as a learning experience. Either way, I look forward to improving and making more games in the future!</p>\n<p>This demo itself is completely free, but if you'd like to show your support monetarily, consider donating to a charity that's important to me. It's thanks to many Ukrainian people and resources that this game was possible.\u00a0\u00a0https://help.gov.ua/en/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T14:32:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0a/b0a4d4098efb1337f2ee51cd172afca7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RienKT"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
