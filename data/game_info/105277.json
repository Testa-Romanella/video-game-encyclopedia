It's been great participing in this jam, when I saw it, I wasn't sure if I could upload any thing, since I have never used Pico-8. But it was great for learning, now I'm in love with Pico! I'll be doing more things, and I'll update this game with all the ideas I got in my head.\u00a0I got a huge list with different bullets and effects that I would love to implement.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Any sugestion/critic you have, I'll be pleased to listen! :)</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>And by the way, If you mod it, I'll be pleased to play it! Let me know! (I'll upload it to pico BBS)</p>\n<p>Cheers :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ee/2ee9d20dedddf34cfa7ca456cb2ffe81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Suzuka"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
