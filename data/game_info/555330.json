A tale as old as time.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>W - Up\r\n<br/>A - Left<br/>S - Down<br/>D - Right\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instructions:<br/>Move around the floor, walls, and ceiling to dodge the balls. Be sure to keep an eye on your electric charge in the blue meter. If this drops all the way, the light will go out! Blue charging pads will appear periodically to keep you charged up.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made for Mini Jam 73 (https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-73-power). I wanted to make something simple for my first jam so I decided to keep the player constrained to a single room. I went the route of interpreting the power theme as electricity. This took the form of a light bulb who must ensure that they stay charged while dodging projectiles. The following colors are used:</p>\n<p>1. Black - #000000<br/>2. White - #FFFFFF<br/>3. Yellow - #F2DEA0<br/>4. Blue - #7EBDC2<br/>5. Red - #BB432F</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T05:07:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/155/15547b6a2d7caeb1061033d88ae3406e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["shhwing"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
