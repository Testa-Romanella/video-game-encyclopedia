The theme was swipe.</p>\n<p>In this virtual reality game, moles pop up in front of you - you grab them and toss them at various dangerous objects in your backyard. There is a scoring system based on which obstacle you've hit, but there is no time limit yet, but that is an intended design feature.</p>\n<p>This is a prototype, so there is no menu and limited features... but the proof of concept is there.</p>\n<p>Any and all feedback is welcome! Enjoy throwing rag-doll moles, friends!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3e/f3ef2e2c5b8ade29acc438d4f0dc27aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Virtuous Reality Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
