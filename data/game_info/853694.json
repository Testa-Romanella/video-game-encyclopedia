Your living room will never be the same.\u00a0</p>\n<p>JJR allows you to improve your health and fitness through dance, music and connection with\u00a0other dancers in the JJR community.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Apart from the visuals, JJR also includes integrated dance pad controls, a proprietary piece of hardware designed by the award-winning team at JJR Studios. No dance pad, no fear - you can also use standard keyboard controls.</p>\n<p>Upcoming features in our next release include a\u00a0sophisticated algorithm that will run through any song you want and create a beat map for you, which you can share with the online JJR community.\u00a0</p><p>Download the game here:\u00a0https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sD43VymXwfFInPOvQor1cRsN_v2Gmkln/view?usp=shari...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T13:09:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49a/49a6b7ad0f609d580617061321e211da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["jenny.li"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
