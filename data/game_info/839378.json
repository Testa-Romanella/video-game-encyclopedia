But there's really no way that your new employer could judge what is and isn't collateral damage, right?\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>So that is your assignment; cause our enemies as much headache as you can get away with whilst maintaining a shroud of plausible deniability. You will ultimately be forced to act in ways that are detrimental to our goals, but if it wasn't you it would be someone else, so try to at least get some value out of it. Just don't get caught.</p>\n<p>Good luck, and glory to Rodinata!</p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>W/A/S/D</strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 -\u00a0 \u00a0 Moves Character Up/Left/Down/Right</li><li><strong>Shift</strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 -\u00a0 \u00a0 Sprints</li><li><strong>Left Click \u00a0 \u00a0</strong>-\u00a0 \u00a0 Fires Pistol</li><li><strong>Right Click \u00a0 \u00a0</strong>-\u00a0 \u00a0 Throws Explosive Device</li><li><strong>E \u00a0 \u00a0</strong>-\u00a0 \u00a0 Enters and Exits Vehicle</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T07:07:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0a/c0ac0ec52d246652e819ad83a2e0c8c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 230, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mason Brake"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
