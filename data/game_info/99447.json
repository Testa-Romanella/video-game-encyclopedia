You are now the proud owner of Lola's Barkade, an arcade built to cater to a very particular set of customers. \u00a0Unfortunately, the previous owner failed to mention that the power fluctuates wildly and there is never enough to power more than a few machines. \u00a0Manage your power usage carefully in order to make enough money to pay your bills. \u00a0Be warned, the money is automatically withdrawn from your account periodically and if you are ever short, you will be forced to go out of business. \u00a0Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Click on machines to turn them on and off.<br/>If a machine is on, customers may use them, which makes you money.<br/>If your customers are happy, they are more likely to stay longer.<br/>Watch your power usage, though. If you use too much, your machines will turn off and you will have to manually turn them all back on.<br/>Don't forget that the vending machine and sign also use power (and can be turned on and off)!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e72/e72ca3202ea64b0eff69be08d4660486.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["A-Flat Miner Studios"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
