(MattJohnson)", "description": "<p>This is a new game that I've been making, It's also probably the first thing that I could actually call a game - It's almost like an asteroids clone, but you're fixed in the center and have to shoot at endless ships until you get blown up. It's still a WIP, but as of now I'm actually really happy with it. Might be able to release it for real at some point. Features that I want to work on include an upgrade system(Extra health, shields, ect), and a better game over screen, and also more, stronger enemies. I would like to implement a wave feature but that'll have to be further down the line.</p>\n<p>Either way, the main game loop is done at the moment - This is originally what I had in mind when starting this project, so here it is - Enjoy!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Controls are simple, just point and click where you want to shoot - The ship will always turn to face the mouse. Windows only for now.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T12:28:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e7/4e7d6a593a1c9e984ad3d3920a18db58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MattJohnson"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
