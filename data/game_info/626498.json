They</p>\n<p>destroy their enemies with quick strategic moves. The player who destroys all</p>\n<p>enemies in a level successfully completes that level. Each player has a certain</p>\n<p>number of troops to start with. Players select a certain number of troops and send</p>\n<p>them to the area they want to capture. They regularly gain new troops in captured</p>\n<p>territories and in their starting zone at regular intervals.</p>\n\n<p>Story</p>\n<p>The time has changed in the Aegean sea. Big countries stopped their claims and</p>\n<p>support on the islands. From that time, local people need to found a way to keep</p>\n<p>themselves alive. As a result of this, islands started to create their own countries.</p>\n<p>Because of the limited area, these countries had very limited resources on these</p>\n<p>islands. That's why each folk wanted to live in better conditions. After some time,</p>\n<p>these desires resulted as a military investment. Warships started to build and island</p>\n<p>wars take place in the Aegean sea.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T07:29:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/762/7629426a5ffc26c36150a99a1418494e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 209, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Ege"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
