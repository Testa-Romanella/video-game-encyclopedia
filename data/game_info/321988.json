Suddenly, two gigantous ball ships land on Bally\u2019s world. Out from their connected extended platform stormed out white troopers from the presumed dead Ball Busting Committee! \u201cPreposterous!\u201d, thought Bally as he busted the approaching troopers to OvarHeaven! But atlast to no avail, as they overwhelmed him and banished him to the outskirts of space and time no likes of what any baller has come to.</p>\n<p>There in his new limbo of the BBC\u2019s state of the art Kleenex military base, ran by General Puffs, Bally sat chained away as he learned about the accidental resurrection of the BBC\u2019s Boss caused by an Oval organization, the Central Nut Neutralists. The CNN searched for a way to stop the BBC after they accidentally resurrected them. They stumbled upon scriptures written about Bally\u2019s existence and scoured the universe to find him right in the hands of the BBC.\r\nWith collaboration efforts from the CNN, Bally Bob Joe busts out once again from the BBC\u2019s military base in newfound rage. The CNN tell him that he must get the sacred weapon of the ancients, the E-BONE. He must gather the two E-BONEies throughout the universe to finally destroy the BBC\u2019s boss once and for all.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-24T07:38:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/381/3813708638bd732f2475885dcdc6ce99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sounides"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
