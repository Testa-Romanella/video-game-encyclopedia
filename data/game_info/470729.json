Katey can cast a few spells by collecting ingredients into a cauldron, there is a large variety of magical monsters for her to contend with and puzzles by the gallon.</p>\n<ul><li>100 levels</li><li>Lots of puzzles, monsters and even bosses!</li><li>Secrets to earn</li><li>Magical!</li><li>Create your own levels</li><li>5 themed words</li></ul>\n<p>Music was created by Parsec Productions, who also helped with ideas and naming levels and other things.</p>\n\n<p><em>* This is one of the first games I uploaded to the internet that wasn't a fangame or more of a prototype than a game, it definitely has some issues in game design, but should run fine hopefully, it runs on my windows 8 PC, if it doesn't run you can try running in compatibility mode.\u00a0 Unfortunately I won't be able to fix any issues.\u00a0 Getting onto moving platforms is one of the major issues as the moving platforms don't actually stop when they reach a ledge, it's kind of finicky and can be frustrating. Also every level can be cleared normally or cleared perfectly by getting all the candy, and some of the levels the candy is more \"do you have enough patience to walk back through the level to get all the candy\" than the more ideal \"here is an extra puzzle to get all the candy\". \u00a0Sorry ^^<br/>The game also ends with an implication there would be a sequel, which never happened. I prototyped some ideas but never released more than a demo. Part of it is that over time I began to not actually like how this game ends, so it felt weird to continue the story.\u00a0 It doesn't end on a cliffhanger or anything, it's still a pretty self-contained story, just putting that out there seeing as the game does end with \"to be continued...\"*</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-20T04:16:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/217/2171c12745431016d5bac86914a58407.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BlackmothEntertainment"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
