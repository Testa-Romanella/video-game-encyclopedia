{"id": 899222, "slug": "moody-metro", "name": "Moody Metro", "name_original": "Moody Metro", "description": "<p>A prototype I've been working on and hope to develop and release fully. Focused on an arcade driving style and a stat-based part system to upgrade cars. Taking inspiration from some of the first open-world racers such as Need for Speed Underground 2 and Midnight Club 3.<br/><br/>Currently, there's a small map, with two events started by two parked cars. You can drive up to an NPC and start a time-trial event(Enter or X Button). If you beat a set time you will be rewarded parts that upgrade your car.<br/><br/>There's also a garage where you can swap to a different car and purchase basic upgrades.<br/><br/>Keep in mind this a prototype and very early in development. There's bugs, glitches, things aren't complete. That said feedback is important and I'll take note of anything I receive. More Updates Coming Soon</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T12:15:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eaf/eaf94f5ee573576ae04b5c183f8c78fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jelify"], "genres": ["RPG", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
