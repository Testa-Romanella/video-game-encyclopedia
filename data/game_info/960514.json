I will indulge you just this once...\"</h3><br/>It is the Year 500. Chaos fell upon the world ten years ago when an unknown and mysterious celestial body arrived and began orbiting Earth. Given the name \"The Witness\" by the natives of the Runic Empire, the celestial body eerily leered down at the people of the world as its energy gifted people with magical powers beyond their wildest dreams.<br/><br/>Ranging from control over the elements like Earth and Fire, to more sophisticated powers like control over animal life and even the gift of healing, humanity found plenty of uses for the newly-found powers they had been bestowed. The gifts people received were named \u201cBursts\u201d after their ability to burst through the limitations of what humanity once thought was possible, and those capable of using them were named \u201cBreakers\u201d. Humanity appeared to be entering a Golden Age of power\u2026but their prosperity was short-lived. Soon, those who relished themselves too extensively in the Witness\u2019 gifts found themselves corrupted, their mental sanity breaking down as the Burst magic running through their veins malformed their minds and bodies. These lost souls were referred to as the Broken, and they ranged from mindless zombies to intelligent monsters. <br/><br/>Among them was King Runic, the most powerful wizard to ever live. When the witness appeared, he used the chaos to consolidate his power and take over. His presence as the king allowed him to maintain control over his many conquered nations. Among his many loyal men, three soldiers were brought together by the sheer gravity of his power. These soldiers served as extensions of his power and were used to conquer and control the region. When King Runic eventually passed, a void of strength was created; one that could only be filled with more strength. Over the years, factions were formed around two of the pillars while the 3rd disappeared completely. The runic kingdom was split once more between the 2 mad kings: Weiss and Saladin.<br/><br/>Though mercenaries are looked down upon by society as ruthless individuals and contracted killers, there is one particular group of them that act in the interest of the people. This group, led by the protagonist, Oden, is one such group. You, as the player, take control of Oden who is famous across the region for his combat aptitude and unwavering stamina and strength. Though, Oden is a victim of severe amnesia and his past is a complete mystery to him, but not all hope is lost after his group is contracted to neutralize the Three Pillars of the Runic Kingdom. <br/><br/>With this quest accepted, Oden and his band of mercenaries venture across the land to combat evil and the Three Pillars themselves in an epic and action-packed adventure.<br/><br/>Will you reclaim your memory and save the kingdom from total corruption?<h3>Lethal Swordplay</h3><br/>Use your sharpened and lethal sword to strike down foes and maintain your Breaker Gauge.<h3>Magic Casting</h3><br/>Oden isn't just limited to his sword. Oden can cast magic spells that deal great damage to enemies. Be careful, however, as continued use of these spells can subject Oden into what we call...<h3>Broken Mode</h3><br/>Continuous exposure to magic and Bursts casts Oden into Broken Mode, a transformation that boosts all of Oden's combat capabilities. Be sparing with this mode, as it will limit your vitality the more you use it.<h3>Engaging Story</h3><br/>The world of Year 500 has plenty of characters and lore to discover. Speak to your fellow mercenaries, descry the world around you and be exposed to a rich lore that has more than meets the eye.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-08T03:44:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7c/e7c86e3825529fadcbaa91587b9823e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Breakers Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["The Breakers Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
