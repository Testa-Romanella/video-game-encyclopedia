The step counter will trigger events.\u00a0</p>\n<p>During encounters: point your phone in different directions while holding your finger on the screen to listen for ghosts. There's a reference sound that points to you where it is. When you hear the sound in both ears, shoot the ghost by swiping either left or right on your screen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This prototype was meant to explore how elements of soundscape design and mobile sensors can be integrated to create a kind of screenless AR experience.
