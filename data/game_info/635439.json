The Pirate Queen is an action slasher from Cyberfox Studios. You\u2019ll be frantically swinging your sword to take down a slew of different enemies. Make snap decisions about who to take down first before your rapidly dwindling health runs out!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nStep into the shoes of Grace O\u2019Malley, a real Irish pirate warlord from the 16th century. You will struggle to carve out a place to survive and thrive in an Ireland packed with feuding clans, and fight to unite Ireland against the threat of the British Empire. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nTHE PIRATE QUEEN features tons of different enemies and bosses that will require strategy and speed to beat, cutscenes giving you a taste of pirate life, and an endless mode to let you really push your sword fighting to the limit!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI created THE PIRATE QUEEN after being inspired and excited by Grace\u2019s tale. Every story I heard about her was crazier than the last. I knew capturing the thrill of O\u2019Malley\u2019s life in a game would be something special.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTHE PIRATE QUEEN is Cyberfox Studios\u2019 premier game, and we\u2019ve loved every second of making it. It isn\u2019t without its shortcomings, but we hope our passion and excitement shines through.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYAAARGH!<br/>\r\n-John Mints II<br/>\r\nFounder", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T05:00:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a8/7a8c9ac275dbe8f67c865337b4e7cb19_hXfcVUc.jpg", "website": "http://www.cyberfoxstudios.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["John Mints", "Cyberfox Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["John Mints", "Cyberfox Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
