Inspired by games such as 'I'm On Observation Duty', you are left alone in a basement\u00a0with nothing but some cameras, a phone and your thoughts.\u00a0Monitor surveillance cameras to check for hallucinations, and click and hold to rectify them.\u00a0The longer you let these hallucinations\u00a0stay, the more dangerous <em>it </em>gets...</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>- Watch every room through the camera (accessed by clicking on your computer), and look out for any changes that occur to the rooms.</p>\n<p>- Click and hold on hallucinations\u00a0to fix them. The longer you ignore a hallucination, the more your sanity will drop.</p>\n<p>- The creature will manifest as your sanity deteriorates. Use the phone besides you to call for help, but be aware as this takes time, and is on a lengthy\u00a0cooldown.</p>\n<p>- Hang in there, help will arrive at 6AM.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Modelling &amp; shaders: Draak5, BupBoi</p>\n<p>Programming: Yoshihide<br/></p>\n<p>Incredible voice acting: BupBoi</p>\n<p>https://bupboi.itch.io/</p>\n<p>https://draak-5.itch.io/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T10:08:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8b/a8bdcbf07ddf7cb040cd1a01f0272067.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yoshihide"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
