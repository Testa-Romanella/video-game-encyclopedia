Duality has been kept in the foreground both in the creation of the content and the design.\u00a0 While the design of the game is determined in black and white it is also constructed on two opposite maps. The biggest difference between the maps is that the rules of gravity and other influence states are contrasted on both maps. On the second map, Arrow keys are also used as mirrored based on the theme of duality. Despite those negotiations, the game shares one aim, to collect the keys that appear in both worlds in this conflict of contrasts to reach the end with the help of a circular portal.</p>\n<p>Designed by team <strong>numenal </strong>(Fatih Andic, Kardelen Turkoglu, Umut Yildiz, Zeynep Ozge Yalcin)</p>\n<p>The game is still under development, the second map will be added soon.</p><p>https://play.unity.com/mg/other/onely-17z<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T09:03:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/340/34067043c859dd824e62f561eb0b151f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zozge"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
