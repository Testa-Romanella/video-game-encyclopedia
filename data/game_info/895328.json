It is one of the most popular board games in\u00a0Japan\u00a0and is in the same family of games as\u00a0Western chess,\u00a0chaturanga,\u00a0Xiangqi,\u00a0Indian chess, and Janggi.\r\n<p>In this game demo I will showcase a certain mechanic which is the drop rule in Shogi. Pieces that you captured from your opponent can be used in future moves. On your turn, you can choose to move a piece or drop/deploy a piece from your hand on to the board.</p>\n<p>I could not yet program the whole game of Shogi in this demo, so\u00a0I thought I will show you guys how does someone solve a Shogi checkmate puzzle called Tsume Shogi!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<strong>Tsume shogi</strong>\u00a0(\u8a70\u5c06\u68cb or \u8a70\u3081\u5c06\u68cb,\u00a0<em>tsume sh\u014dgi</em>)\u00a0or\u00a0<strong>tsume</strong>\u00a0(\u8a70\u3081) is the\u00a0Japanese\u00a0term for a\u00a0shogi\u00a0miniature problem in which the goal is to\u00a0checkmate\u00a0the opponent's king. Tsume problems usually present a situation that might occur in a shogi game (although unrealistic artistic tsume shogi exists), and the solver must find out how to achieve checkmate. It is similar to a mate-in-<em>n</em>\u00a0chess problem.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T13:19:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/483/483f2eeff47dcdcfee191523f4acb10f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jienjien"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
