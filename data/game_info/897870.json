Or do not do any of those things. The choice is yours when you play <em>An Empty Game</em>.<br/></p>\n<p>(plz play it)</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong> WASD/Arrow keys to move, shift to move ever so slightly faster, E/Enter to interact.<br/></p>\n<p>Special thanks to the following people:\u00a0Morgan Chipman for composing the short guitar riff at the beginning of the game;\u00a0 All my playtesters: Ryan, Dylan, Mathew, Morgan, and Jake;</p>\n<p>And you!</p>\n<p><strong>Notes</strong>:\u00a0If, after beating the game, the game only shows a black screen, input the Konami code.</p>\n<p>Despite what the game says, the game is 100% finished, except for minor patches.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>This game contains disturbing elements.
