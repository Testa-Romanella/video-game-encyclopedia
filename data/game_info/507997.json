Everything is done in 2 days. There are 2 shaders , one of them for turning paints to white and black because actual paint's parts are already painted with different colors to detect which part should be painted by shaders. Other shader is for masking brushes by using these prepainted colors.</p>\n<p>When you click the screen it detect which color is under the mouse then passes to shader. I know it seems white but actual paints aren't.</p>\n<p>In app you can undo, delete all history, fill whole parts (bucket), paint with pattern or colors and most important feature is you can do all of these without overflowing parts.</p>\n<p>I have made the project for a freelance job so I\u00a0can't share the sourcecode for now. Also\u00a0I've never code this type of painting demo before in any engine , even I haven't even seen this kind of painting\u00a0 app\u00a0made in godot. If there was one, it would be helpful therefore I had to learn everything and to use my previous experience while making the project.</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> For the demo there are just 4 images that I didn't work much on it and of course it can be more than 4 and be better images.</p>\n<p><strong>USAGE VIDEO:</strong>\u00a0<strong>www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L763PtqOks</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T05:49:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/878/8786652a8c6643f793cdcc26702ffdfc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["cenullum"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
