The theme was <em>Lost &amp; Found</em>.</p><p><em>#Game Dev Unlocked Game Jam #2</em><br/></p>\n<p>My idea resolved around souls being lost, by escaping from hell and collecting them to 'find' them, by attacking humans which have been possessed by the demonic souls. I didn't want to spend too much time thinking about a perfect idea because I know from my experience that I will think over and over and never start if I do that.</p>\n<p>I know the game has some bugs or 'jankiness' to it because of time constraints, but I am very happy and proud of myself for making what I believe to be my best game yet in just one week. The time pressure really helped me push through every chance I get and prioritizing tasks to make what's most important before spending too much time polishing little stuff.</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed my work, you can follow me on Twitter @duanecreates or Instagram where I'm most active with my day-to-day progress.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T07:59:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b30/b30631d77071a767116cf1c7e7840134.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Duane Creates"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
