Awesome game jam!</p>\n<p>Participants: Andrew Hsu (HuckCG) and Sid Naik</p>\n<p>The intended mechanic was..... the axe from Bowser's castle in Super Mario! We thought it was hilarious that you didn't have to fight Bowser and could just touch the axe to make him fall and die, so we created a boss fight in which you had to do exactly that. Unfortunately because of time restrictions, we couldn't finish it, but here's the cutscene we DID make:\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>We also used a previous rail shooter controller (that we adjusted from the MixAndJam Star Fox Rail Movement controller), and converted it for \"All-Range Mode\" just for this boss fight.</p>\n<p>All art was created with free models or designed in blender, and all music/sfx were free assets.</p>\n<p>https://i.gyazo.com/e5aa75e48c0f62e20e62776b88d8e6d9.mp4<br/></p>\n<p>you know... making games is easier than you think xD</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T03:45:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/192/192106858d7fbb514bc70b5ad0a3eccd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HuckGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
