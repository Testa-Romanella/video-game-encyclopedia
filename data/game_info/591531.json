This is a game where you play as a submarine, and you must beat each level by weaving in between the bombs placed in amongst the overgrown, underwater areas. It's definitely not a difficult game - I was trying to keep it quite simple to both make and play, but I really hope you enjoy it! Thanks heaps for checking it out!\u00a0:D</p>\n<p>All assets and code was created within the 48 hours of the Compo.</p>\n<ul><li>YouTube -\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/c/Icosogames</li><li>Discord -\u00a0https://discord.com/invite/pEBzR2Jk4F</li><li>Twitter - https://twitter.com/icoso_games</li><li>Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/icoso_games/</li></ul>\n<p>Tools:</p>\n<ul><li>Game Engine - Unity3D</li><li>Text Editor - Visual Studio</li><li>Graphics - Aseprite</li><li>Music - FL Studio</li><li>Sound Effects - Bfxr</li></ul>\n<p>:D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T05:40:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01f/01f41072fb09298be05c9b7998500c80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Icoso"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
