One reviewer referred to it as &quot;Defender in the desert&quot;.<br />\nIn Chopper Command the player controls a military helicopter in a desert scenario protecting a convoy of trucks. The goal is to destroy all enemy fighter jets and helicopters that attack the player&#39;s helicopter and the friendly trucks traveling below, ending the current wave. The game ends when the player loses all of his or her lives or reaches 999,999 points. A radar, called a Long Range Scanner in the instruction manual, shows all enemies, including those not visible on the main screen.<br />\nA player who achieved 10,000 points could send in a photo of the TV screen and receive a &quot;Chopper Commandos&quot; patch.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1982-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:52:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06c/06cfeb0ac45f772f3231d9e95ae3c725.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 8, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Atari 2600", "PC", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["Activision"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Activision Blizzard"], "esrb_rating": null}
