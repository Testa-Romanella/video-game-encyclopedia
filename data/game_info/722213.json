I wanted to finish something not overly ambitious, but something I could be proud of, with some spit and polish and not just a prototype. I learnt a ton making this game. Pixel art is hard. Bigger pixel art is harder. Music and sound effects too. Everything you add to a game ripples all the way through everything else. And yet there's an amazing, supportive, and friendly community out there, building games, sharing tools and techniques and art. I want to thank all those that helped me, that encouraged me, that gave me feedback on early versions of the game. So now I\u00a0have finally shipped something.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Built with DragonRuby GTK</li><li>Black Chancery font version of 11/19/91 by Earl Allen/Doug Miles</li><li>7:12 Serif font by \"CMunk\"</li><li>Chord progression generated with ChordChord</li><li>Melodies generated using OneMotion Chord Player</li><li>Sound FX generated with ChipTone by Tom Vian</li><li>Art created with Aseprite</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T09:04:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c00/c00588cca83b70af76781af970a29b6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Marc"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
