I am more or less just your ordinary kid. Well if you consider a kid trying to get into Game Development as ordinary. As for the game, it's really just your ordinary snake game but skinned to be scammer based with some scammer audio in it. I will probably (definitely) add more features to the game in the future such as a leaderboard and maybe even a multiplayer that would somewhat represent tetris in two player mode. The game is very basic so you should not expect too much if you download it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3d/b3de7778fee52eb0df3887027562079d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Derpy-Canadian"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
