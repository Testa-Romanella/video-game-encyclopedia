If you are ahead of a space station but roughly in the same orbit, try expanding your orbit by firing prograde to slow down. Conversely, if you are behind a space station, try decreasing the size of your orbit by firing retrograde. This may seem counter-intuitive, but so is reality. This video may help too (not made by me.)</p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT: Windows flags a lot of indie games as potential viruses since they aren't published by a recognized entity.

They will be displayed in the bottom\u00a0right.</p>\n<strong>Orbit</strong>\n<p> To visit a station, you must approach it in orbit. Stations are represented by yellow dots in orbit and you, the player, are a white dot. Make sure to match the stations' speeds in orbit or else you won't enter docking mode. That means that you and the stations should have roughly the same orbit, and you should be in the same position at some point on that orbit.\u00a0Some stations will only allow you to enter if you've already visited another station, so it is best to do the objectives in the order they are listed, from top to bottom.</p>\n<strong>Docking</strong>\n<p> When you've met up with the station (this is called a rendezvous) you will need to dock (connect) with it. This is done by slowly approaching the station and putting the crafts docking ports against each other. The position of the docking port is indicated by a green dot. Once you've docked you will be taken back to the orbit view from which you can choose your next destination. If you've completed all your objectives you will proceed to the next level.</p>\n<strong>Controls</strong>\n<p>[R] = restart</p>\n<p>[Scroll] = zoom<br/></p>\n<strong>Controls in orbit view</strong>\n<p>[Right mouse + drag] = pan</p>\n<p>On-screen buttons:</p>\n<p>\"New Maneuver\" = Begin planning your next orbital maneuver.
