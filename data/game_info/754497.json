Later on the sprites will be replaced with higher quality custom drawn sprites. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Feedback is more than welcome!</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>NOTE: This will not become a full re-make of the entirety of Mega Man 7, it's only ment as a practice project for future projects.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>- Move = Arrow Keys / WASD<br/>- Jump = Space / X / K<br/>- Attack = Z / J<br/>- Slide = Shift<br/>- Select Weapon = (0-8)<br/>- Menu = Esc<br/><br/>Dev Tools:<br/>- Page_Up = Move player 200 pixels backwards (Anti-Stuck key/test tool, if ever needed to use)<br/>- Pause button: [Pause key] (if the game seems to be frozen for some reason, try pressing \"pause\" just in case)<br/>- Frame Advance = [Keypad \"Plus\"] (Very buggy)<br/>- Spawn another player = [Keypad \"multiply\"] (this \"may\" lag your game. To get rid of the \"clones\", restart the game from the menu or refresh the browser).<br/>- Able to change the game speed in the settings menu (mostly for testing purposes).<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Version 07032022 public alpha 1<br/></strong></p>\n<p>- Currently WildCoil and Mega Buster have been implemented, more special weapons will be added as progress is done.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Known Bugs/Issues:</strong><br/>- Player might get stuck in geometry, that's why I got the \"Page Up\" key :3<br/>- Animations might sometimes behave strangely (the current animation system will be completely over-hauled in the future for a better one).<br/>- Audio is not balanced/some audio clips might sound off and spamming too many projectiles will make loud noises!<br/>- No way to die in the game yet (Death not yet implemented, pits intentionally repel the player to prevent falling off the stage)<br/>- No safety for falling off the stage (you have to reset the in-game via the menu or refresh the browser).<br/>- Few development tools left intentionally, so be careful with them.<br/>- Sliding state can sometimes get stuck when getting hit while sliding.<br/>- Floating platforms might causes wonky behaviour with the player character.<br/>- Healthbar overflows from the bottom, if the player has too much health. (This is intentional as I forgot to check if health bar is higher than max_health).<br/></p>\n\n<p>Made in <strong>GODOT</strong>.<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>All assets from\u00a0Mega Man 7 (SNES):<br/>-Sprites, music and characters -&gt; Copyright Capcom <br/>\u00a0 \u00a0=Sprites ripped by:\u00a0 (KeyBlade999, Magma Dragoon, DogToon64, QuadFactor and Mister Man) and few made by me based from the game.
