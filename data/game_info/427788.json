Help Bob navigate through the Tower of Contrivance. Bob is distressed, which has caused him to move at random. Guide him through all 50 levels through whatever means necessary. Bob is a good boy. Protect Bob at all costs! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach level is a self-contained puzzle. Levels progressively get more complicated. If Bob or any part of the level gets out of control, you can reset the level at any time. It is a simple game with a simple premise, but it is not so simple to complete. It will test you. Relax and go with the flow.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T08:32:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c7/6c70ec6347cb3730d549ed5b96909500.jpg", "website": "https://www.silhouettevalleygames.com/bob-wants-to-go-home", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Silhouette Valley Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Silhouette Valley Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
