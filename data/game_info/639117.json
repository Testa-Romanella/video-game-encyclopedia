Shooting a name will display how long they have been following that person's channel. Gifted subs and resubs will display as a new name during the game. If you are worried about player avatars, I suggest putting your camera over that section.<br/><br/>The game will actually play Super Mario Odyssey music, but I changed it for the video to avoid strikes / claims :) <br/><br/>If you enjoyed this game, please consider checking out my other Twitch inspired game, Chataclysm! I\u00a0would love to know if you play either of these games on stream. Thank you!<br/><br/>https://davidarthurpaul.itch.io/chataclysm</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T06:08:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bba/bbaa0aa84ee210f284968ce23d84e9ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["davidarthurpaul"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
