As of today, there are no studies which can affirm at 100 percent that this is true, evidence that supports these sort of statements still remains delicate and complex. However, many studies hypothesise and suggest that an improvement of cognitive functions remains possible through video games. Such studies would be shown through this interactive game. The idea is to guide you through several reading parts while immersing you in an interactive world where you can experience the situations which you are reading about.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d0/5d05e86e9689e8f93475aa88a7e5ae5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bry55"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
