I'm a 17 year old that is hoping to one day be a video game designer, and I have finally finished my\u00a0first ever project. I started the project about a year ago on UE4 and then took a break for a long time. Just recently I finished it, and the entire game was probably built in about 4 months or so. Yes there will be bugs, yes the polish is not great, but I am very excited to release my first game and see what people think. Criticism is good so I can gain information for my next project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*The only assets I used\u00a0from the marketplace where the furniture pack, and effects pack I know a lot of beginners like to use assets but not me</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-09T04:02:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9b/c9b9776d087ea6049e801fde8943111f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BigJohnson"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
