Take care as the labyrinth will shift and change every 10 seconds.</p>\n<p>Your goal is to search the twisting corridors for 5 specific items, but beware, the other items are cursed and will send you back to a starting location. The goal is to find all 5 items in the fastest time possible.</p>\n<p>This is heavily inspired by the board game with the same name (Labyrinth by Ravensburger)</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>- WSAD to move<br/>- E, F to interact / pickup items</p>\n<p><strong>Notes / Know issues:</strong><br/>The game definitely needs some balancing. Due to the random nature of the labyrinth it's very possible for a player to be stuck in section of the labyrinth for some time. If I had more time, or was able to do a second pass I'd probably look to address this in some way.\u00a0</p><p>Would also like to add a pause menu so players can access settings mid-game</p>\n<p><strong>Assets used:</strong><br/><strong>- Character Controller:<br/></strong>\u00a0 -\u00a0Starter Assets - First Person Character Controller</p>\n<p><strong>- Graphics:</strong><br/>\u00a0 - Game-Icons.net<br/>\u00a0 - Synty Studios - POLYGON Dungeon Pack<br/>\u00a0 - Synty Studios - POLYGON Dungeon Map<br/>\u00a0 - Synty Studios - POLYGON Dungeon Realms<br/>\u00a0 - Synty Studios -\u00a0POLYGON Horror Mansion<br/>\u00a0 - Synty Studios -\u00a0POLYGON Explorer<br/>\u00a0 -\u00a0Synty Studios -\u00a0POLYGON Particle FX</p>\n<p>- Audio:<br/>\u00a0 - Mega SFX Pack<br/>\u00a0 - Ultimate Sound FX Bundle<br/>\u00a0 - Dark Fantasy Studio- Shadows Guild</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T21:19:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f65/f65a93df06739ba0b2124776ac20e49d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Diannara"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
