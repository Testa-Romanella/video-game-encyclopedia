Only problem is you were told all your life that their is no\u00a0fifth element. After consulting your mentor, you are told the one person who might know it's identity\u00a0is the oracle. However, the oracle does not like to be disturbed and one misstep along the way could be fatal.</p>\n<p>I made this game in three hours for Trijam 3 Hour Jam for the theme 5th element. This is the jam version and while the story is complete, the music does not fit at all and I had to cut out the middle a bit. I will fill it in after the jam\u00a0and promise my next game will be much better XD.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Music:</p>\n<p>\"Medieval: Exploration\"</p>\n<p>Author: RandomMind</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/medieval-exploration</p>\n<p>Art:</p>\n<p>Shelves3, Workshop1</p>\n<p>Author: Lornn</p>\n<p>https://lornn.itch.io/witches-wizards-backgrounds</p>\n<p>Dune 1, Dune Cave 1</p>\n<p>Author: Lornn</p>\n<p>https://lornn.itch.io/fantasy-desert-backgrounds</p>\n<p>Birch 2, Cave, Clearing 1, Clearing 6, Cottage Interior 1, Fields 1 Mist 4</p>\n<p>Author: Lornn</p>\n<p>https://lornn.itch.io/fantasy-forest-backgrounds</p>\n<p>Mob Old Man Green, Mob Old Man Red</p>\n<p>Author:linxuelian</p>\n<p>https://linxuelian.itch.io/charres-mob-oldman</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-10T02:58:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db8/db85978d761faa6f365e8fa119136a99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kobato Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
