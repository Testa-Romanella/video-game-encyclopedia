Want to force your opponent to play breakout instead of pong? Pick wizard.</p><p>The game is still quite early in development and the assets are largely placeholders (there to get a feel for how things work)\u00a0but the gameplay itself is solid.</p>\r\nMultiplayer\r\n<p>You shouldn't need to forward ports, but if people have trouble connecting, forward whatever port you want to use.
