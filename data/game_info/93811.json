Part puzzle game and part eccentric inventor's laboratory, Contraption Maker is full of ridiculous fun.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe team that created the original \"Incredible Machine\" (for those of you old enough to remember), are back with the spiritual successor. Didn't play the original? Don't know what we are talking about? Check out all of these features:\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\tEnjoy hours of puzzle solving with over 200 official puzzles and countless community submissions. Fix broken contraptions with a specific set of parts you are given to accomplish goals like turning on lights, opening fireworks factories, and throwing birthday parties for crocodiles.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\tEnter the easy to use Maker Lab to make your own awesome contraptions. More than 100 parts ranging from gears and lasers to bears and cats are at your disposal. Use the layered background tool to create settings for your contraptions to exist in, and then animate them to add some life. \r\n\t<strong>There's no part or size limitation to what you want to make.</strong><br/>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\tPlay online with friends to build contraptions together in the Maker Lab. \r\n\t<strong>Up to 8 players can build together</strong> in real time. Currently multiplayer is only in the Maker Lab, there is no cooperative puzzle solving yet.<br/>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\tShare your puzzles and creations with the world through the Workshop (On and off Steam). \r\n\t<strong>Thousands of Workshop submissions</strong> from puzzles to laser powered computers are already waiting to be played.<br/>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\tJavascript modding is built directly into the game. \r\n\t<strong>Create custom game types</strong> using all of the the Contraption Maker parts and physics as a base. Or start with a published mod and use the Maker Lab to make a new level. Easily share and play other mods in the Workshop.\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Contraption Maker does not run on Windows XP</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff9/ff921c4aea06ce00e1c1dc2fba30b3ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Spotkin"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
