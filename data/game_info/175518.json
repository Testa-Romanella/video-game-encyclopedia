There's not a lot of power in these batteries though, and you're low of them.<br/>There's ennemies!<br/>There's multiple levels!</p>\n<p>So here's some anticipated question/answer:</p>\n<p>Q: Why are movement so weird? Why can't I change direction while jumping?<br/>A: Because the game is design like that, in order to make you feel uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>Q: Why is the battery running low so fast?<br/>A: Because of the theme of the Ludum Dare. And because without that, collecting battery would feel useless.</p>\n<p>Q: How can I low kick in the face of an ennemy?<br/>A: You can't. You only can interact with them via the flashlight, or by dying.</p>\n<p>Q: How long is the game?<br/>A: 2 minutes straightforward, but...</p>\n<p>Q: That game is freaking hard!<br/>A: Up to 15 minutes when you're discovering it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/016/016544f74c09f5fe93d9b6b50c0b1a5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MarionLAsticot"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
