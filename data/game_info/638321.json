This game was made in under 24 hours, so there's bound to be issues with the gameplay and a few bugs!\u00a0You can send me feedback via the comment section on this project page, the in-game feedback menu,\u00a0or you can contact me on\u00a0<strong>Twitter</strong>\u00a0or\u00a0<strong>Discord</strong>.</p>\n<p>Since this game was created as part of a 24 hour challenge I set myself, I documented the experience in an entertaining devlog style video over on my\u00a0<strong>YouTube channel</strong>.\u00a0So if you're interested, go check it out!</p>\n\r\nHow do I play?\r\n<p>Well, you're a capsule <em>(so unique!)</em> and you're goal is to get as high as possible without dying to the rising pit of lava beneath you. You'll need to dodge <em>(using WASD and 'Space')</em> falling blocks and use them <em>(via clicking and dragging)</em> to build a tower so that you can climb away from the lava.</p>\n\n\r\nSounds easy, what's the catch?\r\n<p>I can assure you, it's not gonna be easy. Why? Because the game's difficulty increases the higher you climb. Meaning that the lava will rise faster and faster until you're <strong>dead</strong>. However, you gain coins every 5 metres and as the difficulty increases you'll get even more coins! You can then use these coins at the shop which is located at checkpoint platforms to buy upgrades so that you can climb even higher. But, the distance between each\u00a0checkpoint platform will increase with difficulty so make sure you use your coins wisely!\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\r\nCool! How do I get started?\r\n<p>You'll want to create a new folder somewhere on your computer and extract the contents of the zip into it. Most operating systems have a way to deal with zips, but if not, just download a zip decompressor of some sort and extract the file with that. Once you've got the folder ready, open it up and\u00a0click on the Toppler Effect executable file (application on Mac)\u00a0and have some fun!</p>\n<p>If you have any feedback, make sure to use the 'F12' menu in-game!<br/><br/><strong>Note:</strong>\u00a0If you're a Mac user, you may have to go into you security settings to allow the program through the MacOS security protocol. There should be a little question mark on the top right of the pop up that tells you how to do that. Once you've got the security settings open, make sure to click 'ok' on the pop-up so that the security settings will show the prompt to allow Cube\u00a0Run to run. Alternatively, you can download the itch.io desktop app and then download the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T06:44:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48a/48a7e9867baa495fa36ce8c3163896d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["dashdev"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
