Each level has the same goal - switch off all tiles using the least amount of moves. Test limits of your brain by perfecting each puzzle. Let your mind be your guide in meditative and relaxing, yet challenging, journey. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tAccording to Zen philosophy, game has minimalistic UI - no timers, score or move limit labels. No distraction, just you and puzzle.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9f/f9fbad03ca2c72fff49f3e5c99110990.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Konstructors Entertainment"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
