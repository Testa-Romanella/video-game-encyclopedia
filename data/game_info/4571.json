Titans known as the Old Ones were defeated with their power being locked away inside Eternia Crystals. Bored apprentices decide to play with the Crystals and unleash the evil forces once again.</p>\n<p>The game currently has 12 different classes to choose from. Each class has a unique playstyle. For example, the Adept is a good tower character while the Countess is a tank.</p>\n<p>The players have to fight off the hordes of enemies. In order to do it, the players have to build up defenses which are different for each class. Players can also upgrade their equipment and get new weapons and armor. It is also possible to summon a personal pet which grants a buff to characters abilities and can repair the defenses.</p>\n<p>Every game mode is playable in both multiplayer and singleplayer, yet some events are online-only.</p>", "metacritic": 81, "released": "2010-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-07T09:17:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/321/3213f56333ca5e92a620f41bd3365637.jpg", "website": "http://dungeondefenders.com/", "rating": 3.32, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 115, "owned": 2686, "beaten": 114, "toplay": 15, "dropped": 153, "playing": 5}, "playtime": 8, "achievements_count": 130, "ratings_count": 282, "suggestions_count": 578, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 282, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS", "Android", "PlayStation 3", "macOS", "Linux", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["Trendy Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Reverb Communications", "Trendy Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
