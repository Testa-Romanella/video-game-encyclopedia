Your job here is to decide whether a patient requires immediate treatment or not.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUse any available information: family status, criminal records or medical testing. Don\u2019t forget, that there are way more patients than you can treat at once and every decision has its consequences. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can\u2019t save them all, but does everyone really deserve to be saved? Check carefully each case. Fates of some patients have direct influence over other\u2019s and even over your own!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGood luck, Doctor!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-11T05:10:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a40/a4068971b9060ed6f0dde0e302b8e857.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gard Interactive"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Gard Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
