Work out and gain stats like dexterity, strength, and intelligence. Earn coins at work to get and give gifts, like bananas, flowers, and candles, then take them on dates to the beach, forest, or roof top. Gain the woman's favor, and they will let you into their apartments, where the real action will happen (nudity warning). The woman will also give you gifts back. With over 100 pictures to collect, get some or get knocked out trying. Each woman has two different story endings. This game has a choose-your-own adventure mixed with open-world gameplay.
