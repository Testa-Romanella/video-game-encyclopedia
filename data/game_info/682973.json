She will use her skills of law in the criminal justice system to create a crime scene, solve it and help her partner solve it. The players are going to solve crimes in real life, using Steffi's unique abilities, and occasionally taking pictures.<br/>\nThe players to enter the game will be sent a crime scene set up by Steffi and the other members of the black layer, but they have to solve the crime scenes themselves. The black layer is comprised of black limousines, black cars, black police cars, black aretats, and white uniforms and is armed with stun guns and submachine guns.\n\nPlease make sure to watch the video and move on to the full gameplay trailer for the game (above).\n\nOuthouse Media was founded in 2007 by Joanne Phillips and Chris Tye.
