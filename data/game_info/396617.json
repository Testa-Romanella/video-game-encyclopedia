I\u00a0was the sole programmer on the team. The intention was to make a fun stealth game that didn't take itself too seriously. From this project I learned how to properly import assets into the Unity engine and how to make\u00a0basic AI behavior. Making AI move and come to life was my favorite thing I did in this project.</p>\n<p>Captain Panda and the Party Palooza is a stealth game where you, Captain Panda, have to get your party back on track by switching your robot friend's control switch back to party from kill. To do this you must sneak around to avoid the killer robots and turn the knob back to party!</p>\n<p>How to Play:<br/>Use WASD and the mouse to navigate the player character. Either evade or disable the robots by sneaking behind the robots and using the 'E' button to interact with the large black button on the back.<br/>Reach the end of the level and use the 'E' button to interact with the large grey knob on the purple switch to win the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T04:17:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc6/cc6055346443b7ccf6bf3dcfc42f262a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joseph Winemberg"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
