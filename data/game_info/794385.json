Other than that, I hope you enjoy this short story I made.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong><em>~Partial spoilers from here on out~</em></strong></p>\n<p>So far the story has one ending, and may seem confusing by the end of it. But depending on how I feel, the game may be updated to have multiple endings though I feel that it's perfectly fine as it is.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T10:32:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5b/e5b0d8a3e44bd377d2a2c5d0ad0aab46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Arcade Sky"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
