{"id": 4856, "slug": "hoard", "name": "HOARD", "name_original": "HOARD", "description": "<p>HOARD is an arcade action game, set in a fantasy world, where the player will take control of a mighty dragon. The game\u2019s overall main goal is to collect treasure for the dragon\u2019s hoard, as the name implies.<br />\nThe gameplay is based around moving through different landscapes, burning down villages, collecting gold troves and kidnapping members of the local royal family, a classic dragon activity. However, the player needs to defend his character\u2019s lair from daring adventurers. Knights set out on a quest of saving the beautiful princess,  and many more creatures with a common goal of defeating the dragon, which would be you. With level progression, players can upgrade different parameters of their scaled protagonist and improve their gold acquiring capabilities. <br />\nThe game offers four game modes, with cooperative multiplayer gradually increasing the difficulty and the overall fun of each playthrough. The graphics are unique in the way where the game field looks like a board game table, with castles and villages placed around differently each time, and the overall look of the game is as if it was a D&amp;D game that suddenly became alive.</p>", "metacritic": 65, "released": "2010-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T12:39:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87f/87fd7f7312a5382dfe31fe9cf538d1c7.jpg", "website": "http://www.hoardgame.com/", "rating": 2.68, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 61, "owned": 1401, "beaten": 16, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 46, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 140, "ratings_count": 93, "suggestions_count": 414, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 94, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 3", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Big Sandwich Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Arcade", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Big Sandwich Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
