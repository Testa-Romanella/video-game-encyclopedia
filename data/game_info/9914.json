The basic rules are similar. The environment, the pressure of AI to characters, and the process of player to overcome these pressures through collecting, building and fighting.<br/><br/>Phantom has some different features; it can be said to distinguish the other survival games.<br/><br/><ul><li> Phantom is a very unique style of hard science fiction survival game, the art style is different from most of the survival of game in the market.<br/><br/></li><li>A purely physical construction system, the vast majority of the survival of the construction of the game system is just a \"shell\", these \"shell\" cannot move! The Phantom construction system is different, if the player to build any purpose for a building or tool, the player needs to design by themselves, Phantom provides only the most basic \"function block.\" Second, these \"function blocks\" all follow Newton's law, they are alive, players can interact with them. Then based on the construction system, in theory, the player can create any highly interactive things. Whether buildings, traps, vehicles, aircraft, rail cars, and even calculators can be designed and built, Phantom provide almost unlimited possibilities.<br/><br/></li><li>Human beings as the player of the survival game is a very natural choice, because here are a lot of human needs, to eat, drink, to moderate temperature, with physical constraints, and even guts and so on. But in the Phantom world, electricity is almost the only need to be considered. Although it seems to greatly simplify the survival part of the game, but in fact it is a challenge of the distribution and management of the electricity, because in the Phantom world to do almost everything needs electricity, alive need electricity, running, fighting, construction, and so on all rely on electricity. more terrible is that those who build the functional blocks are all in need of electricity to operate. Power is very limited, then how to allocate power according to the situation is to challenge the players.<br/></li></ul><br/>When physical construction is combined with single source power survival, I believe that Phantom provides a unique gaming experience.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:14:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/486/486630dd8d26aa025fc6a2c6112a89c9.jpg", "website": "http://www.phantomisreal.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 25, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 250, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Phantomsireal", "Phantomisreal"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Phantomsireal", "Phantomisreal"], "esrb_rating": null}
