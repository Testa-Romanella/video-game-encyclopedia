Travel around a fantasy land where 4 different cultures have merged, but not always peacefully. Disarray is spreading through the land, and the ruler is doing nothing about it, so maybe it's time to replace them.<br/><br/>Asking politely most likely won't do the job, so you're going to need an army if you wish to take over the capital. But remember, this is going to be a dangerous journey, so you should always think carefully about the choices you make. It's hard to be a leader if you, and your troops are all dead.<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/>Raise your sword<br/><ul><li> ...and promptly put it back down, after you realize that you\u2019re not much of a warrior. Perhaps the role of a leader will suit you better.</li></ul>Gather your troops<br/><ul><li>Recruit characters from 4 different races, and turn your ragtag group into a formidable army.</li></ul>Travel across the land <br/><ul><li>Explore a kingdom, where the ideologies and cultures of 4 different races have merged.</li></ul>Discover events &amp; encounters<br/><ul><li>During your quest, you will come across different types of events and encounters that require you to make choices.
