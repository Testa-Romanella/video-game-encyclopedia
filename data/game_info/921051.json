The theme was \"Roots\", so we thought... Vegetables have roots, so why don't we do a party game about farmers?!</p>\n<p>Root Dudes has 4 minigames, each game is played as BO3 (best of three) so maybe you will need to play a couple times to see all minigames!</p>\n<p>The gameplay is really friendly, players can only move and grab/drop items.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Movement: WASD / arrow keys</li><li>Grab / Drop: Spacebar / enter</li></ul>\n<p>The minigames:</p>\n<ul><li>Water a tree trunk: Take care of the lawnmower and follow the rainy cloud! With your bucket, get a load of water and pour it into the tree!</li><li>Plant your vegetables: Vegetables are raining from the sky! pick them up and plant them on your garden. But be carefoul, your rival may steal them from you... or maybe you will steal them from him</li><li>Turnip gathering: Pick up turnips and drop them in the trunk! Take care, your rival can also steal them! Also, the bigger the turnip, the greater the scoring</li><li>Lawnmower chaos: Protect your roots from the lawnmower! Make sure to grab them and put them away from you!</li></ul>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<ul><li>\u00c1lvaro D\u00edaz Due\u00f1as --&gt; Game design &amp; programming</li><li>Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds Ru\u00edz Garc\u00eda --&gt; 3D art, textures, QA</li><li>Carlos Oliva --&gt; 3D art, textures</li><li>Sergio Ros --&gt; 2D art, lightning, textures</li><li>Ranjith Sebasti\u00e1n S\u00e1nchez\u00a0--&gt; 3D art, VFX</li><li>Daniel Alberto L\u00f3pez --&gt; 2D art, UI, textures</li><li>Naxo Lara Romero (@scifiensemble) --&gt; M\u00fasica</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T19:23:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1f/b1f3fdf827aa2ede9dd493cffe53a5fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zorkat", "Jos\u00e9 Luis Ruiz", "RastaPanda7", "Sergio1808", "charliesala", "Trickeout"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
