Is this a dream or nightmare? Reality or bionic simulcra of your refracted cosmic memory? Who knows... but welcome to the jungle... you've got your psionic ax to grind...</p>\n<p>A very playable and beatable mini-adventure. Collect the lil shiny diamonds and da ones often found near boulders as well as eliminate all enemies with your \"portal charge-ram ability\" against certain robotic avian entities, or for more stalwart foes, simply blast with your psionic ax.</p>\n<p>Made this as sort of a quick mini adventure originally but it as evolved into a mini classic in my own mind to give release for you. And who knows, maybe more to come with the zany characters here sometime within the next 30 years... possibly, etc, etc. But this first adventure was certainly fun to make and play. I hope you will enjoy this adventure naturally inspired by and made for the greatest... the Commodore 64 aka C64.</p>\n<p>Ideal speed is for NTSC system or mode in emulators or other devices. However, PAL users will get an optional (not required) score/life counter. OK to place black electric tape on screen to hide this if you want for premium challenge and pure adventure mode!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T08:08:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d78/d78896096596a053fdf730f4fa38f60e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Mo's Full F* Sci-Fi Adventures"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
