Every turn you get 3 actions which you can use to walk or cast a fire, water, or earth spell. Fire does 1 damage, has 1 health, and moves 2 spaces. Water does 3 damage, has 3 health, and moves 1 space. Earth does not move at all and takes 1 damage per turn  but can absorb 8 damage before it's destroyed. All movement and placement in the game is orthogonal. After every turn all the elements on the screen move and then the next player takes their turn. Each character can take 4 damage before dying and last man standing wins.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T03:21:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35d/35d1c5e48a00bc7ccd5320ed13557a45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["fmefford"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
