The player on the 3-dimensional right side of the screen controls a sick person frantically searching their drawers for medicine to combat their illness.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The player on the 2-dimensional left side of the screen controls a white blood cell eating the many different kinds of germs attacking the sick player's body. Each of the different germ types is color coded (red, blue, and green) and tied to medicine of the corresponding color in the right side player's cabinet. Taking a pill spawns a powerup on the blood cell's screen, which allows it to devour the corresponding germs and clear the screen. Player communication is very important in this fast paced game as the white blood cell needs to communicate to the person what medicine is needed at each moment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Allowing a buildup of germs makes the body taking increasing amounts of damage over time that can only be healed by eating more germs. Meanwhile, the sick player needs to keep their mental morale up by also finding different unhealthy snacks in their cabinet. This tradeoff spawns germs more quickly for the blood cell to fight off, forcing a back and forth relationship between the two players' experiences to work together, \"repair\" the body, and fight off illness.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T05:47:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e61/e6148b3408117b5487db766654ada61a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Beitle", "Rilang"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
