Originally Meep was there to scare the family, but now Meep has noticed they are doing activities that <strong>will deteriorate the house and themselves</strong>! Your job is to go around each location of each level and do various household tasks. However, you must not cause too much suspicion or the people living there will get scared and leave! Meep's Maintenance is a cute, quirky pixelated casual game that anyone can enjoy!</p>\n<p>The goal is to go around the house fixing tasks <strong>without being seen</strong>. Beat the level by <strong>fixing every single task in time within the time limit</strong>. Try not to be seen, as the fear bar will increase the longer that you are seen by the human! If the fear bar reaches completion or if you don't fix a task in time, the game is over! Keep track of what tasks to do first as a red arrow means that the task is about to expire and you will lose the game!<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Control schemes:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Escape Key to open pause menu in-game</p>\n<p>WASD movement controls</p>\n<p>\"W\" to move up, \"A\" to move left, \"D\" to move right, \"S\" to move down\r\n</p>\n<p>Interactive key: Hold \"E\" to complete tasks</p>\n<p>Special Ability: Spacebar to go invisible for a few seconds (unlocked at level 2)</p>\n<p><strong>Team members:</strong></p>\n<p>Producers: Naman Khurana &amp; Emily Chavez\u00a0</p>\n<p>Game Designers: Charlie Xu &amp; Josh Castillo</p>\n<p>UI/UX: Amber Chang &amp; Esteban Aldana</p>\n<p>Programmers: Josh Nhean &amp; Zane Moore</p>\n<p>Artists: Jessica Lam &amp; Joyce Mai</p>\n<p>Audio: Darius Friedhof &amp; Haley Vlahos</p>\n\n<p>Created for GDIM 61: Introduction to Game Development @\u00a0UCI</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T08:52:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf4/bf4a9fe950949d0c256d9f22f5c26f53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Riifushi", "Stratagist", "eiviy", "CharlietheCoder", "Zaney", "MirrorCube", "ninjadare", "El Estebann", "namank100", "JDioso17"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
