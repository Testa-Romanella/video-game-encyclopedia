You may explore the entire map. To enter the DF-41 mobile launcher vehicle you should walk to the front cabin on the left-hand driver-side and approach very closely to the front set of doors and then hit \"E\" key to Enter the vehicle. Once in vehicle the drive mode takes over and the WASD keys now control the driving mechanics and the mouse cursor can be used to pan the camera around the DF-41 truck. To exit the vehicle in drive mode simply press \"E\" again to exit back to first-person walking mode. <br/><br/>To raise the missile tubes in preparation for launch, the DF-41 must already be at a full stop (spacebar for brakes) and then press \"R\" to raise the missile tube. Once the missile tube is raised vertically at 90 degrees upright, you may then press the \"T\" key to start the countdown to launch. At any time during this entire process you may choose to press the \"J\" key to eject the missile tube dome. If you forget to eject the dome prior to missile launch it will automatically jettison and eject before final countdown begins.  <br/><br/>Although not required to play the game, there will be optionally the ability for the user to emulate a pseudo authentication process prior to nuclear launch via means of using a free standalone <strong>DF-41 Authenticator app</strong> (Android and later iOS) in conjunction with the DF-41 Simulator. More details on this can be found in the user manual.<br/><br/>*** A more comprehensive PDF user manual will be followed up and released shortly *** <br/><br/>During gameplay you can press the \"U\" key to make hidden the missile tube dome to directly expose the nuclear missile inside the tube, and pressing U once more time will hide the missile cap and expose the individual MIRVs (of which there are up to 10 configured on the DF-41) inside the missile. Pressing U a third time will cycle it back to original configuration of displaying everything and un-hiding all.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-27T19:44:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98e/98ee0f82554bd76561750206ebaec6ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hydrogenpi", "Bo Chen"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bo Chen"], "esrb_rating": null}
