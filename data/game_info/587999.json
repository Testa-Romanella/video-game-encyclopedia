The more food you provide the larger your nest will grow and the more frequently you will get requests from other characters. Complete these requests for bonus points; failing them will lose points. If you fail to bring back enough food your nest will shrink and requests will become less frequent.</p>\n<p>Feedback Form:</p>\n<p>https://forms.office.com/Pages/DesignPage.aspx?lang=en-GB&amp;origin=OfficeDotCom&amp;ro...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T04:26:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/033/033a56e74af55c5fecfee7f5e3daa0b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hammy1202"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
