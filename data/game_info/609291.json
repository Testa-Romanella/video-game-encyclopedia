As per other games in this genre, you will have to manage your resources wisely and handle events properly if you want to succeed in your goal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The hook of our game is rooted in its semi-nonlinear structure. The game is designed so that the path you take is largely decided yourself, besides a few key points. This will be facilitated by free-roaming 3-D movement, events where player choices have major consequences, and RPG elements like ship customization. The motivation behind these design choices is to make a game where the player feels like the journey they experienced was entirely unique and engaging. <br/><br/></p>\n<p>Furthermore, we plan to implement enough variety in the game so that there is a high replayability element to the game.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Download and install the EXE file.\u00a0<br/>Use keyboard and mouse to play</p>\n<p><strong>Published/Updated Date:</strong>\u00a02018</p>\n<p><strong>Student Team</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Jacob Eddy</li><li>Zachary Reyes</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T07:16:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f1/6f13e503f2b87bdbb4a309d5291764ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CSG at TU"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
