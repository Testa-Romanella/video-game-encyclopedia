The Game Off jam is annually hosted by GitHub, and this year's theme was to make a game based off a clich\u00e9. The idea behind Need it Later is that players often hoard items in anticipation they might need them more later, only to never end up using them. <br/></p>\n<p>For example: You ever spend a couple of hours trying to catch Mew-Two in Yellow without consuming your only Master-Ball? I did, and almost immediately after catching him, I realized I had no use for it anymore.<br/></p>\r\nAcknowledgements:Game by:<p>https://mcfrostyboy.itch.io/<br/>https://rancidmilk.itch.io/ (me)<br/>https://coltrainn.itch.io/<br/></p>Assets by:\r\n\r\nMost of the assets used to create this game are either paid assets owned by the developers or are available under the Creative Commons license.
