As Artia, the player will have to traverse enemy lands to reach their destined sword, and ever dependable Merlin is there to provide company and aid along the way. It\u2019s an adventure of steel, magic and friendship. The mechanics and feel of the game are loosely inspired by, amongst other things, Hades and different games in the Legend of Zelda series. Our intended audience is mainly teenagers between the age of 12-15, but we believe that the game can be enjoyed even by older players. Through the process of creating the Queen\u2019s Sword, we have learned the importance of communication and planning, but also what a rewarding experience it is to have created something like this in only two weeks.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T08:17:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a77/a77232dd46f620a6c6b99a8f609bc9d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 383, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Futuregames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
