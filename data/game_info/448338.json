This game will feature what happened 200 years before the original Final Fantasy 1 for the NES, featuring an unexpected cast of characters otherwise known as the 'Sky Warriors' in the canon game. Witness the catastrophe of the four Fiends of Elements making their grand entrance into the Final Fantasy world, and experience the Lufenian response!</p>\n<p>Ironed out details using canon story from both the original Final Fantasy 1, the various updates from future re-releases on more modern consoles, and even diving into the history of the Dissidia line of Final Fantasy games in a bold attempt to flesh out a very possible \"what if\" scenario of the Sky Warriors story. Fans of FF14 will also see some similarities in boss design!<br/><br/>Features!<br/>- Rich 8-Bit NES style graphics<br/>- Classic soundtrack used from the Wonderswan re-release of the classic Final Fantasy meshed with other popular Wonderswan titles and chiptune remixes from other sources<br/>- Full sound effects ported from the original Final Fantasy title for NES<br/>- Painstakingly accurate representations of the Final Fantasy 1 world in its past<br/>-\u00a0Custom Sprite work by Ocean's Dream<br/>- The return of several original Final Fantasy 1 classes and the majority of the original spell list (with bug fixes from the original NES versions!)</p>\n\n<p>Bugs!<br/></p>\n<p>- RPGMaker 2003 is by no means a perfect program, and as such there are a few minor bugs.</p>\n<p>- This game has real time battles! Unfortunately, as a result\u00a0there can be some difficulty\u00a0when inputting commands if the enemy is taking an action at the same time.</p>\n<p>- Sometimes a character will get stuck in a forward position on the battle screen, this sometimes happens with the application/removal of buffs and debuffs.\u00a0It has no bearing on the game whatsoever and taking a normal attack action with the character or ending the battle should fix this.</p>\n<p>- Row Command:\u00a0As we all know, the original FF did not have a 'row' based system, however, it is impossible to remove this command from the battle menu for characters. Changing characters rows will work, but look odd with the UI.\u00a0The game is designed without the use of rows needed, so this action can be disregarded!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T04:25:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed6/ed6429c5522a36c21839de529a4862f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Illy"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
