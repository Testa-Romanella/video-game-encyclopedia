The basic features of the game were developed using assets, instructions, and scripts provided by the course.  I expanded upon this foundation, adding features and developing an original level.</p>\n<p>This is a retro 2D platformer that plays similarly to classic Mega Man or Super Mario games, starring MSU's mascot, the Spartan. Thus the base game's original title: Super Sparty Bros.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I chose to expand this by making a miniature Metroid-style level, where you're free to explore and acquire power-ups that help you access new areas. \u00a0So now it's truly an Adventure!</p>\n<p>At this point, there's only one power-up to find: the Double Jump, but\u00a0I may develop this further later on.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Main Level background music: Darker\r\n            Waves by Zander Noriega, from OpenGameArt.org</li>\n<li>Level graphical assets: Grotto\r\n            Escape 2, from Unity Asset Store</li>\n<li>Ability Orb sprites:\u00a0 by\r\n            ColeKSmith, from\u00a0OpenGameArt.org</li>\n<li>Ability Orb collection sound effect: from\r\n            (Free) Retro SFX Pack by 3rd Note Inc., from Unity Asset Store</li><li>Sparty, Knights, other graphics, music and sound effects, as well the original programming scripts are from the MSU course, originally developed by\u00a0Brian Winn and Greg Kozma</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e0/6e0f6dba0b3b9374329c772908de61e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["EmeraldStreak"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
