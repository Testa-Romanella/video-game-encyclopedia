In this activity, you will have the opportunity to plant various species of plants and accompany them in their individual growth.</p>\n<p>The user will have at his disposal tools and products to cure them or to improve their development. Specimens that reach full growth can be moved to the store for display and possible retail sale. Plants that fail to reach this stage, due to disease or lack of care, will die and must be replaced with new ones.</p>\n<p>Time in the application is organized into \"working days\" which end when the user has finished the work he has set out to do. To make the experience realistic, day after day, the plants will change their appearance depending on the care received. The plants displayed in the showcase will have a time limit to be sold, after which they will wither.</p>\n\r\nCommands\r\n<p>In this application you can interact with objects through keyboard and mouse inputs.</p>\r\nW-A-S-DMoveFInteraction with environment interactable objectsEGrab an itemQDrop an itemLeft Click (Mouse)Interaction with User InterfacesRight Click (Mouse)Function\r\n\r\nTools\r\n<p>The tools are useful to take care of plants in the garden. You can use a <em><strong>hoe </strong></em>to plant seems in the soil, a <strong><em>watercan </em></strong>to water\u00a0your specimens every day and a <strong><em>trowel </em></strong>to transplant them in a vase near the flowerbed. When the working day is over, you can go to the next day through the <strong><em>c</em></strong><em><strong>alendar </strong></em>on the shelf in the\u00a0 laboratory.\u00a0Once the plants are ready, you can move them in the shop to sell them to NPCs coming inside from the entrance. You can decide when to start the sale by interacting with the <em><strong>PC </strong></em>in the shop.</p>\n\r\nIllness\r\n<p>Some specimens can get ill so you need\u00a0to take care of them by using specific <strong><em>medicines</em> </strong>for a couple of days.</p>\n\r\nTeam Members\r\n<p>The project was made for the \"Virtual Reality\" course at Politecnico di Torino.
