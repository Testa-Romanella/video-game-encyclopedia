I'm really happy to have found a game mechanic that I like, but it's more a Proof Of Concept than an actual game. There's only 3 (yes, it's <strong>very</strong> short ^^') playable levels because I had some bugs that made some levels not work at all (keys won't open doors, collision fails etc.)<br/></p><p>It's not a good game but I'm publishing it anyway so at least I can say that I made it !<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T03:18:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e4/8e4652b4580fbfba6bebfaa079f38e0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["warang580"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
