Supports controller, touch, mouse, and keyboard! I developed this entirely on my SteamDeck, so it will be a bit before I can fix the icon and test the windows build.</p>\n<p>Please consider supporting so I can continue to make more games and hopefully better ones too.</p>\n<p>I created some of the icons, some of them are from packs made by Zacksly, so check out their stuff, it's very nice.</p>\n<p>The nice background is:<br/>https://opengameart.org/content/mountain-at-dusk-background</p>\n<p>I'll be working to add more polish, modes, features, etc. soon hopefully. I do want to add some sounds to this one. I enjoyed making this one, and I look forward to making more things. <br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T12:29:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2e/d2e83553d5cc6a2a5d160fcc8aeb03d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["zodiepupper"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
