You are responsible for watching over your spies to make sure that the mission succeeds (be it stealing the intelligence or taking the black money or killing all the enemies). You can only control one of your spies at a time and the spies may get bored if you don\u2019t command them which will cause them to start doing things on their own, or they may get too fed up with your commands which will cause them to rebel. Keep your men calm and tell them to interact with their surroundings to complete the objective.<br/></p>\n<p>Click to move the selected agent</p>\n<p>Click on certain items to interact</p>\n<p>A - Attack mode</p>\n<p>S - Stealth mode</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T03:44:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6c/f6cee3eb5a7cf0bfe13e3d966944b2f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Faraaz Jan"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
