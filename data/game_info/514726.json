It portraits the changing seasons of our environment and also that life and death are changing season for us all as well.</p>\n<p>The game idea is based on a biblical scripture from the book of Ecclesiastes 3: \u201cTo every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;\u201d. The game defines the life and death of the player as seasons. The player moves across the screen. The aesthetics of the background and foreground content is themed to have literal seasonal context.</p>\n<p>A rabbit runs in the foreground as the symbol of life.\u00a0The rabbit runs across the landscapes of different seasons (Summer ,Autumn, Winter, Spring), and is chased by a predator, a wolf. The wolf eventually catches up with the rabbit near the end of the landscape bringing the season of the rabbit's life to an end.</p>\n<p><strong>Developed in Processing 3</strong></p>\r\nThe Planet is Lava\r\n<p>This is a single click (Spacebar) game where a\u00a0spaceman must escape a planet of lava.
