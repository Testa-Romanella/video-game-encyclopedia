Pretty sure you're human though. You have human arms, that makes you human - right? I sure hope so.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even worse, you are surrounded by a ton of zombies. Who would do this to you? Luckily, there are guns lying around the place. Somebody needs to take care of these zombies, so it might as well be you. Doesn't look like anyone's coming to help you, either.</p>\n\n<p>*This game was just a quick project I whipped up in about an hour because I wanted to just run around and kill some zombies. Sometimes it takes so long to see worthwhile results in your projects - I just wanted something to blow off some steam. This game has no win screen, it's just for zombie-killing fun.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/945/945fe6154d380109ece7ff1108276531.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SBGAMES"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
