You are tasked with landing at the restaurant (to load up the meal) and then delivering the package to its destination (denoted by a big green arrow over one of the houses). Be mindful of your fuel gauge and be sure to land gently on the refueling station which is free of charge today only! Your metal hunk of junk is just barely held together by duct tape and elbow grease so be sure you don't bump into anything going too fast. Oh and that dinky little ship of yours comes pre loaded with its first upgrade, the overdrive, toggle it to increase your thrust output (also increases fuel consumption).\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>This is the minimum viable product for the upcoming game Project Cargo, a\u00a0modernized homage to Lunar Lander (Atari 1979). This game will be subject to major changes and uses a lot of place holder assets. This release is strictly to be able to share with people at GDC for feedback.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Game by: Carlos Bonachea</p>\n<p>Art by: Massive\u00a0 [\u00a0twitch.tv/xx_m4ss1v3_xx ]</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for taking the time to try it out! Feel free to drop a comment with feedback, since the project is far from done I am mostly looking for feedback about the feeling of flying the ship and ideas about the core loop (getting cargo and delivering it).</p>\n<p>All Rights Reserved</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T13:34:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38c/38c6b8b063b29dbae10a130111f813c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cBonachea"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
