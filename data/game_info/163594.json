My friend Brendon and I constructed the levels together. This was a load of fun and my cousin and I had a blast playing this two player back in the day. While it's far from a smooth platformer, it still holds a place in my heart as the second game I made. The music is a whacky and weird concoction I made from splicing different music together, it sounds somewhere between awful and catchy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/011/011ecb03786fc5bfde65b66604d80805.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheAfterWorld"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
