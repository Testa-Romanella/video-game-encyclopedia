Unfortunately he lands himself in a wave of nightmares, featuring deadly creatures and beautiful, yet unforgiving environments. To reach his final dream, he must fight his way through until he reaches the light.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Some features were unfortunately cut due to time constraints, but we are very proud of what we were able to produce in such a short time. Also, it is quite a heavy game performance wise, as we were going for high fidelity.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>We hope you enjoy and feel free to leave feedback!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/993/9932786a0621c96f8a07707c29b982a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["TeamFive"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
