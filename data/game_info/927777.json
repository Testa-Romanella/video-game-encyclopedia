This is a very original idea invented by me I promise. <br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0Anyways, I actually challenged me and a friend to see who could make the best Cookie Clicker game in an hour and thirty minutes. Here is his game:\u00a0https://jak3y53.itch.io/cookie-clicker</p>\n<p>Now, this is version five of the game as of now, when the game was first complete all it had were two items, and.. A cookie. But in the span of a day I added one more item and a save system. (More items soon to come.).<br/><br/>This game will be receiving updates pretty often.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T17:11:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df3/df37c24dfc1a8071f827c9e12140bf07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Inovade"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
