In this game, you play as someone who is lost in an abandoned rural area. You walk around, collect items, and uncover the mystery of what happened to everyone and why it is now abandoned. You win the game by getting back to your house. This game was made entirely by me with some help from some additional free 3D assets I found online.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T14:39:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b09/b0913100cf509fcd9fe458114933cbd4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CarterWood"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
