Two players go head to head in race to collect and drop as many sheep as they can before the time runs out. The twist is that each player can annoy the other by either messing with their cameras or pushing them. These interferences happen when each player picks up a camera. When one player collects a camera, the other player's screen will be affected. There are a number of effects which can happen, these are:</p><ul><li>Twirling the level</li><li>Looking at the level through a fishbowl</li><li>Blurring the level out</li><li>Blooming the colours in the level</li></ul><p>Both players can also pick up timers which will add an extra 10 seconds to the time. <br/></p><p><em><strong>Art Style</strong></em><br/></p><p>The art style is straightforward and simplistic. I have a bright and simple colour system so that it feels more like a party game rather than just a sheep herding racing simulator.</p><p><em><strong>Why?</strong></em><br/></p><p>I wanted to make a fun little game where players would gather around and enjoy racing against each other. It started off as a game jam project but at that time I only had the two players robbing each others sheep. I then went back to it a month ago and began to work on bringing more functionality, aesthetics and objectives into it.</p><p><em><strong>Controls</strong></em></p><p>Two Xbox controllers (recommended)</p><p>Xbox controls are displayed on the menu screen<br/></p><p> Keyboard (optional)</p><p><em>player 1:</em></p><ul><li>W, A, S, D to move</li><li>Spacebar to push opponent</li></ul><p><em>player 2:</em></p><ul><li>Arrow keys to move</li><li>Return key to push opponent</li></ul><p><em><strong>I hope you enjoy the game!!</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Let me know what you think! :)</strong></em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e69/e695ea91e75bbaadcedc5622f3ebb5b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["NiallMc"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
