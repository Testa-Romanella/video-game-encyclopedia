If you find a way into the level editor, great, but there's nothing there yet.</strong></em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>A bit about Dungeon Masters</strong><strong><em> (The original concept, at least)</em></strong></p>\n<p>Dungeon Masters is a dungeon-crawler with a decent campaign. That's not\u00a0 the main attraction. This game features a fully-fledged level editor and browser, so you can upload your levels and share them with your friends, in more ways than one.</p>\n<p>Dungeon Masters features full online multiplayer so you can play with up to three friends to make tackling those devious player-made labyrinths a little less challenging. Online multiplayer is also available for the campaign mode!</p>\n<p>What's more, you have a choice of any of 5 different characters to choose from, each with different weapons, stats and abilities!\u00a0<em>(The only character playable in this demo is Oliver, but he's so adorable I think it's fine.)<br/></em></p>\n\n<p><strong>So what's playable?<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Here's a list of everything this very short teaser includes:</p>\n<ul><li>Campaign mode</li><li>One character</li><li>Only 4 playable levels, with extremely simple puzzles</li><li>No music, but a couple sounds!</li><li>Lots of amazing art done by our amazing artist! (Credits below!)</li><li>No really, the art is the best part</li><li>(Mostly) Fully developed character mechanics, health, stamina, combat etc.</li><li>I'm especially proud of the stamina thing, the way it integrates with combat is very simple but effective</li><li>Level-up system is very rudimentary, but it is there in some form!</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Credits!<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Art direction:</strong>\u00a0 Katy Bisson // Twitter @spookyfoxinc</p>\n<p><strong>Coding / Systems:\u00a0 </strong>Pip Fox // Twitter @_underscore_Fox</p>\n<p><strong>Sound Design:\u00a0 </strong>Joe Comber // Twitter @jnjcomber<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Directing / Management:\u00a0 </strong>Pip Fox<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Level Design:\u00a0 </strong>Joe Comber, Pip Fox</p>\n<p><strong>Art / Animation:</strong>\u00a0 Katy Bisson</p>\n<p><strong>Writing / Story:\u00a0 </strong>Joe Comber<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-18T05:53:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e91/e91276009ca60481ddfa3edf52b2120b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pip"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
