Instead you have to roll your entire character to aim. Inconvenient but fun!<br/><br/>The game only has a local highscore list for now, so be sure to post your scores in the comments, and let me know what you think!<br/><br/>This is my first game jam in a while, but I managed to whip this game out in around 8 hours. I've made all the art myself, except for the explosions. Sound effects were made with SFXR and the music was made by James Hammond. Be sure to check him out!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-15T04:06:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88f/88fcff3fe58e85f391bdbe68a7de02aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["woutervanvugt"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
