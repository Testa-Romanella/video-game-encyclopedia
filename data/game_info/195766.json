Even the employees refuse to file their personal forms. So, the government has called in The Auditor, a former misfit who now works in tax collection to collect them by any means necessary. Disguised as a construction worker, the Auditor must infiltrate ProfitCo headquarters and collect their taxes.</p>\n<p>Your goal is to collect the tax folders from every employee in each level and head to the staircase to go to the next one. At the end of the fourth level, you must collect the company\u2019s forms from the CEO in his office.</p>\n<p>Your auditor starts off with 10 health, displayed in the upper left corner. If you get attacked too many times, you will die and need to restart the level.</p>\n<p>The number of folders you need to collect is displayed in the lower right corner. When you\u2019ve collected all the forms, you will be able to proceed to the next level.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/>WASD - Move<br/>Mouse click/Ctrl \u2013 Attack<br/>Mouse \u2013 Camera\u00a0<br/>Escape \u2013 Pause<br/>M \u2013 Mute audio<br/>Mouse Wheel \u2013 Increase/decrease mouse sensitivity</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4c/d4cc3c38b9a9476ab058cd3f0c5588ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["anotherthingnamedcolbert"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
