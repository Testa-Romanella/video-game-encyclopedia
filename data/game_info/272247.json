You know those old Sentai shows with the stock footage that you didn't care look quite right? Yea,\u00a0We tried to put that in\u00a0video game form! Customization is key! Choose to make your viking a power attacker by putting permanent upgrades in his strength then boost it higher with cards! Or for those who need a Pinch of HP swap one out when you feel you need the boost!</p>\n<p>Here's the story!</p>\n<p>Data Card Prism Vikings is a massively popular card battle game in Glassshade, a medium-sized suburb that has the currently only operating factory and arcade: Asgard. No one knows who the founder is, but a young lady seems to be running the counter, drawing many teens in to play her card game. It seems this young lady is actually the owner of Asgard: Frigg, and is looking for more than just some hit card sales! She is looking for 7 warriors to become the Prism Vikings described on her main series of cards!\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0When the Legendary Official Kode Interceptors \u00a0(L.O.K.I) finally arrived, she knew time was short! The school\u2019s principal was the first to have his DNA Code intercepted; he was turned into a chair. At that moment, she knew she didn\u2019t have much time\u2026</p>\n<p>With danger looming and more people being turned into harmless objects, Frigg pulled the only group of teens into her secret base: the D.C.V.S. Base. She hands each of them a prismatic Gjallarhorn and 5 stat cards. When the gjallarhorn is blown, they will become the Prism Vikings: a superhero team that can change their abilities with their data cards at any time! One card could make them resistant to freezing\u2026 Another could beef their strength! With these cards, the combinations are endless! It\u2019s also makes sure that L.O.K.I. can\u2019t modify their DNA, as their code is protected by Frigg and the powers that be.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>As this is a prototype we thought chapter 6 in the game would be a decent place to set you.\u00a0Which is based on expanding the plot of Titania\u00a0Reyes who's Prism\u00a0Viking is Valkyrie pink also known as Eir. Will she be able to save her mom's ballet class and the day or will L.O.K.I. turn them into something different!
