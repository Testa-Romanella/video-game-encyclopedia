It stated \u201c Deep within the forest existed a lake that seemed like any other, but deep within it resides a dragon. This dragon once brought fear and destruction to anywhere it crossed paths but now is deep in slumber. A young child heard this story like many others but believed it was a story to keep children from straying to far into the forest. Until, they were visited by a witch in their dream. Now tasked with obtaining a sword, a jewel, and a pendant for the witch, the child must set off on adventure.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Member of The Four_teenth Floor: Carol Zhao, Darnell Foster, Laeticia London,\u00a0Peng, Shen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T19:10:16", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["The Four_teenth Floor", "Dfost", "lankxy", "WalkerZ"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
