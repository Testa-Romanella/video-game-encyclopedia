How you sat on the school bench and filled out your conquered boxes? The feeling when you could close several boxes in a row? Then welcome to the world of Ultimate Dots and Boxes!</p>\n<p>In this game, just like in the classic pencil and paper game, you take turns with your opponent to connect two dots. If you close a box this way, you get one point and it's your turn again! You are the winner if you have more boxes than your opponent at the end of the game. But there is a twist - you don't just play on one board, you play on three at the same time! The boxes in the different game boards reward a different number of points, so you have to prioritize where you close your boxes. Plan ahead and trick your opponent!</p>\n<p>The most important features:<br/>- Choose between 3 difficulties offline against the computer.<br/>- Challenge your friends in 2-player mode on the same device.<br/>- Logic and strategy based - easy to play, hard to master!<br/>- Suitable for all ages</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T02:43:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/616/61617094f4961827154a5bacf3dc4609.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["creativecodecampus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
