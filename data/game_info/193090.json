The theme was <em>Breakout</em>.</p><p>This was made in a few hours on the first day of the jam. Unfortunately I didn't have time to work on it all day, and was unable to add any extra polish, but it is fully playable. It's a bit tough and will need some additional balancing to speed of the ball and paddle. Those touch ups will come later when I can add in all the extra features I wanted.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4a/c4a16087bc150ac213cecdaea3f9a06c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["justin35f"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
