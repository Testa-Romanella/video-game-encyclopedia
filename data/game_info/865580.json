It's a cooperative game!<br/></p>\n<p>- This game can be played alone but the more brains you have, the more chance you have to find the answer...</p>\n<p>- Reflection, Filters, Observation, Analysis, and Communication are the keywords to succeed in this Mastery Game!</p>\n<p>\u00a0- The pictures are already back to back correctly, cut the length of the cards and fold them in half to glue them (except the two sheets for the location cards).</p>\n<p>- Read the Game Design Document (GDD), the explanations of the game design and the instructions for use are there.</p>\n<p>\u00a0- The character pieces are to be cut into circular shapes, the colors will help you. The red triangle is also to be placed on the island map next to the 22h square.</p>\n<p>- Don't pay attention to the instructions on the island card, our game doesn't have a radio value with a decimal, we forgot to remove it.</p>\n<p>- On the player cards you can see 3 small circles each time, they have to be cut out, and you have to be able to see through the circles of the card.</p>\n<p>- For the radio you will have to cut some areas, cut a square as on the screen:</p>\n<p>For the medium circle: cut the 1, the 3, and the 6 (cut the inner numbers, the small one)</p>\n<p>For the small circle: cut UNDER the 1 (keep the number 1)</p>\n<p>A little more: to make it more challenging, you can set a timer per round to be sure not to spend 3 hours per round and make the mission more complicated.</p>\n<p>Enjoy! <br/></p>\n<p>_______________________________________________________________________________________    <strong>\u00a0</strong><br/><br/><em>This game is the result of Game Developer training.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T09:49:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e03/e03c90d72ca9a71fc537f8870c80452d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["E-smile"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
