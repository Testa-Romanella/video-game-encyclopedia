Simply wear a VR headset and find yourself in such simultaneously futurist, cozy and confined place or just simply be somewhere new and nice in times of quarantine and inability of people to travel.<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>-Experience being in a cyberpunkish capsule hotel, living in a cozy confined space<br/><br/>-Briefly interact with environment<br/><br/>-A new entry in a \"Laying Simulator\" genre.
