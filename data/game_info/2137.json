Gemini Rue is a graphic adventure game that allows players to take control of two main characters. First is the Azriel Odin, who is an ex-assassin turned law enforcer, in order to gather information on his missing brother. Second \u2013 Delta-Six, a man with memories of his past life that finds himself in some kind of a rehabilitation facility for criminals, who will be allowed to leave after some needed training.<br />\nGemini Rue is played like any other point-and-click adventure; where characters controlled by the player have to explore their environments through interactions with NPC\u2019s and puzzle-solving. Additionally featured shooting mechanics, where players can aim and shoot from behind the cover. At set points in the game, players will be able to switch between characters, present in different world locations, going through these stories separately until they reach a common plot thread.</p>", "metacritic": 82, "released": "2011-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-21T11:13:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/471/4715696335cefa662386da8f688d39ec.jpeg", "website": "http://www.wadjeteyegames.com", "rating": 3.67, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 116, "owned": 1292, "beaten": 101, "toplay": 35, "dropped": 27, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 15, "ratings_count": 123, "suggestions_count": 381, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 123, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "macOS", "iOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Wadjet Eye Games", "Joshua Neurnberger"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Wadjet Eye Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
