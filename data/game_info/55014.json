{"id": 55014, "slug": "f-19-stealth-fighter-1988", "name": "F-19 Stealth Fighter", "name_original": "F-19 Stealth Fighter", "description": "<p>F-19 Stealth Fighter is a combat flight simulator developed and released in 1988 (PC DOS) and 1990 (Amiga and Atari ST) by MicroProse, featuring a fictional United States military aircraft. It is the 16-bit remake of the 8-bit game Project Stealth Fighter, which was released for the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum in 1987. It was also ported to the NEC PC-9801 in Japan only, and the DOS version was re-released on Steam distribution platform in 2015.</p>\n<p>F-19 was developed before the F-117 stealth bomber was publicly revealed, and the aircraft of the game bears little resemblance to the actual F-117. Instead, game designers relied on the F-19 model kit released by Testors in 1986. The appearance of aircraft that appears in Night Hawk: F-117A Stealth Fighter 2.0 matches the real F-117, however players of the second game are offered the choice of flying a fictitious version that carries more stores. Critically acclaimed, the game was followed by Night Hawk: F-117A Stealth Fighter 2.0 in 1991.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1987-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:50:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5b/e5b4d411511bb7b062efe8e497fc6462.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.75, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 100, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 278, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["PC", "Atari ST", "Commodore / Amiga", "Linux"], "developers": ["MicroProse Software"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Nightdive Studios", "Retroism", "MicroProse"], "esrb_rating": null}
