Here, they live peacefully and you can choose to raise them if you want!</p>\n<p>The garden is currently rather empty so there's plenty of freedom for <br/>you to decorate it how you want. How the garden will look will be up to <br/>you!</p>\n<p>You can earn coins by playing mini-games to buy various things for the <br/>chibos and your garden! Don't worry if you feel that you aren't that <br/>good with mini-games. They are optional and they have different <br/>difficulty settings you can choose depending on whether you want to just<br/> relax or be challenged.</p>\n<p>You're welcome to have fun and enjoy this little sanctuary!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c8/7c8a6c6007916f92d87cf64a508ad2d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 243, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["AshyraStudio"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
