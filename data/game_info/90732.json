Alone, she begins to search for her missing sister.<br/><br/>With her only clue being the word of a strange man to guide her, she walks straight into a twisted party game hosted by a woman named Eyela. Eyela and her guests (the doll-like Porcia, and the gloomy Balin) force her to participate in a game of theirs: Koray is to run, and solve their puzzles and play their games, or become their dinner. <br/><br/>Terrified for herself and her missing sister, she reluctantly accepts her fate, and presses onward.<br/><br/>Three beings referring to themselves as \"gods\" hold her fate in their hands. Will she be devoured, another lost child in this candy-land of horror? Or will she manage to locate her sister before it's too late?\r\n<p>\u2764-\u2764-\u2764-\u2764-\u2764</p>\n<p>This is an RPG Maker MV horror game originally made for the Pixel Horror Game Jam 2016, but ended up becoming a much bigger project than I intended.
