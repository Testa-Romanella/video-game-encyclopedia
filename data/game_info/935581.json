The game ends when one player has no tiles left in their hand, or when neither player can make a valid move. The winner is the player with the fewest tiles left in their hand at the end of the game.</p>\n<p>The robot player is programmed to play strategically, using algorithms to determine the optimal moves based on the tiles it has in hand and those on the playing surface.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Additionally, the game can also include different variations of the game such as blocking or draw dominoes.
