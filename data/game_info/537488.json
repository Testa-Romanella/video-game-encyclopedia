A fantastical world, Avalonia is\u00a0home to the Discoucian Monarchy, as well as monstrous creatures and secretive academies for the highly gifted.</p>\n<p>Returning from his most recent exploits aboard his personal flying galleon,\u00a0<em>The Nostradamus</em>, Pageon is treated to a hero's welcome, and celebratory procession through the streets of Avalonia\u2019s capital, Evermore.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Little does Pageon know he\u2019s being followed by a mysterious group known as the Purple Guard, whose devious leader is his estranged sister, Queen Lily Pageon of Harrha Island. Fiercely intelligent, Lily specialises in dastardly technological inventions with the aim of bringing down the Discoucian Monarchy so that she may reign as its dictator. However, the heir to the throne is one Princes Josephine Oladine, whose youth and royal position masks her role in the Discoucian Secret Service.</p>\n<p>Joining forces, Princess Josephine and Sir Arthur\u2019s adventures will take them across the whole of Avalonia \u2014 from the fog-bound shores of Karga, to the secret underground shanty town beneath the frozen prison of Icester, south to the verdant city of Proceur and from there to the affluent Starfall Academy \u2014 in their quest to foil Lily\u2019s revolutionary plans.<br/>___________________________________________________________</p>\n\n<p><strong>___________________________________________________________<br/>Nicholas Lovelock:\u00a0</strong>Director, Story, Artwork, Marketing .<br/></p>\n<p><strong>JDSherbert:\u00a0</strong>Developer, Programmer, Sound Designer/Composer,\u00a0 Version Control, Marketing/PR.<br/>___________________________________________________________</p>\n\n<p>___________________________________________________________<br/>The book is available to purchase here:<br/>https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1911525824/ref=bseries_primary_1_1911525824</p>\n<p>The full soundtrack is available for free here:<br/>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1oAjALuo2HGAKagFVDFofFt_Ufw8W4l1<br/></p>\n<p>Follow the Facebook Page:<br/>https://www.facebook.com/DiscouciaGame<br/></p>\n<p>Follow the Author\u00a0on Twitter:<br/>https://twitter.com/Lovelockart67<br/></p>\n<p>___________________________________________________________<br/></p>\n\n<p>___________________________________________________________<br/><br/>All musical works, audio and\u00a0code are Copyright \u00a92020 to Joshua \"JDSherbert\" Herbert.<br/>\"Discoucia\",\u00a0\"Discoucia: The Game\", and the \"Alavonia\" Universe are all trademarks of Nicholas Lovelock and Team Discoucia.\u00a0<br/>No unauthorized reproduction or distribution is permitted of the works (Art, Narratives, Software, Music)\u00a0contained within this software without prior consent from the creators.<br/>The Discoucia Franchise, and all characters, artworks, fictional works and books are owned and licensed by Nicholas Lovelock for use in this production.<br/>The works within are fictional, and\u00a0do not necessarily represent the thoughts or opinions of Nicholas Lovelock or Team Discoucia.<br/>All character likenesses to real persons, whether living or dead, are entirely coincidental.</p>\n<p>All rights reserved.<br/>___________________________________________________________<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-28T04:38:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eee/eee198339db4e410581930edb1f7316a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["JDSherbert"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
