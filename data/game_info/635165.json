{"id": 635165, "slug": "first-date-joe", "name": "First Date Joe", "name_original": "First Date Joe", "description": "<p><strong>First Date Joe</strong> is a bad date simulator. It is a submission for\u00a0The Programmers Hangout game jam and probably the first game that has been produced using\u00a0ct.js and\u00a0Traviso. You can pet the dog.\u00a0When I get the time I hope to release the combined toolset (which includes a visual editor to\u00a0develop worlds such as Joe's).</p>\n<p><strong>What worked...</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Traviso\u00a0and\u00a0ct.js\u00a0both delivered - yet again!\u00a0Traviso\u00a0now has TypeScript support!\u00a0Cosmo Myzrail Gorynych\u00a0work continues to be an inspiration.</li><li>The visual editor (built for this project and not yet released) made making\u00a0Traviso\u00a0worlds much easier.</li><li>Not using a real pee sound\u00a0in the game\u00a0has probably benefited my mental health in the long run. \ud83d\ude01</li><li>I feel the game sort of strikes the right balance telling the story of an\u00a0obnoxious guy but in a not too\u00a0offensive or judgemental way.</li><li>The sound - which I always leave until last - does actually make a big difference. Especially\u00a0Jahzzar's\u00a0Last Dance.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>What didn't...</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Developing a new engine (or engine mix in this case)\u00a0to deliver on a game jam is a tough ask. Engine development always takes longer and is more frustrating than you expect.</li><li>Isometric sprite/tile assets look great but are still fiddly and annoying. Affinity Photo not copying\u00a0blank space doesn't help.</li><li>Games like this work best when there is a big world to explore and autonomy. First Date Joe's small world leads the player to feel a little claustrophobic in an almost linear storyline.</li><li>The toolset may struggle with really big worlds! I was thinking about a project linking feature in\u00a0ct.js\u00a0to solve this.\u00a0At the moment I just manually copy everything from smaller project to a huge project\u00a0in a text editor.</li><li>Probably needs some more diversity! I did make the princess a game developer though!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Is it or its toolset open source?</strong></p>\n<p>Not yet. But hopefully soon (when I catch my breath \ud83d\ude09).</p>\n<p><strong>Will it be improved further?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>It may be improved for the\u00a0Marathon Jam but again I need to catch my breath.</p>\n<p><strong>What next?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Probably something completely different but one day I may come back and try to tell a really deep immersive love story using Traviso.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The credit list for this one is huge!</p>\n<ul><li>Jahzzar produced Last Dance -\u00a0the sound track (CC BY-SA 3.0)</li><li>Cosmo Myzrail Gorynych\u00a0produced\u00a0ct.js\u00a0- the memory card, Greed and timed lock minigames (MIT license)</li><li>Hakan Karlidag produced\u00a0Traviso\u00a0- the isometric engine behind the immersive world (MIT license)</li><li>Lukas K\u00fcstenmacher produced\u00a0the dungeon art Gothic Archways\u00a0(CC0)</li><li>Apostrophic Labs produced\u00a0Desyrel\u00a0(Apostrophic Labs License), Dalton\u00a0Magg produced\u00a0Ubuntu (Ubuntu font licence) and Eduardo Tunni produced\u00a0Lemon\u00a0(OFL)</li><li>Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, Caspar David Friedrich, Hokusai, Piet Mondrian, Monet, Edvard Munch, Georges Seurat and Vincent van Gogh produced the gallery works (more for your interest than anything else)</li><li>Marv Martian said \"damn it\" (CC0), agent_vivid said \"hmmm\" (CC Sampling+), QUARTETOFANTASTICO got people saying \"awww\" (CC0), conleec recorded some footsteps (CC0), lonemonk got people clapping (CC BY 3.0),\u00a0krystofjakobe got a tram ticket, schultzanagger was refreshed (CC0) and Garuda1982 got a dog barking\u00a0(CC BY 3.0)</li><li>Charles Sanchez (CharlesGabriel),\u00a0 Daniel Eddeland (daneeklu),\u00a0 DarkwallLKE,\u00a0 David Conway Jr. (JaidynReiman),\u00a0 ElizaWy,\u00a0 Evert,\u00a0 Johannes Sj\u00f6lund (wulax),\u00a0 Lanea Zimmerman (Sharm),\u00a0 Manuel Riecke (MrBeast),\u00a0 Matthew Krohn (makrohn),\u00a0 Michael Whitlock (bigbeargames),\u00a0 Nila122,\u00a0 Stephen Challener (Redshrike),\u00a0 Thane Brimhall (pennomi),\u00a0 Tracy,\u00a0 Tuomo Untinen (reemax),\u00a0 bluecarrot16,\u00a0 gr3yh47,\u00a0 laetissima, Stephen Challener (Redshrike),\u00a0Mandi Paugh,\u00a0William.Thompsonj,\u00a0Benjamin K.
