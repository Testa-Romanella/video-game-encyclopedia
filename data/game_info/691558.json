The bird fights against the  trees by dropping an egg on the tree.\r\n </p>\n<p>The egg is released by pressing the left mouse button or on mobile  pressing the screen. At each flight the bird can carry only one egg. The  bigger the tree brings more points. Each time the tree is hit with an  egg it decreases to ground level but continues faster grow.\r\n If the canopy of a falling tree hits a passing bird the player gets  an additional 300 points and the trees stop growing for one second.</p>\n<p>Two game modes arcade and missions.</p>\n<p>Graphic \u00a0 Bevouliin</p>\n<p>Music\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Bart</p>\n<p>Web version issue.For a unknown reason music does not looping.These problems were not noticed in mobile version.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T07:14:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/184/184b496ed52ea8bad9d307dfe272e48e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Letipas"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
