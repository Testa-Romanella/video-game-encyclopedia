Where many games focus on a climactic moment, Perennial calls attention to the quiet, more introspective moments before climax.\u00a0The effect of Perennial is best achieved as a display in a public location, where passerbys can begin their journey underground at the very moment they stumble upon it.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/>Concept, programming, graphics, and music by Isabella Djurovic.
