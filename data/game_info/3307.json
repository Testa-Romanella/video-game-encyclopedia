{"id": 3307, "slug": "the-escapists", "name": "The Escapists", "name_original": "The Escapists", "description": "<p>The Escapists is an indie adventure game with role-playing and puzzle elements developed by Mouldy Toof Studios.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>You play as a prisoner with only one goal in mind - escape. The players can acquire items that will help them in the process of escaping either by buying them from fellow prisoners or crafting them. In fact, you can always steal the items you need from someone else.</p>\n<p>It is possible to interact with other inmates who can assign tasks to the player. By completing these quests, the players can increase their respect or earn some money. Different activities such as visiting the gym or reading in the library increase the player&#39;s stats which increase the chances of a successful escape. </p>\n<p>In order for the player to not be spotted by their wardens, it is essential to avoid their attention and follow the timetable by eating food with all the other inmates, appearing at a morning gathering, and so on. The cells are often searched, so the player has to be careful and hide the tools required for the escape. If one should get detected, they&#39;re moved to the punishment cell and lose all the items and preparations they made for the escape.</p>\n<h3>Miscellanious</h3>\n<p>Five add-ons for the game were released. Each of them added new prisons, including the iconic Alcatraz prison, new escape options, crafts and much more.</p>", "metacritic": 71, "released": "2015-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T13:07:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc4/bc46fd9543044b48ce87929f3e0d28a2.jpg", "website": "http://www.team17.com/", "rating": 3.42, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 206, "owned": 1781, "beaten": 106, "toplay": 34, "dropped": 238, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 225, "ratings_count": 293, "suggestions_count": 267, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 295, "platforms": ["Xbox 360", "PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One", "Linux", "Android", "macOS", "PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Team17 Digital", "Mouldy Toof Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Team17 Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
