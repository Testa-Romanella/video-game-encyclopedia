We want to use it to get feedback on the flying controls and feel.\u00a0We hope you'll give us lots of feedback!</p>\n<p>In this demo, there are 20 coins that you can collect. There's no time limit, and nothing will happen when you've got them all, it's just something to try to accomplish with your flying skills.</p>\n<p>As you fly, you'll leave a blue trail behind you. If you crash into it, your ship will explode and you'll respawn after a few seconds. Look out!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD: Steering\u00a0(WS = Up and Down vertically, AD = Left and Right horizontally)</p>\n<p>Left Click:\u00a0Accelerate</p>\n<p>Right Click:\u00a0Boost</p>\n<p>Left Shift:\u00a0Emergency Brake\u00a0(for tighter turning)</p>\n<p>R:\u00a0Reset. This will just reload the game if you want to start over.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T08:33:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa6/fa610260b3e742ba9b5b632757a328b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Party Moose Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
