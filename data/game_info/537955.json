Is a game with simple rules:</p>\n<ul><li>Your objective is to remain the last on the platform.</li><li>You can move along the platform jumping from one tile to another.</li><li>Each time that a character leaves a tile this colapse and fall, leaving a hole in the platform.</li><li>You have to move to run away from the others pinky bad slimes. You are the blue, good slime by the way.</li><li>As you move, you break the platform and make it smaller, making easier that the other bad slimes fall into the lava pit before you do.</li><li>When you win a round, you can pass to the next. Each round will be a little more difficult that the previous one , in other words, more challenging.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>You can move using the Arrow Keys.</li><li>You can close the game by pressing the Escape Key.</li><li>You can use the mouse to click in the Interface Buttons.</li></ul>\n<p>This is my first completed game by myself, so, even though it's not perfect, it's\u00a0 finished! (this really is an achievement for a solo gamedev while working a full time job). It's playable, fun and free!! So don't be lazy, download it, play it and give me some feedback about it.\u00a0 Thank you for that.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T02:48:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/062/062648f0ddd0e7706276531735741ce4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Areshu"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
