In it, you are free to roam around and impregnate as many women as you can, provided you know how to manage your stamina, money and other stats. The game is currently being worked on by a bunch of anons, and it&#39;s in the very early stages of development, so expect it to be a little rough around the edges. The characters are an ensemble of some of our favourite hentai girls, shamelessly ripped off from commercial Japanese visual novels.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-30T04:35:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/526/5262103f6c5615cea1dd19f56a114cc2.jpg", "website": "https://waifu.nl/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
