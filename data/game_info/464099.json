It's a rhythm game where your goal is to shoot and destroy the other ship! The only catch is is that you can't choose what action to take each turn; you pick a 6-turn list at the start of each round, and you have to do whatever action you picked for that turn. (If your ship turns blue, you have to shoot.) Good luck, and feel free to share your best times!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move: WASD</p>\n<p>Shoot: Up arrow key</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T04:03:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca2/ca2f2851e6f0b9973f272bff832299a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["eminon"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
