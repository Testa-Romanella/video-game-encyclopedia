Running on a purpose built unique engine allowing full environmental planetary terraforming, with 10s of 1000s of inhabitants all reacting in-real-time, even from planetary orbit<br/><br/>Starting out as a fledgling god, known as the Igigu, trying to impress the Anunnaki (your creators), you are responsible for creating and raising the Sumer, a race of primitive, but hard working (sometimes!), creatures on a new planetary body created by the Anunnaki.<br/><br/>From encouraging birth from their cocoons to dipping them in the sea when they 'occasionally' catch fire, their entire survival is in your hands.<br/><br/>Using the powers bestowed upon you by the Anunnaki, help terraform the landscape to create land that's close enough to water for the Sumer to drink and feed as well as stable and level enough for them to build. Encourage the growth of trees/grass by controlling the elements such as the water, clouds and the sun. Protect the Sumer from other inhabitants of the sea, land and air who view the Sumer as little more than snacks on legs.<br/><br/>In return for your care the Sumer\u2019s belief and love (or fear) will furnish you with mana, the source of your power. As your mana grows, so do your powers and abilities, from throwing simple fire bolts to performing Astral Projection to another fledgling god\u2019s planet to help/hinder their progress and reap their mana, the power is quite literally in your hands.<br/><br/><br/><strong>For full details please visit our website</strong><br/><br/><br/>Features<br/><br/><br/><ul><li>You have the power to manipulate, create and destroy elements. From moulding the landscape and interacting with the elements to causing natural disasters and summoning guardians.<br/><br/></li><li>Play at ground level or if you amass enough mana ascend to the heavens to allow greater control, powers and view of your creation.<br/><br/></li><li>Defend or encourage the Sumer to defend themselves from the myriad of creatures from the sea, land and air.<br/><br/></li><li>Asynchronous/synchronous multi-player, leaving your Sumer undefended while away may not be the best idea, those with the power of Astral Projection have the ability to wreak havoc, or help, as they see fit.<br/><br/></li><li>Create your unique \u2018constellation\u2019 in the heavens, which also doubles as the gateway for Astral Projection, to be seen by other fledging gods in their night sky<br/><br/></li><li>Create Pantheons Of Gods, group up with gods you can trust to help each other in times of attack and need<br/><br/></li><li>Unlock all 6 Realms of the planet as your Ascension level increases, giving you more abilities and power as well as getting closer to unlocking the Secrets Of The Anunnaki<br/><br/></li><li>And many more to follow\u2026</li></ul><br/><br/>Project Info<br/><br/>Sometime ago, I presented a game idea &amp; a home grown tech demo to Lionhead while working there, luckily we were given the chance to start on this creating initial designs &amp; plans at Lionhead under the name 'Genesis', but sooner after starting, due to other work priorities and the ultimate sad demise of Lionhead Studios, this project was soon stopped. Since then this has been my lunchtime &amp; weekend passion project and now has both my sons contributing to it in both writing &amp; design.<br/><br/>With the the advent of VR, this project became even more driven, as a passion, but also a way to involve my children in the game development process, something they are both passionate to get into.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:45:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c9/1c908b15e5dde66949f210c838e66b66.jpg", "website": "http://meigigu.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 481, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ItsAllAGame"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ItsAllAGame"], "esrb_rating": null}
