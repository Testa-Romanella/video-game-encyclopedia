The initial game idea is that the player is a drunk sorcerer who's magic is overflowing, making him cast random magic uncontrollably. It was originally planned to be a bullet-hell style game where the player is the source of the bullets, and you would need to avoid killing any innocent NPCs.</p>\n<p>This is our first built\u00a0project ever outside of basic tutorials, and\u00a0that turned out to be a bit too difficult in 48 hours, so instead you must now escape a labyrinth before you kill yourself with your own magic missile ricochets. Oh, and you are quite drunk, so good luck maneuvering around!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T11:29:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/801/801f2eb163402275a44de85e84a7728b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["n8krakov", "mattleo2011"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
