It provides you with food and salvage from the ocean, under one condition: you must use it all to build a ship. Can you keep your Messiah happy and yourself alive?</p>\r\nBeware: Prototype!\r\n<p>Please note that this is an early prototype, so except the game to be unoptimized and buggy. Do your best to ignore any issues of that nature and <strong>focus on the core gameplay concept!</strong> Right now, it's vital for me to receive feedback on the general gameplay loop, if it's even remotely fun to play in its unfinished state!</p>\r\nHow the game works\r\n<p>Because the game lacks a\u00a0tutorial, this site will teach the basics of the game for now:</p>\n<ul><li>Each day, you need to <strong>complete building tasks</strong> that the Messiah assigns you</li><li>The day is divided into <strong>four phases</strong>: Night, Morning, Afternoon and Evening<br/>\n</li><li>During each phase, you can <strong>pray for a type of salvage</strong> to spawn more frequently <strong>or </strong><strong>for a meter to drain slower</strong> for a while<br/>\n</li><li><strong>Swim into the ocean</strong> to gather salvage to build structures and craft items. Don't let your stamina run out though!</li><li>If you fail to complete tasks, <strong>your standing</strong> with the Messiah<strong> will drop</strong>. If it drops too low, you will die!</li><li>After 7 days you will die because I am a horrible person</li><li>Rinse and repeat :)</li></ul>\n<p>There are also other experimental features like harvesting trees and rocks with axes and pickaxes respectively, so have fun exploring!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<strong>Key</strong><strong>Action</strong>WASDMoveMouseLook AroundEInteractTabToggle InventoryCToggle Crafting MenuFUse Current Item in HotbarXDrop Last Item in WaterYDrop All Items in Water\r\nGiving Feedback\r\n<p>To give feedback, please join my Discord server.
