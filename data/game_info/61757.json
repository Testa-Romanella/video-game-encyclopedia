Your day is starting off great!Nepenthe is a hand-drawn RPG with a terrible sense of humor. Set in the strange world of Carithia, you play as a mysterious bald dude who lost his memory. Yes, you read that right. Meet some very polite monsters, and battle both them and your sense of self-dignity in epic bullet-hell fight scenes.Definitely not a potato in a trench coatSporting a childish hand-drawn art style, Nepenthe is sure to either make you love it at first glance, or throw your computer away. The developer of Nepenthe takes no responsibility for such actions, and recommends drinking chamomile tea. \u201cIt\u2019s really soothing,\u201d he says. \u201cYou should really try it one day,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat was I talking about?\u201d He asks.
