This game is just prototype.<p>\r\n\tThis is prototype of game we want to create. The idea is pretty simple. The ball is getting smaller and smaller but when you eat the cubes(we call them cookies) you will get a little bigger. When you get your size to number 0, you will die. When you touch a wall, you will die. There is almost no graphic and UI in this game. Just a prototype.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Controls - </strong>Left mouse button.<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>New stuff</strong><br/>\n</p><ul><li><strong>You can now download PC version of this game.</strong></li><li>Added few more levels.</li><li>Game now has health bar.</li><li>There is new enemy in the game!
