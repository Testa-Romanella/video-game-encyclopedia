This is a game that I am making for my wife on my off time from work. She really likes platformers and I can't think of a better way to show her how much she means to me. So I am using this place to let my friends beta test the game for me as I create it. I only have the first 4 levels and they are currently on repeat. Next update will be esc taking you to menu, and clicking on boss pictures will take you to their individual lvls. I am not a computer engineer or programmer so some bugs I cant' fix. Feel free to leave me with any ideas or game breaking bugs. enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/526/526463b660cf137db2dd7a090920094b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["McFrostey"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
