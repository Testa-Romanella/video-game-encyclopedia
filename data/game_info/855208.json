There are 12 important items that modify encounters in different ways, making enemies easier to defeat, adding time to your timer, adding turns, or one exceedingly rare item with special effects and buffs. <br/><br/>You have five turns to defeat each enemy. Each turn is timed, and will alternate between choices that add to your damage, and reduce your damage. On positive turns, choose the highest addition, and on negative turns, choose the lowest deduction.</p>\r\nScore sharing:\r\n<p> You can share your score with friends!
