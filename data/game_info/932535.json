You have already laid waste to their land. They are prepared to fight, even if it means death. Anything to end the death and destruction that you brought to their land. Of course, you fight them, because these people's lives mean nothing to you.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This game was created during my intro to game development class for university. It was a final project for the class, and I\u00a0created it with two others\u00a0- Luke Abella and Raymond Williams - and it was my first experience with game development, Unity, and C# as a coding language. It was a lot of work, but definitely a great learning experience. I just wish we could have implemented more, but I will say that I might return to this game to make a \"full game\", meaning create a full level that takes at least an hour to complete at a normal pace.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T18:03:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28c/28c3fa7085c22aa9fe8f7c49a78fa32d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Danny_Phantom3"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
