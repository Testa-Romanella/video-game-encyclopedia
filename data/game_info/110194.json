Mostly story driven with little battling .\u00a0</p>\n<p>Made in a Month, probably less than that due to time constraints limiting my work time to the weekends. Only one person worked on putting the entire game together, other resources were either found or friends lent a\u00a0 hand with art.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a project I\u00a0made to help me practice for a more long term project which is also connected. Please report any bugs found in the games.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d0/4d02d47111ccb7fcd7411dcb374a6043.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["0alacrity"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
