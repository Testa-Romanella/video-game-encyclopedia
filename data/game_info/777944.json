New mechanics are introduced such as hearts in bubbles which you now also have to confine. Dodge waves of bullets and survive while the boss panics. There are 4 phases in this game with each ending in a panic mode where the goal is not to confine the octopus but to survive. Be strategic in which objects to confine\u00a0 first then maybe will the octopus stop breaking out of it's confinement. Also, it's hard but possible. Did deathless myself ;) though per each phase so... Uhhhh... Good luck!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Z or Q to Go Through Menu and End Screen and to Use Ink, WASD or Arrow Keys to Move</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Takago: Main Programmer, Artist</p>\n<p>Miyaki: Main Artist, Programmer</p>\n<p>sproutser.art (please help me): Music Composer</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong></p>\n<p>If you however have lots of difficulties with the game and can't stand the difficulty, use the code \"Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right\" in the menu to make the gain more lives after each phase. This though is not at all how the game was intended. It's only to help people who normally don't do hard bullet hells.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T17:49:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9dd/9dda4e632852b7570874f7636c43afc0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Takago"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
