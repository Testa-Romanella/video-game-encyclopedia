Kill or be Killed, so you can steal all the cash and take it to the bank. We have three classes to choose from, jumping no scope kills, 8 arenas ranging from close quarters to sniper size maps. Take cover, sprint, crouch, jump, slide or boost your way into position to eliminate players during the day/night cycle.
