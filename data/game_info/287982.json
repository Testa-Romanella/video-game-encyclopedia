It's based on our much larger series called The Nays.<br/></p>\n<p>This project was created for Global Game Jam 2019 (meaning we created it in under 48 hours). The entire game and all of its artwork was created in a single weekend by Steve Rakar and Michelle Rakar.</p>\n<p>This year's theme was \"What Home means to you\" and coincidentally, that is the central theme of The Nays, so it fit perfectly for us.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9a/d9a053e50462c16f88d41149898f1c94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Gek Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
