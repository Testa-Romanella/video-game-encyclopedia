{"id": 961919, "slug": "cosmogonic", "name": "Cosmogonic", "name_original": "Cosmogonic", "description": "Cosmogonic is a 10 minute interactive science fiction animated short.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis story is told by Cosmogonic\u2014a once-great robot-engineer, who created the universe. When we put on our VR headsets, we step into Cosmogonic\u2019s head and hear him narrate the story of one of the planets he created: Actinuria. Here, the Pallatinids, a society of giant robots, live under the cruel King Archithorius. Fearing a conspiracy, he forces the citizens to wear suits of uranium armor, which causes an explosion if too many of them gather. But one Pallatinid\u2014a bold, young inventor named Pyron\u2014decides to use science and technology to inspire a revolution. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nA note from Director Pawel Szarzy\u0144ski:<br/>\r\n\"Cosmogonic is the story of an oppressed society and its path to liberation. I believe strongly that the basic drive to freedom is universal. Through a sci-fi perspective and a journey to distant, bizarre, and often incomprehensible places, I want to remove our everyday, structured vision of the world, and draw us away from the friendly, earthly environment we know all too well. By creating Cosmogonic\u2019s uncanny world\u2014diving into the origin of its universe, exploring the beginnings of life there, and experiencing the struggles of a developed civilization\u2014I hope to offer a fresh perspective, one that will help us to look clearly at ourselves. Ultimately, the story is a fairy tale. In my opinion, it is one that asks us to face the driving forces of nature, politics, and technology that shape our world today.\"", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-09T03:35:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa5/aa5c95fd7b9ddf2b6b2849842251ee93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 255, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kinhouse studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Astrea"], "esrb_rating": null}
