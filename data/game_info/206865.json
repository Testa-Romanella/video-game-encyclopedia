You must control two ships at the same time - one red and one blue. Each ship can only travel in nebula of their same color. Careful though. Fly a ship in the opposing colored nebula and you will spin out of control!</p>\n<p>Both ships emit a colored wake or 'stream' behind them. This stream allows the opposite colored ship to pass safely through the wrong colored nebula. However, each ship's stream does not last forever! Collect fuel canisters scattered across the level to keep the wakes flowing.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\nKeyboard/Mouse\r\n<ul><li>WASD:\u00a0\u00a0move red ship</li><li>Arrow Keys:\u00a0\u00a0 move blue ship</li><li>M\u00a0\u00a0Key:\u00a0 pause game</li><li>Mouse:\u00a0 select menu items</li></ul>\r\nController\r\n<ul><li>Left Stick:\u00a0 move red ship</li><li>Right stick:\u00a0 move blue ship</li><li>Left Face Button:\u00a0 pause game</li><li>A button:\u00a0 Select item</li></ul>\n\n<strong>Notes</strong>\n<ul><li>It is recommended that you play this game with a controller, although the game is still playable with the keyboard.</li><li>JetStreamers is only available for windows 64 bit machines</li></ul>\n\n<strong>Credits</strong>\r\nTeam\r\n<ul><li>Joshua Rosen</li><li>Marcus Romriell</li><li>Lex Dath</li><li>Ryan Dougherty</li></ul>\r\nOrganizations\r\n<ul><li>University of Utah EAE Program</li></ul>\r\nSoftware\r\n<ul><li>Made using Unreal Engine 4</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d7/6d79918381112d9c6ec4c5dcd2b748ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RevolveRex"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
