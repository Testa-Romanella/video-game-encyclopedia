Events in the early 21st century have upturned civilisation. Permanent lockdown extends across the globe while people stay glued to their screens isolated through social media. The limited government aid that is being provided has pacified the population.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBut not you. You know better. The better you. You break out from your room to find the only trace of virus manifesting its mutations. You turn the corridor, expecting lifeless streets. Footsteps draw near, but the smell of rotting bones arrives first. All your neighbours are now zombies - with an insatiable hunger for human flesh. Do not catch their infection!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSecure the building. Bring life back to streets. Scrap and build items. Find other survivors. Find the cure!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nZombie Quest will leave you thinking that you should have stayed indoors, after all.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T03:47:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb2/bb206ffee4ca889ba713f661637d1ff8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Liutauras Stravinskas", "Adrian Aksan", "Beniamin Paduch"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Liutauras Stravinskas", "Adrian Aksan"], "esrb_rating": null}
