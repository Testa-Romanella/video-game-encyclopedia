Coupled with the teleport mechanic, the engaging combat experience allows for a very interactive gameplay. There is no objective yet, though I do have a plot lined up.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Video showing combat gameplay:</strong><br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tControls:\r\n</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Left/Right</strong> - A/D<br/>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Jump </strong>- Space</li>\n<li><strong>Sprint</strong> - Shift</li>\n<li><strong>Attack</strong> - Left Click</li>\n<li><strong>Short tele </strong>- Q</li>\n<li><strong>Portal tele</strong> - X</li>\n<li><strong>Pick up item</strong> - Z</li>\n<li><strong>Cast Fireball</strong> - 1</li>\n<li><strong>Cast Lightning</strong> - 2</li>\n<li><strong>Cast Fire Blast </strong>- 3</li>\n<li><strong>Cast Ice Blast </strong>- 4</li>\n<li><strong>Cast Heal</strong> - 5</li><li><strong>Cast shield</strong> - 6</li><li><strong>Open Menu</strong> - ESC</li><li><strong>Mute </strong>- F1</li>\n<li><strong>Restart</strong> - F5</li>\n<li><strong>Suicide</strong> - F6</li>\n<li><strong>Toggle Controls</strong> - F7</li><li><strong>Open Console </strong>- ~</li></ul><p>The console can be opened with the '~' key.
