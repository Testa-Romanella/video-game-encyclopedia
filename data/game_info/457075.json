I mean, being inside for months isn't too hard, right? You got family, technology, food -- perfect. Wrong. You have none of those things (unless you count that weird ten year old tin in the back of your cupboard 'food'). Face it: You're alone. No friends. No family. All you have is the TV and the microwave and - oh - that cheap knock-off blender you swore you'd use as part of a New Year's Resolution which lasted all of 5 days. Would be weird if you started developing relationships with these things...<br/></p>\n\n<p>Lockdown Lover is a visual novel dating simulator in which you (yes, you!) develop relationships with your household appliances after a long and slippery fall down the slope that is called 'being a total loner and probably a loser who decided it would be a good idea to spend their month's wage on a TV instead of taking care of the basic necessities of survival' -- or something.</p>\n<p>Make friends, foes and all else along the way to ensure that you are in fact the saddest person in the world (seriously, who wants to date a doorknob?).</p>\n\n<p>**We're still early in development! Stay tuned to see the future of Lockdown Lover as we continue the story, adding more characters and branches that will keep you entertained.**\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T02:59:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d1/5d19ef0235ad21ad0bc42f29763f3c95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["phat hoops"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
