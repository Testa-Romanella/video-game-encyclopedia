With \"W\" he flies up, with \"S\" down. You are using your mouse to shoot hearts towards moles. Once you hit them they will follow you until you hit another one, so they can pair. Your goal is to get 10 pairs and try not to miss any moles on the way or waste your hearts. Also MoleMan has to evade flying Ducks on his way.</p>\n<p>You can choose between 4 difficulties: Easy, Medium, Hard and Extreme. The higher the difficulty, the faster MoleMan is. Each Difficulty has it's own Highscore. The Highscores can be erased with the Reset Button in the Settings Menu of the Main Menu. <br/><br/></p>\n<p>-Made by TheLuigiplayer &amp; KiritoGames20<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61c/61ce85a30f30c02500c75a220e733632.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheLuigiplayer", "KiritoGames20"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
