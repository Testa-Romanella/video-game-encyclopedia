Porting GML to HTML5 unfortunately bricked the game, so I patched it up as much as I could given the limited time. You might occasionally encounters small bugs. Please let me know if you do.</p>\n\n<p>The theme of the jam this time was \"ON / OFF\" which I found rather hard to work with. Maybe if I went for something else other than a platformer. Even so, I tried incorporating the idea of turning stuff on and off or getting onto and off things into the game.</p>\n\n<p>Just like Interdimensional Spike, which I am proud to say was the winner of the previous Nokia Game Jam, this might be seen more as a demo of possible game mechanics that could be used in a small game where you play as a... button. <br/>I tried keeping the controls simple while coming up with various ways to progress inside these constraints.<br/></p>\n<p>Let me know if you like it and what you think about it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T03:26:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33d/33db67885d144a0ec50ab03668378aaf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["yaotu"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
