Dark humour, player choices that have some impact on your outcome and hours of daft shenanigans. <br/><br/>- Over 70 locations<br/>- Thousands of lines of dialogue<br/>- Over 120 custom made sound effects<br/>- Original composed soundtrack <br/>- Alternate outcomes and wildly varying dialogue based on player choice<br/><br/><br/><br/>In this hilarious parody adventure set in a vaguely renaissance fantasy world you play as 'Brownie'. Brownie is a sub manager of a local pilchard press in his home town of Schtinkberg. A simple man, in the midst of a mid life crisis. He awakes from a terrible dream featuring his permanently angry boss and a poorly animated unicorn... the rest is up to you.<br/><br/><br/>Follow the twists and turns of Brownie's adventure into our world (Well, Sheffield anyway) and beyond in the funniest and most ridiculous point and click to ever be solo developed by a middle aged hippy burnout. Hours of puzzles and laughs. <br/><br/>Make choices, solve puzzles and enjoy absurd dialogue.
