Falling through holes loses one of your 3 lives, so think carefully about your steps.</p>\n<p>On your way, you can collect stars, Christmas ornaments, and gifts for extra points.</p>\n<p>The game has a password system to load already-played levels.      </p>\n<p>The game is tested on real hardware, TheC64, and VICE emulator.      The game will run in PAL and NTSC modes, but it's not optimized for NTSC.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T07:07:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae0/ae059ca3a748c09264fd32a39531249b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vector5 Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
