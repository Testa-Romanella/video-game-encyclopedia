The experience to be gained from this was to learn how to work with developers in different disciplines so that we could adapt to environments in game studios.</em></p>\n<p>An adventurer ventured to the depths of a deserted island in search of the Jewel of Hope. However, once they removed it from its box, despair seeped through the island. It awakened ancient stone sculptures which attacked the adventurer, but they are determined to escape the island with the precious jewel. Players can move throughout the various rooms in the maze-like ruins and shoot down incoming enemies. The objective is to locate the final boss and defeat it.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Artist</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Soh Wah Rok (Jake)</p>\n<p><strong>Design Team</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><em>[Lead]</em> Tan Xinyi</p>\n<p>Kevin Ng Jun Ming</p>\n<p><strong>Tech Team</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>[Lead]\u00a0</em>Caleb Foo Chuan Xi</p>\n<p>Lim Junhan</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T04:53:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc4/dc487639b6658558fbb174daf3ffb597.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UOWM Game Development", "Tan Xinyi", "CalebFoo"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
