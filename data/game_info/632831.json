It is still a narrative game, you can play it online and if that doesn't work you can download it but that requires an emulator i recommend this one (https://mgba.io/). this is a very early version and is no where near finished.  that is why there may be things missing/ not working, also this demo is really quick but should show what its like.</p>\n\n<p>note for the jam owners:</p>\n<p>This is a horror game with a killer if there is anything that is going over the rules (no sex gore 18+) please comment and i will\u00a0 get back to you</p>\n\n<p>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T06:44:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a27/a278d1bb16f1a839417bfb2702b51406.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Zyphon_22"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
