The corruption runs rampant and corporations have their fingers in every aspect of life, and the social divide has never been greater. This is the latest stage of capitalism - selling your kidney to afford next month\u2019s rent. But living in the future has its benefits - technology, body mods, neon tattoos\u2026 And that\u2019s where you come in, Henry.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ve had a rough childhood but you made it out of the rathole. You had a life, a family, stability. Until she died. Now you have to fend for yourself and take care of your son. So, you gotta do the only thing you\u2019ve ever been good at - tattooing. Well, maybe it\u2019s not the only thing you\u2019re good at, but ain\u2019t nobody gonna pay you to get into barfights. So, you took out a loan, now you gotta hustle. Don\u2019t worry though, I have a feeling your first client is just around the corner.</p>\n<p>Anyway, long story short, welcome to my world, dude. Tattoo Punk world.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": true, "updated": "2021-09-22T09:46:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/f33/f3300c8dba5a8b645856a51d2c5c417f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 287, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["No Gravity Games", "Varsav Game Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
