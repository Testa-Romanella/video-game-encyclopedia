Your can go it alone, but friends can help you up if you fall. Fight fearsome monsters (and cute penguins). Explore four distinct dungeons that grow in complexity as you go deeper. What's after the fourth dungeon? Definitely not just more of the same but harder.\u00a0Gain memey loot and dodge Bethesda-level polish. Endure the terror of confusing menus with references to vaporware.</p>\n<p>But hey, deadly combat is always more fun with friends. So gather around, and see who can get the furthest before death eventually comes calling for you all. <br/></p>\n<p>Remember, there are no bugs. Only 100% intended &amp; fully developed features here.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T04:32:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ed/8ed1e93872bc1f9cf48a6675f4feeb1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ADoodleyDo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
