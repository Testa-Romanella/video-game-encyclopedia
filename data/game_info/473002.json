There are two ways to change weapons, get hit by an enemy or wait for a pick up item (color orange box)\u00a0to appear. There are four weapons: Pistol, MachineGun, Bazooka, and a Warp Device. The color of the Bazooka is <strong>orange</strong> and it will explode once it hits an enemy, though there is no explosion art yet so there will just be an invincible hitbox that will enlarge once triggered. And the color of the Warp Device is <strong>black</strong>, though this is not a weapon, and what this does is warp you in its current position by either clicking the <strong>right mouse button</strong> or pressing the <strong>E key</strong>. You only have 5 lives and the only way to heal is to wait for an item pick up to appear (which is colored green and a bit larger than the weapon pickup). The enemy will increase by number as you play so uhhm yeah. Basic controls are WASD to move and left mouse click to shoot, yeah.</p>\n<p>Other:</p>\n<p>I wanted to add some art and music for this but there was an urgent task that was given to me in school regarding our Graduation (yeas I'm graduating from Highschool). Our Graduation will be at 28th of this month so after that I'll be continuing this project, add some art, UI, music, sound effects and other stuff so yeah.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T04:32:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/993/993221afddcef34d3546971661906829.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HeadphoneUser75"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
