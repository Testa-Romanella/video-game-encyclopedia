Stranded on a cannibal island you are lucky: Improved seamanship has led to fewer and fewer shipping accidents in recent years - a major food source for the cannibals. So you are offered a deal: find Brownie George on a remote island, and get his relish recipe to make beans more tasty than your bones. So you go on a quest with your fellow pirate buddy, fly with birds, paddle in barrels, and use your bubble shooter to fight sharks.</p>\n<p>This is the demo version of the game, covering the first stage. The final game will be published on Steam.</p>\n<p>You need\u00a0 a buddy to play the game. Also, you need a separate voice chat of your choice as the game does not provide one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T14:59:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d2/0d274919bbdf57c4e098ba3f155aded9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 336, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Atlantic Tech & Candy"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
