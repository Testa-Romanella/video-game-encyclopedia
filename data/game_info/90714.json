Vigilance is key as environmental tells such as footprints and other disturbances will point out careless cadets. Using special abilities and firing your Invisigun will also momentarily give you away. Along with items and powerups, these mechanics reward stealth, reflex, forethought, deception, and awareness. A variety of lovingly-made environments, maps, game modes, and abilities combine for high replayability and a deep path to mastery.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compete with up to <strong>4 players</strong>\u00a0or <strong>bots</strong> on a single screen</li>\n<li>Test your skills in a <strong>single player</strong> challenge mode with 3 skill levels</li>\n<li>Mix and match <strong>local</strong> and <strong>online </strong>players</li>\n<li>Battle your friends using a variety of <strong>heroes</strong>, each with unique <strong>special abilities</strong></li>\n<li>Explore <strong>70 maps</strong> spread across <strong>6 planets</strong>, each with unique interactivity, hazards, and weather effects</li>\n<li>Choose from a variety of <strong>game modes</strong> playable on every map for deep replayability</li>\n<li>Customize the game mode conditions with <strong>match modifiers</strong></li>\n<li>View hilariously revealing <strong>instant replays</strong> that expose tactics</li>\n<li>Save instant replays as animated <strong>GIFs</strong></li>\n<li>Control your hero using <strong>gamepads </strong>or the keyboard</li>\n<li>Enjoy hand-crafted <strong>pixel art</strong> made with care</li>\n<li>Groove to the custom pulsing, ambient <strong>soundtrack </strong>composed by Paper Sound</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<br/>\n<strong>Survival</strong>:<br/>\r\n\t\tLast hero standing wins a point each round\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t<br/>\n<strong>Hunter</strong>:<br/>\r\n\t\tEvery kill earns a point\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t<br/>\n<strong>Zone Control</strong>:<br/>\r\n\t\tMaintain control of the zone area to score points\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t<br/>\n<strong>Deadline</strong>:<br/>\r\n\t\tMost kills within a time limit wins\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t<br/>\n<strong>Carrier</strong>:<br/>\r\n\t\tSurvive the longest while carrying the token\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t<br/>\n<strong>Land Grab</strong>:<br/>\r\n\t\tClaim the most territory on the map to win\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t<br/>\n<strong>Beast Tamer</strong>:<br/>\r\n\t\tTame the wild beasts and collect rewards to win\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dev blog: www.sombr.com </li>\n<li>Twitter: @shadiradio</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:26:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f33/f33b293995beaa13bc6ae2af39fa1ff4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 424, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sombr Studio", "shadiradio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
