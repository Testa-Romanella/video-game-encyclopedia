More than 300 units of eight countries are present in the game.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The singleplayer mode features four campaigns (One for the FRG and the U.S. and two for the USSR). Each campaign is a hypothetical war scenario between the NATO and Eastern forces in Central Europe.</p>\n<p>There is no unit building present in the game. Every arriving reinforcement is paid for using deployment points, which are accumulated for control over key areas. Reinforcements are not unlimited, as the amount of purchasable units is limited. Units earn experience on the battlefield and if they survive until the end of the mission, they can be used on the next level of the campaign.</p>\n<p>Units have a set of stats: experience, health, psyche, ammo count, and accuracy. The units psyche depends on the state of the battle with the enemy forces. If a unit suffers a panic attack, it&#39;s efficiency goes way down. Vehicles can be upgraded. Some of the units are only present in the game&#39;s multiplayer mode. Initially, the player has access to a little number of the game&#39;s units. New units are purchasable for the command stars that are awarded both in single and multiplayer modes. The players can get 840 stars overall.</p>", "metacritic": 81, "released": "2012-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T12:28:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe0/fe044284119f28c3f5e6e31bad7a01ff.jpg", "website": "http://wargame-ee.com/", "rating": 3.26, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 48, "owned": 1080, "beaten": 26, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 35, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 29, "ratings_count": 70, "suggestions_count": 536, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 70, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Eugen Systems"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Focus Home Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
