It is you or them: CUT or be CUT.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>- HOW TO PLAY -<br/></strong>The extradimensional katana is a legendary weapon that can cut through nearly anything BUT there is a catch: cuts dealt with this sword<strong> will only happen after\u00a0SHEATHING it.</strong></p><p><strong>- CONTROLS -</strong><br/>Look --&gt; MOUSE or\u00a0 RIGHT STICK<br/>Move --&gt; WASD or LEFT STICK<br/>Sheath/Unsheath --&gt; RIGHT CLICK or LEFT SHOULDER<br/>Cut --&gt; LEFT CLICK or RIGHT SHOULDER<br/>Exit --&gt; ESC<br/>Cheats/Godmode --&gt; M <br/></p>\n<p><strong>GAMEPAD SUPPORT</strong>:\u00a0 SSC supports <strong>Xbox One gamepads</strong> and should work without any issues. Just ignore the tutorial tips as they are oriented towards keyboard and mouse users and remember to use ESC in order to exit the game. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: since this is a prototype bugs may happen... if you get stuck in a room after clearing it use <strong>R </strong>to restart it and try again.<br/><br/></p>\n<br/><br/>\n<p><strong>SamuraiSuperCut </strong>it is just a prototype of a really dumb idea I had one day thinking on how cool Samurai look when slashing things. Its aesthetics are obviously inspired by the great SUPERHOT. It was also an excercise to deepen into Unreal Engine blueprints. <br/><br/>Hope you enjoy this little prototype and, don't forget to sheath your sword!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T11:11:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08b/08b71c214217c308cbf6eeab51719f94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Celuloide"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
