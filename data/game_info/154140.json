This game has four different difficulty levels ( Easy, Medium, Hard, Hyper! ) but you must conquer them all if you wanna finish it. What do I have to do in this game? it's really simple, just reach 150 points in all of the four modes! ( if you can, that's it ) and free your lover ( a cute yellow rabbit ). Background songs are a mix of really good chiptune 90's magic, players are taken on a nostalgia trip. Between levels , there's always a mini-boss battle gameplay, where you must blast your enemy with a light-saber sword to proceed, moving on an hoverboard controlled by your device's accelerometer. Speed is the key! to enjoy this game you'll have to push your reflexes really hard, just ignore distractions,flying japanese onigiries,Christmas's Santa or NES cartdriges and reach for the goal!<br/><br/>Youtube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bcRnM45bkQ</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d5/7d561a25e9c72d93de4a8a7097a06904.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Jumpersize"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
