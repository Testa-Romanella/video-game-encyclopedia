Slimes, the weakest of RPG enemies, have the ability to take over enemy units and fight!<br />\n[Summary]<br />\nThis is a strategic turn-based RPG, but it is Slimes that you control. Slimes can take over an enemy and control them in battle.<br />\nFor example, a Slime can utilise archers, or use magic if they take over a magician. They can even bewilder an enemy with a bribe if they take over a merchant.<br />\nIn addition there are various kinds of Slimes:<br />\nSome of them can warp.<br />\nSome of them can improve the abilities of the possessed enemy.<br />\nAnd many more...<br />\nEach stage poses key strategic questions. Which Slime will you use on each enemy? How will you take them over?<br />\nFor example the element of a Slime is very important for a capture. This is a tough game, too, so you cannot win by charging in recklessly - tactics are vital.<br />\nThe appearance of this game may be lighthearted, but a big challenge awaits!<br />\n[STORY]<br />\nThe world was about to be ruined.<br />\nThe brutal humans arrived and almost took over the whole world.<br />\nThey burnt the forest, polluting the water and the sky.<br />\nThey were tyrannical, almost ruining the land.<br />\nAnd they threatened the Slimes that offered little resistance; they did not have great power and merely waited for extinction.<br />\nThen the Slimes realised they could take over the human bodies and use that strength against their enemies.<br />\nThe Slime counterattack began.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T12:19:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f50/f50626c2dd2656062216234900974d8c.jpg", "website": "http://www.altairworks.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 10, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 426, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["Nintendo 3DS", "Android", "iOS", "PC", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Flyhigh Works", "altairworks", "MASAYA TAKAHASHI", "ALTAIR WORKS"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CIRCLE Ent.", "Flyhigh Works", "CIRCLE Entertainment", "MASAYA TAKAHASHI"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
