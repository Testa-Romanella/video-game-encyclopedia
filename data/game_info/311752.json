We should pay attention to both battlefield and strategy.<br/>\r\nThe adventure part of the game is for reference: the Tower of Killing.<br/>\r\nAfter all, it's unrealistic to develop games independently and make a big gameplay adventure.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nProduction process:<br/>\r\nDuring the production process, I also saw other similar games, and found that a slogan beyond dungeon is also instant combat + card adventure.<br/>\r\nAfter playing for a while, I found that the difference between my game and mine is still very big, and I can't help but relieve myself.<br/>\r\nThe game's card emphasis is that the timing and position of the operation will not be biased toward numerical size.<br/>\r\nAfter all, it's a real-time battle. The risk-taking part is mainly about strategy.<br/>\r\nI'm very fond of Furnace Stone Kun. There will be a lot of adventure events, which will strengthen the content of the card Kun.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSome others:<br/>\r\nGame is one of my production. I used to make some commercial games.<br/>\r\nNow independent production of personal games, thanks to the support of the family, is not and do not have time to do what they want to do.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/051/051cfb5b51bcdea42842892449bd05d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["CoolHeartGame"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CoolHeartGame"], "esrb_rating": null}
