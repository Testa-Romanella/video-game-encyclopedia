No buttons or similar forms of input are used. The focus of the work is on the specially developed gesture recognition system. It continuously checks the user's movements for predefined runes.

To demonstrate this system, an environment was created consisting of assets and audio files from third parties.</p>\n<p>Check out RuneMagic (https://lorro.itch.io/runemagic) for the Unity package.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T21:43:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/126/12630f86b19f4d6864f1e9cea1ce8cb6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lorro"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
