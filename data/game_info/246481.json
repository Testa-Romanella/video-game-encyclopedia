The game progresses in a linear manner: watch cut-scene events, complete missions, set up wanzers during intermissions, and sortie for the next mission. Missions in Front Mission 2089 are traditional tactical RPG fare, ranging from destroying all enemy targets to protecting a particular allied target. Due to its mobile phone format, the story of Front Mission 2089 is told through episodic content; with new episodes being released for download on a bi-weekly basis. A returning feature in the game is the Arena. Like in Front Mission, players can fight other players to win monetary rewards. Mission rankings also make a return; based on the scoring system of Front Mission 3, players can earn new parts and wanzers by doing well during missions. Another returning feature is briefings. Lastly, players can choose to play two unique scenarios - one for the Oceania Cooperative Union, and one for the United States of the New Continent.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T12:11:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/fdb/fdb6e442f230ddb4be7e1e92a672398b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 310, "game_series_count": 10, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": ["h.a.n.d."], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Square Enix"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
