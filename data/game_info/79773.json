Become the CEO of a multi-national corporation and lift into the stratosphere and beyond, all by the force of your own propulsion!<br/><br/>Corporate Fart Jump is an addictive game to play during any of your boring meetings. Or anywhere else, for that matter, because it's so much fun.<br/><br/>With retro 1980s graphics and realistic sound effects, this is a perfect metaphor of the corporate life: fast-paced and full of punches in your face. As in real life, the only way to get ahead is hard work, luck, and making others think that you're shooting rainbows out of your [censored].<br/><br/>As in every corporation, you have to put on your best suit and start from nothing. By adding your valueable input to the corporate ecosystem, you slowly begin to lift off. However, there's more than just one obstacle ahead; no one wants you to succeed and you have to outsmart the system of corporate barriers if you want to get promoted.<br/><br/>Without the propulsion and fresh ideas, you'll quickly be downsized, rightsized or otherwise eliminated. However if you're really good, there's no limit. Climbing the ladder, up and up, to the point where air is so thin normal people cannot breathe. The stratosphere. Push it further, ambitious as you are, and you can become CGO--Chief Galactic Officer, and finally, CUO--Chief Universe Officer. Your mother would be proud!<br/><br/>Fun fact: did you know that CGO gets a totally black and frictionless company spaceship to travel to other galaxies?<br/><br/>Features:<br/>- simple one-hand operation (don't play while driving!)<br/>- incredibly addictive (really, don't play while driving)<br/>- beautiful pixel-perfect graphics and realistic sounds<br/>- the longest corporate ladder you've ever seen!<br/>- if you buy now, you get to start playing earlier!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T11:10:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3cb/3cb3faf4a5334b1d8bb87524b02a1871.jpg", "website": "http://fraoula.com/cfj", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Fraoula"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Fraoula"], "esrb_rating": null}
