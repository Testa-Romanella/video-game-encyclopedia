(Made in less than 48hrs)</p>\n<p>Isometric puzzle game where you control a dice and try to place it on tiles, such that the top of the dice matches the tile. Click on the tile to roll the dice to that tile. Use the arrow keys/buttons to look from different sides. At the moment only the core mechanic of the game is implemented and there is room to introduce layered complexity like - Rotating platforms, conveyer belts, portal tiles and so on. Also given the duration of the Gamejam the number of levels are few.</p>\n<p>Also our 1st game :P.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T08:39:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe5/fe5c60db88223bb088bc76aebad3f7b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NoxTheDamned"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
