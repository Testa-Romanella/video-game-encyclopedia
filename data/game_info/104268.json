Each turn lasts a random amount of seconds (between 5 and 15). If you're still blowing on your egg when time runs up, your egg will hatch ! But if it hatches with a low power, then chances are high you'll lose the game (played against 1 to 3 other players) !\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>So how long will you risk blowing on the egg to increase it's power ?</strong></p>\n<p>For more about me check out my Youtube channel (plenty of Unity tutorials, behind the scenes and devlogs\u00a0) :\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Z1XWw1kmnvOOFsj6Bzy2g?view_as=subscriber</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/955/9553101841261bdf696e2580c647db1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Blackthornprod Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
