{"id": 967046, "slug": "cybertd", "name": "CyberTD", "name_original": "CyberTD", "description": "Think you have what it takes to save cyberspace? Mutant viruses have invaded its core and are threatening to destroy it. It\u2019s up to you to take on these waves of viruses and defend the core of cyberspace in a way that prevents any of them from reaching it. But there\u2019s no need to fret \u2013 you'll have countless upgrades and a split-personality killer drone to (more or less) help you out!<h3>Innovative tower defense experience</h3><br/>CyberTD takes the <strong>classic tower defense experience</strong> and combines it with <strong>roguelite elements</strong>, creating a captivating mix. With each level-up, you'll unlock new upgrades and gain access to more options for customizing your defense according to your own unique style.<h3>Easy to learn, tough to master</h3><br/>Though learning the game's simple mechanics is easy, you'll need to come up with an <strong>elaborate strategy</strong> if you're looking to reach high-score territory. You'll be entertained for plenty of time in your hunt for better upgrades and tactics \u2013 and you\u2019ll get some questionable support from a retired killer drone with two feisty personalities.<h3>Various game modes</h3><br/>You'll always find yourself facing new challenges through these different game modes:<br/><ul><li><strong>Single Player</strong>: Viruses charge at you, wave after wave, with mutations that boost their strength and endurance \u2013 but you, too, have access to a growing range of effective defense mechanisms designed to stop them.<br/></li><li><strong>Co-op</strong>: Face the waves of enemies as a pair and work together to fight them off for as long as possible.<br/></li><li><strong>Versus</strong>: Face the waves of enemies side-by-side and compete to see who's more successful at fighting them off.<br/></li><li><strong>Weekly Challenges</strong>: A different set of special challenges each week for experienced players \u2013 tougher rules come into play here!<br/></li><li><strong>Community Clash</strong>: Fun and exciting games for streamers (Twitch) where your chat takes control of a second player in co-op or versus mode, or determines how the rest of the game unfolds for you through choices!</li></ul><h3>Endless possibilities</h3><br/>You have the power to choose what you need to defend against the enemy effectively. Looking to inflict heavy damage or trigger nasty status changes? Eager to level up your weapons or gain powerful abilities? Over <strong>170 different upgrades await you in four different levels of rarity</strong>, ready to be unlocked and integrated into your inventory. You can choose one upgrade per enemy wave from a random selection in this pool \u2013 so no two games will ever be the same!<h3>Direct link to the developer</h3><br/>Feel free to contact us \u2013 we appreciate any and all feedback!
