Infiltrate and destroy their base in Grid Gunner, a turn-based bullet hell where everything is depending on you. All projectiles and enemies move when you move so that you can take your time while figuring out how not to die. This game was made in Ludum Dare 41 with the theme of mashing up 2 unlikely genres. Grid Gunner is a combination of the bullet hell and turn-based genres.</p>\r\nYour Mission:\r\n<p>Your mission is to take out the operation from within. Unfortunately, due to your noticeable presence as a green and your un-stealthy entrance, the reds have noticed you. The reds can come in many different forms, ranging from big deadly ships to small boxes. Good luck on this mission.</p>Grid Gunner is now mobile!\r\n<p>We have recently released an Android port of Grid Gunner, so that you can play on the go!
