In King rocket, you have the opportunity to independently launch a rocket into the sky, and moreover, control it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nKing rocket- is partly a flight simulator with a side view, partly a fly. To begin with, the player needs to launch the device into the air and only then take control into their own hands. If you operate the device incorrectly, and do not follow the fuel indicator, then in a moment it may run into an obstacle, which will lead to its destruction. In addition to collecting stars, the player will need to safely land a rocket, which is also quite difficult. But if it didn\u2019t work out the first time, it will work out the second time. Good luck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGame Features:<br/>\r\n- 30 levels with increasing difficulty<br/>\r\n-Old-school gameplay<br/>\r\n- Pixel art graphics", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-04T02:13:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bd/0bd0f1fba8789e70dff5417cb1647b6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kefir build"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bitlock Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
