A new world and set of enemy formations are generated for every game, too bad you won't be able to enjoy the scenery below cuz you'll be too busy trying to survive!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The world is generated at random, so weird\u00a0occurrences like lamposts on a desert island,\u00a0or a farm with no homes around it are not\u00a0uncommon. Also, pay no mind to the occasional\u00a0farm in the middle of a forest.\u00a0Beware of the landmines, yes they still detect\u00a0you and can blow you up even if you're miles\u00a0above them.</p>\n<p>The sprites are from Kenney's Pixel Shmup pack (The game's title makes a bit more sense now doesn't it? No? Okay...) All the sounds except the music are from the scratch Sounds library. The music is from Scratcher @Rae-TV's EDM album: Beyond. Found here\u00a0https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/426798682/</p>\n<p>Thanks to Emhuo\u00a0https://emhuo.itch.io/\u00a0for their awesome Pixel font pack(s).\u00a0I used Bold Blocks from the Nico Fonts pack in this project.\u00a0Thanks to Kenney for hosting the Game jam, and thanks to YOU for viewing my project. Feedback would be greatly appreciated.
