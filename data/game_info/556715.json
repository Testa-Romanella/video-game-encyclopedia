Using a hand-made dolls house and soundscapes, players of 1-4 investigate generational memory, trauma and truth. You have 20 minutes to investigate 4 out of a total of 16 rooms - choose truths or lies to decide what really happened. In this prototype, 3 rooms are available to play.</p>\n<p>This is being developed with support from the Creative Youth Foundation as a part of my being selected for the Creative Youth Development Award. I am being mentored by Jeff Tanton, VP Creative/Creative Director at Mediatonic for the digital game, and will be working with a professional fabricator to create the physical installation. The piece is being developed with accessibility at its core, having audio description, neurodivergence-friendly interactivity, and not being restricted to people who can physically travel to the piece.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T06:48:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/828/82858a019a58ff4024a5c1616be7067e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["hannahraymondcox"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
