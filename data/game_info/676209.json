Once the game starts, use the keyboard keys ASJK\u00a0to control players 1 and 2.<br/><br/>Player 1 uses 'a' to pull and 's' to release.<br/>Player 2 uses 'j' to pull and 'k' to release.<br/><br/>Press the pull button to bring the trophy closer while raising Tension. Press the release button while your opponent is pulling to fling them away while releasing all of the built up Tension. If a player touches the trophy then they win. If a player\u00a0falls off of the platform then the other player wins.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay\u00a0Tips:</strong>\u00a0Release a pull\u00a0quickly to create less Tension than a long pull. If both players stop pulling, then Tension will decrease over time.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong>\u00a0Tug of Warriors was created with the Scratch engine in 72 hours with original code, art, and music.
