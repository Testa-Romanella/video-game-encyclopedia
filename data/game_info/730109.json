Because Grandpa is a jerk, he hid my teddy bear, but Ted can't sleep without me, so I need to find him. With my glow sticks I can light the dark mansion, but Grandpa doesn't like light and he also doesn't want me to walk around at night. He also looks very ugly.</p>\n<p>Use WASD and the mouse to navigate around. Throw glow sticks with LMB and open doors or collect items with E. Don't stay in the dark for too long. And don't try to shake Grandpa's hands. He may be a bit upset and put you back to sleep.<br/></p>\n<p>We used and edited a sound which is licensed under CC 3.0 Attribution:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/TheSoundmakerqueen/sounds/488962/</p>\n<p>This game was made by Colleen, Denice, Markus and me within 48 hours for the Global Game Jam 2022.</p>\n<p>You can also play it on the official GGJ site, if you want:\u00a0https://globalgamejam.org/2022/games/not-alone-7</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T06:23:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eec/eec53d530d465459fb6e08e61690409e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Fernofai", "DeGray", "Lethyos"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
