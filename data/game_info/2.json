Her supernatural skills are called upon when everything and everyone else has failed to rid a haunted house of its ghostly presence.<br/><br/>Conventional methods won\u2019t cut it with these ghosts. Instead, Mae comes armed with a deadly arsenal of ghost-busting weapons, from rocket launchers to razor sharp boomerangs.<br/>But these aren\u2019t your average poltergeists. At the end of each round, a ghost appears and mimics your every move from the round before. The longer you survive the more extreme the game becomes.<br/><br/>Engage in non-stop ghost annihilation in 10 eerie areas of the haunted house \u2013 each room presenting its own hellish hazard. Brave the winds on the balcony and the fire in the kitchen, surviving for as long as you can. <br/><br/>With a devilish local multiplayer \u2013 you can play co-op or deathmatch modes with up to 3 of your friends, and with 50 unique challenges even the most daring Extreme Exorcist will be put to the test.", "metacritic": 75, "released": "2015-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-29T21:55:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67d/67d0e74fd74fd2ea9b847856fb388736.jpg", "website": "http://extremeexorcism.com", "rating": 2.72, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 37, "owned": 337, "beaten": 11, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 26, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 65, "ratings_count": 59, "suggestions_count": 443, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 60, "platforms": ["Wii U", "PlayStation 3", "PlayStation 4", "PC", "Xbox One", "macOS"], "developers": ["Golden Ruby Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ripstone"], "esrb_rating": null}
