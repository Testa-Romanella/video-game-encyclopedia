And I had a lot of fun.</p>\n<p>The game jam's theme was \"unstable\". And the first thought came to mind was magic.\u00a0\u00a0And any powerful wizard would hold a powerful staff. But what if that staff was the most insensitive staff that would combust at a moment notice.\u00a0And that How I came up with game core mechanic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The core mechanic is quite simple. Each time you fire a spell. An hidden point gets added. This point's range is random to make the staff more unstable and random. Once it reaches its limit. An exclamation mark appears above the player. While in this unstable state. Any spell you cast becomes more powerful, but it also accelerate the staff's instability. And once it reaches boiling point, it explodes.</p>\n<p>I did plan and would have love\u00a0to have multiple levels, enemy variety, different type of spell, and a much better AI. But, because of my inexperience I could not have done it faster. And the asset leaves a lot to be desired.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the end, the game as it is now is more of a demo much less than a game. But I did learn a lot.</p>\n\r\nCredits:\r\nFont:\u00a0<strong>8-bit HUD, by\u00a0\u00a0</strong>Seba Perez, from\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/8-bit-hud.font\r\nSFX: - 256 NES Samples, from\u00a0https://www.contralogic.com/256-nes-samples/\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - 8-bit explosion sfx, by POWER, from\u00a0www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXzoh6uJO1w", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T05:52:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6dd/6dd0fc477169ebcdbb72e989918eaf51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mssalkhalifah"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
