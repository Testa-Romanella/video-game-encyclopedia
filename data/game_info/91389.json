But somehow, no one ever thought to ask is... <strong><em>WHY</em></strong><strong><em>?</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>World-renowned physician Dr. Antony Darley and his faithful sidekick Mr. Alex Homain\u00a0 discover the shocking answer to this question when they are taken captive while on a polar expedition.\u00a0\u00a0But will they be able to escape with their lives?\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><em><strong>Dr. Darley and the Prisoners at Santa's Workshop</strong></em>\u00a0is an irreverent visual novel that's like a cross between\u00a0<em>Danganronpa</em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>Professor Layton</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's completely linear, so it contains none of that\u00a0<em>pesky gameplay</em>\u00a0that hampers so many other video games! With a length of 48,400 words, it\u00a0can be read in a few sittings.</p>\n<p>I'm an artiste, not a programmer, so this\u00a0 is unoptimized and probably has a bunch of minor, (hopefully non-game-breaking) technical issues.
