This time I made a text adventure! I've been wanting to do one for some time, but never really made one. When they announced the theme Ancient Technology, I wanting to create an adventure/exploration game, with an air of mystery to the objects found, but I knew I wouldn't be able to do that graphically, I'm a programmer and my graphics skill are hardly my best. But as I also play a lot of table top RPGs, I decided to make a text game that could evoke more of the player imagination.</p><p>This game is a very simple one, and although the quality of writing doesn't keep up until the end, I hope you can have fun reading/playing this little journey. This project had many ups and downs, but I will discuss this later in my Post Mortem, which I should write after one or two weeks, after I gathered some feedback.</p><p>As always, please leave a comment so I can check your game too!</p><p>Congratulations to all!</p><p>*************************************************************************/</p><p>Announcements:</p><p>* (08/28) I don't know how to make the embedded browser in itch.io stretch to the whole page. I will work on that. Also if I find that the font size and spacing isn't very comfortable, I'll change it ASAP!</p><p>* (09/06) Added two recommended BGM, added Firefox bug</p><p>* (09/06) Firefox bug crushed</p><p>* (09/08) Embedded URL was wrong, fixed</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/060/060801eb872afffcb67e1a24b2417eb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nihil Aleph"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
