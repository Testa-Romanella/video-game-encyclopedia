Set in a vibrant cartoon world brought to life by eye-catching pixel art, the player\u2019s primary goal is to reach the end of each level safely, and then defeat that level\u2019s boss. The game will be won if the player can beat the boss of the fourth and final level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, true completion will require the player to return to each level and discover the secrets in all of the areas they couldn\u2019t reach previously, when they lacked certain abilities. The player will have to master both high-speed movement and careful, strategic platforming if they want to prevail.</p>\n<p>In the Demo Version, you can try your hand at the game's third level: <strong>Ice Plains. </strong>A level that sees Katt traversing treacherous snowcapped peaks, jumping across vast chasms and racing by lethal enemies.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Who is Katt Vitez\u0103? </strong>A lynx girl who\u2019s had a curiosity and a desire for adventure since early childhood. Known to be quite energetic, she stays active by climbing trees, exploring caves and holding races with her friends in their mountain forest home. Unbeknownst to her, these innocent activities would serve as preparation for the crisis at hand.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>What's going on? </strong>Strange mechanical beings known as the Maskineri have invaded Katt\u2019s mountain forest, stealing its natural resources, some cutting down trees, others taking the fish from the rivers.
