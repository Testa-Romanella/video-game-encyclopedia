{"id": 50511, "slug": "boxed-in", "name": "Boxed In", "name_original": "Boxed In", "description": "Boxed InYou find yourself enclosed in a 'Burtonesque' room with no exits. Colourful cubes move towards you either from the far wall, the ceiling or from beneath your feet. In order to avoid being squashed by the cubes you must clear them by creating matches. Depending on your chosen options, you must either create a run of three or a block of four. When a match is made, the cubes will explode and destroy any others of the same colour touching them. They keep coming, faster and faster. How long will you survive?Game modesYou can select to play in 'Survival' mode where the cubes just keep coming, faster and faster, or 'Solitaire' mode where the room is filled with cubes and you can take your time to clear them. Difficulty is determined by how many different colours of cube you choose to deal with. Three is the easiest and five is the hardest. To make things even harder, you can choose matches to be made by a line of three cubes of the same colour, or a square of four. You must also choose the direction the cubes will approach you from: the back wall, the ceiling, or the floor. In total there are 36 variations of play.VR ControlsUsing the primary controller you have the ability to: change the colour of an existing cube; add a new cube; or push a cube (if it's close to you). The secondary controller allows you to teleport around the room or on to the top of boxes.Non VR ControlsUsing the keyboard &amp; mouse or a controller, you can do all the same things except teleport. Sadly you must move in the old-fashioned \"walking\" type way. You do however have the ability to jump, so there's that. :)ScoringYour aim is to get the highest score you possibly can before you are either crushed by the cubes (in Survival) or you clear the room (in Solitaire). If you remove cubes quickly then you can earn a multiplier allowing you to increase your score rapidly. Your current multiplier is displayed next to your primary controller (in VR) and on the HUD (non VR).LeaderboardsWhat's the point of playing a game if you can't be the best in the world? Each of the 36 game modes has a leaderboard associated with it. Get your name up there!Designed and developed for VRFrom its very conception, 'Boxed In' was designed, developed and optimised for VR. During development, an option was added to play the game using keyboard &amp; mouse or controller. This turned out to be a fun way to play the game and so we decided to release the game for both VR and non-VR play.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T04:21:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7cc/7cc4f785dc50045862efcd42b39789a8.jpg", "website": "http://www.redchaingames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Red Chain Games", "Dennis Mengelt"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Red Chain Games", "Dennis Mengelt"], "esrb_rating": null}
