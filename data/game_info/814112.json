Water is your power, use water to put out the fires.\u00a0 Grab the rain powerup or power jet water bottle to boost your power. But beware, powerups come at a cost too. And be quick, the longer you leave a building on fire, the quicker the building will be destroyed. If all the buildings get brunt down, you loose. Inspired by the old Rampage game but completely reimagined. See how long you can last against the Armageddon of fire!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T09:23:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84c/84cb99a2208e143f923c2e2b964c8e2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Capuman"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
