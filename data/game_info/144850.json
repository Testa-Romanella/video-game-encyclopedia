A alien. The game only has one level, and the objective is to reach the exit.</p>\n<p>I use some sound effects from FreeSound, like the sound of alien. Using Google and a tool called Metaphor Magnet, I discovered that people feel terrified by alien sometimes. So I chose a eerie piece of music from Kevin Macleod's Incompetech website to complement the game's mood.</p>\n<p>Let me know what you think. In future I'll put more levels into my games, and also make the mechanics more interesting.</p>\n<p><strong>Commentary (by Mike)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Quid Pro UFO</strong>\u00a0is a game designed by ANGELINA, an artificially intelligent piece of software designed by me, Michael Cook, an AI and Computational Creativity researcher. Quid Pro UFO was developed by ANGELINA while I was working on the system towards the end of my PhD.</p>\n<p>This era of the software didn't produce very good games, but it did double down on theme, and this game has quite a good one - tense music, weird alien/space vibes, and some unsettling sound effects. It pulls together into quite a good package, even if the game itself is a fairly simple 'maze'.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you'd like to know more about the research I do, or about ANGELINA, or anything related to us, you can find out more at\u00a0http://www.gamesbyangelina.org</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/945/945d02d3d6bc0ec3412fe271cfb069d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Games by ANGELINA"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
