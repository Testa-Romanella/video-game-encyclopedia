Help them and go out into the world to banish Toshimoto!  Travel skillfully with the winds, visit the four temples and bring the artifacts into your possession. But be careful, there are many dangers lurking on your way: you have to stand up to thieves and ghosts, wind dragons corner you and you have to acquire various items to brave all dangers.
