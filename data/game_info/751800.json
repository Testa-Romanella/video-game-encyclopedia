Rules are simple: crush / destroy as many stars as you can by clicking them in groups of the same color (2 or more). Sounds easy? It is! Ain\u2019t this the greatest game ever? We think so :)</p>\n<p>More stars you destroy at once the higher score per star you will get. Group as many stars of the same color together to crush them at the same time to receive highest scores.
