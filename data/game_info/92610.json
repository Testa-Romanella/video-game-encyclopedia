You control Firewing, a dragon tasked with collecting all of the Peace Crystal fragments. To do so will require exploration, collectibles, mini-games, and of course, platforming!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis game was originally started as a side project of mine as I wanted to try recreating a Nintendo 64-style title. It was then left alone for a number of months until one day I decided to adjust the scope of it (or else it likely never would have been finished) to fit in to a single level. This gave me the motivation to finish it (albeit it with basic menus and a very simplistic story) but still deliver that Nintendo 64 feel!\r\n</p><p>\n</p><ul>\n<li>All new (translation: better) textures</li>\n<li>Smoothing groups added to geometry</li>\n<li>The jump height is now dependent on how long the player holds down the jump button</li>\n<li>Player controls were refined to reduce button usage</li>\n<li>The game is now saved after collecting a crystal fragment</li>\n<li>Settings and button mappings are now saved automatically as well</li>\n<li>Added footstep and gliding sounds</li>\n<li>Changed a handful of things in the main level including adding a new type of enemy</li>\n<li>Added the ability to control the camera with the mouse</li>\n<li>Miscellaneous bug fixes</li>\n</ul><p>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Loads of items to collect!</li>\n<li>Large, expansive level with a variety of gameplay!</li>\n<li>Mini-games, which includes kart racing!</li>\n<li>An offering of nostalgia 32/64-bit platforming fans long for!</li>\n</ul><p>\n</p><p>\r\nTwitter: \r\n\t@StudioBesus || Development Blog || IndieDB Page\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c1/8c1d30099ebb2409687569d1016f5d44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 216, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Besus"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
