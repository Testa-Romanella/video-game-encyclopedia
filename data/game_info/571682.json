{"id": 571682, "slug": "super-minecraft-64", "name": "Super Minecraft 64", "name_original": "Super Minecraft 64", "description": "<p>This is a Minecraft fangame with some Super Mario 64 gameplay mechanics made in Unity3D during my free time. No copyright infringement intended, just a fun little hobby project I have been working on.</p>\n<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>\n<p>Basically, collect all 7 diamonds by preforming different tasks in the world to win the game. The true goal is to see how fast you can be the game. I know there are some really good platformer people on the internet, and I cant wait to see the parkour or speed running times you will manage.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Use the WASD keys to move, mouse to rotate camera, and space to jump. Press E to see the diamond hints / tasks.\u00a0For right now, JKL keys change settings until I add proper settings menu to the game. Press R and ESC to reset and close the game respectively. P for pause / settings menu in game.</p>\n<p><strong>Future Development</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Currently, there is only one level which is ripped from the Pack.PNG seed, but if this game gets some love I might add more levels in the future. My schedule can be kind of wacky, so please don't expect regular updating, as this is just a hobby project.</p>\n<p><strong>System Requirements</strong></p>\n<p>Warning, currently a heavily unoptimized game that needs improvement, and a good pc to run. I was able to get a solid 60 FPS with a gaming pc, but really bad FPS on my college laptop. Size is still to be determined. About 36 MB of data space.</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks for playing.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T10:28:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/854/854aa118caa95278138857c29c1cd788.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DevGod2020"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
