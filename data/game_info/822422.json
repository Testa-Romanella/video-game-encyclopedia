{"id": 822422, "slug": "blood-of-the-hydra", "name": "Blood of the Hydra", "name_original": "Blood of the Hydra", "description": "<p>You are a Greek warrior tasked with slaying the mythical Hydra. However, upon facing the beast, you were unable to overcome its awesome might, and with the last shreds of your life left, fled.</p>\n<p>You pleaded with the gods to let them heal your wounds, to which they obliged. However,\u00a0 they were not pleased with your cowardice, and as punishment they healed you by placing a drop of the Hydra's blood within your own. If left unchecked, the blood will consume you as a new Hydra bursts forth from within.<br/></p>\n<p>Now, with the Hydra's blood flowing through your veins, you slowly recover your strength as you fight to slay the beast once more. Can you stay alive long enough to regain your glory and lift the curse?</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>WASD - Move<br/>Left Shift - Run<br/>Left Mouse Button - Attack</p>\n<p>ITEMS:</p>\n<p>Health Potion - A red potion that heals you 10 HP.<br/>Poison Potion - A purple potion that damages you for 5HP, but reduces your healing factor by 0.1 as well.</p>\n<p>(Items are automatically collected when you run into them.)<br/></p>\n<p>GOAL:</p>\n<p>See how high of a level you can beat!</p>\n<p>TIPS:</p>\n<ul><li>The further you delve, the more enemies there are to face, and the stronger they become.</li><li>Balancing your HP and your healing factor is key! Don't be afraid to take damage on purpose if you're healing too much, and watch for poison potions!</li><li>You'll always slash in the direction of your mouse cursor. Try to hit multiple enemies at once!</li><li>The more you get damaged, the faster you'll heal back up, just like the Hydra itself...</li></ul>\n<p>NOTES:</p>\n<p>This game is a proof of concept. Currently, the game is endless and there's no Hydra to slay just yet. How far can you get?</p>\n<p>If you get a high score , let me know on Twitter! I'd love to see how far you get!</p>\n<p>(Made for My First Game Jam Summer 2022!)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T16:02:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c1/6c1584f795b5d34f3a890a329fa22e8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Quippersnapper"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
