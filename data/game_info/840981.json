She has a rocky relationship with her sister, Emily, and wants to stop crime to help others out. Everything is somewhat normal until they meet a strange girl named Leandra who doesn't seem to be from this world...</p>\n<p>This demo sets the stage for gameplay and introduces the characters and their relationships with each other. It is very story and character-based with no open world map. You will be in each area for a certain reason and the story is linear; no chance of getting lost and having no idea what to do next. It also switches perspective to see things from others' point of view.</p>\n<p>Sawyer usually has something to comment on and dialogue/actions will change depending on who is in your party, so check everything twice!</p>\n<p>For the full game, I want to implement a relationship system- choices you make can decide the ending you get; Sawyer can end up with any of the other main characters.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There will also be side quests available each day that are unique and can have certain characters as partners. You will have to solve some sort of crime that can be from fighting enemies to investigating clues.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once Leandra enters the stage, dark things begin happening in the town that can only be described as demonic. She has some sort of connection to everything that is going on and will add dark fantasy elements.\u00a0</p>\n<p>CONTENT WARNING: There are disturbing elements, including foul language, violence, death, abuse, child abuse, depression, etc. It is just as dark as it is light-hearted, and will only get darker the further the story goes.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T07:08:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/576/576f052d82fc31c2e34af19718bcc6e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kiki Cakes"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
