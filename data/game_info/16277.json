Although all information regarding this was classified, the USSR discovered it and in 1976 organized an expedition to explore the wreckage. 2 years later regular flights to the moon had become common and the scientific research center Orbit was built but this information remained classified.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt is now May 2023 and contact with Orbit was lost. The space agency has requested the Junior 2, which was orbiting the moon, to find out the cause. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe lunar module crashes while attempting to land and Gregory Klimov is the only survivor.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs Gregory Klimov, you will be in danger form the cold of outer space. Every breath of oxygen is precious. Every task is fraught with danger. The distraught crew of Orbit are in hiding under its surface. You must find any resources to build equipment.
