Don\u2019t stand still or you will be overrun, find ammo for your more powerful weapons to use them.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>To play: Either download the NodeJS build (for windows) or preferably play the web version!</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>A breakdown:</p>\n<p>All assets outside of UI/SFX/Music used Houdini in some way. All characters/weapons/enemies/collectables/particles were modeled/rigged/animated in Houdini then rendered to pixel art using my Houdini Compositor Pixel art renderer. All of the terrain textures started in Substance Alchemist, went through Houdini to be converted to pixel art, then were brought into Tilesetter to create tilemaps from them.</p>\n<p>For the UI I used Affinity designer, and Construct\u2019s built in tools.</p>\n<p>The music was composed by myself in Fl Studio 20, along with help from Spitfire Orchestral Libraries and Reason Suite as a VST plugin.\r\n</p>\n<p>I did not create the font, the font is one of Kenney\u2019s free assets from https://www.kenney.nl/</p>\n<p>I also did not create the SFX from scratch though I did edit them. I sourced the originals from https://www.zapsplat.com/ (I have a no attribution license for them from ZapSplat Gold, but I thought in spirit of the jam I would make clear the source).</p>\n<p>I included the Houdini HIP files, along with a batch of 20 screenshot (both zip files) of the asset process in Houdini. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-21T04:09:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2a/b2abd6eb9c202f9515d8fff451cca95f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["CillianCreates"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
