The mine in which SCP 6187 is located has been bought by the SCP Foundation and was out of use beforehand.</p>\n<p>Description: SCP 6187 is a mineshaft which is located in a mine near \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in Germany. According to the current measurements no end could be found to the mineshaft which is why researchers suspect that it could be infinite. Furthermore a researcher who wanted to explore the mineshaft before it was bought by the SCP Foundation reported about a creature with glowing red eyes but could not remember the body of SCP 6187-1. Local policeman\u00a0 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 who investigated the mineshaft after the incident reported that he also encountered the creature and was even attacked by the creature. Policeofficer \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 could not remember anything about the appearence of SCP 6187-1 exept the red eyes either. In addition both stated that they heared \u201espooky\" and \u201eabnormal\u201c sounds from within the mineshaft.</p>\n<p>Addendum 1: After examinations through test subject D-1276 there are speculations about SCP 6187-1 only attacking when light by a flashlight is shined on it. Please investigate without a flashlight, because reduction of chance of risk is important for future investigations on SCP 6187-1. Testsubject D-1276 managed to get 2,3 kilometers deep into the mine before he disappeared after a connection loss.</p>\n<p>Addendum 2: Test subject 1277 will be researching about the behavior of SCP 6187-1 as demanded by Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>Addendum 3: Acess denied.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T03:52:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/710/710ee94c81683c928e790b385117c7aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PolygonStudios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
