It's really two different days, one good and one bad. It could be raining, or not raining, or raining dust, but things will happen. You will go places and talk to people and hopefully see your girlfriend.</p>\n<p>Use the arrow keys or WASD to move around. Bump into things to interact with them.\u00a0When presented with a choice, use up and down to pick, and right or space to confirm your choice.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the 2019 Bitsy Secret Santa! I made it for Dino, using the prompts \"rain\" and \"nerves\". I tried to use them at least a bit! I hope you enjoy it Dino!</p>\n<p>This game was made in Bitsy using these hacks: exit from dialogue, transparent sprites, dialogue choices, and character portraits animated. Of note this is one of the few games where I resisted the urge to go ham with the \"edit image from dialogue\" hack.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-27T02:26:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef0/ef047219e03700bc4f941be983b01a9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["caeth"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
