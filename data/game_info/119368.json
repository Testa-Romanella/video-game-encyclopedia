It is recommend to use <strong>Xbox 360 or Xbox One</strong> <strong>controllers</strong> when fighting so you don't want to share a keyboard and because the aiming is more accurate and more intuitive.

We all are either full time students or working full time at a job with other responsibilites for most if not for all of the week so the updates will be few and far between. That being said we have already polished it a bit from when game jam ended and we're re doing the control script as we speak. </li><li><strong>We love comments!</strong> So please if you want to say something say it!
