If someone doesn't do something quick, those bombs will go off and cause a massive cave in, right below NYC!</p>\n<p>Jim grabs his old rusty\u00a0hunting gun (he's never been one for hunting) and gets to work. He can't just let the city crumble \u2014today, he puts everything on the line to save what he loves and do his duty.\u00a0Today, he becomes a hero.</p>\n<p>\u00a0This game was my first game jam game, and it was a tiring blast to make (made in 2 days and one night)!
