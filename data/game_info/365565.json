These bigger enemies only spawn after you've bought at least one upgrade. Upgrades are purchased by visiting a solar system and spending scraps from enemies. Exiting the shop menu will heal you and destroy the system.</p>\n<p><strong>Other controls:\u00a0</strong>To use the shop, click on an item you wish to buy, and then click on what slot you want to place it in. You can also click on items you own to sell them for some extra scraps. While listed, most people don't realize you can also use &lt; and &gt; to rotate the guns, and its a lot easier than Q and E.</p>\n<p><strong>Few known bugs:</strong>\u00a0When entering a shop, you might be charged again for your last purchase, so don't shop excessively. Very very rare, but you may become unable to shoot, in which case please restart.</p>\n<p>This is a reupload for the artist's portfolio.
