{"id": 292106, "slug": "ufactory", "name": "uFactory", "name_original": "uFactory", "description": "uFactory is a strategic factory building game where efficiency is king.  Enclosed in a small building with limited capital, can you produce more product than any other?  Use a variety of different contraptions, conveyor belts, mechanical arms, and more to create your very own factory how you want to build it.  There are many roads to success in uFactory, but only the best can figure out how to eek out that last bit of performance to lead the pack.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nuFactory is still in an early alpha state.  This means that all of the core features are in the game, but the content is still being actively developed.  Expect to see many more new products, materials, machines, and subsystems in the coming months.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:48:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc7/cc7f0799e08fb40ad0c803c15cddda17.jpg", "website": "http://www.ufactorygame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 5, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 22, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 193, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lucid Silence Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Lucid Silence Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
