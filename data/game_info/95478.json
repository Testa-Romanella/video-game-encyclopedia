The original 7DRL version is left available for the curious.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e4/7e44c237bd9b38adae5844038be6c72c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["PNJeffries"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
