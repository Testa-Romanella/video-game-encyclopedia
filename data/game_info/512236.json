One day they were forced to break out of that routine when a catastrophic event hit now known as the great flood. Overflowing towns, spilling through homes, scattering the truth of all life that existed before; forcing these people to adapt, survive, and overcome! With this new life style came new skills; weapon making, exploring and inventing and with these new innovative minds Zenith Falls has a chance to be flourishing as it once was.</p>\n<p>Help restore Zenith Falls by exploring, finding the truth, inventing , adapting and becoming a Great Voyager!</p>\n<p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong><br/>Zenith Falls is a multiplayer (16 lobby) MMO, Hack and Slash, Exploration game where players take on the role of new age explorers, traveling by the use of airships around a sunken world, forced to gather artifacts from towers left by unknown origins that are known as the \"Lunar Towers\".\u00a0 Alone or with a team travel the sunken world to uncover new gear, attack other players, uncover secret knowledge or start a new land!</p>\n<p>Players start off in Lunar City, a branched off community of survivors that live on the tallest of the Lunar Towers, though the city is small it has become a safe haven for survivors around the sunken world.</p>\n<p><strong>KEY FEATURES:</strong><br/>\u2022 Air Travel<br/>Lunar City offers a few ways to start off traveling to other that can be found by climbing up the two ladders, on the right you will find hovercraft's which are free driven to any destination, on the left you will find an airship with a pilot waiting for someone to start flight.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Customization<br/>You character design, weapons, skills and aura color are all customizable to make you stand out more than other players.
