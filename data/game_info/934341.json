One day he wakes up in a strange dream (or nightmare) in a place only known as dreamland. Inside a dark and eerie house, Aaron is unsettled. Help Aaron find paradise, by going through portals sending him to areas of increasing aesthetic pleasure (Aaron's aesthetic preferences). Try to understand your character, Aaron, as you might wonder what landscape art he might like. Each portal has an image of where Aaron is teleporting to in a maze-like fashion. Later areas have increasing aesthetic pleasure to Aaron. After finishing all levels, Aaron will have reached paradise in dreamland (assuming he has no way to escape dreamland).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T16:58:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac3/ac30ef126ea878d4ed369fb9acf4a3e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["kspecific"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
