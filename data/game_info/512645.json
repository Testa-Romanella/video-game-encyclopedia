Jokes aside, part of me is still very proud of making these games, despite their flaws, both technical and in their core design, and if you can look past the fuckery of the old ass engine i used to make them, if you can enjoy at least a tiny bit of what i'm offering here, then it'll all be worth it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Have a good day.</p>\n<p>-Nukadamo</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T06:15:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6b/c6b80f1f7b6ee13d6bd457dafab42183.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nuskadamo"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
