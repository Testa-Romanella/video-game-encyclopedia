Let's release a rage virus and make it worse.</p>\n<p>This is a\u00a0<strong>Fast</strong> <em>(Really ?)</em> <strong>Action-Packed\u00a0Shooter\u00a0</strong>game that will make you dive back to the 90s and 00s games. Based on a small core logic, this game is made in 48 hours.</p>\n<p>There is a virus outbreak that is <strong>OUT OF CONTROL</strong>. Wait a sec, there's more to it. Just PLAY THE GAME and DO SHARE YOUR SCORES TO EVERYONE.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS-</strong></p>\n<p>WASD - movement keys</p>\n<p>Right Click - shoots bullets</p>\n<p>Left Click - shoots grenades</p>\n<p>That's it. Use your ammunition very carefully. You die mostly because of your *noob skills* <em>(just kidding) </em>or \"NO AMMO\" banner in front of your eyes.</p>\n<p>PS - I know there is no Web version\u00a0for this game. I don't know why, but god wasn't in my favour when I built for WebGL. I tried for 6 hrs to fix the bugs and make it\u00a0build but sadly, it was not enough. So, <strong>DOWNLOAD THE GAME AND PLAY IT.</strong> Don't ignore this page because of the invisible Web version.</p>\n<p>If you're still reading this, Thank you for your patience.\u00a0</p><p>DO RATE MY GAME HERE -\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2020/rate/697927</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T09:48:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/778/778340dd9e09f318e2c358b7a276d777.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sashbros Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
