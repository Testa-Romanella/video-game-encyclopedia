{"id": 438614, "slug": "zombie-hunters", "name": "Zombie Hunters", "name_original": "Zombie Hunters", "description": "<p>Zombie Hunters is an enhanced version of Zombie Zone. It tells the story of the cowboy-hat-wearing, samurai-sword-wielding girl Aya, who is on a quest for revenge against her own sister.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is the same as in the original game, but there are two more new playable characters. One is available from the beginning; her name is Riho Futaba, and she is not related to Aya&#39;s story. She wears a blue bikini, shoes on high heels, and a deadly look of vengeance. The differences between her and Aya are purely cosmetic; Riho has exactly the same moves, and goes through exactly the same levels. At the beginning of each level, you can choose whether to play as Aya or as Riho. The second character becomes unlockable during the game: this is Makoto, Riho&#39;s younger sister.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2005-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-18T07:44:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d9e/d9e4c998ce06edb4413817bc054b092d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 10, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Tamsoft"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["D3 Publisher"], "esrb_rating": null}
