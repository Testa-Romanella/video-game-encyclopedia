{"id": 53993, "slug": "pipe-mania-1989", "name": "Pipe Mania (1989)", "name_original": "Pipe Mania (1989)", "description": "<p>Pipe Mania is a puzzle game developed in 1989 by The Assembly Line for the Amiga. It was ported to several other platforms by Lucasfilm Games, who gave it the name Pipe Dream and acted as general distributors for the US. In this game, the player must connect randomly appearing pieces of pipe on a grid to a given length within a limited time.<br />\nThe Windows version of the game was included in the MS Windows Entertainment Pack. In 1990, it was released as an arcade game by Japanese manufacturer Video System Co. Ltd., though with slightly altered gameplay, giving the player the task to connect a source and drain with the random pipe pieces.<br />\nLong after its initial release, the Pipe Mania concept re-emerged as a minigame representing hacking or security system bypassing in larger video games.<br />\nPipe Mania has similarities to Konami&#39;s 1982 arcade game Loco-Motion: objects slowly move across a grid of tiles that make up a path which the player must continually adjust.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1989-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-13T09:53:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/86a/86af4a8f168782e2fbef5509fad6a13a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 4, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "Atari ST", "Game Boy", "Classic Macintosh", "NES"], "developers": ["The Assembly Line"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["LucasArts Entertainment", "Empire Interactive", "Lucasfilm Games", "Video System"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
