The opposing team touching the ball will result in failure. This is also the case if the ball goes out of play.</p><p>There are three different game modes, all varying in playstyles and requirements, providing unique and challenging gameplay - this with the inclusion of varying difficulties.</p><p>This is by all means a game for everyone, you do not need to be a football fan, or even a sports fan to enjoy Football Gauntlet. Hopefully you will give it a try and have an enjoyable experience!</p><p>Lastly, ALL feedback is very much appreciated.
