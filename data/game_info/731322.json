Just take a look at any social network to see how dogs and cats control the human mind with things like 'cuteness'. This game is a simulation of what would happen if God forgot to control nature for a moment and a carnivorous plant took advantage of it to start it's plans to conquer the world.<br/></p>\n<p>I can't put the simulator tag to this game since it hasn't been scientifically proven that carnivorous plants behave this way; but to that i say that it hasn't been proven YET.</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS:<br/>-Right-Click: The plant will attack the position where the mouse is located when you press it<br/>-G: When you have enough points you can press G to make the plant grow, a.k.a. go to the next level.</p>\n\n<p>RAMBLING:<br/>Anyways, this was made for My First Game Jam 2022. I participated in the previous Jam and, like last time, this game has no audio. But, unlike last time, i actually attempted to make the audio for the game. Sadly i discovered that you need more than a day and 2 functioning brain cells to make it, and that's all i had by the end of the game jam. Maybe some day i'll do it, but who knows.</p>\n<p>Thanks for coming to see my game!</p>\n<p>'Till next time, friendly stranger ;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T11:17:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a20/a20309b07b09b76663746b818e681e1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JJ_anomalies"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
