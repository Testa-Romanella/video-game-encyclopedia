You start as Iruq, the son of the Lord of Death, Exitium.\u00a0Exitium holds dominion over this realm, and, as your father, he asks your assistance in preventing an invasion. You set out to fulfill his request, collecting wanton souls and becoming more powerful\u00a0along the way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0You must fight your way through a randomly generated sequence of rooms, purchasing upgrades with the soul fragments you gather from enemies. At the end of each region , you will fight a boss who will grant you access to the next region upon their defeat. You may also find \"Shards\" during your runs, which can be used outside of runs to permanently upgrade your abilities\u00a0(NOTE: There is only one region as of alpha build v0.3.0; the remaining three will be added in the time between the alpha release and v1.0.0).</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0IMPORTANT:\u00a0</strong>The options necessary to change controls/view keybindings will not be in the game for another week or so. In the meantime, here are the default controls:\u00a0<strong>Movement| WASD; Attack| LMB; Dash| Space; Interact| E; Pause| Esc.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0This game has been in development for roughly a year, and I expect it will take me another 6 or 7 months to get to a 1.0.0 release. This game is currently in its Alpha phase, and that means that buying it comes with a risk. Please understand that this is not a complete game, and should not be treated as such. I am using placeholder art, sounds, and even some major gameplay elements are subject to change.\u00a0 This does not mean that you can't criticize me, but there are some things that I am already planning on changing and do not need to be told about (see paragraph below).</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If you want the immediate details of what is to come within the next month(Jul 2022), continue reading below.\u00a0<strong>I am adding/doing:</strong> || More options and better option control, including keybindings; adjusting enemy movement, enemy spawns, enemy attack patterns; a new enemy type for the caves region;\u00a0implementing primary and special effects (more upgrade options, effectively); likely a couple characters; specific colors for the type of attack that an enemy is charging; cleaning up textures and tiles for the staging ground room; a delete function for save files; allowing player to skip upgrades;\u00a0 a few additional meta progression options;\u00a0and many, many bug fixes. ||</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I'll reiterate; this is not a completed game, and it is the first one I have ever published, which makes each purchase that much more impactful. With each one, I will be a little more capable of making this a game worth playing. Thank you, and I hope you enjoy my creation :). Tweet me your feedback @EliasPippenger.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 P.S. There is a demo version available for free. At the time of 6/26/2022, the paid and free\u00a0versions are exactly the same. The reason the paid version exists is because those who buy the game will receive all future updates for free, including the update to 1.0.0, which might be a more expensive version of the game upon its release.\u00a0The demo content likely will not change other than bug fixes or quality of life improvements.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T06:52:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aba/abad8a8f9d4a02f5e047bc6c85fcba7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Elias Pippenger"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
