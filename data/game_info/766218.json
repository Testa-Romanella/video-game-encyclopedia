It involves stealth, mind games, and atomic weapons. It is a 2 player game meant to be played on separate devices.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0You play as either BLU or RED and your mission is to score 5 points. To score a point, you must either collect bait or nuke your opponents. Every round, you and your opponent select an action (either <em>move </em>or <em>nuke</em>) and they both get executed simultaneously. The thing is, you cannot see where your opponent is located unless they are close by, collected bait, or tried to nuke you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T14:43:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b2/4b2adfe93282f08f4989eed73377d953.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["fbd117"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
