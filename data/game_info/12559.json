In order to master the game, the player is mastering life science principles. <br/><br/>The ecosystem begins with producers, plants that are the basis of each biome, with plants regenerate leaves that are eaten by animals (depending on how healthy they are). The plants have vegetative, flowering, and/or fruiting reproduction cycles, including a need for pollinators in order to successfully pass through the blooming phase, and animals must eat fruit in order for the most possible amount of seeds to germinate and begin. Next come the consumers: herbivores, insectivores, predators, scavengers, and omnivores. <br/><br/>These animals live and breed in territories over time, eating their appropriate food, and in many cases becoming food. Some plants and animals are poisonous or tough (like tortoises), limiting which animals can eat them! In addition to managing all this over many different species, each plant and animal creates detritus over time, and decomposers must be used in order to complete the cycle of life! If detritus builds up, poop, bones, and debris will begin to appear in your ecosystem and the health of everything in it will be reduced.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:13:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ea/2ea58af008bc6a32ad492b4a3a4b3ae1.jpg", "website": "http://tyto-online.com/ecology/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 19, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 38, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 305, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Immersed Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Immersed Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
