My daughter contributed a couple of different clouds to the game so don't mind the pink and black falling \"Clouds\".</p>\n<p>Avoid the branches by moving side to side or activating your shield. Go as far as you can without popping. Your shield starts to replenish very slowly over time after about 3 seconds of not activating it. The game difficulty increases over time by increasing the speed at which you ascend very slowly.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Left Arrow = Left</p>\n<p>Right Arrow = Right</p>\n<p>Spacebar = Toggle shield on and off</p>\n<p>P = Pause</p><p>R = Restart</p>\n<p>Escape = Title screen (Escape again to end game)</p>\n<p>*If you have a touch screen or want to use your mouse you can click the \"M\" key on your keyboard and it will activate your mouse. Meaning the balloon will follow your mouse on the screen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T06:21:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4aa/4aa23c16f33b3788a7d79e477ea35f87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cross Gen Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
