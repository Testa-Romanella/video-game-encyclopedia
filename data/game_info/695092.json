It does not care whether you are a saint or a villain. Either way the sun will rise every morning and shine light on the world you live in. The universe will not be changed via a good deed or a bad one, but it can be altered by the powerful. Power is all that matters no matter the means of getting it. Whether you buy your way to god-hood or earn it, does not matter, as long as you get there. Will you be a speck of sand in the vast beach of the universe, never changing the course of history? Or will you be an ember floating on the wind, a victim of the horrors reality has in store for you? Or will you rise to the top, above all else by whatever means necessary and become a Fleck of Greatness?</p>\n\n<p>This game is just a demo for a project I'd like to work on. The demo comes in a zip file so you have to extract the files contents and go into the folder and find the .exe file named \"a fleck of greatness\", but keep it in the file other wise the game won't run.</p>\n\n<p>I'd love to work on this game more in the future, making my own tile sets and adding an abundance of original characters, but I've enlisted into the USMC and will be in bootcamp for the next three months, and after that I imagine I won't have that much free time, but this will be something I hopefully can work on. It has definitely been a great help calming my nerves about joining the military and I don't want to abandoned it. Hope you like it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-15T06:37:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a8/7a82160447036d2a894a1c24d939b28f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jred9801"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
