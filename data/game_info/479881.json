Right now there's none of that though lol</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T03:13:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e6/1e6c549b84bed34447d60bec31baba55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sharkwithlasers"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
