Kill as many enemies until you run out of time.</p>\n\n<p>Code description</p>\n<p>----------------</p>\n<p>Moving enemies is done by calling kernel routine (59749) which is used to inject empty line during typing in commands from the keyboard</p>\n<p>(because a single line of code takes two lines on the screen). This routine moves down all lines below an injected line.</p>\n<p>With a little hack, it is possible to use this and produce a constant scrolling-down effect.</p>\n\n<p>Line by line code overview</p>\n<p>----------------</p>\n<p>- Line 0:</p>\n<p> - Clear the screen and initialise variables used in the game</p>\n<p>- Line 1:</p>\n<p> - Initialise kernel scroll-down routine</p>\n<p> - Print \"Score\" on the screen</p>\n<p> - Initialise some additional variables</p>\n<p>- Line 2:</p>\n<p> - Create a new enemy at a random x position in the third line on the screen.</p>\n<p> - Delete the shot on the screen</p>\n<p>- Line 3:</p>\n<p> - Call kernel routine to scroll down the screen</p>\n<p> - Recreate ship on his current position on the screen</p>\n<p> - Recreate a shot on his current position on the screen</p>\n<p>- Line 4:</p>\n<p> - Check if the shot hit an enemy, if so then jump to line 7</p>\n<p> - Increment the timer</p>\n<p> - Check if the enemy hit the ship, if so print \"game over\" and end the game</p>\n<p>- Line 5:</p>\n<p> - Read the keyboard</p>\n<p> - Set the direction of the ship according to keys '1' and '9'</p>\n<p> - Change ship direction if it hits the borders of the screen</p>\n<p>- Line 6:</p>\n<p> - Check if the player pressed '8' to fire a shot or if shooting is in progress.</p>\n<p> - If there is no shot fired then jump to line 9</p>\n<p> - Else delete the old shot position on the screen.</p>\n<p>- Line 7:</p>\n<p> - Display the new shot position on the screen</p>\n<p> - If a shot hit an enemy then delete that enemy\u00a0</p>\n<p> - Delete the shot and cancel the shooting process</p>\n<p> - Print a new score on the screen</p>\n<p>- Line 8:</p>\n<p> - If the shot reached the top of the screen then delete it\u00a0</p>\n<p> - Cancel the shooting process</p>\n<p>- Line 9:</p>\n<p> - Increment position of the ship</p>\n<p> - Clear the old ship position and display it on the new position</p>\n<p> - If the timer did not reach the end then jump to line 2</p>\n<p> - Else print \"time out\" and end the game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T11:40:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42e/42ebbcc0d99a1093340bb6b655ea7774.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BASIC 10Liner"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
