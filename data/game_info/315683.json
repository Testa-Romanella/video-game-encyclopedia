I create a super-hexagon clone, changing the chosen theme for something a little bit different - your life is (con)currency. In computer science, <strong>concurrency</strong> refers to the ability of different parts of a program or algorithm to be executed in partial order, without affecting the final outcome. In my project there is only code - some procedural generation for shapes and stripes - <strong>no sprite, no prefab, no physics, no implicite value</strong> (excepted a radius PI). I optimized each part of code so as to reach the lowest execution using a simple (but efficient) pooling system and an improved implementation of coroutine. Also I use a leaderboard on-line so as to save best scores. This way all players can rival with others. Of course, like in the original game, the main gameplay is really really hard, but with training you can reach some good score and skill.
