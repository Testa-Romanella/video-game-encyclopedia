Pollution ruins the city day by day. Your name is Raphael, You are a feared thief, but you got caught. As punishment you are to be thrown into a shit stained, mostly toxic sewer system, but they threw you into the wrong one and didn't notice. You were thrown into a sewer that hasn't been used for a really long time and you come to notice that you weren't the first that had been there.</p>\n\n\n<p>we are a small team of 5 that had really no clue how to make a game. We had 2 weeks and 1 extra week, but we worked for 2 weeks only. This is out first game and sadly we couldn't finish it in time. We might update the game and finish it, but we'll see. i\u00a0wouldn't get my hopes up. We are students at StadinAmmattiOpisto in Helsinki Finland and this was our first video game project so far.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T06:21:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb5/bb5859cde02806ac95acb2b42c6ca756.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LikeAardvark"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
