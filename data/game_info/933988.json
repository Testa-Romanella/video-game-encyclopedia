To do so, you can setup towers to stop them dead on their tracks!\r\nHow to play: Stop enemies from reaching the end of the level by constructing towers. Press on the white squares (fundations) to open the tower selection menu. Choose a tower and if you got enough gold, you will build it. Towers attack enemies on their own.
