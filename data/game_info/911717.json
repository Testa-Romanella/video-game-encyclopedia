(I was on a deadline, sorry)</p>\n<p>- Removal of the limited lives, instead replaced with a per-level count of how many tries it takes players to complete, with an overview and total presented upon completing the game. Go for a low score!</p>\n<p>- Level select and debug codes (Down/Up 5x on title screen)</p>\n<p><strong>Note on the intended music:</strong> I did not have the time to try and convert the C64 music track to Pico-8 format, so the game has no music. However, for the full experience I did record the audio from the C64 game to play in the background. Go ahead and loop this if playing a non-web version.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T07:08:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f1/8f13fd9a10907e167a4036ea16957e20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Dr. Dos"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
