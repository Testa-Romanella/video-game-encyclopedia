This means that\u00a0<strong>you may not be able to plug the injury</strong>, but you can still play around making clots and raising your score.\u00a0Fixed\u00a0(see\u00a0devlog)</li><li>Clicking to make connections can be tricky, especially in a crowded space. If it doesn't work the first time, try again.\r\n</li></ul>\r\nCredits:<p>This was a solo jam entry created in 3 days. Art was made by me with exceptions noted (certain UI elements).
