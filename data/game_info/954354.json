{"id": 954354, "slug": "horologia", "name": "HOROLOGIA", "name_original": "HOROLOGIA", "description": "Aboard Station Mendacia, idling his days away is the station's sole human occupant for the past five years \u2013 maintenance man Joshua. Joshua\u2019s sole responsibility on the massive station is its maintenance and upkeep \u2013 not a terribly Herculean feat since Mendacia is almost entirely run by its impeccable artificial intelligence, SAM.\u00a0<br/><br/>When Mendacia passes by the black hole Pantagruel, gravity fluctuations cause a minor maintenance issue that Joshua must fix - but the choices he makes along the way prove to have strange consequences.<br/><br/>What is the truth behind Station Mendacia?  What secrets is SAM hiding?\u00a0And can Joshua ultimately separate reality from fiction?\r\n\n<p>HOROLOGIA is a story\u00a0of the hero's journey, where each end strives to encompass a different stage of the\u00a0monomyth - from the call to adventure to the journey's nadir, and finally to the return with the\u00a0elixir. Its narrative is heavily inspired by a myriad of cultural media, chief among which are films such as\u00a0<em>The Matrix</em>, and games such as\u00a0<em>The Stanley Parable</em>.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, however, HOROLOGIA is a metaphor\u00a0for ourselves as readers, and our relationship with the narrative presently unfolding wherein Joshua and SAM serve as foils for both the reader and the author. Does the way the reader\u00a0interacts with the story influence\u00a0the way in which the narrative is told? Or does the narrative march inexorably forward regardless of the reader? HOROLOGIA endeavors to be an\u00a0exploration of these musings.</p>\n\n<p>Created in partial fulfillment of NM4231 Digital Media\u00a0Storytelling Strategies.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Ms Sarah-Tabea Sammel.<br/></p>\n<p>An interactive fiction story created\u00a0as part of Communications and New Media studies.</p>\n<p>CNM Department, National University of Singapore</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T07:10:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db7/db7dbe7e52d170c3e7c66470fadc73b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["shaunays"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
