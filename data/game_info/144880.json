(The theme was \"A small world\".)\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis is a fight to the death for two pixels trapped in a 640x200 CGA world. The first pixel to shrink to zero pixels is the winner, or the first pixel to grow to 200 pixels is the loser.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tListen for clues. If you hear \"up\", you'll want to bounce off the top wall to shrink in size. Be careful though - every time you bang into the wrong wall, you'll grow.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe game is open source at https://github.com/leereilly/PIXEL-DUEL. Pull requests are welcome if you'd like to make it better. Can't really get any worse!  \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Pixel 1 controls:</strong><br/>\n</p><ul>\n<li><strong>W</strong> - move forward (guess which way forward is)</li>\n<li><strong>A </strong>- rotate clockwise</li>\n<li><strong>D </strong>- rotate anti-clockwise<br/>\n</li>\n</ul><p>\n<strong>Pixel 2 controls:</strong>\n</p><ul>\n<li><strong>\u2191</strong> - move forward (guess which way forward is)</li>\n<li><strong>\u2190 </strong>- rotate clockwise</li>\n<li><strong>\u2192 </strong>- rotate anti-clockwise</li>\n</ul><p>\n<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/507/507cfee37fbec06d3c86c5b75a1dbc44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lee Reilly"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
