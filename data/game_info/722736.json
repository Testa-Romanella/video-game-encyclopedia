There are random effects that occur as you progress levels and click.</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<p> - You left click the color boxes to select a color and left click in the gray rectangle at the top to drop</p>\n<p> - You need to fill the bucket with the same color as as the bucket to 100% to continue</p>\n<p> - The vertical bar on the left is your bucket progress and the bar on the right is your level progress</p>\n<p>No time for a title screen, options, audio, scoring system (number of clicks), polish, or ending. The game restarts at the end.</p>\n<p>Things I learned in the jam:</p>\n<p> - First time playing around with physics particles</p>\n<p> - Finally learned how to lerp (still a lot more to learn)</p>\n<p> - I now know more about how GMS2 handles color than I want to, but I had fun making the color matching algorithm</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T03:34:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2c/a2c5143379e6d8f9f1a2e442034871c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thebooksnail"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
