New levels, new puzzle mechanics and added motion controls in select levels. Solve puzzles with time limits in 120 exciting levels over 6 different level packs. Improve your scores by finishing levels faster than the target time.</p>\n<p>This PS Vita Homebrew needs\u00a0Henkaku\u00a0installed, depending on your firmware version (see\u00a0vita.hacks.guide for versions up to and including\u00a03.68, and\u00a0Trinity\u00a0for versions\u00a03.69 and 3.70 -- video tutorial) you should be able to install VitaShell and then copy the VPK using FTP or USB, and install it via VitaShell. This game uses touchscreen controls for the most part, and in later levels accelerometer\u00a0(motion sensors).</p>\n<p>This is a homebrew game created with the Vita SDK, and NOT an official PS Vita release.</p>\n<p>Note that while PS TV (Vita TV) support isn't explicitly disabled, this game relies on touch input and motion sensors, so practically it doesn't really work there.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T09:16:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1fe/1fec39bef25093ab5b878aaf40409a7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thp"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
