It may not be as easy as it sounds - some levels are bigger than other ones and the trick is to calculate the line in such way that it crosses each platform point. As the levels go further, they become harder and get bigger panels to start with.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBigger boards mean bigger challenge! Good luck, connect them all!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9aa/9aa9eb02695c5cc0a7d9221d4e80b064.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pixberry Studios"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Silicon Echo", "Pixberry Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
