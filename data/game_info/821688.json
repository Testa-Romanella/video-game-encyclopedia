However, the magician has completely different plans - he decides to take revenge on the goblins for killing civilians? But how will this confrontation end?..</em></p>\n<p>This game is VERY fast, and I tried to squeeze everything out of this concept. Kills give a shield for 1 second, so it's better to kill enemies in packs. When the lives end, all those killed earlier are resurrected, and you are carried to the beginning of the level. Green checkpoints make up for lives, it's better to touch them! Kill all the goblins and find the descent! Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T10:30:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/038/038dcf6d59647ba8a2c7e32c066ea986.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["chigun"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
