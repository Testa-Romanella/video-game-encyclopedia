You need to keep the citizens of Cube City safe while keeping up-to-date on your paperwork.</p>\n<p>On the right side of your screen is your office - you need to stamp paperwork that your <em>very angry </em>boss dumps on your desk.</p>\n<p>On the left side of the screen is the view out your window. Yellow civilians walk back and forth, but red robbers will try to kill them! Click the window to fly out, move around with WASD, and left click to attack nearby robbers. Once you've beaten up the active robbers, fly onto your window to get back into the building.</p>\n<p>If civilians die, you lose points. You gain points by beating up robbers and stamping paperwork.</p>\n<p><strong>Why is the leaderboard broken?<br/></strong></p>\n<p>lol blame @MathiasHareide.</p>\n<p><strong>Why does the camera go to a duplicate office if I go to main menu and try to play again?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>lol blame @BenjaminBergseth</p>\n<p><strong>Oh yeah - don't press quit.
