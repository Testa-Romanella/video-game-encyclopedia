(you need one in order to play this, sorry...)<br/>\u00a0 - line by line, shift by shift, you need to make more full squares than your opponent (friend).<br/>\u00a0 - BUT your opponent (friend) have the same objective...<br/>\u00a0 - in the end, who have made more squares, of course, wins.<br/>\u00a0 - if you made a full square, it's your turn again.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\n\"why i'ts so ugly?\"\r\n<p>In my defense:\u00a0IT'S A PROTOTYPE. PLEASE, DON'T BE SO MEAN.</p>\r\nwhy this old game?\r\n<p>yesterday, one of my teachers couldn't go to the class, so we got a 90 minutes of free time.<br/></p>\n<p>my friend ana and\u00a0 me were thinking about playing something, but not as always, like online games and stuff.<br/>so we end up playing tic tac toe...<br/>suddently, one of my friends/classmate came to our table and literally drawed a hundred dots in my sketchbook, ten by ten and sayed: \"line by line, don't let the other make a square... go!\"</p>\r\nas you can see...\r\n<p>\u00a0 i love it. (ana won, but we don't need to talk about that...)</p>\r\np5.js\r\n<p>\u00a0 i used p5.js library to draw everyting related to the board in a canvas.</p>\r\nbig shoutout to:\r\n<p>\u00a0 Ana Liriel.<br/>\u00a0 Thiago Mazzoni.</p>\r\nand sorry for my bad english :c\r\n<p>love you guys.</p>\n<p>~ Break.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T02:17:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a08/a08278c937d1bd879ec2e2d2b54fa0b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["break plays"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
