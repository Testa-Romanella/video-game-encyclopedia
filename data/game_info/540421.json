Also, I kinda cheated and made it for three. Last august me and 3 friends went to the top of a little mountain called Monte Neme to see the Perseids (meteor shower that takes place every year during summer). It was a very chill moment that I remember fondly so I wanted to relive it with this little game. You can catch as many shooting stars as you want, the game has no ending \ud83c\udf0c</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<p>Theme music:\u00a0The End- EVA</p>\n<p>SFX:\u00a0Northeast Bling by tripjazz</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T04:29:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d4/2d437d3600c54ca8acb96bbddef5f742.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sara P.
