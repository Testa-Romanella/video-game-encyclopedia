It let's a team play against itself to get better.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The objective is to get interesting results by tweaking the settings.\u00a0 The settings include:</p>\n<p>team (angle, distance, direction) - Whether each player receives the relative angle, distance or direction\u00a0of a team member.</p>\n<p>opp (angle, distance, direction) - Same as above, but for opponent team members.</p>\n<p>Nearest\u00a0 (opp / team) inputs - Receive above information about the (n) nearest (opponent) team members.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fixed (opp/ team) inputs - same as above but from (n) fixed players</p>\n<p>ball (angle, distance, direction) - Relative angle, distance or direction of the ball.</p>\n<p>(own/opp) goal (angle, distance) - Relative angle or distance to the goal of a players own/opponents team.</p>\n<p>field edge (angle, distance) - Relative angle or distance to the edge of the field.</p>\n<p>cutoff - Maximum distance for which the player receives inputs. If a player/ball/goal/edge is outside of this distance, the input is set to 0.</p>\n<p>hidden layers - Number of hidden layers in the neural network. More than 3 rarely works.</p>\n<p>layer size - Number of neurons in a hidden layer.</p>\n<p>genes per team - Amount of different players. This rarely works as you would like. But is still interesting sometimes.</p>\n<p>adaptation - If enabled, the Evolution Strategies algorithm uses an adaptation vector to update parameters. Not really interesting.</p>\n<p>adaptation vector - Mutation rate.</p>\n<p>rounds - Amount of rounds a team must play to win. So the amount of games in a tournament is 2^rounds.</p>\n<p>tournaments - Amount of tournaments per generation.</p>\n<p>A good way to train team is by setting the game duration to 5 seconds. Then setting the speed to x1024 and press R. When they can find the ball, increase the game duration. This leads to pretty good results within minutes.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24c/24c4e9ff9071045442cb6221583e61fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["buddhaman"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
