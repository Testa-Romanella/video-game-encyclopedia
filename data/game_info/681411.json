A vicious creature called Final has ripped his heart where he stored all the power he used to create that world.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSix creatures, both from our world and the other one, chase this monster to steal the heart for their own purposes, since it's told that the bearer of the heart will weild an enormous power.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game was all made by 1 person (Andr\u00e9s Borghi) through 7 years of hard work, including graphics, programming, story, music, sound and pretty much everything. This new release celebrates the 10 year aniversary, updating the game to modern specs and with visual and audio improvements.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you enjoy pixelated blood, fluid gameplay in Capcom style, combos, tragic and epic music, weird pictoric landscapes and complex storytelling this is the game for you!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T02:29:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/568/568919969646a1319a5aaee28690a41b.jpg", "website": "http://theblackheart.com.ar/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 30, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 411, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Andr\u00e9s Borghi"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Saibot Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
