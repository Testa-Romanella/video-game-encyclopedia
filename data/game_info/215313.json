You start big, and want to shrink in order to achieve that. There's several element that will help you, or not, in this quest.</p>\n<p>This game has been made for the GMTK Jam 2018. The theme was \"GENRE, but you can\u2019t MECHANIC.\". I followed this theme, by reimagining the classic game, <strong>Snake, but can't win by growing. So you have to shrink, in order to win.</strong></p>\n<p>You can move using the arrow keys, and restart with the 'R' key. You can exit the game by pressing the 'Escape\" key. There's a total of 5 levels, these levels are not perfect, but are here to show the potential of the mechanism. I hope you'll enjoy them ;)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b8/9b854590b67591320c1c8e1c80647366.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lucas Delvallet"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
