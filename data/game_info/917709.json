However, she accidentally fell asleep in the classroom. It was already late at night when she woke up, and she could barely see anything. Luckily, she had a torchlight with her and found some spare batteries on the classroom table. Akaya then tried to leave the school through the main entrance. However, the entrance door is locked, and a key is needed to escape the school. At the same time, the footsteps nearby echoed in the corridor... <br/><br/>Who was the one on the other side? Will Ayaka be able to return home safely?</p>\r\n[Patch Notes]\r\n\r\n//-------------------------------//\r\n= v1.5.2 = [27/01/2023] =\r\n//-------------------------------//\r\n1.
