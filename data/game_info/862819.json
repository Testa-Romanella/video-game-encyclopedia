You don't have long to memorise their positions so make sure you have a keen eye. After the lightning has struck you have until the next strike to click on the windows and door to\u00a0choose which entrances they are coming for.

You can hear the trees outside as the gusts of wind violently shake the branches.</p><p>The floor beneath you starts to tremble with an unnatural rhythm. You can hear rain and hail starting to slam the metal sheeting of your roof. This doesn't feel right.</p><p>*Thud*...... *Thud*..... *Thud</p><p>3 slow but hard knocks against the kitchen window startle you. You've lived on your own long enough to know that sound was not a friendly neighbour.
