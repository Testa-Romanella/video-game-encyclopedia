I had done smaller projects, but had lacked the motivation to work on any big\u00a0game project. I often make games with simplistic stories, but sometimes go in over my head when making the game.\u00a0Then, one night in January\u00a0I realized something: What if I did a bunch of small projects, stories I constantly made in my head,\u00a0and put them together?\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Thus, this silly, somewhat unoriginal,\u00a0tiring project began. Starting on February 2021, I\u00a0had from the beginning of the month till 11:59 PM before the next month to finish the project I\u00a0was working on.\u00a0 And then do the same thing from March all the way to December.\u00a0 Now that its 2022, I\u00a0want to share this project. I do want to say this though:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>All of these games are bad.</strong></li><li><strong>Some of these games have bugs I\u00a0couldn't finish in time.</strong></li><li><strong>Some of these games have their own original stories (more content than others).</strong></li><li><strong><em>Some of these games are extremely short.</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>But no matter what, I love all of them through the hard times and good times making them.</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>What's in these games shows all of those story ideas I\u00a0have in my head</em></strong>,\u00a0<strong>ones I\u00a0know I may never have time to fully develop in the time we have now.\u00a0</strong></li><li><em><strong>This project is special to me. So I\u00a0hope that you enjoy them all.</strong></em></li></ul>\n<p>I plan to release the games as I go into the rest of 2022. I will continually update the page with each new game. The first 3 games (February, March and April) will be available, while (May, June, July) will be available later on (and so on and so forth). Release status is \"In development\" but the content is fully complete, and will be changed once all the games are completed.</p>\n<p>All credit and content warnings\u00a0will be given for each game unless otherwise stated.</p>\n<p><em>PROJECT(S) Synopsis:</em></p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>1.
