Blame allows you to shift the blame on to a friend, loved-one, or co-worker.  You can even blame strangers for all your problems.  Simply flick the spinner and blame will determine who's responsible for the mistake.  Since nothing is ever your fault,  Blame will always point to the \"other guy\".  Blame is great for work, home and anywhere you go!<br/><br/>Now you can easily shift the blame to others.<br/><br/>Of course, Blame is just a joke and we should all take responsibility for our own problems. However, If you don't like this app, it's not our fault.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:57:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14a/14a9a28bd0f465df485159a0e442fc92_FW7yVFC.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Bimza"], "genres": ["Family"], "publishers": ["Bimza"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
