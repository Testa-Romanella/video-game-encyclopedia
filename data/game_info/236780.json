{"id": 236780, "slug": "general-practitioner", "name": "General Practitioner", "name_original": "General Practitioner", "description": "<strong>Become a General Practitioner</strong><br/>Live the everyday life of a General Practitioner: go to the clinic every day and meet new patients, develop your skills through study and manage your clinic and your staff. With dozens of items to buy and an always short budget will you be able to treat your patients in the best way?<br/><br/><strong>Deep and engaging narration</strong><br/>General Practitioner features a very long and deep storyline which will take you in a world of mistery and deception. Explore the game's main story while enjoying the other activities available in town. The whole game contains more than 40 hours of gameplay and it's growing update after update!<br/><br/><strong>You decide your own fate</strong><br/>Choices in dialogues and situations really matter! With more than 100 choices to make both in the Main Story and in medical exams you'll experience the consequences of your actions (and in-actions as well). You decide your own fate, do you have what it takes to be a General Practitioner?<br/><br/><strong>Meet new people</strong><br/>The built-in romance system allows you to hang out with dozens of characters of both genders, jog with them at the local park, play a bowling game, relax at the local spa. If you are smart enough you can even make them fall in love with you and ask them to live together, unlocking special conversations and events with them.<br/><br/>You won't know if the date will go well or not, because that depends on fate (and your choices and comfort level of the other one). The more you build up your date's confidence the more chance of success you will have.<br/>Each character you date has a pool different characteristics (i.e. people they like/dislike, favourite foods, informations about their family or job etc.). You'll randomly get to know a different characteristic each time a date will go well and, since they're random, they will be different each time you play General Practitioner or load a save game.<br/><br/><strong>Each patient is different</strong><br/>With a pool of more than 90 scripted patients also comes a random examination system!<br/>Simply put: each time you play the exams will be different. From a pool of 60 diseases and five different patient's archetipes (Children, Teenagers, Young Adults, Adults and Elders) you won't get the very same situation twice!<br/><br/><strong>Medical accuracy</strong><br/>Developed with the help of a real MD, the game features medical informations that are accurate and up-to-date. Please do not take medical informations other than for having fun in the game. If you experience some medical concern ask your doctor as soon as possible.<br/><br/><strong>Original Soundtrack</strong><br/>Ann Sharova (Zup6!, Just Ski, Ezmir: The Last War and many others) composed a soundtrack with 12 different scores to accompany you in your trip as Chief Practitioner of St. Mary's Clinic.<br/><br/>You can hear some work from Ann on her Youtube Channel , or on her SoundCloud . A Youtube reel is also available.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:53:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b12/b1287c35ad7166a0b5490606bb34a129.jpg", "website": "https://www.brunimultimedia.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 13, "toplay": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 128, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 333, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Bruni Multimedia"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bruni Multimedia"], "esrb_rating": null}
