I've been intrigued by the genre since quite some time and had the last push while sawing the #AdvXJam event. The theme is \"A good time\". I first thought of the quiet moment when the dust settles after a tragedy. However, the more I think about it, the more I question myself about what is \"a good time\" ? <br/></p>\n<p>Finally, I took a more literal approach, but this is not an essay either. Just a slice of life between two characters who may or may not fall in love, depending on subtle shifts in time.</p>\n<p>I really enjoyed my experience and If you like the result too, the best you can do is give me some feedbacks. Either here in the comments or @_btstr_ct on Twitter. I learned the hard way I should have narrowed my scope earlier. On the bright side, it means there is still plenty I'd like to explore on this project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T04:13:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86e/86e98ff9e8a7aea358bc507a38f66e70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bstrct"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
