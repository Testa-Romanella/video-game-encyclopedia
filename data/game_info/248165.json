I also found CD-Rs with some Macromedia files on which look like bits of prototype game files. Stuff like pong and solitaire and breakout clones. Most of them wouldn't run but there was one of these prototypes called 'GWUHH' that feels familiar and I swear I've played before but I can't find anything about it online or on this subreddit.</p>\n<p>Anyway - long story short I've managed to get it running in DOSbox - it can get a bit laggy at times but as far as I can tell it's totally playable. Has anyone played this game before? It's really creepy and I'm convinced it was an actual released game at some point but I have no idea when or what company.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/422/42285167c86da5e9e1c88164740dadbf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lukenofurther"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
