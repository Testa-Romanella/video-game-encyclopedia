The theme of the jam was Atmosphere :\r\n</p>\n<em>What if you could help create a sustainable planet and a safer world for women? Create a game or interactive experience that communicates the idea of protective layers.</em>\n<p>We wanted to represent the negative thoughts and toxicity of the environment that women face in our game, as these frequently obstruct their path to success. The metaphor of nature exemplifies this. To conserve oxygen, Mother Earth (Gaia) attempts to trap toxic fumes in the ground and plants. Neither of these battles against social injustice nor environmental collapse can be won alone, and we must all work together to create a world that is both sustainable and safe. This collaborative support is represented by protective layers that shield Gaia from the harsh world around her, whereas the world's toxicity manifests as malice, which Gaia must destroy.\r\n</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Programming : Charlotte Nicaudie, Pouyan Shekari-Kiani</li><li>Art : Elin Abrahamsen, Amy Dolphin</li><li>Project management : Blandine Masselin</li><li>Game design : All</li></ul>\n<p>SFX :\u00a0Magic spells - Water by WOW Sound,\u00a0 from the Unity asset store.\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/magic-spells-water-193538</p>\n<p>Music :\u00a0Air by Bosnow,\u00a0 from Uppbeat:\u00a0https://uppbeat.io/t/bosnow/air.\u00a0License code: F3BWYXISOFBCWN48</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T05:53:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a02/a02774ac7c7efb828275abd547c1d7b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bmasselin", "Pouyan Shekari-Kiani", "lawoo", "GoffMoff", "Elin"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Racing", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
