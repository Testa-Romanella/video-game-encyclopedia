The controls are designed to be played by 2 friends on a single keyboard.<br/></p>\n\n<p>The year is 2050. Armor has evolved to the point where it's virtually impregnable by any material. In a testing lab, scientists test the theory of causing damage to tanks by sound-powered grenades that transmits sound waves at their natural frequency (i.e. resonance), causing internal motors to vibrate enough to damage the engine.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>This game was made in 48 hours as an entry for Global Game Jam 2018 Singapore.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbe/cbe85d7257f57d0db686106146103c57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Chue Sai Hou", "justinjuay", "YiCHong"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
