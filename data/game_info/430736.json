In this game, you defend your campfire from the  \"corruption\", glitchy ice monsters who HATE your fire.</p>\r\nHOW TO PLAY\r\n<p>You need to keep your campfire alive. Enemies will head straight for your fire from all angles, ignoring you completely. To defeat an enemy, smack it with your torch. Use your jetpack to move around the tundra quickly. If an enemy gets close to your campfire, a warning will appear on your screen to let you know.<br/></p>\n<p>Destroying an enemy will increase your combo meter. \u00a0Keeping your combo streak going is the key to getting a high score. Occasionally, you'll need to stray far from your fire to keep your meter up. If you're in a situation where you don't think you can make it back to your fire in time to save it, you can transfer your campfire to a new location by burning a tree down, though this will clear your multiplier.</p>\n<p>Have fun, and thanks for playing!</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<ul><li><strong>WASD</strong> - Movement</li><li><strong>Space</strong> - Use jetpack</li><li><strong>Left mouse</strong> - Swing torch</li><li><strong>Right mouse</strong> - Burn tree, convert to campfire</li><li><strong>P</strong> - Pause</li><li><strong>Esc</strong> - Exit game</li><li><strong>1</strong> - Switch between fullscreen/windowed.
