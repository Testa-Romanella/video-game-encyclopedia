Eventually, you could even win the paragon of perfection, Mary Sue herself!</p>\n<p><strong>Mary Sue's Character Casino</strong> is a loving tribute to character tropes, gacha games, and freestyle music\u00a0in the form of a simple roguelike deckbuilder.</p>\n<p>The entire game can be played with a mouse (one with at least\u00a0two buttons is strongly recommended). Choose an area of the casino to play in, make a wager, and start raking in those characters! Once you do, they can be equipped via the Collection menu for some sweet benefits!</p>\n<p>As you build up your collection, more areas will be unlocked. Will you be able to make it to the VIP Lounge, where Mary Sue awaits?</p>\n<p>For more information, check out the in-game brochure!</p>\n<p>After last year's hiatus, I'm back with my sixth Holiday Card! Sixth and final.</p>\n<p>That's right, I've decided to end the Brainscraps Holiday Card project for the foreseeable future. This one took a lot out of me-- I went through two other game engines before finally settling on GDevelop, plus the amount of art I had to create this time was enormous compared to previous games. I need another break, and I'm not sure one year off is going to cut it this time.</p>\n<p>That said, plans can always change! Also, I'm not done with hobbydev altogether; you'll surely see something new from me at some point in the future... I'm just not sure when.</p>\n<p>This year's Holiday Card\u00a0was initially inspired by <em>Luck be a Landlord</em>, my favorite game of 2021. Please check it out, and give TrampolineTales your business if you enjoy their demo.</p>\n<p><em>Mary Sue's Character Collector</em> also contains references to all of my\u00a0previous Holiday Cards. Keep an eye out for them!<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you all for playing, and extra special thanks to my friends and followers!</p>\n<p>--RKasa, December 2021<br/></p>\n<p>\r\n    All art, sound, writing, design, and other\u00a0original content in <em>Mary Sue's Character Casino</em> is licensed under a\r\nCreative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\r\n    </p>\n<p>Please refer to the Credits screen for copyright and related information regarding the outside assets used for this game.\r\n    </p>\n<p>If you have any questions or comments, as always,\u00a0feel free to contact me.
