Who is she? What kind of monsters lurk in the woods?</p>\n<p>This is the very first game that I\u00a0have ever created. It was developed in a time period of 6 weeks.\u00a0 I know it is not perfect, and the original idea of the game was way more wider than the content I was actually able to implement on it, but in the end, I am actually quite happy with the result.</p>\n<p>If you find any kind of bug, or just want to express how you feel about the game, please feel free to post your thoughts in the comments!
