Luckily you know a little game you can play in your head to organize your thoughts and memories. Make it through five puzzles to learn something about yourself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong> each puzzle starts with a question, the answer to which is hidden among other thoughts and ideas. Flip cards to recall a memory about it, and\u00a0use those memories to match pairs of cards. Once only a single card remains, you have found the answer you are looking for.</p>\n\n<p>My entry for the\u00a0AI and Games Jam 2022 (theme: Isolation).\r\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Content warning (spoilers):</strong>\u00a0dementia, brief mention of death and animal death.</p>\n\n<p>A\u00a0game by Sander in 't Veld.
