Humanity awaits the turn of the century with copious amounts of anxiety and optimism. The main talking point of the time is whether or not electronics and essential services will cease once the clock strikes 12. Those in power assure the general public that if they were still using electricity, then there may have been means for concern. However, with the advent of Shards, they have very little to worry about.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shards are what powers 90% of the world. They are obsidian-like crystals that house power within them that no other means of fuel could ever hope to achieve. As a result, humanity shifted most of their technology to utilize this mineral. It wasn\u2019t long before every industry started to use Shard Energy from entertainment to agriculture. This has led to many humans exhibiting levels of Shard Energy within them but thankfully there are no adverse side effects to this despite what uninformed individuals may say. Most people welcome Shard Energy so much so that celebrations are held when cities without Shard Factories finally get them. Once it is up and running, they are able to go off the electrical grid and enter a world of cheap, limitless energy. Unfortunately, the celebrations were short lived for the town of Elrich.\u00a0<br/>Before the new century, the newly constructed Shard Factory within the city reached critical levels for no apparent reason and plunged the area into eternal night with a violent meltdown. The citizens that survived the event, known as the Shattering, attempted to escape their city but any attempts to leave the opaque dome that had enveloped their home was met with a swift and brutal death. That which lurked inside of the swirling darkness refused access into and out of the area. Those that were fortunate enough to have been in the blast zone of the Shattering were killed instantly, with their husks being reanimated by the Shard Energy.\u00a0<br/>These husks roam the city with the singular purpose of destroying anything that emits strong levels of Shard Energy, which paints a huge target on the survivors. With nothing but their wits and will, those that were left behind must fend for themselves in the endless nightmare that is the New Year.</p>\n<p>Find your way around our test level in which you can fins chests with loot while being hunted by the enemies that are patrolling throughout the level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My Fellow Amazing Teammates:</p>\n<p>Lead Developer:\u00a0\u00a0https://aubdini.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Lead Artist: (link Coming soon)</p>\n<p>Artist: https://bigdaddymike.itch.io/</p>\n<p>The Amazing Music\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ross Bugden:\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T04:09:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/419/41998c4f8a5e3cf7cfbe502be52e05bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OiDavo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
