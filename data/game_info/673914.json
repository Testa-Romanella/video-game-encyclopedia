There are several items and weapons to find, and each weapon has its own ammo system.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first game I have ever made entirely by myself, I hand-drew everything in it, did all the programming, and messed around with Midi music to create custom tracks for most of the areas.</p>\n<p>Every copy of the game also comes with a free PDF copy of the Fighting Fantasy book it is based upon! Enjoy!<br/></p>\n<p>Game is designed on a CRT monitor, for CRT monitors, but should work fine on a flatscreen. I just dont own a flatscreen to test this on. <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T09:54:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c43/c43a6de25f08452288445b6eff8d6df8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sqeek Songplay"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
