Your task is to defeat the other circles, who are, appropriately, trying to defeat you.</p><p>The controls are simple: WASD to move and mouse to aim and use special abilities. The game has 12 characters, 117 levels, and a multitude of enemies. Among the characters are one who makes portals on walls, another who throws a boomerang, and another with a jetpack who can throw grenades.</p><p>Nothing about this game is complicated. It's not supposed to be. Instead, I tried to make thought-provoking level designs, clever characters and enemies, and charmingly minimalistic effects.</p><p>This is my first big game; I've made several others, but none that I have published or released. I hope you enjoy it.</p><p><strong>So please, go ahead. Enter the arena.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b81/b8161138817bbe1b11b077ced32eec1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["TheMost"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
