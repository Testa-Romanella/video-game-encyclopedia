If you want to know why, please read my \"Code is Just\" thread on Twitter. I couldn't have got it published without my good friends David and Geoff, who also appear in Code is Just</p>\n<p>Geoff and I convinced David to reboot Floor 13. It's time I\u00a0followed suit, with Chimera 2.</p>\n<p>This game is what I\u00a0should have done next. I didn't, and my life went very differently.</p>\n<p>Not a bad turn, just not the turn I\u00a0perhaps should have taken.<br/></p>\n<p>I've wanted to correct that mistake for\u00a0decades, and well, never really committed.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0kept looking for permission, for funding, for the right time.</p>\n<p>It never came.</p>\n<p>It never does.</p>\n<p>The time is always now.</p>\n<p>Until I had the crazy idea of just launching whatever prototype work I have and then continuing to develop it for as long as I can.</p>\n<p>Publicly.</p>\n<p>And worse than the shame of showing early sketches with people who've learned from me watching, to actually ask for money (though that's optional as you'll see)</p>\n<p>The game takes the assets from the ZX Spectrum version (for now) and I will in real time, continue from the point where I\u00a0left off.</p>\n<p>It might be rubbish.</p>\n<p>I might not finish it.</p>\n<p>Or I might make something special.\u00a0</p>\r\nIt's way too early!\r\n<p>Yes, it is.</p>\n<p>That's exactly why I'm putting it out, even before there's anything to put out.</p>\n<p>It will start off very, very rough.</p>\n<p>Not even a game.</p>\n<p>Not even as \"good\" as the original.</p>\n<p>But, with your interest, help, support and cheerleading, I will take it to its logical conclusion, changing it in surprising ways.</p>\n<p>Nothing is off the table.\u00a0<br/></p>\r\nWhat's in it for me?\r\n<p>You could donate now, but you're getting a ropey, early build with almost nothing in it, so why bother?</p>\n<p>The amount I'm asking for is small, but optional.</p>\n<p>You're not paying for what this is. You're paying for what might be. And you're paying to take a ride with me, wherever I\u00a0drive the bus.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So it's optional. Don't pay anything if you don't want to. No judgment here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That all said, the more donations I get, the more time I can afford to put into the development. You'll be a valued supporter.\u00a0Don't worry, I don't rely on these for the bills, so even if nobody donates, I'll carry on, just more slowly.</p>\n<p>I'm going to build the game I've always found a way to run away from, and I'll be doing it from roughly where I left off, and we're going to see, together where we end up.\u00a0</p>\r\nI'm in, don't break my heart\r\n<p>I'll do my best. I\u00a0just ask that you join me, a 56-year old with a long history in the industry on this partly sentimental, partly curiosity-driven\u00a0journey to pick up where I left off and make something that I hope many will love as much for their participation as for whatever the game ends up becoming.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T18:57:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/208/208648ce9a79cec4d72128ab3af2756e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Shahid Kamal Ahmad"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
