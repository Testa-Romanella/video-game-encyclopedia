The crash landing has left you with mild amnesia, and you are slowly unfolding bits and pieces of who you are. You have three goals:</p>\n<p>1. Find out who you are.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. Get someone to say your name.</p>\n<p>3. Find a way to live on or leave the island together.</p>\n<p>The only things you need to play are players, pencils, and paper.</p>\n\n\n<p>This game was created live on Twitch (with some editing later on) on 7/21 by Alexander Sprague and Jessica Geyer of Wannabe Games. We are working on flexing our creative muscles and making new fun things for people. Follow us on twitter @jawska and @kittycrusade and drop us a suggestion for a game idea. We make something new every Sunday!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-27T12:08:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ccd/ccd21afb2f0d526fe6d64f88de0c63a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wannabegames"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
