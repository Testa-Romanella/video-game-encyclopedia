The game doesn't represent the final product, but will introduce you to the world of Wizard of Legend in a fun and interactive way.</p><p>This demo takes place after the timeline of Wizard of Legend and is shown from a more modern perspective where the events of the game are now studied as an important part of history. In the Museum of Lanova's Chaos Trials exhibit, you can experience a few of the spells and challenges that will be present in Wizard of Legend.</p><p>Disclaimer: Though this demo features the gameplay and combat mechanics of Wizard of Legend, it is a completely separate experience from the game. This demo was created from a work in progress and everything is subject to change. That being said, have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c50/c506b0792966d723d7890260eee2c0df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Contingent99"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
