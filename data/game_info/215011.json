Grey rooms are unvisited, blue is the current room, yellow means visited.<br/>Underneath the minimap is a progress bar showing you the archeologist's progress. You lose when it is empty.</p>\n<p>Controls<br/>------------<br/>Move: S/D or left/right arrow keys.<br/>Jump: Z, W or up arrow key.<br/>R: Reset current room. Useful when fully locking up rooms<br/>???: left click. Requires power-up.<br/>???: right click, aim for 2 separate blocks. Space to reset. Requires power-up.<br/>???: shift. Requires power-up.</p>\n<p>Limitations\r\n<br/>----------------</p>\n<ul><li>Max 31337 bytes</li><li>360x400 pixels stretched to the whole screen (tested on\u00a01920x1080)</li><li>Max 32 colors per frame</li></ul>\n<p>Known bugs<br/>----------------<br/>- Collision separation is quite poor:<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 - hitting any wall horizontally will stop your vertical momentum and \"eat\" your jump<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 - landing often aligns your X position with a tile.<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 - my sincerest apologies for all the unfair deaths due to slipping off of a block above a spike pit. I could not fix this within the given timeframe.<br/>- The title screen is only clickable after a few seconds (unresponsive while music is generating)<br/>- Very rarely the background layer does not show up. Refresh to fix.<br/>- Very rarely linked block movement is not consistent. Reset the link (space) or reset the room (R) to fix.<br/>- You can probably find some ways to sequence-break or really break the game by using its unique mechanic :)</p>\n<p>Special thanks<br/>-------------------<br/>rpp0 (https://github.com/rpp0) for lending his musical talent!<br/>Tatiana for creating an awesome victory screen and being very supportive and patient<br/>Gynvael for organising a game jam / dev challenge that I can actually participate in, being a father. We need more longer game jams! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/799/7998d614f7e658a9a4cb1daaf3703c44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Vassildador"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
