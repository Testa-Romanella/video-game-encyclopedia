Your boss states that you are the best climber and this family needs your help.</p>\n<p>Climb the cliff to rescue the people stranded on the side. Be cautious of the falling rocks and running out of stamina!</p>\n<p><strong>Tutorial:</strong></p>\n<p>Movement: Move side to side, up, and down to avoid the falling rocks, maneuver around ledges that are in the way, and reach each family member.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Falling rocks: Avoid the falling rocks! Each hit you receive will effect you. You'll be knocked off the cliff if you get hit with the rocks 3 times.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ledges: The family members are stuck on some of the ledges. Some ledges are just obstacles on the cliff, so you'll need to go around you. Ledges also prevent rocks from hitting you if you're below one.</p>\n<p>Stamina: You also have a finite stamina level.\u00a0Once you run out of stamina, you'll need to take a quick break in order to recuperate.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your boss is counting on you to save this family!</p>\n<p><strong>Creators:</strong></p>\n<p>Programming - Chris\u00a0LaVoy</p>\n<p>Animation - Cindy Tran\u00a0Instagram</p>\n<p>Storyboarding - Nichelle Nguyen<br/></p>\n<p>Sound from zapsplat.com</p>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>This was the team's first project together, first game jam, and first time using Godot.</p>\n<p>The web build of the game is missing the intro section due to issues with Dialogic.
