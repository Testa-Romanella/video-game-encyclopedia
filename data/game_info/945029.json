{"id": 945029, "slug": "not-for-broadcast-vr", "name": "Not For Broadcast VR", "name_original": "Not For Broadcast VR", "description": "The award-winning darkly comedic game of televised chaos that critics have called a \u201cBizarre masterpiece\u201d and \u201cQuite possibly the best FMV game ever\" is now available in VR!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Not For Broadcast VR takes the gameplay, story, and gripping dark comedy of the original award-winning FMV adventure and brings you closer to the news than ever. Get a full view of the entire newsroom, interact with your equipment and punch, slap and grab anything that dares to get between you and the truth.<br/><br/>We promise it\u2019s so immersive you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re really being electrocuted by your poorly maintained equipment!<br/><br/>Egotistical celebrities, dishonest politicians, and strange sponsors clash on the airwaves. You\u2019re in the chair to ensure that the show goes on uninterrupted. Or at least, that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting paid for. There\u2019s now nothing stopping you from spending all day hitting yourself on the head with VHS tapes, we suppose.<h3>Hand-pick the headlines\u2026 with your ACTUAL hands!</h3><br/><br/><br/>Experience the lost art of inserting a VHS tape into a deck through the magic of virtual reality. Carefully position your \u201cair-conditioning\u201d so the news doesn\u2019t overheat and turn spin wildly around your desk during the adverts (watch the cables, though).<br/><br/>Plus, shake your fist in rage at whatever political ideology you don\u2019t agree with (Or at everyone, it\u2019s OK, they can\u2019t see you).<h3>Frame the picture; frame the debate</h3><br/><br/><br/>Keep the general public entertained with your editing skills, and keep an eye on those ratings. Make politicians look greedy or brave, make resistance leaders look noble or violent, and make news anchors look charming or unhinged. Who and what you decide to show on screen might change the course of history. No pressure.<h3>Keep it PG</h3><br/><br/><br/>If VR was invented for anything, it was the simulation of pushing important-looking red buttons. Smash it (or gently tap it; it\u2019ll work fine either way) to keep rude words (and other sensitive information) off the air. Keep the news safe for children and oppressive political regimes alike.<br/><br/>Tune out the chaos, load up the ads, crank  up the volume and immerse yourself in the dreams, fears, hopes and neurosis of an entire nation, all while sitting on your floor.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T05:01:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/326/3268e85e37707757cc0fbc1329598f3f.jpg", "website": "https://www.notforbroadcastgame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 27, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 284, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NotGames", "Babaroga"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["tinyBuild"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
