Collect keys to open doors. Use portals to teleport and avoid the monsters.</p>\n\n<p>The game is still in early progress and has an Developer tool button inside the options menu. It can be used to choose which of the mazes you want to play. I did this so people can try different ones incase there are bugs and/or other problems which causes them not to be able to complete a maze and move to the next. Simply go back to the main menu and pick the next one. I appreciate all the feedback i get. It's not pretty or very well done, but it's fun and very hard. Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T06:35:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c16/c168f9aac1f9e92db6b3249fedc19ec3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["zaditen"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
