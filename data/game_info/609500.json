It's planned to be a short, sweet platformer game with nothing groundbreaking. All of the voice lines are done by my friend DandKGames. This was mainly inspired by There is no Game and I wanted to create something like that, but a platformer. This is also my first project. All music and textures are made by me.</p>\n<p>HTML5 version\u00a0available on Newgrounds.</p><p>If you want older versions of the game you'll have to go to my website here:\u00a0http://dewachen.mynetgear.com/simple-platforms/</p>\n<p>Update 0.2.6 5/27/21: Added level 6, Changed the character's collision box, Added background music, Added better lighting</p>\n<p>Currently fixing a bug in the newgrounds version where the voice lines in level 4 play all at once in the beginning.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T08:24:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4c/d4c1ac3ae858b64f271c0a0a512145ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Minecraftian808"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
