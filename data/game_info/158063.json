As you start to cook your delicious bacon, your roommate grabs a another slab of bacon and fights you for the microwave over a frying pan placed directly under your grandfather's vast chicken egg supply.</p><p>It's up to you to win the fight to be able to cook your bacon. Will you succeed or fail?</p><p>Plays similar to pong, but with \"millions\" of eggs. Eggs move fast, can crack and explode the egg yolk everywhere, and are everywhere.</p><p>Credits:</p><p>Jacob Peltola: Art, Code, Sound &amp; Music, Design</p><p>Nick Mudry: Additional Programming, Game Design</p><p>Social Media &amp; Web Links:</p><p>@Nick_Mudry - Twitter</p><p>@Jtpup0 - Titter</p><p>http://mudry.me - Nick Mudry's Website</p><p>http://jacobpeltola.blogspot.com - Jacob Peltola's Website</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fa/7fa4d27be1a0e0f4bb10feb1309604e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Nick Mudry"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
