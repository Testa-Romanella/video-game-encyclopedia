Watch their numbers fluctuate as they reproduce and interact with other organisms!\u00a0Grow your populations and add new creatures to produce more and new colors of paper to craft more species! Be sure to maintain proper ecosystem balance, or else it may collapse...</p>\n<p>Paper Pets is a low-stakes and relaxing experience.
