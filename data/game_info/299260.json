Select three of these to play and spend your resources on improving the other two.\u00a0Build up your economy and your defenses quickly as there is not much time before the invaders arrive. Each wave of attackers is stronger than the last and has a special effect on the game. <br/></p>\n<p>After each wave you will gain a new pair of buildings that are more powerful than those you had before. <br/><br/></p>\n<p>Good Luck!</p>\n\n<p>Music from freesound.org https://freesound.org/people/Andrewkn/sounds/440933/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-04T04:50:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b6/8b646a27feda6f376ef12443ad4ea4e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sisyphean Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
