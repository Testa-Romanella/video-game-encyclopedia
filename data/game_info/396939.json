The goal was to spend a max of three hours in development, but it took me longer than that, partly because I'm not an artist and decided to do the graphics before implementing the mechanics.</p>\n<p>You can move your vehicle up and down via the arrow keys. Avoid the rocks as they slow you down. Instead collect the little power ups that give you a speed up! Collect enough of them and you advance to the next level.</p>\n<p>Currently each level is as good as any other, but you have to collect more power ups in each subsequent level.</p><p>Made with\u00a0Godot.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-09T02:04:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b22/b22a08ac4f1659d028bbe576964ce720.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GreenBeakCrow"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
