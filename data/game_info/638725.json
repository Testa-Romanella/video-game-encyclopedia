The witch would knock on the doors at night, and try to lure men by calling them out in voices similar to that of the women they loved - mother, wife, sister. Upon hearing a familiar voice, the person would open the door, and subsequently die within the next 24 hours. This legend spread like wildfire, wreaking havoc in the city.<br/>\r\nThe locals then found out a way to get rid of the witch. They started writing 'Nale Ba' on the doors, or uttering the same from inside of the house to ward off the evil spirit. 'Nale Ba' literally means 'come tomorrow' in Kannada.
