Which is why there's no sound, or explosions, and it might not be free of bugs, but otherwise I hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e5/5e5a55c227ec8ed171516383774f0773.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Steve Dean"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
