It has an innovative respawn system, 12 levels, a 12 track soundtrack, online leaderboards, and a unique custom level creation feature.<br/><br/>Users are able to create images (both static and animated) that can be imported as level geometry, hazards, or interactive elements. Creators can craft full 10-level campaigns with customizeable screens and intros, and share them with one another.<strong><em>*</em></strong><br/><br/>The challenging levels are balanced with the inclusion of a simple yet unique respawn system wherein the player can leave a checkpoint at any location at any point, as long as they are on solid ground.\u00a0<br/><br/>Beyond the visual aesthetic, the challenging level design, and the abundance of features, there is the fantastic soundtrack composed by James Bennett, which bring the seemingly simple 3-color atmospheres to life.\u00a0</p><p><em>*Not available currently in the Mac version</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/934/934be9a181ce11ffe7f05e2ded9d6810.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Fred Wood"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
