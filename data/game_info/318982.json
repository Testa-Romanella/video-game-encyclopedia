The basis of the level and game design took inspiration from a basic rumba that swivels when cleaning the house, and I found it to be quite cute making it similar to the main player. The game should be engaging and aesthetically pleasing to the player when assuming gameplay.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-13T05:15:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4db/4dbfdfd3463c177f6d563a4af4834c8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["jjezus"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
