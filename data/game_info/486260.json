The main character has a dog, and to get to the house, the player must choose a path so as not to drop the dog's hp to 0, but at the same time not to lose his own. Consequently, there should have been impassable traps on the way, which the player had to choose deliberately, thinking before the one who would lose hp.<br/>It was also not possible to fully explain the traps, so the car and the thunder scare the dog with their sounds, and do not directly cause damage with electricity, as one might think.<br/><br/>The game was supposed to teach that if you take on all the hardships and difficulties, then you will not get as far as if you shared them with a friend who is ready to help you.<br/>You have to take care about your friends, but don't forget about yourself.</p>\n<p>MaDe by</p>\n<p>Artist KingZer0\u00a0https://twitter.com/_KingZer0_<br/>Composer Lucas Questr\u00a0https://twitter.com/LQuestr<br/>Programmers <br/>Hash'ak\u00a0https://twitter.com/_hashak<br/> Musheerme\u00a0https://twitter.com/Musheerme<br/></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Used assets<br/>Sound effects obtained from zapsplat.com<br/>UI by https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/47220<br/>Sounds by https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/6779<br/>sounds by https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/9381</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T06:29:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/948/9480fffd56603aaa4bb4ea3ec81f83bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hash'ak"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
