{"id": 489651, "slug": "super-tic-tac-toe", "name": "Super Tic Tac Toe", "name_original": "Super Tic Tac Toe", "description": "Super Tic Tac Toe\r\n<p>Super Tic Tac Toe is a turn-based <strong>strategy board game\u00a0</strong>with simple rules of Tic Tac Toe.</p>\n<p>Super Tic Tac Toe is known by many different names, including Mega Tic Tac Toe, Ultimate Tic Tac Toe and Tic Tac Toe on Nine Boards.</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Super Tic Tac Toe\u00a0is like original Tic Tac Toe but with nine boards in a 3x3 grid. The trick is that a player can't choose freely which board\u00a0to play on.</p>\r\nFirst move\r\n<p>The starting player\u00a0can first choose any of nine\u00a0boards, and then play on that board exactly like in original\u00a0Tic Tac Toe.</p>\r\nFollowing moves\r\n<p>The next player must always play on a <strong>board</strong>\u00a0matching a\u00a0<strong>cell</strong> played on the previous turn - each cell map to a similarly positioned\u00a0board.</p>\n<p>In the example, X played in the <strong>cell </strong>number 6, so O must play on the <strong>board </strong>number 6 (in yellow).<br/></p>\n\n<p>Because O decided to play in the middle <strong>cell</strong>, X will play next on the middle <strong>board</strong>.</p>\n<p>The game then continues like that turn-by-turn.</p>\n<p>Additional <strong>important rule</strong>:\u00a0If a board was already resolved (win\u00a0or full), a player can't play on that board, but chooses freely any unresolved board.\r\n</p>\r\nWinning the game\r\n<p>The first player to get three <strong>boards</strong> in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line wins the game. Note that it's three boards\u00a0instead of cells as in original Tic Tac Toe.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of an almost completed game:\u00a0It's O's turn\u00a0on the yellow board, but it doesn't matter where O\u00a0plays anymore, since\u00a0X can win\u00a0the top-right board next, and thus,\u00a0<strong>X\u00a0</strong><strong>wins three board in\u00a0up-right line</strong>.</p>\n\r\nSimple strategy game\r\n<p>Super Tic Tac Toe has no winning strategy, unlike the original\u00a0Tic Tac Toe game, and I have very little to say about that. However, it's obvious that winning a single\u00a0Tic Tac Toe board doesn't really mean much at all.<br/></p>Credits\r\n<ul><li>Sounds NoiseForFun.com</li><li>Medal icons Pixabay.com</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T03:54:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/988/98875b311685d8c25e40aa9a8ef70ee7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tactic"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
