All you need to do is to:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Go to Assets - &gt; Google Mobile Ads -&gt; Settings and put your app id (from your AdMob console) there. (Important step, app may crash on start if you skip this step)\r\n</li><li>Open the script \"Menus.cs\" and put you interstitial ad id on line 42 for android, line 44 for iOS, and banner ad id on line 59 for android, line 61 iOS.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>This project is compatible for android, iOS, WebGL, PC and many other platforms that unity supports.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Tap the screen to release the balls, you need to do that in a perfect timing so balls fall into trucks. Each ball you get into the truck rewards you with a different amount of points, depending on the truck score multiplier. If the ball misses the truck, it disappears. When you lose all 100 of your balls, the game is over. The game is endless and your only goal is to reach as many score points as you can.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T01:01:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ad/4ade6130f41c2dff7553bca999ef24eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NeonSpaceFighter"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
