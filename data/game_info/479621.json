You have 2 needs: hunger and thirst.<br/>Each day you can choose between collecting water or fishing, you can't do both. Some days you will not be able to do an action.<br/>You can make an offering to the gods to <strong>rewind</strong> time and go back a day to change your decision. Be careful though as you only have a limited amount of offerings!<br/>Survive as long as possible without running out of food or water and await rescue!
