You will build your own christmas market and create a beautiful place where people can connect!\r\n\n\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>In this game your only goal is to relax and to build your own Christmas market. First get a nice cozy blanket, grab a cup off tee (or mulled wine) and then start building. The more buildings you have the more customers will visit your Christmas market. But don't forget the decoration! The more decoration you have the more money the customers will spend!</p>\n<p>On the right you have four buttons:</p>\n<p><strong>Settings Menu - </strong>Here you can pause the game and adjust the volume settings</p>\n<p><strong>Shop Menu - </strong>Buy new buildings and decoration</p>\n<p><strong>Edit -</strong> You want to place a building somewhere else?\u00a0No problem! Just activate the edit mode.</p>\n<p><strong>Delete -</strong> In this mode you can remove a building or decoration. But you won't get any money back!</p>\n\n<p>On the left you have two bars:</p>\n<p><strong>Customer Bar -</strong> This shows how full your market is. Once you reached the top there will be no more customers arriving until someone is leaving your market!</p>\n<p><strong>Happiness Bar -</strong> This shows how happy your customers are. The happier they are, the more money they'll spend!</p>\r\nTeam\r\n<p>Music &amp; Sound: Joshua Hank</p>\n<p>Programming &amp;\u00a0Level Design:\u00a0Dennis Hawran</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Used Asset Packs:</p>\n<p>https://shubibubi.itch.io/winter-things</p>\n<p>https://shubibubi.itch.io/cozy-people</p>\n<p>https://shubibubi.itch.io/cozy-farm<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T04:52:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5b/b5ba73797bad748e21f0ec6ca4399105.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JoshntQ", "Atmo"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
