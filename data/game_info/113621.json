But there are a lot of different options to help you to play more easily and we're working on a tutorial that is now missing...<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Obviously, there are many obstacles on the road you'll need to make Claudio avoid such a classical spikes and monsters but also gravity switchers that add some fun to the game.
