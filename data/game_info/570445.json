Embark on a frantic puzzle adventure with Adjacan't \ud83d\udfe9\ud83d\udfe8\ud83d\udfe6\ud83d\udfe5 - a clever game about colouring the board in such a way that no two same-coloured cells touch! Sounds easy enough, right? Then hop on and show us how it's done \ud83c\udf89 <br/></p>\n\n<p>=== \ud83d\udccb INSTRUCTIONS \ud83d\udccb ===</p>\n<p>(these are also covered in a pretty tutorial with pictures and all in-game but if you prefer plain text - hey, who am I to judge?)</p>\n<p>1. The big cloud at the top of your play area is your CURRENT COLOUR (and score). The trail beneath it is your NEXT COLOUR (and High Score).</p>\n<p>2. Click on any of the cells to colour it with your CURRENT COLOUR and start the game.</p>\n<p>3. Keep colouring the cells by applying your CURRENT COLOUR to any of the cells adjacent to the already coloured ones so that no two same-coloured cells touch (the legal moves are handily marked in light yellow for you so you don't need to figure it all out by hand).</p>\n<p>4. Stuck? The upper right hand corner button lets you SWAP the colours in your palette, and the one below it lets you DRAW completely new colours.</p>\n<p>The small NUMBERS in their corners show how many uses of each you still have.</p>\n<p>5. Keep playing and try to fill up the board!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T05:24:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a3/8a32b1d5a4dbe8819d028c55a9ad8a40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Katspybara"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
