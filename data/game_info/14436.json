Even though the characters move by themselves, you can push them, use blocks to slow them down, and bring them to inaccessible places.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach level got it own theme. It could be avoiding indestructible spikes, making bridges over a cliff or escaping angry dragons.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:12:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3da/3da6b828e7320ca579d3ea9aabf0cf35.jpg", "website": "https://dlan.itch.io/reckpunk", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 114}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 8, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["dlan"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["dlan"], "esrb_rating": null}
