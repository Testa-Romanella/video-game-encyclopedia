In FE, the game auto-selects a crew and if you are in the crew of 10, 10 others are plants and have to hide around the map. The hunters are given spray and have to find the fake plants. Each time a plant gets sprayed, it takes 25% health away and then it teleports away and goes to hide again! After all the plants are killed in the time limit of 10 mins, the match ends.</p>\r\nTeam Deathmach\r\n<p>In a lobby of 20, the teams are split (10 on each team) and the teams have to battle until 1 team gets to the score limit. The top 3 get more XP than the others!</p>\r\nNotice\r\n<p>This game is not fully done, work is needed and so is staff.
