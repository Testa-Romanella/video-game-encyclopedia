But you can&#39;t outstand the desire to look through all of them and prepare yourself for an hour full of nostalgia.<br />\nWhile browsing them, one of the PC games you found there attracts your attention. You don\u2019t remember this game being here. You neither remember buying or playing it.<br />\nIt seems really old, something from the early &#39;00s. The title says \u201cNo one lives under the lighthouse\u201d.<br />\nThe game description on the backside of the box seems to be poorly translated from some other language:<br />\n&quot;You arrive at the old lighthouse on a small island near the coast of the United States. After the previous keeper has gone missing, you need to take over his duties and watch after the light. The member of the Establishment told you they&#39;ll get you an assistant after a week or two, but right now you&#39;re on your own.<br />\nFeaturing:<br />\nIsland exploration<br />\nEnjoy the loneliness and ultra-modern graphics<br />\nLook after the lighthouse, light the lamp at the sunset<br />\nListen what seagulls speak to you<br />\nNo words said<br />\nDon&#39;t open the door that leads to the basement under the lighthouse<br />\nNo one lives under the lighthouse<br />\nThis sounds weird and disturbing. Game screenshots on the box look a bit uncanny. If this game wasn&#39;t so old you&#39;ve probably decided it&#39;s another pretentious walking sim with horror elements.<br />\nYou need to check it. The box with other CDs stays in the corridor. You spent at least an hour looking for your old laptop, as your current PC doesn&#39;t even have the CD port.<br />\nInstall wizard completes and closes automatically in less than a minute. A text document named &quot;Instructions.txt&quot; opens immediately after that.<br />\nInstructions.txt:<br />\nThe keeper is responsible for the care and management of the light, and for the station in general.<br />\nThe keeper is responsible for the careful management and expenditure of stores and supplies.<br />\nA lighthouse must never be left wholly unattended.<br />\nKeepers must be courteous and polite to all visitors who conform to the regulations.<br />\nThe lighthouse basement should be locked up tight and not visited not by the keeper, nor anyone else.<br />\nLights must be lighted punctually at sunset and must be kept burning at full intensity until sunrise.<br />\nAll preparations must be made early, that there may be no delay in lightning.<br />\nThe lens and the glass of the lantern must be cleaned daily and always kept in the best possible condition.<br />\nThe keeper and his assistance, if he has any, should live in a house near the lighthouse. No one lives under the lighthouse.<br />\n&quot;This doesn&#39;t sound like proper instructions for a PC game&quot;, you think. So you don&#39;t bother closing the document and finally launch the game .exe file.<br />\nWhat could go wrong?<br />\nA word from developers:<br />\nNo one lives under the lighthouse is a short experimental retro horror game made by 3 horror fans from indie game studio Sowoke Entertainment Bureau.
