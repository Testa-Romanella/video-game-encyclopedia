You may need to bounce off some things to get your ship moving in the right direction. Please leave a comment -- and check back for info about development of the full game.</p>\n<p>Now with TWO players simultaneous. Knock the other player around. Use bumping into things to steer your spaceship.</p>\n<p>The more I play with this, the more I think that a full game would be a lot of fun. Fully developed levels, missions, and perhaps even ship damage, fuel usage, and online multiplayer. Lots more Godot to learn! <strong><em>Let me know what you think!</em></strong></p>\n<strong>Left player<br/>Z key</strong>\u00a0 fires your thruster\r\n<br/>(that's all you can do)<strong>Right player\r\n<br/>/ key</strong>\u00a0 fires your thruster <br/>(that's all you can do)&lt;<strong>ESC&gt;</strong>\u00a0\r\nrestarts the game\r\n<br/>(for when you fly offscreen or get stuck)\r\n<p>I'm learning Godot and experimenting with the physics engine.\u00a0I did this to test the physics engine with gravity and collisions and I\u00a0liked the result enough to want to do more development on the game.</p>\n<p>This added \"thrust flames\" and\u00a0a lot more stuff all moving around compared to\u00a0the first test version and there are now 2 player ships. Pretty wild how Godot handles all this additional physics -- even as a web-playable game. The web version is a little slow on my laptop (a low-power Pentium CPU) but the game runs fine as a desktop game.</p>\n<p>You can follow me on my website\u00a081766.com\u00a0for articles about game development and publishing (sign up for the email list!) or you can follow me here on itch.io.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-21T03:25:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69d/69da0ef488deb5c985ac0917307fcb33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Uncontrollable Spaceship"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
