This means keeping them alive requires more heals.</em></li><li><em>If you run out of food, you can't spawn new villagers. Farmers are arguably the most important right next to loggers. No one cares about miners after the beginning.</em></li><li><em>You are never truly self sustaining. Don't leave your game idle too long, you WILL lose.</em></li><li><em>The difficulty slider ONLY determines the villagers' base delivery amount. Farthest right is hardest, farthest left is easiest. It scales from 5 resources per trip to 10 resources per trip.</em></li><li><em>Right clicking deselects whatever button you've last pressed. This should have been in the tutorial. Sorry.</em></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f76/f76218a2497a895a1dec21b3fd972df3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kindred"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
