{"id": 962438, "slug": "gemstone-guardians", "name": "Gemstone Guardians", "name_original": "Gemstone Guardians", "description": "Gemstone Guardians is a tower defense game where selection and combinations are key. Choose your towers and make powerful combinations to try prevent the enemies from reaching the end portal.<h3>Build</h3>Each round you will be able to build five towers at random to help you defeat the incoming wave of enemies. You must select one of the five towers to be used and the rest will turn to stone. These towers can be strategically placed to help maze enemies away from there desired destination.<h3>Combine</h3>Towers of the same type can be combined to increase their power. Additionally special towers can be built if you acquire the right combination of towers. These towers have special effects that will help you to beat the later rounds. Each kill a tower gets will increase its damage permanently, and combining towers will add the kills of all towers combined. Making sure the right towers get the kills early on will help you make powerful combinations later on.<h3>Fight</h3>Each round a wave of enemies will spawn that will get increasingly more difficult with different challenges that you will face such as flying, sprinting, or boss monsters. Enemies have different armor types that makes them either more resistant or more vulnerable to certain tower damage types. This makes your tower selections each round even more important. Use the damage meter to help optimize your towers and placements, and see which towers are most effective.<h3>Upgrade</h3>Each kill you get will grant you gold which can be used to increase the chance you will get higher quality towers in the following rounds. You can also use your gold to increase the chance of getting a certain tower type each round. This can be used to try build specific special towers.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-19T03:33:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/087/087d1054f8bb2d47785cb4910b3cf2c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 371, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MM Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["MM Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
