My Cauldron's Conjuring Trash!!", "description": "<p>Game made for Ludum Dare 42 (theme: \"running out of space\"). Done by me, using Aseprite and Game Maker Studio. Big thanks to Katarynka (@Katarynke) for making background music for my game! Also shoutout to everyone that helped me with the title, mechanics etc. <br/><br/>Play as a witch that needs to destroy her own cauldron which began spawning rubbish at her house. <br/></p>\n<p>Arrows to move<br/>E to pick up<br/>R to use/throw away</p>\n\n<p>Pick up trash and throw it away to the fire. Cleaning removes a little bit of of cauldron's energy. If there's too much rubbish, you will lose.<br/>Use alchemy table to craft potions. They can be thrown to the cauldron to remove some of it's energy. Destroy the cauldron to win.</p>\n<p>Feel free to report any bugs! Thanks in advance. I know that menu can get resized weirdly after playing in fullscreen but I don't know yet what causes it.<br/>The game may be a little bit unbalanced (it's too easy, perhaps?). Hopefully you will have some fun nevertheless!!</p>\n\n<p>All in all, I'm really glad for parcipating in this jam (despite being around 18 hours late). It was my first ludum dare! And my third game made entirely by myself.</p>\n<p>Enjoy! /(oxo)\\<br/>@zozolka</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e7/3e7d54a9c4e36d28637e76440f082413.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zozolka"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
