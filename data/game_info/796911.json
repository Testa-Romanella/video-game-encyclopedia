Just a little test map and a work in progress vehicle controller. I mostly spent the time working on vehicle controller and camera controller code and trying out the 32 bit style a little. It was a start of trying to attempt to recreate a little Korean fishing village I visited near Ulsan. Also inspired by Hometown Cha-cha-cha.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before the gamejam all I had was a different car controller that I thought I could use for this project. I ended up having to rewrite the controller anyways so I basically started the jam from scratch, although I did have a higher poly version of the truck model which I could trace to make this one.</p>\n<p>Controls -</p>\n<p>WASD / Arrow keys / Gamepad controls to drive the truck.</p>\n<p>Mouse to look around.</p>\n<p>R to reset.</p>\n<p>Shift and Ctrl change gears, however that doesn't do anything but change the sound.</p>\n\n<p>Bugs - you might not be able to hear the engine, but it is supposed to play audio.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T16:36:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/121/121bbf41d68dc77dc7f06a91eba28e6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["weirdybeardyman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
