Delay your inevitable bankruptcy for as long as possible. Once your treasury is empty you can use the experience from your last failure to improve your skills and try again.</p>\n\r\nDetails\r\n\n\r\nResources\r\n<strong>Resource</strong><strong>Description</strong>You get\u00a0<strong><em>Souls</em></strong>\u00a0for killing enemies.\u00a0<strong><em>Souls</em></strong>\u00a0are spent when using skills (except for punching, which is free).<strong>EXP</strong>You also get\u00a0<strong><em>Experience</em></strong>\u00a0for killing enemies.This is your pension. The knights will try to steal it from you. Your place looks like a dungeon, they just can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s inevitable that you will not have enough\u00a0<strong><em>Gold</em></strong>\u00a0left at some point. You lose the game if your\u00a0<strong><em>Gold</em></strong>\u00a0falls below the marked threshold.\r\n\r\nNotes / other features\r\n<p>On reaching new stages (A stage being the number of spawned enemies over the whole run.), you can increase the starting stage of your next run to fasten up the gamplay a bit. You also start with an adequate amount of souls for the selected starting stage.\r\n</p>\n<p>Your experience and skill levels are saved persistently (also in the Web version). So you can leave the game and come back later if you would like to continue for some further runs.</p>\n\n\r\nChange log\r\n<ul><li><strong>V2 -</strong>\u00a0April 6th 2022: Some balance changes including buffs for skeletons and barricades.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T15:48:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a3/5a30a694ef91d8a90bc71746f0b05970.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Andreas Roschal", "woergbi", "BananaBobBert", "Tyraktar", "Mowerick", "Xayos"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
