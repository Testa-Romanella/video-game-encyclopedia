{"id": 36858, "slug": "eets", "name": "Eets", "name_original": "Eets", "description": "<p>Eets is a puzzle game developed by Klei Entertainment. The game draws heavy inspiration from the classic Lemmings and The Incredible Machine. There is no story mode present in the game.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game features 100 levels with 600 more available for download free of charge. </p>\n<p>Eets is the main protagonist of the game. This tiny creature is afraid of the dark, gets angry when it gets hit and becomes happy when it eats a bit of small sweet orbs. The main objective of each level is to guide Eets to the exit of the level by manipulating his mood, solving puzzles and putting specific items in the right places. For example, explosive mushrooms can be used to get Eets over a pitfall, whales can be used to push the items up in the air, and the gravity pills can allow Eets to reverse the gravity and walk on the ceiling. </p>\n<p>The game features a mood system. When Eets is angry, it jumps a bit higher. If it is frightened, it may not jump at all. </p>\n<p>In the Xbox 360 version of the game, an action mode is included. This mode is heavily inspired by the Patapon series of games, where the players use the button combinations for Eets to execute specific actions and prevent it from getting killed by an endless horde of enemies created from something that appears to be Marshmallow. There are multiple types of these enemies, each of which acts out differently.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2006-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T07:49:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/104/1041893771063f87d42aa8098561e472.jpg", "website": "http://www.eetsgame.com", "rating": 1.61, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 16, "owned": 371, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 7}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 18, "suggestions_count": 244, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 18, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Klei Entertainment"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Klei Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
