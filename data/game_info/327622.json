The amount of stuff I learned about making multiplayer games has definitely changed the way I see multiplayer games overall.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, in this game, team up with your friends over the internet and shoot zombies while waiting for a resupply from the chopper. Choose from the Grenadier, Scout, Shotgunner, Tank or the Sniper, each with their own abilities, and kill all the zombies. Ignore the fact that you don't actually hold a shotgun, and fire shells from your chest. Hey, it's a prototype.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-14T03:55:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8cb/8cba3ca30b74d47915445199116a07b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bts_ash"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
