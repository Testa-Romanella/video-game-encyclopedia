Hurl your large truck around one of several circuits to a soundtrack of suitably heavy music with engine growling--and appropriate bangs and crashes should the armco sneak up on you. You practice during the Saturday fixtures and race for real on Sundays (happily you&#39;re not expected to play in real time). There are 11 European tracks, eight customisable trucks and drivers. You have control over such things as the hardness of the springs, tyre pressures, rear axle ratio and shock absorbers and even how much diesel you take on and how much water for the brakes. It&#39;s also possible to turn on driver aids like ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) and ESP--it&#39;s not clear whether this stands for Extra Sensory Perception or something more mundane. For each track there&#39;s an aerial view with sectors marked and details of track length and records.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-08T04:22:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/6f0/6f036b1e957e5db6637d7d49fdd6fdbb.jpg", "website": "http://www.mbtr.de/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 395, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Synetic"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["THQ"], "esrb_rating": null}
