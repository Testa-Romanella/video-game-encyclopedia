Your city is craving a monument. To put\u00a0 it together you need to provide the construction site with material and some fleshly currency. This currency will spawn in your city if you provide enough food. Beware, since there is a serious deflation going on, which is heard to worsen during food shortages.<br/></p>\n<p>When you have provided your monument with enough material you can watch it rising up step by step. News of the monument has spread to your neighbors and they do not want you to have this glory, be prepared to defend your city from enemies.</p>\n<p>We wanted to do a small project this time and it turned out to be bigger than we thought. The plan was to implement three stages/levels: Egypt, Greece, and Rome, but we only managed to finish the first two. It is our first game with sound and we believe the music turned out pretty well. Also, our time management got better so we could testplay the game the first time Saturday night.</p>\n<p>Play LD version online</p>\n<p>Play Post-LD version online<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T08:45:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a5/9a5fc383aa4e43ce2729aa53869c694b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["FluffyVoxels"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
