You are the only one<br/>who can prevent total nuclear annihilation.<br/><br/><strong>From the maker of the cult hit 128k!</strong><br/><br/><br/><strong>Translate the language, decrypt the computer, and save the world.</strong><br/><br/> <h3>How does it work?</h3>Atomograd (stylized Atom\u262dgrad) is a point 'n click computer simulation game, where you have to do everything in your power to disable the nuclear weapons in a cold war-era Soviet nation. <br/><br/>You play as an American agent who managed to break into a Soviet air base, in the region of Atomograd. You sit down in front of an old 80's computer with the mission to disarm the nuclear warheads, but it turns out to be a more challenging task than you though it would be. Every line of text and every recording is in a  foreign language you don't recognize. All you have to your aid is an morse based messaging system, and your personal sense of linguistic pattern recognition.<br/>Search through documents, video clips and chat logs to decrypt the mysterious computer in this <strong>first ever linguistic puzzler</strong> to save the world from nuclear demise!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-29T02:33:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/761/76186907238f30e712bca40418cb29b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Petter Malmehed", "J\u00f6sses", "Deklaration"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Petter Malmehed"], "esrb_rating": null}
