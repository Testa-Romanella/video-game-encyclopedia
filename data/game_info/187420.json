I created the character model Dave along with his skeletal rig and animations, as well as the enemy models skeletal rigs and animations, I also made one of the friends that you save at the end of the level Chomper who is a little guy with a spring and jumps up and down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I would list the other guys that created this game but they don't have itch.oi accounts and they kind don't really work on video games\u00a0 anymore.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game works very well but the man thing and the reason why I call it a rage game is because of the enemy collisions in the game they are kinda broke we tried to fix them but ran out of time. Their are also some other small things but the game is still playable and complete able.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c01/c0116bf74c9dae607997ccbe2bfd74df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crystal Nugent"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
