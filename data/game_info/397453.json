I used a mood board to help define the theme for my game inside my head, and I think it turned out well. The game revolves around you, an astronaut who is exploring a distant planet in space. The player comes across an asteroid just chilling, until you push him and start his journey down a series of hills. The asteroid wants revenge, and enlists a fleet of his brothers to stop your exploration. In the final level, you both make peace, and go on to explore the cosmos as comrades. <br/>The background for level 1, and sprites for all of the boxes in my levels are from the artist Aiden Art on the Unity Asset Store. All mechanical code was written by Michael Baker.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-09T04:02:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f0f/f0f81c7fb111f24204bc5a23157d9535.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Connor Blankenship"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
