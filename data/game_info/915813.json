Does this colon ever end? Just keep the colonoscope between the colon walls by using the A button (Although the B button might have been more appropriate for this game).</p>\n<p>Enjoy this silly little game and I will update with more bum puns soon.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Also this project is open sourced if you'd like to take a look https://github.com/anefiox/SFCave<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T11:41:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79b/79bd7e85899a39d9d4e7aa6060554760.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["anefiox"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
