In addition, the game features a combination of inhouse and outsourced assets - The Main Hub and Laboratory being almost exclusively inhouse.\r\nOverall, it has been a blast to work on and I hope you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed working on it!\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nCredits\r\n<strong>Producer<br/>Raven Hoegalmen\u00a0(Linkedin)</strong>\n<strong>Art<br/>Ed Swinbourne - Art rep &amp;\u00a0Environment Artist (Artstation)<br/>Thomas Moore - Prop &amp; Environment Artist\u00a0(Artstation)<br/>William Capewell - Prop Artist (Artstation)<br/>Stefan Suciu - Character Artist &amp; Animator (Artstation)<br/><br/>Code<br/>Kurtis Watson - Code Rep, Player &amp; Puzzle Mechanics\u00a0(Portfolio)<br/>Nikodem Hamrol - UI &amp; Tools\u00a0(Portfolio)<br/>Gaetano Trovato - Tools &amp; Gameplay\u00a0(LinkedIn)<br/>Michalis Stratis - Menus (LinkedIn)<br/>Saurya Saurav - AI &amp; Gameplay (Portfolio)<br/><br/>Design<br/>Adam Lorincz - Level &amp; Enemy Designer (Linkedin)<br/>Sema Ermis - UI Designer (Linkedin)<br/>Will Rogers - Narrative &amp; Experience Designer (Portfolio)<br/><br/>Voice Acting<br/>Alix Perry - Julia (Portfolio)<br/>Antonio Roulet - Clarus (StarNow)</strong>\n<strong>Special Thanks To<br/>Kelvin Wong<br/>Zafar Qamar<br/>Zuby Ahmed</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T15:25:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a25/a250efe13729f08dbae23be6b68ddf9c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wotsern"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
