We started with a fish as the main character of the game, telling a story of finding the true self in the adventure.</p>\n\n<p>We expect to design 5 levels, and now complete the 3 levels of prototypes, the theme is water, fire, wood, followed by soil and gold, a very typical Chinese five elements theory.</p>\n\n<p>This demo version was released to hear a wider range of opinions. Game plot design, gameplay design, visual effects and more.</p>\n<p>In the next step we will no longer be limited to a fish as the protagonist, we hope that the protagonist will advance the entire story line in a more pure ink form.</p>\n<p>We hope that everyone will have fun and hope that more experienced people can join this creation, especially in technical art and level design.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-11T03:47:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/845/845e4256f5cecc0af81074c0772f722a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 175, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dongfangliu"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
