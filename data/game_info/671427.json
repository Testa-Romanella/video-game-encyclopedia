{"id": 671427, "slug": "a-grief", "name": "A grief", "name_original": "A grief", "description": "<p>'A grief' is a game about the five stages of grief. The player is represented by a peacock, which is my personal symbol of grief as my deceased grandfather raised peacocks that died after his passing one by one, like falling petals. The stages of grief are explored through different rooms: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and the final room which is locked- acceptance.\u00a0To access the room of acceptance, the player collects closure as they pass through the other rooms and two keys for opening the locked door. To\u00a0pass through the room of acceptance, the player enters one final door in an empty grave that unites the player with their grief and helps them cross it.</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T05:30:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0aa/0aa1de953a83c27f5778d9a0f30e7974.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["zahramansoor"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
