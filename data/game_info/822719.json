This a very very early concept for the game with some but not all mechanics I wish to have. This game is also my submission for the two week summer game jam. The story of the first level is that there sharks who have evolved legs, just when you though it was safe to walk on land.</p>\n<p>If you like the look of it give it a download. I\u00a0do plan on developing the game further and adding more features and polish existing ones.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T18:08:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92f/92fcf35f6a3c085b4405bf7997abfebe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LowPolyAssets"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
