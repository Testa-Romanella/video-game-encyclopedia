It's based on my own experience\u00a0with the\u00a0sickness. Everything\u00a0you're\u00a0about\u00a0to\u00a0play\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0true\u00a0story.\u00a0Even\u00a0the\u00a0journals are\u00a0clipped\u00a0from\u00a0journal\u00a0entries\u00a0I\u00a0actually\u00a0wrote.\u00a0<br/><br/>With that in mind, the game is in early development, so be patient. With the game's Kickstarter we hope to improve the game even more than it is now.<br/><br/>Here is a full commentary video on the game:</p>\r\n\r\n***A few problems****\r\n<p>If the framerate lowers during gameplay, especially if you are streaming, try the different versions of the game below. The slowness is due to your computer's resolution.<br/><br/>Also, lighting does not build for certain scenes. It's random every time. We don't know what's causing this.\u00a0 Yes, we googled it. \u00a0If you think you know the solution, contact us. <br/></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>If you liked what you played, or even think it can be BETTER, follow our pre launch Kickstarter page!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>@HLNunnelly - graphics/coding/overall development<br/><br/>@elenaiwilliams - music<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T13:27:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7aa/7aa147ad65ddfd1b900842d8a0cdcb53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HLNunnelly"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
