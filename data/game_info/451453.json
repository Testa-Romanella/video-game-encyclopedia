There are 3 sub rooms (located in the room that follows the initial one) that hide the batteries, but one of the rooms can only be unlocked with a certain number of batteries. The rooms are protected by soldiers and ninjas who move horizontally, watch and chase you if you are at a certain horizontal distance in the vicinity and make you lose when they touch you.And if the player keeps himself without changing status (walking, standing, crouching, jumping) the baby starts to cry and consumes chocolates. If the chocolates reach 0 the game is over.\u00a0With the dash, you can cross soldiers and ninjas without losing the game (but you will be chased if you see it), with the jump you can get out of sight of the guards, you can climb platforms by jumping on them, in addition, he can hide crouched behind boxes, drinking fountains and barrels.</p>\n<p>\u00a0ProgrammerSpeedrun:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T06:46:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/842/8426558d78822ee327b8845e884b7e95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Megastrons"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
