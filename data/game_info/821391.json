Each turn raised spikes become unraised and unraised spikes become raised.</p>\n<p>Dices can have two elemental abilities: Ice and Fire.</p>\n<p>Fire can burn down wood, how many it will burn down depends on the die side.</p>\n<p>Fire also can melt ice, how many tiles it will unfreeze depends on the die side.</p>\n<p>Ice can freeze water, how many tiles it will freeze depends on the die side.</p>\n<p>There's only one special die, it's infinity. Dies that are infinite can't be destroyed, only used, infinite die with fire/ice elemental will melt/freeze every single entity it had connection to.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>W/A/S/D - Character movement</p>\n<p>Spacebar - Dice roll</p>\n<p>1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9 - Hotkeys for choosing a die</p>\n<p>Ctrl + 1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9 - Hotkeys for choosing an item</p>\n<p>To move select a die and click on the character, the side of the die will determine amount of turns you have.</p>Known Issues:<p>Spike collision might be broken in windows/linux/mac builds, they should work as expected in web.</p><p>Diagonal movement breaks many levels, so no, that's not an intended solution, the only levels that require diagonal movement are the last two.<br/></p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Programming: Emilly</p>\n<p>Art: Emilly, Therealtamatus</p>\n<p>Made using Godot Engine.<br/></p>\r\nAttributions:\r\n<p>Fonts: KennyNL<br/></p>\n<p>Music: josefpres<br/></p>\n<p>Sound effects: jsfxr, KennyNL, JustInvoke<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T08:17:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/910/910049387f0e8f4b501c66387a90e125.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Jamker"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
