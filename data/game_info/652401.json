So this is very rough and basic while I get down functions to work correctly but the idea is to play as a hero who is a slime that has tasked himself with defeating a big bad that other heroes believe doesn't even exist. Along the way you gain some followers to be in your party. I'm attempting to bring in a semi-persona system where you progressively gain cores that you can switch between to use different abilities to beat opponents the best way.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T02:00:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f71/f71e510edbc3a7233f2a9a3a2d973c51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AwkwardCrying"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
