Features such as screenshakes, stamina bars, basic animation, falling leaves and a few more coding techniques\u00a0which can be\u00a0used in future games.</p>\n<p>I also made all the art myself, except the fonts (used dafont.com for those). I do think I did\u00a0an alright job with the art, it still needs a lot of work, but I think this is far beyond what I have done before. This was also my first time doing animations without a sprite sheet\u00a0(the axe swings) and I think it turned out great! I know I've only used and made pixel art in the past but I would love to do some 3D modelling and some vector art! It would definitely put my drawing tablet to good use.</p>\n<p>Overall this was a great learning experience and really helped me out of the creative slump I've been in. It's been almost six months since I've even touched the unity engine or even made anything close to a game, however over the last few weeks I have been following a couple tutorials on youtube to learn more and this was my first game since I came back.</p>\n<p>This game has also shown me how much more I want to learn, such as: Music development, animation, UI, new forms of artwork, and few smaller ones mostly based on improving my previous basic knowledge. I hope that if you follow my page that you look forward to seeing more of my projects in the next few weeks.</p>\n<p>Thank you again! I hope you enjoy playing!</p><p>Haha, just remembered by last game was called Dropped!, I really need to come up with more creative names in the future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T02:22:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3df/3df9d8da29a6aadb3b3113b76b23145e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lexloug"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
