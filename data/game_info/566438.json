I am currently working on an idea for another game, and these are some of the mechanics that I\u00a0want to implement into that game, so I thought a good first game would be just testing out and learning to create those mechanics.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was created for a school project and I want to thank the teacher for having this project because without it, I don't think I would have ever actually finished this.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing my game!
