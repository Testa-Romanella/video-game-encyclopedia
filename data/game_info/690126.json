A story about self-discovery, self-love, and acknowledging change.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>As the first game released by Autumn Realms Interactive, we hope that our game creates a conversation about what we called during development \"the now\". The way society works is always evolving and so many lifestyles exist around the world, but there's always some shared experiences or feelings that we all have growing up. But this will definitely change and also be different for every generation forward! That being the case, we'd love to hear about your thoughts on what you've experienced growing up, whether it follows with what the visual novel addresses or not!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T10:22:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d84/d843b3a13973e7a6359dd20ddffc3b89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["autumnrealms-ia"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
