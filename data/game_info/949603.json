I've decided to compile a collection of almost <strong><em>every surviving gamedev project</em></strong> I've built in the last 12+ years! Not counting different builds of the same game, there are about <strong><em>39 different projects</em></strong> included in this collection! It felt very cathartic to put this together, but I hope other people find some of these interesting.<br/></p>\n<p>Here's a list of highlights:</p>\n<ul><li>BUDD (Classic)</li><li>Frostbite Crawl</li><li>Sonic Round 7</li><li>Lana's Nightmare</li><li><strong><em>Kappa's Adventure (2015 Demo)</em></strong></li><li><em><strong>Crystal Heart</strong><strong> (Various Builds)<br/></strong></em></li><li><strong><em>The RPG Maker Predecessor to BUDD</em></strong></li><li>BUDD (Modern) Engine test</li><li>Fantasy Zone HD demo</li><li>Prototypes for the very earliest Kappa games</li><li>Archives from the Steam Workshop long thought lost</li><li><strong><em>And many, MANY more!<br/></em></strong></li></ul>\n<p>They should be split up by completion status. Finished games, anything relating to Crystal Heart, demos with a playable amount of work done, prototypes with a few mechanics but no gameplay loop yet, and projects that take a bit of extra work to get running.</p>\n Some\u00a0were\u00a0omitted\u00a0just\u00a0because\u00a0I didn't\u00a0think they\u00a0were interesting (like basic character controllers), homebrew that would require an emulator, or\u00a0because they were mods for other games.\r\n<p>\u00a0<em>Or because I'm still developing them.<br/></em></p>\n<p>A huge thank you to all my friends and collaborators that helped me with these over the years!  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T17:59:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30a/30a4d6ff7911e7329da9c294ee2b7b20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EngineerKappa"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
