And planet-rabbit-land, there is no water! So you must kill rabbits, harvest their blood, and use it to water your crops!</p><p>You will need either a Gameboy emulator, or a flash cart to play this, this is a *REAL* Gameboy DMG game!</p><p>-- Controls --<br/>D-Pad - Move<br/>A - Shoot<br/>B - Water Crops</p><p>-- More details --<br/>PlantBoy was a challenge, the goal was never to win, or even do well! I set out in the hopes of creating a simple, functioning *real* Gameboy game, written fully in z80 assembly in 48 hours.</p><p>Having about only a weeks experience in z80 assembly, and only little knowledge of assembly in general this was a big challenge. I'm happy with how far I got though, I plan to refine the code a little in the next few days.</p><p>Oh, and if anyone actually does play this on a physical Gameboy, and not an emulator, please record a video of it and show me! I've only been able to test this on emulators myself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/997/99702ec040fee3c78b532a9adf774c67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["siO"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
