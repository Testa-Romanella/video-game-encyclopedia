The gameplay is most parts identical to that of previous game and consist of exploring surroundings, solving puzzles, and avoiding monsters. Like in the previous game, your character is practically unable to confront monsters and has to hide from them to survive. However, there is no more sanity meter, and inventory in Machine for Pigs and puzzles are more physics-based than in The Dark Descent. <br />\nIn Machine for Pigs, you play as Oswald Mandus, a first game protagonist\u2019s descendant, and successful industrialist. He recovers after a fever which lasted for a few months after a disastrous expedition in Mexico. Not remembering anything about it, later he finds out that he build a mysterious machine in the basement of his mansion and his house is full of swine-like monsters. The player must restore Oswald\u2019s lost memories and reveal the secret of the machine.</p>", "metacritic": 72, "released": "2013-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-19T05:08:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d9f/d9f982e042df6263684ba1fdea3efc1c.jpg", "website": "http://www.aamfp.com", "rating": 3.23, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 674, "owned": 5745, "beaten": 371, "toplay": 94, "dropped": 191, "playing": 9}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 7, "ratings_count": 663, "suggestions_count": 356, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 670, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["The Chinese Room"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Frictional Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
