There is one puzzel in every room. In the room there can be enemies patrolling or there can be enemy spawnwaves. The enemies drop health packs so you can heal yourself. If you die you can always respawn in the current room that you are in but all enemies will respawn and the puzzles will reset.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T04:01:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae2/ae25b4add8d15c6f320dcd4bf4feba99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tom Hardebol"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
