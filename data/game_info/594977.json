The goal is to  move one or more of your fish pieces to the bottom of the ocean, across 3  levels, avoiding being captured by enemy fishes.\r\n</p>\n<p>The pieces move similar to their Chess counterparts:  prawn (=pawn), anemone (=rook), seahorse (=knight), fishop (=bishop),  sharking (=king), jellyfish (=queen). Differently from Chess, there\u2019s no  check or mate, as long as a piece reaches the bottom you are good.  Anemones, fishopes and jellyfishes can\u2019t move down more than 3 tiles -  otherwise it would be an instant win.\r\n</p>\n<p>Unfortunately I couldn\u2019t  finish it in time for the Ludum Dare, but I don\u2019t want to throw the code  away so I\u2019ll keep working on it.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T11:50:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75d/75de21b064f3841f9de54ec7427f25ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wendel Scardua"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
