(Note:\u00a0I reuploaded the project to fix some bugs and remove the debug tools.)\u00a0I'm not sure but it didn't happen again so it seems fine. Also the quit button does not work. You have to reset the page to quit.</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>\"Disaster has struck! The evil spirit: \"Solkak\" has possessed the great sun spirit: \"Solotheo,\" and has set out on a mission to exterminate the Heilio people of the land. When it seemed like all hope was lost, one young boy: \"Soltek\" steps up to take down the spirit and save his people.\"</strong></em><br/></p>\n<p>Wrath of the Sun God is a platformer bullet hell made in 48 hours for the Ludum Dare jam #50, with the theme of \"Stop the Inevitable.\" In it you play as \"Soltek,\" a young Heilio boy, who sets out do destroy the corrupted sun spirit \"Solkak.\" Armed with the powerful \"Sunshot,\" Soltek has to enter the temple of Solkak and use his power to eliminate the sun spirit, and save his people!</p>\n<p><strong><em>-CONTROLS-</em></strong></p>\n<p>To move, use the arrow keys (keyboard,) or use the left control stick or D-pad (XBOX)</p>\n<p>To shoot, hold down X (keyboard,) or hold X / Y (XBOX)</p>\n<p>To jump, press Z (keyboard,) or press A (XBOX)</p>\n<p>Note: The yellow square on the player is the player's hitbox, I was going to have the visibility of it be toggled in the settings, but I ran out of time to implement it, thinking that players attempting \"Hard Mode\" would appreciate it more.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Incorporation of the theme:\u00a0\u00a0</strong></em>Uhhhhh, to be fully honest I completely flopped here. The original idea for the game would have been fine, and if I had that extra day I could have accomplished it, but I guess the theme is in the story now, sorry about that. (See more about the original idea below)</p>\n<p><strong><em>-Overall am I satisfied with this entry?-</em></strong></p>\n<p>I'm very conflicted, on one hand I managed to make (in my opinion) a fun bullet-hell-like boss fight in two days! And it's way better than Ruben Goldberg (https://skript-kitty.itch.io/ruben-goldberg.)\u00a0But at the same time, compared to what I wanted to do before, I kinda failed. But that's just how\u00a0 the story unfolded I guess. But if I had to rank this, I'd give it a 6/10.\u00a0Well that's about it, see you next jam! -Skript Kitty</p>\n<p><strong><em>-Okay, so what the heck is this original idea you keep talking about?-</em></strong></p>\n<p>I keep mentioning it, so I'll share what the original Idea for the game was.</p>\n<p>The game was originally supposed to have you exploring the temple, and while you <strong><em>can </em></strong>fight the boss at any time, there are many upgrades you can get throughout the temple that are very powerful, the only thing is that the player would be on a strict timer, so they need to manage their time well, as if the timer runs out, Soltek's holy fire will consume the Heilio people. The collection of items would also explain how Soltek got their Sunshot. So overall I'd say this product could have been a lot better. Maybe I'll remake this someday, eh I'm not too in love with the story to really do that.</p>\n<p>And that's basically it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T20:58:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/513/51351d1b435bd90e3cdfdd373f85d2cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Skript-Kitty"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
