I really wish she would leave me alone.<br/>However, Numajiri seems to like me or something because whether I\u2019m sleeping or going to the convenience store, she always follows me around.<br/><br/><br/>\u201cBlack-Hearted Nurse\u201d Kiritani<br/>Voice: Ren Toyotaka<br/>Another member of the \u201cOG Three.\u201d<br/>When Yamaguchi told me my primary nurse for this week would be Kiritani, she looked at me like she was pitying me.<br/>I heard that Kiritani is a former delinquent who was feared by everyone in her hometown\u2026<br/>But I\u2019m not gonna trust the rumors! After all, Kiritani seems nice, inside and out. Maybe a bit frail-looking, but a real beauty with presence. Calling someone like that a former delinquent has got to be some kind of terrible joke. She actually treats me in the nicest way possible\u2026<br/><br/><br/>\u201cPsychopathic Nurse\u201d Tendo<br/>Voice: Miru<br/>Tendo is the last of the \u201cOG Three.\u201d<br/>She\u2019s an eccentric person who\u2019s always laughing. Is she always in a really good mood, or is she just completely cracked...?<br/>I think that rather than seeing me as a patient that needs assistance, she sees me more as a rarity and thus a friend worth playing with... or maybe a toy? <br/>Any way you slice it, she\u2019s a very dangerous person with no common sense.<br/>But since she\u2019s the daughter of the head nurse who basically runs this hospital, no one can tell her off.<br/>Will I make it to my discharge date safely?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-19T06:52:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef0/ef0a164562c187bef1d41399819ef3de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 209, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dark One!"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Shiravune"], "esrb_rating": null}
