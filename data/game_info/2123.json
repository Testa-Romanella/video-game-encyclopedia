After waking up in the middle of the night to mysterious sounds, you start exploring the dark looking for comfort.<br />\nThe game explores horror through atmosphere and exploration, not with scores and combat systems. In Among the Sleep you\u2019re vulnerable, scared, and trying to make sense of the world.<br />\nController support: Works 100% with Xbox 360 controllers, might have some issues with Xbox One controllers. We are sorry about the inconvience.<br />\nThe game will not get VR support.What people are saying<br />\n&quot;More, please!&quot;<br />\n- Kotaku<br />\n&quot;[...] it more than succeeds in creating a wonderfully eerie atmosphere full of childlike anxiety, and along the way tackles a serious subject in a darkly poignant manner.&quot;<br />\n- IGN<br />\n&quot;Its depiction of a first-person horror told through the eyes and stumbling little legs of a two-year old is as intriguing as anything I&#39;ve seen all year, and reminiscent of a time when games actively sought out new ways to play and new stories to tell.&quot;<br />\n- Eurogamer</p>", "metacritic": 66, "released": "2014-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-01T09:17:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/41b/41b9f5119f03663dcc3ead3501beab14.jpg", "website": "http://krillbite.com/ats", "rating": 3.46, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 141, "owned": 1150, "beaten": 187, "toplay": 48, "dropped": 52, "playing": 5}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 30, "ratings_count": 208, "suggestions_count": 376, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 212, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Krillbite Studio", "KrillbiteStudio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Krillbite Studio"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
