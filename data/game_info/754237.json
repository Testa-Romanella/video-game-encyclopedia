It's a free, nonprofit, passion project that I wanted to do in my free time. I am not expecting to be paid for this game (though donations are welcome) nor am I to be expected to finish this game very quickly. This is simply something I wanted to do for myself of my own free will.</p>\n<p>If you're looking for a RPG with an intricate story and detailed gameplay, you're out of luck. Yes, this game is pretty generic, but it was made to be fun rather than complex and detailed. Just try to have fun with the game even if the story and gameplay isn't what you're looking for.</p>\n<p>Also, given that this game is still in development, and that I'm only human, please report any bugs found in the game and do not be afraid to share or critique my game with suggestions to make it better or harder.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T14:53:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a0/6a0fb5ed81f57b85c3202e5f86d83f55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GhostlyGuy99"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
