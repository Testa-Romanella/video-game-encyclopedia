Dodge and avoid the mirrors and escape the factory, or die of shame!\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 This is my first game in Unity without the use of a tutorial, so be wary of the bugs that might be present. Use the WASD or arrow keys to move (including a double jump) and press escape at any time to go back to the menu. Please full screen the game, otherwise a portion of the screen seems to be cut off . Thank you for taking the time to view my game, and most important of all, enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/211/2117b06f3ba8acd44bb2876f5abca871.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zashers"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
