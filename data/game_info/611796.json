Through her journey she will learn that a lot of things she knew about being a mom are, in fact, misconceptions and as she gets rid of them she will be able to do things that she thought were impossible.<br/></p>\n<p>Your only enemy is gravity itself and the burden you carry. So as you advance and leave the burden behind, you will manage to go higher and further.<br/></p>\n<p>Some segments of this game are really hard and can be frustrating, but as you leave the unnecessary burdens behind things will start to become more pleasant.</p>\n<p>This is\u00a0my first published game.\u00a0 It was\u00a0initially made for the Jam9 game-jam\u00a0with the theme \"Mother\", but due to technical problems I couldn't submit it in time. Weeks later I took the project again to finish it. I reworked the level design and gave it some language options. As my mother's birthday approaches, I now publish this game as loving gift for her.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>In the near future I might implement some new features to the game, such as:</p>\n<ul><li>Checkpoints</li><li>Spanish translation</li><li>Pause Menu</li></ul>\n\n<p>That's it, enjoy the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T05:01:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8a/b8ad43de036a87d18e05eb12601f62f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rigashii"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
