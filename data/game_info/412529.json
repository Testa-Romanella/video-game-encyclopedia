(</strong>I was slow and kinda lazy to time it... was around 4h... I hope you enjoy it!)</p>\n<p>Since the theme was factory, I just had to make a sequel to my OG 1st TriJam game:\u00a0https://jdzsk.itch.io/acceptable-or-not-ducks</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>You work as a sorter in a Duck Factory.\u00a0Sort the ducks according to colors and earn score. The Duck\u00a0Factory has 3 strike policy, so you only have a chance to screw up 3 times before you're fired! Good luck!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 Quacks:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 https://freesound.org/people/Breviceps/sounds/445960/<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 https://freesound.org/people/Reitanna/sounds/242664/<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 https://freesound.org/people/mattlikestapes/sounds/398939/<br/>\u00a0 Music:<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 https://freesound.org/people/michorvath/sounds/412343/<br/>\u00a0 Font:<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lacquer?selection.family=Lacquer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-17T02:09:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85e/85e471196cf696f4142164281423aaf8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jdzsk"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
