Sounds simple right, but when you are battling the clock and new letters keep falling the challenge is on! Are you up to it?</p>\n<p>Thankfully to help you in your task we have assigned you a maximum of 6 power up slots to take into the game. These require energy and a minimum word score to unlock. I suggest you choose carefully. Speaking of power ups, there are 10 unlockable power ups in the game each with their own special ability in helping you clear the grid.\r\n</p>\n<p>Where do I get energy from, I hear you ask, each letter has a points value, and by combining letters to create words you get a word score. Simply put we convert your word score into energy. Any energy not expended in the early levels is banked as gold to help you when the game gets really tough!\r\n</p>\n\n<p>No Ads - No In App Purchase - Internet Connection Required</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-13T07:34:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7f/b7f8dd43801d29c4d88dd47c7e54d78e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["1982Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
