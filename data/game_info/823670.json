You must always stay quick on your feet, as ammo on the powerfull guns quickly depletes and your health and stamina are mainly refreshed by pickpups found around the map. Remember to always use  each gun for it's purpose, and don't just stand around shooting everything with a pistol. Invadead features an arcade mode, where your goal is to survive through the most levels in one go to build a streak, as you and zombies gain in new abilities, but also it features a more streamlined campaign. The game is PC exclusive, and better played on a qwerty keyboard.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T06:39:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe2/fe2bb10ac87811ec437fb70796a0385b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xx_ObamaDestroyer69_xX"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Xx_ObamaDestroyer69_xX"], "esrb_rating": null}
