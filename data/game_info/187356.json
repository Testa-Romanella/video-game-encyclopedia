{"id": 187356, "slug": "kingdom-essence", "name": "Kingdom Essence", "name_original": "Kingdom Essence", "description": "<p>Started out as a made-up game I used to play with some friends in another program (LDD), and at some point I was hit with the thought of whether the game could be made into a standalone, as the game was never really that complex in the first place, and from personal experience and friends it was quite fun.</p>\n<p>Hence I started making a much simpler version compared to the most advanced version of the original. As I wanted to make a small game that resembled the original but wasn't as complex (hence less time to make a first prototype), and when completed I play tested it with a friend who said it seemed very basic but was quite fun.</p>\n<p>At the moment the game contains no personally made graphics - instead is filled with basic colours - but soon\u00a0 I aim to change that. The mechanics of the game might not come straight away as there is some niches - such as you have to have a tile selected that you want to send population from to colonize another tile - this was done as various tiles have different populations and this way you can choose which tile the settlers come from and how many. The combat system is basically a system of integers with Warriors having a value of 3 and normal population a value of 1.</p>\n<p>Each kingdoms goal is to destroy all the kingdoms and remain as the last standing - the average game time can vary massively depending on how passive the players are.</p>\n<p>The game can theoretically be played by any number of players - but there is a limit which is related to how many tiles there are - which currently is 15.</p>\n<p>A lot of updates and improvements are already on the drawing board as the game doesn't even resemble the original at the moment - which has such things as food, animals (horses/elephants), slavery (when you battle other kingdoms tiles and take the population into slavery), building various parts of a full-set of armour and weapons, diplomacy between kingdoms, and much more.</p>\n<p>Either way try it out and see how it goes - all comments are greatly appreciated, especially if reporting bugs or improvement suggestions.
