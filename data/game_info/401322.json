You must take the role as Santa, and fix his mistakes, and make\u00a0sure that all of the presents are sorted in the right piles. Do your best to sort as many presents as you can as efficiently as possible!</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>For the Game Intro text, just press Enter or Space to scroll through it when it loads. It can sometimes be buggy, but we ran out of time to fix that.</p>\n<p>Other then that, very simple controls. The top elf is controlled with <strong>W</strong> and the bottom elf with <strong>S</strong>. The rest should be pretty self explanatory based on color and location.</p>\n<p><strong>CHALLENGES:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This quick little game was made of course for the Mega Tri-Jam 2019.
