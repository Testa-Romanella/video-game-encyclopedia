It's a simple clicker game where you mine dogecoin. You can buy new equipment and inflate the price of doge, and it looks pretty satisfying I think.</p>\n<p>I wanted to add a lot more, but I'm feeling burnt out and want to move on to the next project so I wrapped this up. The biggest problem it has is that the Doge or USD can overflow into the negatives if you're too epic at the game. So, just don't be too epic. That is all.</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, if you feel like donating, here's my Dogecoin address:\u00a0DTR8H8LCg97PAzzzdfx7fE6Zwkd59VXkLa</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T08:42:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eae/eae081d1ad9185dae64472b7096e2938.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Harper Rhett"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
