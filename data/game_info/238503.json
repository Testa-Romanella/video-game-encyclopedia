You can play with either keyboard or gamepad (controls on main menu). We made this game in gamemaker studio. This was our first gamejam ever so please be nice ! We could not make it playable on the web but you can still download the zip file, Thank you for playing ;)</p>\n<p>Proraming + level design = Edgar B.</p>\n<p>Graphic assets = Leonard B.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/706/706c8f36697a41a41760236f763e557f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ouragan84"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
