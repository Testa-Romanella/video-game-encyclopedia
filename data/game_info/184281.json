Some blocks appear to be real but are just visual illusions. The player has to use cherries to check which of the blocks are safe to jump to. When the player finds the fake blocks he can hit them with the cherries to turn them real for a few seconds. But be careful because you have limited cherries, so use them well! <br/></p><p><strong>Controls<br/></strong>Arrows - Movement<br/>Mouse - Point<br/>Right Click - Throw cherry<br/>Left Click - Interact</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e32/e3201a3945d9018cfb0d9dd2afe7d5e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IPCAGameJam"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
