This is in fact one of the only true Big Chungus games (and is different from any others). Now, is it really that involved, you ask? Of course not. Is this ready to be shipped off to Gamestop? I doubt it, but that would be really neat! Does it look like it was designed by a grade school computer class? Probably. But is it a playable game with the legendary Big Chungus? You bet it is! And I say, that's all we need (mainly since I\u00a0don't know how to officially code), but either way, here you have it :)</p>\n<p>Enjoy, and feel free to share this game with others!
