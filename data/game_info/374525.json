Additionally, you are not forced to move forward\u2014you also gain the ability to stand still and move backwards. This allows you to stick to boxes by reversing into them, along with many more interesting effects.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game fully explores the consequences of the new mechanics in the 60+ levels offered, requiring the player to understand the new ways that they can move. Eventually, three different colors of boxes and color checking gates are added, expanding the difficulty and scope of the puzzles.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-16T02:18:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9b/c9b40d3c0651638f60b058bd4657ba14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 4, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ramsey Boyce"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Ramsey Boyce"], "esrb_rating": null}
