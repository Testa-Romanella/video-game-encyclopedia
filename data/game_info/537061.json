Time to steal some presents with a twist. Your life depends on it. The more presents you steal, the more lives you have. The aim is simple, steal and many presents while getting away safetly.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Your main goal is to get through the portal in each level without falling to the enemies. Each time you fail a level you lose a present, if you run out of presents and die, you lose. Collect presents from the levels to gain additional lives so you can make a few mistakes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Light Red Enemies</strong>: Moves every 2 ticks towards you. If they get too close you are toast.</p>\n<p><strong>Dark\u00a0Red Enemies</strong>: Moves every 4 ticks towards you. They function the same as the light red enemies, just slower.\u00a0</p>\n\n<br/><strong>Keyboard</strong><strong>Controller</strong><strong>Movement</strong>W,A,S,D or Arrow KeysLeft Joystick<strong>Confirm</strong>E or EnterA (South Button)<strong>Cancel/Return</strong>Q or BackspaceB (East Button)<strong>Pause Game</strong>EscapeStart Button\r\n\n<p>The entire idea for the game came from the video above, mostly the way the knights move in the early stages and the clear beat on their movement.
