Your powers are being tested - your touch moves objects back and forth in their timeline, like a selective time-travel. Your left hand rewinds time, your right hand fast-forwards it.<br/></p>\n<p>Who are you? Are you the only experiment in the lab? What did you do - or what are you about to do? Use your powers and put together the clues to sort out the story!</p>\r\nHelp us out! Add your level!\r\n<p>The game as it is now is the skeleton structure of a potentially very longer series of puzzle to solve. How would you use these powers to create new levels? What combinations can you think of? Just write us everything - and we\u2019ll add YOUR level to the game!</p>\r\nTeam\r\n<p><strong>Concept &amp; Coding </strong>Michelangelo Alesi</p>\n<p><strong>Sound design</strong> Nicolo Traini</p>\n<p><strong>Story &amp; Graphics</strong> Leda Baol</p>\n<p>3D models created by <strong>Quaternius</strong>,<br/>distributed under Public Domain license (CC0)<br/>Typeface \"Mattone\" by <strong>Collletttivo</strong>,<br/>distributed under SIL Open Font License Version 1.1</p>\n<p>This game was originally uploaded for the GameDev.tv Community Jam 1-31 May 2020 \"Time\"</p>\n<p>Average playtime: 15 minutes</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-01T04:06:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09b/09ba1cc45a17a509d3a7b051422fac87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Mic", "Leda", "nicolot"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
