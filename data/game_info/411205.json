This project is part of the final year for the Game Design bachelor, we've been working for 3 months on <strong>preproduction</strong>, looking for design ideas, testing and prototyping each. The game is designer for <strong>mobile experience</strong>. The goal was to present in december a brief <strong>gameplay prototype</strong> of what the game is going to be, every human ressources were <strong>focused </strong>and the <strong>game design</strong> of the game during that period and to study the <strong>feasibility </strong>of the project.</p>\n<p>\u00a0It's only on January than the research on theme and artistic direction would begin, simultaneously entering the production. The production was supposed to last for 6 month.</p>\r\nGame Design Post-Mortem\r\n\r\nGame system\r\n\n<p>Players will be proposed a succession of little puzzle. We planned to deliver several \"world\", each world introducing and exploiting a new mechanic. A world is divided into <strong>10 puzzle situations</strong>, the last challenge offering a fight against the super unit of the region.</p>\n<p><strong>One level, one set up, several ending</strong>. The player player will face a group of enemies trying to push him towards the bounds of the map to kill him. During a game his <strong>reflection</strong> will be challenged, <strong>planning </strong>next turn, we oriented the system so that players have to constantly <strong>think</strong> the <strong>outcome </strong>of their <strong>decision</strong>. \"Is this position dangerous ?\", \"Can I get rid of this opponent without putting myself in danger ?\"</p>\n<p>To get rid of enemies, since they don't have any life or anything, you'll have to push them against map border. This will instantly froze them to death. Each action spending <strong>action</strong> from a <strong>pool </strong>that's being refreshed every new player's turn. If the player <strong>succeed </strong>at <strong>completing </strong>the level he will <strong>unlock </strong>the next one, earning <strong>upgrade</strong> for the character (such as range for spell, 1 more action to the pool, etc ...).</p>\r\nMechanics\r\n\n<p>Players have 2 main mechanics for World 1.</p>\n<ul><ul><li>The first is a <strong>teleport</strong>. Player is able to target a tile and it will place him. But there is a twist, if the player use this ability <strong>targeting </strong>an <strong>opponent </strong>you'll <strong>swap </strong>position with him, this action as the<strong> same cost </strong>but a stronger out come.</li><li>The second mechanic is a <strong>push </strong>in a straight line. The player is then able to eliminate opponent by pushing them on map border, but also to <strong>use terrain </strong>gameplay <strong>elements</strong>, such a ice-block in the World 1.</li></ul></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-10T03:15:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d12/d122fd0252030a4b76caa094b5ed9b58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Quentin_Frehring"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
