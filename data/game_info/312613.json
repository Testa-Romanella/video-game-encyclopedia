Lies, betrayal, intrigues, unexpected well-wishers ... The turns of events follow one after another. The atmosphere is created by a mystical background, a feeling of loss and hopelessness, and not by any means elements of horror brought from typical &quot;horror films.&quot; Frankly, there\u2019s nothing much to be afraid of besides, perhaps, a crushing, utopian atmosphere. Walking through the infected quarter, past moldy \u201ccrying\u201d houses, poisonous fumes and zombies wrapped in dirty sheets, makes you uneasy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2005-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-23T11:30:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/0e8/0e861e17ea34d020ecef9b17f0a25eb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.32, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 29, "owned": 43, "beaten": 43, "toplay": 46, "dropped": 32, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 69, "suggestions_count": 263, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 69, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ice-Pick Lodge"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["G2 Games"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
