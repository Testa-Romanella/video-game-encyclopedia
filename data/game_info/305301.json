{"id": 305301, "slug": "corona-borealis-pre-orders", "name": "Corona Borealis (pre-orders)", "name_original": "Corona Borealis (pre-orders)", "description": "June Pinegar is forced to spend the summer working at her father\u2019s quaint country caf\u00e9, far away from her urban home in New York City. Will romance spark with the dutiful barista or friendship form with the bubbly cashier? Or perhaps she\u2019ll mend the strained relationship between her and her quirky father. One thing is certain: with each passing day, June is finding herself more and more charmed by the intoxicating mystique of the Southern town and its residents.\r\nCorona Borealis is a heartwarming story that shows the lasting effects our lives are capable of having on others, as well as their effects on us. Rather than just providing the player with romance options, it aims to explore the depths of non-romantic relationships, too.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-01T03:25:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cd/4cd4d8a0899a5b44e5a516120ba42f5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 470, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Winter Wolves"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
