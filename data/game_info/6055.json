Match brains vertically or horizontally to eliminate the monsters feeding on them.

Clear the stages to earn Zombucks you can use to unlock special items at the helpful ice cream truck. Challenge the unlockable Endless mode to see how long you can hold out against the full weight of the undead invasion. Collect all of the different scientists, and try your luck at the tough-as-nails Hard mode.
