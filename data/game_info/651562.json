Point and click action, ridiculously rendered in stunning 3D for no good reason! Limitless replayability with procedurally generated puzzles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Make the cards the\u00a0same colour to win, winning 5 matches unlocks the next level of difficulty.</p>\n<p>Does it work on mobile? Hell no! After all the time I sunk into making sure the screen resizes nicely it turns out that the\u00a0 HTML5 build\u00a0falls over on mobile. I'll add an android build if I can figure it out.</p>\n<p>Made\u00a0during the StopWaitingForGodot game jam created by Terry Cavanagh - this was my first go at Godot.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T22:17:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c69/c694fc3314c91ee93a85f159d7812c97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["megalomatt"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
