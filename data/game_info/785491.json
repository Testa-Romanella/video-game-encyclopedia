{"id": 785491, "slug": "familiars", "name": "Familiars", "name_original": "Familiars", "description": "<p><em>Familiars</em> is a witch themed 2D RPG that was developed in my personal C++ engine\u00a0over the course of three months. In this game, players become a witch who can create potions, consult tarot cards, and explore an endless forest with an animal familiar. Players can talk to their loyal companion by typing any text input, and a response is generated using natural language processing techniques. The familiar can recognize special commands to perform tasks for the player, but otherwise, it converses as a chatbot.</p>\n<p>I love cozy games and am interested in the development of buddy A.I. My goal for this game was to combine those two concepts; I wanted to create a world where players could enjoy a relaxing environment, perform optional thematic tasks, and bond with a friendly A.I. that can display own opinions and emotions. I hope you enjoy, and I look forward to expanding this concept in the future!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T18:38:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/935/935191ff086109d3f56c4a7565582e5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UnimoonMedia"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
