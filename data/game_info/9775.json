It allows a party host to scare the guest, while they are facing some of the many phobias people have like: rats, spiders, fierce dogs, hypodermic needles, blood, claustrophobia and even death itself.  This experience was created with the idea of using props like a feather duster, can of compressed air, spray bottle of water and other items to give the guest an unexpected surprise while they are taken to their Final Rest. <strong>To win prizes</strong> upload your videos of your victims being frightened on social media using hashtag #FinalRestVR or reply to the trailer on Youtube and we will be choosing the winners bi-weekly and promoting your video on our social media sites. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5gu73F5344", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:14:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c8/6c8205551913156885e4d2ebb44ef8d7.jpg", "website": "http://www.slipgate.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Slipgate Studios"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Slipgate Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
