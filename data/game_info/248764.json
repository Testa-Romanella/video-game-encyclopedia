A small finite runner, with art created by the 5th graders of Gilchrist Elementary!<br/><br/>-Simple one-touch gameplay<br/>-Three worlds to conquer<br/>-Absolutely no ads or iAP - volunteer project<br/><br/>To create this game, Shallot Games visited Gilchrist Elementary to talk to the students about art in games, and pixel art specifically. From there, the students each randomly selected a game object, and were divided into three groups of about six. Each group was tasked with imagining a theme for their world, and working together to create art that fit their theme. They used colored pencils on graph paper to create their art, which was later digitized and put in the game. This is what they came up with, hope you enjoy! If you're a Grizzly reading this description, thank you so much for letting me work with you, I had such a great time on this project!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:12:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d5/0d51880396d7231ae4834fb07f604879_2lXxjlg.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Shallot Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Shallot Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
