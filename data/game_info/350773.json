Design the scene in the future science fiction style, close to reality and surpass reality<br/>2, original large number of puzzle elements, burning your brain<br/>3. The later DLC will be launched one after another, so stay tuned<br/><br/>Background Story:<br/>In the early 1980s, in order to develop rapidly in science and technology, the government launched an experimental project codenamed \"Xiangshan No. 31\", established No. 31 weather station across the country, and the underground station was hollowed out to build a particle collider. The method of particle collision finds new substances and tries to fundamentally change the backwardness of science and technology. These experimental sites were uniformly disguised as meteorological stations, and the sites were located in the deep mountains far from the city, and experiments were carried out within a few hundred meters of the interior of the mountain or even underground. Due to the high risk and uncertainty of the experiment, after 10 years, that is, in the 1990s, there were cases of experimental failures, and some incidents that were beyond the control of researchers at the time and now, according to retired staff, began. It was only the failure of the collision test. Later, each collision experiment produced high-radiation substances that scientists could not explain, which caused the project team to cause radiation damage even in the case of wearing protective clothing, thus unable to control the instrument. The most serious one, the collider could not be cooled, and a huge explosion occurred. The government claimed that it was a small earthquake, which obscured the vibration caused by the experiment. After the millennium, the state ordered the suspension of all relevant experiments, and destroyed all experimental materials and experimental results, all relevant personnel retired or resigned early, and signed a very strict confidentiality agreement.<br/><br/>Xiao Li\u2019s grandfather was a retired weather station worker. Time flies. After his grandfather\u2019s death, he left a map with a weather station visible on the map, and a date clearly written on it. Curious Xiao Li was always uneasy, and finally decided to come to the weather station on the appointed date to find out.<br/><br/>Xiao Li took the map left by his grandfather and sneaked into the place marked on the map in the middle of the night.<br/>This is a weather radar station, but there are a lot of awkward places, such as radar stations that seem to have been abandoned, there are security guards, and there are people who are repairing solar panels. However, if all this happens during the day, it will be late at night. With a strong curiosity, Xiao Li decided to sneak into the weather station to see what happened.<br/>When Xiao Li sneaked into the weather station, he was shocked by everything in front of him. He didn't even know how long he had not been dynamic. Zhengda couldn't speak. It was a weather station staff. The whole body was covered with stones. It was on the desk. It was exactly like being petrified. The staff\u2019s behavior was not exaggerated. It can be judged that the entire petrochemical process was completed in an instant, as if I was glanced at by the mythical Medusa, and everything was too late to react. People have become big stones. The entire room floor has been partially lifted by a substance similar to magma, causing it to rupture and emitting a lot of heat. Xiao Li has no time to feel how hot he is. When he is about to turn around and rush out of the room, another strange phenomenon Let him hesitate. The room is in the middle and there is an elevator that looks like it is underground. This means there must be a space in the ground. Xiao Li set his mind, curiosity and grandfather's strange words and behaviors made him really want to see what to do.<br/>Xiao Li decided to take the elevator into the mountain to see what was below. It would be a big deal to come back. However, the elevator has been damaged. When Xiao Li rummaged through the method of restarting the elevator, he found the following files:<br/><br/>File A:<br/><br/>\"Internal T31-03\"<br/><br/>No. 31 meteorological office in X City, Y City, Z City, etc.:<br/><br/>To compensate for the harm caused by the failure of the second experiment, and<br/>Advancing the experimental process requires a third time on 2019.5.5<br/>experiment. Experimental purpose: to study the causes of cracks and try<br/>Get the material that makes up the crack.<br/>This experiment is likely to produce a higher level of hazard, please<br/>The personnel are responsible for the protection work.<br/>Another: X City Meteorological Office has caused a comparison in the first experiment<br/>Large casualties and material spills, can be performed if needed<br/>Clean the program.<br/><br/><br/>The experimental method can be found in: F31-77 Executive Manual<br/>File B:<br/><br/>\"Internal T31-08\"<br/><br/>X City No. 31 Meteorological Office:<br/><br/>Expanded underground in Area X due to failure of the third experiment<br/>The scope of influence of the project, the crack is further expanded, and there is<br/>At regular intervals, the event level rises to the highest level.<br/>The superior decided to eliminate all signs of life at the Xiangshan Meteorological Station.<br/>Clean up all relevant materials and block the underground entrance.<br/>All high-level personnel immediately evacuated.<br/><br/><br/>2019.7.5<br/><br/>File C:<br/><br/>\"Internal T31-09\"<br/>Access to DF-37 missile nuclear warhead energy, igniting experimental collection<br/>substance.<br/>Produce a secondary explosion, petrochemical life, 48 hours later,<br/>Involved in cleaning the troops for decontamination.<br/>Destroy the only access to the underground - the elevator.<br/><br/>File D:<br/><br/>\"T31-10 Confidential\"<br/><br/>The experiment further measures the responsibility of the \"mad people\", everything<br/>Technical documents need to be handed over to the organization.<br/><br/>At present, we can only count on the advanced technology mastered by the \"mad people\".<br/>To solve this seemingly unmanageable thing. Next place<br/>Meteorological Office No. 31 will gradually adopt a elimination procedure.<br/>All subsequent instructions are stopped from being updated and released, with the code F31<br/>Instruction set. Scientists above level 10 still respond to the directive and continue<br/>jobs.<br/><br/>In addition, the monster you saw in the video has been determined not to<br/>Belonging to our space, it brings unacceptable horrible events to<br/>The uneasiness brought about by the entire organization has spread to some retirees<br/><br/>This makes Xiao Li more curious: Can the experiment continue? Is there a commercial company that uses the results of this experiment to do bad things? Has the monster mentioned in the file caused irreparable damage? Grandpa left this map, and there are such specific events, so it must be useful. No, I have to figure it out. Xiao Li thought about it, and at the same time reset the elevator, he entered the elevator, the elevator door slowly closed, and the booming inside of the mountain like a mountain.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ad/6ad7c563d15c15f79402d86bf8e3bc38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 265, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["QZQ Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["H.P.Y.S,LLC"], "esrb_rating": null}
