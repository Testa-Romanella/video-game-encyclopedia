Spaceman Spam. After getting a job with a rock refinery and delivery service, Jourd Inc., you were brought to XCGQ-221 to mine the natural resources and send them to Jourd Inc. in return for money. Use this money to build water turrets and upgrade your pickaxe. The rocks outside your small base are 3x as valuable as the rock inside your base, but beware the bugs! These creatures will attack you and destroy your walls! If one touches you, you lose! But if you manage to collect $1,000, you win and the delivery service comes to pick you up!</p>\n<p>Oh, and by the way, here's a few tips for winning:</p>\n<p>1. Upgrading your pickaxe is good</p>\n<p>2. Bugs are bad</p>\n<p>3. You start with 2 turrets but you do need to make more and your walls only have so much health</p>\n<p>4. Good luck and have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T15:30:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4a/a4a50fbd7bc1cc08ad6c2906b84a541a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sillyman987"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
