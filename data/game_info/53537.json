It was released for PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameCube. A Game Boy Advance version was released later.</p>\n<p>The game stars Homer, Marge, Bart, and Lisa, as well as Mr. Burns and several other characters from the show. The Simpsons: Road Rage is similar to Sega's 1999 video game Crazy Taxi, in that the main objective is to drive picked up passengers to their destinations as quickly as possible. These similarities led to Sega suing Radical Entertainment and Electronic Arts for patent infringement though it was settled before going to court.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2001-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-22T07:25:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86a/86ace50647c540c26ee942131459a1cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.62, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 21, "beaten": 22, "toplay": 14, "dropped": 13}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 24, "suggestions_count": 181, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 24, "platforms": ["Xbox", "Game Boy Advance", "GameCube", "PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Radical Entertainment", "Altron", "Fox Interactive"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts", "THQ"], "esrb_rating": null}
