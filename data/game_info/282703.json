By utilizing the observer's royal magnifying glass, the player can imagine the tiny submarine monarch to be much larger than they actually are, which has a number of interesting implications, such as allowing for greater jump height and faster descents. And sure, Sea Monkeys may actually just be commercially-sold brine shrimp, but the way we see things, Wee Sea Things captures a depiction of the little guys as seen through a much more flattering lens.</p><p>Made by John Guerra, Dillon DeSimone, and Tom\u00a0Farro.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c9/2c9ed22e833d30dcc8f5fe349f7c4914.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["We Need Bees"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
