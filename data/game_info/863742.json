Your task is to travel north to reach what may be the last human on Earth.<br/>Explore, fight monsters, scavenge loot, and run out of food as you do whatever it takes to survive in a vast procedurally generated world full of otherworldly monsters. <br/><h3>Choose Your Character</h3><br/>Play as a scavenging hobo, a candy-crazed child, a gadget-clad secret agent, a mystical druid, a knife-wielding punk, a mutating lab experiment, and more.<br/>Each class starts with their own loadout of starting equipment and special perks. Each one has their own strengths and weaknesses that cater to a unique playstyle.<h3>Find Artifacts</h3><br/>Magical wands, flamethrowers, katanas, and jetpacks have been left abandoned on the ground. Loot is randomly generated every game, meaning you have to adapt to what the wasteland provides.<h3>Learn Special Abilities</h3>Deadland 4000 has no experience points. Instead, you will found tomes of experience scattered throughout the land. Reading these will allow you to learn new abilities that will impact your entire run. Become a werewolf at night, photosynthesize your own food, see farther at night, or grow an extra head.<br/><h3>Explore A Hostile World</h3><br/>Navigate overgrown cornfields, dark desert highways, and desecrated suburbs. <br/><br/>Be careful, wildlife has evolved. Many vicious predators roam the wastes, and you're on the bottom of the food chain. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Enemies can be avoided by staying out of their circle of vision. Be careful, firing guns can create noise, and certain enemies will set off alarms alerting everyone nearby to your location<h3>Keep Moving Forward</h3><br/>The world generates in a straight line. Every biome is connected with no loading zones or level barriers.<br/><br/>Take shelter from weather events such as acid rain and solar flares by waiting out the storm in indoor structures. Rest or take your chances exploring at night with reduced visibility.<h3>Every Run is a Story</h3><br/>Your characters only live once, and as a wise man once said: \"Losing is fun\"", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T03:40:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1da/1da5d93543b628d371b6f44e13a9ac0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 47, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 272, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Cain Laikind"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Cain Laikind"], "esrb_rating": null}
