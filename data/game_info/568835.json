This goes from simple coyote time to advanced Whirlwind Maneuvers and Fall Stops.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Finally, if you beat the clock in any given level, you unlock a new palette to use! How cool is that?!?!<br/></p>\n<p>You can also play in Playground Mode, where you already have all movement abilities, or Challenge Mode, where it's just you and your platforming skills against the spikes.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Use WASD or the arrow keys to move.</p>\n<p>Press Esc to pause, R to restart a level and F11 to toggle fullscreen.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Everything was made by 89o, EXCEPT:</p>\n<p>Splat sounds:<br/>duckduckpony on FreeSound.org<br/>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p>Music:<br/>On Hold For You by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/6928-on-hold-for-you<br/>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>\n<p>Made for Wowie Game Jam 3.0.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T15:39:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca1/ca1a7685e0d26aa77a1f7327301eb42e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["89o"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
