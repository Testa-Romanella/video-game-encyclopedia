{"id": 765640, "slug": "onkan", "name": "ONKAN", "name_original": "ONKAN", "description": "<p><strong>Onkan</strong> is a 3D puzzle game inspired by the Aztecs, where sacrifices must be made. The game has eighteen levels set within two pyramids. The first nine levels take place in a right-side-up pyramid while the last nine levels are in an upside-down pyramid. Each Level is themed to a God that chronologically appears in one of the Aztec Creation Myths.</p>\r\nWhat's Included in the Demo\r\n<p>Currently, the demo allows players to test and provide feedback for character movement, interacting with sacrifices, altars, pillars, pushable pillars, stairs and air elevators. This will be on the 4 levels in the game at the moment with more levels up to 9 to come down the road.</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>Explore through the levels bringing sacrifices to altars to unlock the next steps.</p>\r\nFeedback\r\n<p>This is an ongoing project and any feedback would be great!
