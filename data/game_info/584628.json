In the lost realm those spirits ultimately reside, immaterial life thrives. Unusual fauna and flora, nothing like what the spirits had seen in their past lives, occupies the land around them. Towering columns of rock splay into caps and plateaus, where extraterrestrial plants and animals survive; and a stone tower resides in the center of it all. Atop the tower is the most beautiful light, breathing and flickering throughout the day, watching over the landscape beneath it, almost as if it its protecting those around it.<br/></p>\n<p>Then comes a peculiar day in this peculiar place, where the light atop the spire flickers more erratic than usual. And then -- darkness.<br/></p>\n<p>Amongst the darkness that now envelopes the land, the inhabiting spirits are lost - driven to madness and aggression. This once serene place has become overrun with violence and chaos. What can be done to reverse the damage?</p>\n<p>In the protectorate light's last moment, a singularity of sorts broke from it and descended upon the land, lost in the now-desolate wilderness beneath the caps of the great stone columns. Eventually, it was found by a wandering spirit, destined to return the flame to its spire. This is where our story begins.</p>\r\nCredit\r\n<p>Caleb Osorio - Artwork<br/>Joy Sterling - Audio, Music<br/>Thighs Totaling - Audio, Music<br/>Snalegirl - Design &amp; Code<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T05:10:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/218/218c0c328228888e3d580c5a3173801b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Snale", "ImACrow", "joysterling"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
