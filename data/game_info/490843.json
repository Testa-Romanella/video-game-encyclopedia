The main idea behind this game goes back to my childhood working on cars in the garage with my Dad, where the language was \"Hand me that doodad so I can get this thingamajig out of the whatchacallit\". But I have to admit, the drive to publish this game came from the growing unease of my student loan debt. All revenue made from this game will go towards my student loan debt and saving for my 4 kid's college as well. <br/><br/><br/>Thanks in advance for purchasing and playing Widgets and Gidgets.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-10T20:40:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7b/d7b2e9d07ec50f05d504fda187f84403.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dwarf Haven Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Dwarf Haven Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
