The climate changes dramatically. The inhabitants of the city prepare themselves for a growing and confusing threat.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n Learn spelling in a different way while having fun! <br/>\r\n For young and old alike and ages eight and up. \"<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe are Julien (head of the company Futurtech Informatique) and Brigitte (retired school teacher). We live in the Vaucluse and are currently developing an educational innovation. We have created a spelling video game. The first of its kind, \"Pago's Forest\" allows you to improve your grammatical spelling through the discovery of a \"heroic fantasy\" type story. The first part of our trilogy \"The Forest of Pago: The Dragon's Revenge\" is available since August 2019, it focuses on the present tense and subject/verb agreement. The second installment \"The Forest of Pago 2: Remembrance of Ice\" is scheduled to be released in the second quarter of 2021, for the past tense of the indicative. A third part will finally deal with other tenses and modes, the future tense and the conditional and subjunctive modes.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis second part of our trilogy will bring significant improvements: the help boxes are more digestible but you will be able to learn more thanks to a new tab, the grammar tab, which can be consulted at any time in the story, as is the case for the lexicon.<br/>\r\nYou'll also discover a new gameplay system: during battles, characters take turns to face each other and suffer attacks that decrease their life bar.<br/>\r\nThanks to the collected stars, you will have access to an additional gameplay \"Adventure Mode\" which allows you to control Flora's character to help her in her quests.<br/>\r\nYou will find emblematic and mythological characters: dragons, golems, mages, dwarfs, chimeras, frost giants and many other fantastic creatures... <br/>\r\nIn order to meet the needs of our players, we have extended the length of the game: it is with great pleasure that we will offer you more than 30 levels!<br/>\r\nWe are working hard to make the environments even more impressive and to make this game a world to behold.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T05:09:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/324/3248579ca6452d4d7d56e5d9a22d1d60.jpg", "website": "https://www.la-foret-de-pago.fr/la-foret-de-pago-2/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 603, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Futurtech"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Nova's Army"], "esrb_rating": null}
