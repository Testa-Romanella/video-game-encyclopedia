The inspiration for the game came from\u00a0the song \"Tears In\u00a0Heaven\"\u00a0by Eric Clapton and the bible verse \u201cFor, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>The goal is to regain your memories of Ryan before you get taken up into Heaven.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Interact with each of the glowing doors to collect memories of Ryan.
