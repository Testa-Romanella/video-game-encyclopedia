It features \u00a04 separate stories about the main characters, Sakuma, Claris, and Jackson, being teleported to a mysterious castle and finding themselves separated from each other. The game features light puzzle elements but is meant to mainly be an interactive story.</p>\n<p>This demo has the intro sequence and Sakuma's story playable.\u00a0 When playing it on this webpage, feel free to zoom in a bit \u00a0to make the game's resolution a bit more accurate if you need to.<br/></p>\n<p>Music, visuals, and maybe even dialogue are considered temporary for this demo, though not much will probably change between this and the final product.</p>\n<p>Special Thanks to Chris Maltby for creating GB Studio. It's a very fun, easy to use program and I highly recommend you check it out!</p>\n<p>GB Studio Link: https://www.gbstudio.dev/</p>\n<p>Also, check out \u00a0my webcomic this game is based on!</p>\n<p>Sakuma Link: https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/sakuma-the-red-glare/list?title_no=208788<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aca/acaabbcdc570abac19e5ce85076bb921.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RWBeichner"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
