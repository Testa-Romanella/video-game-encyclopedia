The series is not a collection of sequential stories, but rather a presentation of the same story from seven different perspectives. Billed as an &quot;Active Simulation War&quot;, each game has the player direct a different protagonist (or &quot;hero&quot;) through a galactic war. In most versions, the player must travel from planet to planet, defeating enemy defense armadas, and then storming the planet in a mobile attack suit, destroying as much of the planet&#39;s defense systems as possible, all in an effort to take over the planet.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1986-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-09T03:21:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4c/e4c39da99253e23b8e1151df64e55308.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["NES"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Toshiba EMI"], "esrb_rating": null}
