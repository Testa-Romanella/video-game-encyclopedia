I was inspired by\u00a0\"Low Effort Jam 12\" to not spend much time on it. Sadly I\u00a0didn't see the LEJ12 theme reveal until it was too late so withdrew this as a submission there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I've always wanted to write a visual novel or \"choose your own adventure\" style of game, so thought this would be a good start.</p>\n<p>As I write this it is the middle of winter and Sydney is in a strict COVID lockdown. This game/story started off as a way to just mess around using Inkle and to show of some Australian slang, but it ended up turning into a bit of a reverie.</p>\n<p>You'll probably think the writing style looks like crap.</p>\n<p>Hope you get a bit of a laugh at least. I was going to record some voice over with my broad Aussie accent. \u00a0I might try converting it to RenPy later add in all those fancy bells and whistles..</p>\n<p>Hope you 'ave a good one, and don't forget the aerouard!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T08:09:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f6/7f62577c8030c21b3c0d4530c54f3fed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["exzyle"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
