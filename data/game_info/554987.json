Inside were some guns and a treasure trove of ammunition.<br/><br/><br/>Unfamiliar with kinetic warfare, the two girls treated the weapons as toys and played until the sun went down. It was then that a rare guest made a surprise visit to the shrine gates.<br/><br/>\"So anyway, I started blastin'\", said the shrine maiden, recalling the incident.<br/><br/>Also there are UFOs, but don't think it about it.
