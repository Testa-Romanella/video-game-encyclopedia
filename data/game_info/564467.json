Birds come and go, and in the meantime you can play tic-tac-toe with them:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Sparrows.</li><li>Crows. <em>(my favourite.) (plus a special crow that might be a raven?)</em></li><li>Flocks of pigeons.</li><li>Sulphur-crested cockatoos.</li></ul>\n<p>Also a<strong> goose</strong> will be added soon in an update! If you have any requests, please let us know in the comments what other birds you'd love to see :)<br/></p>\n<p>And, though we don't have a video up yet, the game has very nice subtle ambiences and the sounds of little pitter-pattering, wings flapping, tweeting, cawing, and crowing for you to enjoy, even when you don't feel like playing a game of tic-tac-toe.<br/></p>\n<em>p.s. the nemesis system</em>\n<p>If you're reading this, the Nemesis system patent is in effect (or is just about). When I set out to make a game for the Nemesis Jam, I really wasn't expecting to find the document so educational and inspiring.</p>\n<p>The working title for <em>Tic-Tac-Crow</em> was <em>\"My Tic-Tac-Toe Nemesis is a Sulphur-Crested Cockatoo!\"</em>; it was made for the Nemesis Jam, a prompt to\u00a0\"make something in any way regarding this system.\" So, I made a game about birds with individual traits and parameters <em>(My system calls them STATS and QUIRKS)</em> that change in response to player action and other things... and we crafted a living, breathing world out of this dynamic. Birds play against each other, and you can see their individual personalities in motion!\r\n</p>\n<p>There's no way to explicitly view these in-game (you can dig through the save file, it's pseudo-plaintext), but STATS are numerical values that every bird has (e.g. their hidden <em>level</em> is directly related to how good their Tic-Tac-Toe-playing AI is), while QUIRKS are pairs of triggers and reactions.</p>\n<p>e.g.</p>\n<ul><li>When my opponent cheats, I cheat back.</li><li>When the player joins my table, I make a happy noise.</li></ul>\n<p>I think this all combines to create a great sense of individuality between birds, and it's something I'd like to continue using in future projects - as well as continue to work on this one.</p>\n<p>I don't even know if what I've developed constitutes patent infringement or not, and it's frustrating to imagine a future where game design is fraught with this type of worry.</p>\n<p>There's not much I can do about patent law, but maybe this tiny protest will make a tiny difference.</p>\n<p><em>(Also, I'm publishing it on the App Store soon, which will hopefully serve to lend it extra legitimacy!)</em><br/></p>\n<em>who made this?<br/></em>\n<p>droqen</p>\n<p>h heron</p>\n<p>redacted<br/></p>\n<p>also, thanks to everyone\u00a0in my playtest discord &amp; to my 27 lovely patrons!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T09:14:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54d/54d08e4dffad78ed3d0a9809381aae68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Droqen"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
