Contestant's must dip, dodge, and roll to avoid the laser fired off at the beginning of the round. With each bounce against the arena components the laser increases in speed, which in turn increases the rate of score increase, but keep in mind that a faster laser makes it more difficult to hit the apple on your head and getting a score multiplier.  Play through various arenas that increase in geometric complexity, and try to get the highest score to become the Slayzers champion!</p><p>Developed for a Casual Game Development course at the University of Central Florida by:</p><p>- Jacob Galoci | Twitter - @jagaloci</p><p>- Justin Moser</p><p>- Noah Hunter</p><p>- Keanu Kia</p><p>- Nathan Samoranski</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20d/20da4caa6a8921946502a3b2a53de211.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jacob Galoci"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
