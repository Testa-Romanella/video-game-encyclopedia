You can only land on platforms if you get lost follow the arrows they point in the general direction of the orbs. Due to some strange tech issues I can't test the build files so let me know if they don't run. it supports windows,linux and mac os. I will also be adding a web version later for those of you that have computers that it will not run on. (Heads up there is a known bug where after you lose a level the effects are still there I will fix this soon).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T13:43:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/812/812ffb2f89bdee1a5cf709572f6f1fbc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["DanielThornton"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
