{"id": 409287, "slug": "train-dispatcher", "name": "Train Dispatcher", "name_original": "Train Dispatcher", "description": "<p>Discord server:\u00a0https://discord.gg/JTDAvfk</p>\n<p><strong>Train Dispatcher</strong> is a puzzle game about... well... Train dispatching! Your goal is to control your station and surroundings (junctions, signals, etc.) to guide passing trains to their correct targets.</p>\n<p>Trains will arrive from the edges (outer rails) of your train network and will automatically follow the path to nearest signal or station. You can click on the train to see where it needs to go and it's scheduled timetable. Each train needs to stop at some stations and then exit the map again using one of the edge (outer) tracks, again based on it's timetable.</p>\n<p>You can switch junction by clicking on it. It will iterate between all possible states. You can also click on a signal to toggle it (red/green). Once a train passes a signal it will automatically switch it back to red.</p>\n<p>Trains will stop automatically at stations they have in their timetable. Every train needs to visit all stations in correct order. At each station the train will spend at least one minute (boarding passengers) no matter how much it's delayed.</p>\n<p>Be careful not to collide trains! Train will also crash if it arrives on a junction from inactive side. Also look out for new arriving trains, so that they won't block your path.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-03T05:29:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76a/76a0a9c4d6d0ba177b1d1139565d49c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["greeny-dev"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
