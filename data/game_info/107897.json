Try to get through seven nights of running drugs without getting jailed. Collect as many drugs as you can each night and use them to get upgrades to become more resilient, or sell them for money to bribe cops with. Just to warn you, it isn't easy. </p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>IMPORTANT GAMEPLAY TIP</strong>: To beat this game, you should understand that the cops are really dumb and will assume you're gone after they don't see you for a second. If you can't run from a cop when he spots you,  make tight circles around him like this  to lose him.</p><p>If you're having trouble, check out this video playthrough of the game for tips.</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis game was made for Global Game Jam 2016 at The College of New Jersey, with a team consisting of of Brian Intile (me), Evan Zodl, Devon Tam, and Thomas Giulianelli.
