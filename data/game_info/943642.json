The idea of switching back and forth between white on black and black on white came from the idea of Mental health. If I had more time the game would be about someone dealing with loneliness, as that is something I have dealt with a lot personally.</p>\n<p>Anyways! Hope you have fun playin.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T04:05:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d2/3d29a80f81dc55a0a1fc260293ef3b69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FlamingAardvarkGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
