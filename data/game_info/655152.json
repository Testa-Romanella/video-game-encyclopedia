I've planned to add a tutorial and make this sandbox into a puzzle game but I got busy with other things and this project was kinda left behind. So today (3 months later since I last touched this project) I am uploading it unfinished.\r\n</p>\n<p>For those wondering, the stage is setup as a showcase that visually shows what each component does. The weird machine at the bottom right is a game of rock, paper, scissors that I built. The batteries rep user input (rock, paper or scissors) and the LEDs rep the opponent's input (also rock, paper or scissors). The opponent's choices are always randomized.\r\n</p>\n<p>Maybe someday Ill actually finish this, imo its kinda cool.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T16:03:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0aa/0aa006ecd035f1fcad45a19c9e7a521d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Artyom Gabtraupov"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
