(No third game is known to exist.)</p>\n<p>Several years have passed since the events that devastated the once proud town remembered as Paradise. The only two to walk away from the cataclysm unscathed, the hapless everyman known as the Postal Dude and his loyal companion Champ, drive aimlessly through the scorching deserts of Arizona looking for a new place to call home. After a fortuitous gas station rest stop ends with their car, trailer home, and the rest of their worldly possessions stolen, all the Dude\u2019s seemingly got left to his name is his canine cohort and his bathrobe, and neither of them smells all that great. However, on the horizon, the duo glimpses an unfamiliar and dazzling town that beckons to them. What untold prospects lie within? Fame? Fortune? Maybe a bidet or two? Edensin awaits.</p>", "metacritic": 30, "released": "2022-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-24T10:49:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/815/815cab8e9048b0610b6fdb946cf940ed.jpg", "website": "http://www.gopostal.com", "rating": 2.26, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 36, "owned": 268, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 41, "dropped": 32, "playing": 7}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 23, "ratings_count": 61, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 7, "reviews_count": 62, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Running With Scissors"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Running With Scissors"], "esrb_rating": null}
