Uncle Un is an old farmer who needs help with his animals. The job is to keep animals populations stable.

Each turn animals will inform player about their move plans that will be executed on the next turn. Player can use cards to perform actions that will impact those decisions. Prevent destabilization from species extinction by keeping at least one animal of each species alive for as long as you can.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh... can you also finish any of <strong>quests</strong> that Un left for you?
