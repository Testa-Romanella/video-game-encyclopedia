We used the Unreal Tournament Editor which had prebuilt prefabs which eased the development process. The idea was to show that the map is balanced and still nuanced depending on the player's play style. There are two teams\u00a0(blue and red) that spawn diametrally opposite to each other - the map is circular in nature with the ability to fall if you are not careful enough or the enemy shoots you with their rocket launcher. Power-ups are available to spice things up! We were eased by the provided ready-to-use prefabs and assets - attention needed to be given only to the balance of items and positions, spawn rates, and so on.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T10:22:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/414/414065de6e3003ae20f37352c22fd3d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Martin Georgiev"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
