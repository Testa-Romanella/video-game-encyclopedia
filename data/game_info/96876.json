{"id": 96876, "slug": "escape-from-zone-64", "name": "Escape from Zone 64", "name_original": "Escape from Zone 64", "description": "<p>A turn based funny futuristic tactical puzzle game made for\u00a0#LOWREZJAM 2017 64x64 challenge.</p>\n<p><strong>Story</strong><br/>As a leader of a peaceful demonstration against an oppressive 64x regime you are being captured and locked up in a secret facility Zone 64. There you gain supernatural abilities that would hopefully help you escape captivity and gain freedom from the 64 by 64 pixel constrains.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>From the author:</strong><br/>Overall I've spent 7 evenings working on this game, and this is my second finished one. What I wanted to achieve is not an ordinary game that you play on a small screen, but a game where 64x64 pixel space is a feature rather than a limitation. As a puzzle game it may fall a bit short in the department of balance due to time constrains, but I hope you will enjoy playing it as much as I have enjoyed creating it.</p>\n<p><strong>Hints</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Abilities availability depends on the level.</li><li>Each ability can be used once per level (except for illusion)</li><li>Score is determined by remaining turns, remaining energy and unused abilities</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>WASD or keyboard arrows -&gt; movement.</li><li>Space or Left Mouse Button -&gt; skip intro.</li><li>ESC -&gt; menu.</li><li>Right click on character -&gt; list of available abilities.</li><li>1,2,3 -&gt; abilities hotkeys \u00a0(Illusion, Invisibility, Switch)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Sound assets attribution:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>blip from https://freesound.org/people/ihatetoregister/sounds/31822/ by ihatetoregister</li><li>New Message from https://freesound.org/people/Davidsraba/sounds/367607/ by Davidsraba</li><li>Death sound (male) from https://freesound.org/people/Replix/sounds/173126/ by Replix</li><li>Knife Slide from https://freesound.org/people/daymonjlong/sounds/344665/ by daymonjlong</li><li>die from https://freesound.org/people/xtrgamr/sounds/259681/ by xtrgamr</li><li>Gun for Loy from https://freesound.org/people/martian/sounds/182272/ by martian</li><li>Auto Assault Rifle/Gun Burst (Outdoor/Close) [Mixed] from https://freesound.org/people/EFlexTheSoundDesigner/sounds/393671/ by EFlexTheSoundDesigner</li><li>Simple Ding from https://freesound.org/people/CosmicEmbers/sounds/387351/ by CosmicEmbers</li><li>Step 11 from https://freesound.org/people/carrigsound/sounds/32637/ by carrigsound</li><li>Gong from https://freesound.org/people/qubodup/sounds/157432/ by qubodup</li><li>Error from https://freesound.org/people/Autistic%20Lucario/sounds/142608/ by Autistic Lucario</li><li>Game Sound Wrong from https://freesound.org/people/Bertrof/sounds/131657/ by Bertrof</li><li>alarm 003 from https://freesound.org/people/cydon/sounds/127708/ by cydon</li><li>teleport from https://freesound.org/people/outroelison/sounds/150950/ by outroelison</li><li>Teleport from https://freesound.org/people/krzysiunet/sounds/345835/ by krzysiunet</li><li>Swish from https://freesound.org/people/Plaintree/sounds/353611/ by Plaintree</li><li>Fist hiting wood table from https://freesound.org/people/aminut/sounds/177611/ by aminut</li><li>JM_FX_Fireball 01 from https://freesound.org/people/Julien%20Matthey/sounds/105016/ by Julien Matthey</li><li>Zap from https://freesound.org/people/jnr%20hacksaw/sounds/11221/ by jnr hacksaw</li><li>triumph from https://freesound.org/people/gvgmedia/sounds/321656/ by gvgmedia</li><li>Electro success sound from https://freesound.org/people/Mativve/sounds/391540/ by Mativve</li><li>Next Level from https://freesound.org/people/drmier/sounds/221357/ by drmier</li><li>aw yeeeeeeeAH! from https://freesound.org/people/Reitanna/sounds/343892/ by Reitanna</li><li>Door close from https://freesound.org/people/soundmary/sounds/117614/ by soundmary</li><li>All havoc breaks loose from https://freesound.org/people/CGEffex/sounds/97785/ by CGEffex</li><li>Night city reverb from https://freesound.org/people/addiesindie13/sounds/393756/ by addiesindie13</li><li>Air Tone London Busy from https://freesound.org/people/constructabeat/sounds/258383/ by constructabeat</li><li>explosion_012 from https://freesound.org/people/dogfishkid/sounds/399303/ by dogfishkid</li><li>Explosion_01 from https://freesound.org/people/tommccann/sounds/235968/ by tommccann</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46c/46c59d6f4425d230a7d6154282f8bec8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Alex Slavski"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
