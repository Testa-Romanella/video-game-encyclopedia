I've taken out all the unnecessary hustles and you should progress the storyline fair quickly as there isn't much of a story. The game itself is just a typical tactical RPG with only 5 playable characters and 11 chapters in total, should take you an hour to finish.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMost characters can promote once they reach level 15 and learn skills at level 10 and 20, hope you enjoy!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T07:29:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d27/d2703f1d83a0fcc91dffc058b82fc73e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yunkai"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Yunkai"], "esrb_rating": null}
