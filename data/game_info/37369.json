{"id": 37369, "slug": "the-ship", "name": "The Ship", "name_original": "The Ship", "description": "<p>The Ship is a multiplayer FPS developed by Outerlight.</p>\n<p>You get a mysterious invitation to a cruise on a luxurious ocean ship. The catch is that in order to pay for the trip, the eccentric host wants you to kill another passenger in an unusual and creative way. For example, why not close the poor guy in a giant freezer? Or beat him to death with a pan? Avoid the ship&#39;s security and other passengers as they are not against killing you too.</p>\n<p>While working out the planned murder, the players have to eat, sleep, keep their hygiene, talk to other passengers, and keep their character entertained. First, find a weapon. The game features a wide variety of both firearms and melee weapons. The players can also use the environment as their weapon. Second, find your target. The intel about the person you&#39;re about to kill is updated every 30 seconds. At first, you&#39;ll only know the name of your victim. Third, eliminate your target. And don&#39;t get caught. You can change your outfit, lock yourself in a bulletproof room or just blend in with the crowd.</p>\n<p>The game also features a competitive multiplayer mode in which the players have to earn a certain amount of money to win.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2006-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-14T10:02:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/113/113726764cc02f8c9fa38a0029cedc84.jpg", "website": "http://www.theshiponline.com", "rating": 3.35, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 21, "owned": 468, "beaten": 12, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 28, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 43, "suggestions_count": 297, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 43, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Outerlight"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["MINDSCAPE"], "esrb_rating": null}
