{"id": 62125, "slug": "dont-look-down", "name": "Don't Look Down", "name_original": "Don't Look Down", "description": "<p>Don&#39;t Look Down is a VR climbing game like no other. No other VR climbing game has you grabbing and smashing robots into each other, dodging flying spikes, or dashing through bonus rooms for gold coins.<br />\nWe like our climbing system because it&#39;s physically immersive (unlike walking in VR with an analog stick) and varied enough to let you play as simple or complex as you want. You can climb slowly and safely, or you can master the art of flinging to speed through the levels. You can smash robots as soon as you grab them, or you can throw them at distant enemies to take them both out. You can even grab a robot hold onto it, fling one-handed towards another enemy, and then smash them into each other!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-07T22:41:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/353/3537e3ca4283ccb5757e18c4c72a0d52.jpg", "website": "https://catapultgamesvr.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 221, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["Catapult Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Catapult Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
