I made it for the\u00a02022 UNC College Game Jam.</p>\n<p>How to play: You control a set of nesting dolls and have to manage the weight of what you are currently controlling. Each doll has a number, with 1 being the biggest doll and 5 being the smallest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To drop a doll inside the one you are controlling, press \"S\" and then the number for the doll you wish to drop. (S+5 will drop the smallest doll, for instance).<br/><br/>To control a doll you currently are not controlling, press that doll's number. For example, pressing 5 will put you in control of the smallest doll.</p>\n<p>To merge into another doll, press \"S\" and that doll's number while touching it.</p>\n<p>Move left and right with A and D, jump with W.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-05T03:57:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/794/7945c30de48c2ebc15549d9c78eba8b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HannaMouse1"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
