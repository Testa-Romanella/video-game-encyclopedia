It was made for the \"GDQ One mechanic game jam\". No idea what else to say. I probably should have went witha a shooter instead of a platformer but i wanted to deviate from my usual arcadey, random levely, shootery game kind of stuff and try to make a platformer! And now i know for sure that i probably shouldnt make platformer games, or at least one-screen platformer games\u00a0as i suck at level design :c .</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-16T05:06:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/425/4259e5357daafaa9950439f69e9f850d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CheeseBaron2"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
