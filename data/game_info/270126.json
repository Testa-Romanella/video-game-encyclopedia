Unfortunately, said functionality is being removed from the service on January 15, 2019. This removal will cause the whole thing to break on that date. To prevent that, I moved all of the annotations into a Twine game with convenient embedded videos, so you can (mostly) experience the cutting edge click-on-a-video action like it's 2014 all over again.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0threw this together over the course of a few hours so I\u00a0fully expect horrific mistakes and exploding computers. Let me know if you experience issues. (Speaking of issues, I'm not offering this directly in your browser because itch doesn't seem to like the embedded Youtube videos and won't even render the player. Holler at me if you have ideas.</p>\n\n<p>If you enjoy this bit of promotional nonsense then\u00a0please go follow the man himself on Youtube.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dab/dabb00fde4dde795c329b9669ecb738f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thatnerdguy"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
