Instead, your task is to predict the chain reactions unfolding in front you.</p>\n<p>Each level, you're presented with a board of coloured blocks. Adjacent blocks of the same colour matching a given pattern will disappear, with other blocks falling down to fill the gaps. Predict five steps of this chain reaction to advance to the next level.</p>\n<p>Procedurally generated levels make the game quite replayable.</p>\n<p>Use left and right click on blocks to set up your predictions. Alternatively, you can use number keys while hovering over the block (0 removes the prediction).</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul>\n<li>Design and Programming \u2014 Martin Ender and Lukas Niemeier</li>\n<li>Art \u2014 Martin Ender</li>\n<li>Music \u2014 Jimmy Harrington</li>\n<li>Basement Leak Emergency Response \u2014 Mender Berri</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Made with Unity.
