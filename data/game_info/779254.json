Equal parts sentai, magical girl, and Degrassi in influence, ViscerArms is a mid-weight narrative RPG system about 90s nostalgia and school antics. Fight giant monsters, steal the test answers, and make it home for dinner!</p>\n<p>All you need is some d4s, a willing GM, and a fun concept for a magical meat mech. Also, the OST to Tony Hawk Pro Skater, if you can get it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T12:34:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a51/a5174fb22bb6878a0e0fb4ed7f5bf28f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["katebriggs"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
