During a carnival, dancers dance, politicians conspire and a crying ghost haunts the whole place. The protagonist, Irene, is fascinated and appalled at the same time by everything happening around her.</p>\n\n\r\nA dynamic game world, rendered in text\r\n<p>Text is mixed and combined to show a changing place, with many characters moving around, weather, different events -balls, dinners, ceremonies- and interlocking storylines. With more than 80 thousand words and more than ten major plots, each playthrough shows only a fraction of the possibilities.</p>\n\n\r\nThe game is not intended to be won\r\n<p>And it cannot be lost.</p>\r\nPs.
