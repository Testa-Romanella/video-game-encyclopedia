The lights are on, and the front door is opened. But, the windows are all boarded up and the grass is overgrown. It seems like a strange place to deliver a pizza, but at least, it looks like someone is home.\u00a0<br/><br/>You run to the front door since it\u2019s storming pretty bad.\u00a0<br/><br/>\u201cHello!? Your pizza's here!\" You announce. No one answers. There's an eerie silence.\u00a0<br/><br/>You are getting soaked from the rain, so you hesitantly step inside the door and look around. The front door suddenly closes behind you.\u00a0<br/><br/>You just wanted to finish this last delivery and head home for the night. Now you must figure out how to get out of this stupid creepy house.\u00a0<br/><br/>Freely roam the house and try to figure out what is going on. Three dolls and a strange girl named Emily will also start roaming the house as the hours toll by. Stay away from them, but if you do end up in a room with one, figure out how to stay alive.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>This may be your last pizza delivery.</strong><br/><br/>===========================<br/><br/>Main Objective:<br/>Stay alive through the night and get out of the house.<br/><br/>-no blood or gore<br/>-play the game how you want, sit still or run around like crazy<br/>-turn the lights off or on ;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c96/c965365cd3a0503aa72a9311685bf44c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 190, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["skhapps"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
