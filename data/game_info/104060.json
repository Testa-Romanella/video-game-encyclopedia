You can make continents, villages, forest, and much more! You can even create destructive things such as tornados and nukes! And when you're done playing classic mode, you can play survival mode or conquest mode in order to have set goals. In survival, you must defend a small village from incoming hazards. In conquest, you must take over the other castle using a combination tanks, ship, cannons and troops. GAME IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT. :) (MORE FEATURES WILL BE ADDED, FIXES ETC...)
