Spooky timing as well.</p>\n<p>Simply put you play as a giant, terrifying pumpkin which is guarding the neighbourhood from an influx of ghasts and protecting the kids.</p>\n<p>Use your candle to burn these ghasts with Z. But beware burning the kids! Burning ghasts returns some candle power, but burning kids takes it away.</p>\n<p>Lexaloffle BBS thread:\u00a0here.</p>\n<p>#1GAM October 2017</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e26/e2641b4c91b45c3fd5fc6327e1052dfe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["PROGRAM_IX"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
