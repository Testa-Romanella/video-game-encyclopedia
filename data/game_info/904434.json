Looks half-decent. Character and 3D scanned scene work quite well together. Runs quite well without any editing - I can get the filesize down and framerate up by fixing the mesh and changing the resolution of the textuers. I have 13 rooms, so I need to link them together with animated doors so the player can explore freely between the rooms.<br/><br/>*Added a few collision boxes and changed the default value for small-collision distance. Added some candle animations and some glass-reflections. Matched the animation speed for walking and running. Change resolution to a more cinematic style.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T05:21:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84e/84e1f6d823feafd54bcd84d5b9670f77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VP"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
