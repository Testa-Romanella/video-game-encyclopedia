{"id": 741016, "slug": "eldritch-burger-windows-mac", "name": "Eldritch Burger - Windows & Mac", "name_original": "Eldritch Burger - Windows & Mac", "description": "<p>The idea for this game came after watching Lovecraft Country, and contemplating all sorts of bits and pieces of Lovecraft and Cthulhu Mythos influence on horror games, movies and books. Usually things go like the Mist, by Stephan King, a rift opens into a different dimension, and strange creatures, casually just doing what their nature tells them to do, nearly obliterate all of mankind. Or, maybe, a strange cult has taken over a small hospital and is slowly sacrificing the few survivors left to open a portal to the other side (I wish I could remember what this one was called!)</p>\n<p>But, when I really replay this idea in my mind: say of a band of scientists and adventurers, discovering a dusty ancient tomb, combining its terrible wisdom with bleeding edge technology, they open the Rift. What would humanity do with this new dimension, completely alien, and probably poisonous, to us? We\u2019d race each other in opening the first Starbucks, or Chipotle.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Eldritch Burger hasn't gotten super deep into this story, yet.\u00a0\u00a0I have reams of notes where I want this to go, but getting the core loop and making it look decent was what I wanted to achieve. What is this currently? a core game loop and a peek into an art style:\u00a0Farm eggs from this alien ecosystem, and send them through an egg depository to be processed into yummy Eldritch Burgers.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T10:09:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34e/34e0083242bfea5aed1cbc8a2b981551.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Banjo_Bill"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
