I JUST ADDED WIDESCREEN SUPPORT.</strong></p>\n\n<p>24 levels of mini golf! Your goal is to get the ball into the hole in as few strokes as possible. To hit the ball, click and drag. An arrow will show the direction the ball will go when you release the click.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Extra notes: - The ball will not go into the hole if it is too fast. It can also curve around the hole if not going directly in. - If your ball goes into water, it will be placed at the edge before it fell in. - You can save/load your game by clicking the buttons in the level select screen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Store your saves here! https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/622893/\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is touch-screen / mobile friendly. No keyboard required. Though if you have a keyboard, you can press R to reset and H to return to the level select screen (H for \"home\"). Cloud variables are used to create the histograms for each level showing how many strokes people take. Now you get to see how you rank!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>Pen font by @-Rex- Graphics by @awesome-llama!\u00a0 @awesome-llama\u00a0used Blender's geometry nodes to generate levels from lines.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T09:25:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/659/6596142f55d5f5424cedfe99ac27d083.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["CraftProductions"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
