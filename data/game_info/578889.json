There are two things that always kill me in game jams. Coming up\r\n  with an idea that's interesting enough to work on and will fit in the time frame of the jam, and art. I'm a\r\n  programmer, and art doesn't come easy to me. I really liked the concept of the Create a Game Club jam. Re-creating a\r\n  classic game has high nostalgia value, and eliminates one of my problems; coming up with a right-sized idea. I could\r\n  have just used classic 8-bit style one-color invaders, and that would have solved my other problem too. However, I\r\n  decided to stretch myself a little and spent an in-ordinate amount of time drawing and animating my invaders using\r\n  Krita. Have to say, I'm decently pleased with how they look.</p>\n<p>The \"music\" was created by me using Bosca Ceoil. I also created some sound\r\n  effects, such as explosions, and the pew-pews using BFXR. Additional sounds were\r\n  borrowed from a free asset pack (link in the credits).</p>\n<p>I didn't actually follow a tutorial on building Space Invaders.</p>\r\nTools Used and Credits\r\n<ul>\n<li>Unity 2020.2.7f1 Personal</li>\n<li>Krita 4.4.0</li>\n<li>Bosca Ceoil</li>\n<li>BFXR</li>\n<li>FREE Casual Game\r\n      SFX Pack by Dustyroom lic:CC0</li>\n<li>Anton Font lic: OFL</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T06:26:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96b/96bec3ea86ef3c80334f710650282cdd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gr8tGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
