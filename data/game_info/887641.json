However, something peculiar happened after it was fully charged! The overloaded electricity made the grappling hook move uncontrollably and apparently it came to life! This never happened before, and it was the first time the grappling hook moves by itself after fully charged. The grappling hook decided to escape the mansion through the window and venturing the world by swinging on the floating rocks. How long the grappling hook will survive before its battery reaches 0% again?</p>\n<p>How to Play:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Hold Mouse Left Click/Tap/SpaceBar to shoot the Grappling Hook.</li><li>Release\u00a0Mouse Left Click/Tap/SpaceBar to release the Grappling Hook.</li></ul>\n<p>Try traveling for like 1600 ft but don't go too high, you'll find something that's\u00a0\u00a0probably interesting.</p>\n<p>This game was made for Hands On GIM (Ganesha Interactive Media) as Party 1 (MegaHeIX). The Web Browser version is playable on mobile, but there will be some bugs with the button. But if it doesn't work on your mobile device, you can also try to play it here\u00a0https://projectgrapplinghook.web.app/. In any case, the standalone build is always better than the web browser version, please try it if something went wrong with the web browser version.</p>\n\n<p>Credit:</p>\n<p>\"Rock Monster\" (https://skfb.ly/6VHCV) by elarix is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T12:31:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a94/a945dc3e18ec7bc185244106421895df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android", "PC"], "developers": ["KitkatMT", "DeltEnc"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
