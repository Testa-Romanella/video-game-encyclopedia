They attacked the biggest pancake facility in the world. It has been 3 days since that fateful day... You are the last pancake batter remaining, and the factory is infested with Waffle Scum. \"</p>\n<p>\"Fight on, Solider!\"</p>\n<p>F*&amp;% WAFFLES is an action bullet-hell game with a hand drawn style. Kill evil waffles and absorb\u00a0ingredients to climb your way to the top of the online leaderboard (btw, the game only shows your place in the leaderboard, not the actual people that played the game, sorry).</p>\n\n<p>Ingredient List:</p>\n<p>- Flour: Gives you health points</p>\n<p>- Sugar: Makes you faster</p>\n<p>- Eggs: Makes you smaller (if you eat too much you will get bigger again)</p>\n<p>- Milk: If you are low on one ingredient, it will fill it up. Only works when you are low on just one ingredient.</p>\n<p>You get more points over time the better the taste of your pancake batter is, so make sure\u00a0you maintain a balance of equal amounts of Health, Speed and size points while surviving for as long as you can.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T18:28:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf9/cf9f8d0125a7068d83fa8eda45a6ce05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EpiCreeper", "ronsiv8"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
