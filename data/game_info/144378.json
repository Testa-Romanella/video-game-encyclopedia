He gets so mad, that he brings out the big guns (literally) and starts to shoot at the seemingly innocent creatures. You may have a gun, but the birds have something else: Their FECES. You have to avoid their fecal matter at all times due to it being TOXIC enough to kill a person dead! You start with 100 health and no score. Your main objective is to kill of as many birds as you can, whilst still maintaining a beating heart!</p>\n<p>There is no real \"win condition\", you just have to beat your own highscore(s) until you're satisfied!</p>\n<p>Please report any bugs if you find any, thanks a lot for playing; and I cannot wait to play your games! See you next LD!<br/>=)</p><p>NOTE: Make sure you have the Java Runtime Environment installed! If not, go to Oracle's page and install it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eef/eef5cda2fb9521bc9411ea4f5c1c915c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Terabit"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
