You play for John, who has already traveled to different corners of the world. And now he's here in the Barrimean Jungle. This place is not on the maps that we used to see. The main dish for you will be various puzzles: Move objects, perform tasks, etc. Do not forget that every step can be your last step. Then we prepared elements of parkour. Despite the fact that at your disposal only running and jumping. It will not always be easy to get somewhere. Of course, all this is flavored with thematic music, especially for you play the aborigines. I THINK YOU KNOW THAT NOT ALWAYS TRUTH IS ON US BEFORE EYES.
