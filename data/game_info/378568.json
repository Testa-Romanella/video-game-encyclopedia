{"id": 378568, "slug": "picarde", "name": "Picarde", "name_original": "Picarde", "description": "<p>Picarde is a pico-8 cards player (provided with five cards) designed for persons who can\u2019t easely handle the keyboard nor a gamepad.\r\nThe controls are provided as big buttons you can scratch on a tactile screen. So you can use any part of your body or prothesis to play. You can play with a mouse, an eye tracker or trackback too (if you have it and can use it).</p>\n<p>Remarks:</p>\n<ul><li>On some cards, x/z buttons may have been switched (depends on the game implementation by their authors).</li><li>The program installs a local dedicated web server on a port between 8000 and 8020 to serve the datas. Windows will problably ask you to allow this.</li></ul>\n<p>As usual, any help welcome.</p>\n<p>Download picarde.zip, uncompress it (on the Desktop or in %AppData%), open the folder\u00a0<strong>picarde</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0launch\u00a0<strong>picarde.exe</strong>.</p>\n<p>You will have to two UAC warnings to allow the execution of the programs (picarde.exe, picarde-http.exe) and one to allow the use of the TCP/IP port. Thanks to windows :\u2019-(\u00a0If I had a developper certificate to sign the exe I could remove these UAC warnings (but since most of my programs are free, I have no money for this). So please, stop complaining about that.</p>\n<p>Cards :</p>\n<ul><li>Minesweeper by Sophie Kirschner,</li><li>Pico-2048 by Aslan85,</li><li>Puzzle Cave 1 by Hackefuffle,</li><li>Picross-8 by Nest,</li><li>Combo Pool by Nusan \u2013 http://lexaloffle.com</li></ul>\n<p>The sources (CC BY-NC-SA) are available on demand for paying users.
