Can you take the role of nature to stop this from happening? Build rivers, mountains, plains and other biomes to create your ultimate nature protected from fires, floods or sandstorms.<br/>Your creativity can save the world.<br/></strong><strong>Prove it.</strong></p>\n<p>tldr: Just download it below and read \"How to play\" section in menu</p>\n<p>You're the nature, but you control/<strong>own</strong> only some parts\u00a0of the landscape. Those give you your life force, the mighty\u00a0<strong>mana</strong>. With your mana-fueled awesomeness, you can gain control over more of the area. <strong>Tiles</strong> in the area you control can be <strong>transformed</strong> between <strong>plains</strong>, <strong>woods</strong> and <strong>water</strong>. Their <strong>elevation</strong> can also be changed.</p>\n\n<p>With these powers you must fight a\u00a0<strong>disaster</strong>, that pops up in each level and suppress them before they get to the <strong>city</strong> and cause damage. The type, elevation and presence of disaster control tile's <strong>humidity</strong> and <strong>temperature</strong>, which in turn influence mana generation or strength of the disaster. You can gain overview of this in different views of the map.</p>\n\n\n<p>More details are in menu under \"How to play\".</p>\n<p>So what are you waiting for? Look at those poor sheeps! Go save them!</p>\n\n<p>This project was made by 4 students for \"PV255 Digital games development\" course on Faculty of Informatics Masaryk University in Brno</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13a/13a055ce301106d7dd7c56cfa8fa56c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Thran Maru"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
