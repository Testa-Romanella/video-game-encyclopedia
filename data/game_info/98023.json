{"id": 98023, "slug": "depersonalize-me", "name": "Depersonalize Me", "name_original": "Depersonalize Me", "description": "<p>Depersonalize Me is a game about depersonalization which makes me feel like the world isn't real and everything is strange. I tried to capture how my anxiety activates it and how it's hard, but not impossible, to recover when it happens. </p><p>The light, positive thoughts will disappear on their own. When they spawn they reduce the anxiety level. The dark, negative thoughts don't go away on their own and must manually be thrown in the trash. They increase the anxiety level just by being around. The recycle bin can be used to temporarily remove thoughts and they'll come back after a few seconds.</p><p>Unity's WebGL games can't use the audio mixer so the sound effects aren't the same. For the best version of the game download and play the .exe locally.<br/></p><p>If you have anxiety or depersonalization I'd love to know what you think of this! Feel free to reach out to me too! I'd love to talk about what causes it and how to alleviate it.</p><p><strong>@AntonTesh</strong></p><p><strong>ATeshGames@gmail.com</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3de/3deea8bdc9a1289d908bc7231a44a736.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Anthony Tesija"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
