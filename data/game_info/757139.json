Most of the development was done on the jam-ending weekend since I didn't have time during the week. <br/></p>\n<p>During the development I was still learning a lot of stuff about Unity, it slowed down the whole process, but nevertheless was a good experience. I learned a lot and I hope I can enter the jam with a better game next time.</p>\n<p>Devlog will be added sometime on Monday.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>@kdhn - space background</p>\n<p>freesound.org - sounds in the game</p>\n<p>Some pixel assets were used from this and that free asset pack.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T08:19:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd3/bd315cf3e30599f62dad8cfd75917132.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["stanroy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
