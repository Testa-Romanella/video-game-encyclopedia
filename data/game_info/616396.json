The only way to reach the top door is by the incomplete ladder. In order to receive the missing piece of the ladder to reach the door you have to destroy the black void in which is shooting the fire balls at you. The key will help you along the way. If fire balls are coming from two locations; use x and up arrow to destroy the different voids. This game is only a prototype; and I am not completely sure what I want to do with it yet. Suggestions/Likes/Dislikes on this project are appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T10:17:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a8/1a8df7bfb6d8a826275e33ef2a97d3dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vince1102"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Strategy", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
