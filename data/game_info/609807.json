This is intended to show the different interactions that the player can potentially have with their companion to show more of their personality and what they may be thinking at any given time. <br/></p>\n<p>How to play -</p>\n<p>Shift - Sprint</p>\n<p>Ctrl - Walk</p>\n<p>E - Interact</p>\n\n<p>When walking near the well or the campfire the companion will run over to this and interact with it, trying to get the players attention. It is up to yourself if you interact, leave the area or let this animation play out. If the line of sight between the companion and the player is lost then the companion will resort to looking for you, go back into his line of sight and he will follow again. <br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Portfolio - https://www.artstation.com/bethanyanimates <br/></p>\n<p>Twitter - twitter.com/bethanyanimates</p>\n\n\n<p>The animations and blueprinting was done by myself, animations made in Maya and then implemented into Unreal <br/></p>\n<p> Characters - https://gumroad.com/thestoff <br/></p>\n<p>Environment - https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/advanced-village-pack</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T09:45:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/799/7995d39e298e6068886f8c174bdd8a0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bethany Animates"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
