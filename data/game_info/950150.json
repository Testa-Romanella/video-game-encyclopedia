It is your job to make and sell\u00a0potions to your customers to remedy their problems. Every spell you make will result in a different outcome for every customer, it is your job to determine the right combination of ingredients to satisfy everyone.</p>\n<p>Your grandfather crafted an amazing wish-granting potion that everyone wants, but you only have one, and he\u00a0passed away before he could show you how to make it. Perhaps by honing and advancing your skills as a potion master, you too will be able to craft the ultimate potion and bring peace to the land.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T10:44:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/169/16977d17fdc2a5cac932f4c105c8234d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wildgamez", "little_fifth", "Shion_Wild"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
