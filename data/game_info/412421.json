{"id": 412421, "slug": "color-climb", "name": "Color Climb", "name_original": "Color Climb", "description": "<p>Christian the Electrician is an electrical engineer at a power plant. He is called upon to repair a broken machine on the main floor of the plant, and he accidentally gets electrocuted by the apparatus. Christian passes out, wakes up to see the whole interior turn into gray-scale. The objective is to hit the right combination of colors in order to pass through levels as the player helps Christian the Electrician \u201crepair\u201d the vivid interior colors that are now gray. The player is from the perspective of Christian, and the player must go through puzzle obstacles presented by interacting with switches that correspond, in color, to a platform that will present itself to help the player progress through the level. The possible controls are jumping with the space bar, interacting with the \u201cE\u201d key, and moving left and right with \u201cA\u201d and \u201cD\u201d or the arrow keys. The goal of the game is to get through each level to help Christian gain back the color for the power plant through interacting with colored switches to alter the platform to cross over obstacles such as spikes. As one progresses, the levels become slightly more difficult and more colors may be introduced to increase play-ability.</p>\r\nHOW TO PLAY\r\n\r\nPreview of Color Climb Gameplay\r\n\n<p>The player is from the perspective of Christian, and the player must go through puzzle obstacles presented by interacting with switches which correspond, in color, to a platform that will present itself to help the player progress through the level.

Designed by Erin Alvarico\r\n\r\nFUTURE PLANS\r\n<p>The game is built on a story and can definitely be developed more. We want to try and develop more levels to implement so that the game has more colors and has more play-ability. We definitely want to put it into our portfolios and present them online in some way. In order to do this, there definitely has to be more development to do. We are not sure about a steam release, but maybe after we finish some more levels and implement them correctly. Before we implement more levels, we\u2019d like to clean up the graphics and make the overall game flow better by incorporating a time-based loss system as well as a menu that brings the player back to the start whenever they want. After all of this is cleaned up, more levels can be easily created by dragging and dropping the objects and assets we already have made into new scenes.</p>\r\nCREDITS\r\n\r\n(Left) Erin Alvarico, (Left-Center) Paul Harden, (Right-Back) Eric Cho, (Right) Erick Latshaw\r\n\n<p>\n</p>\r\nProducer/Level Designer\r\n<p>Paul Harden</p>\r\nProgrammer\r\n<p>Erick Latshaw</p>\r\nArtist\r\n<p>Erin Alvarico</p>\r\nWriter\r\n<p>Eric Cho<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-14T05:18:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fa/3fa0e43df62e5345c1146fc6cbd0efd4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["erinalvarico"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
