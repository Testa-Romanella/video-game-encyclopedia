During the simulation the fps gets a bit low since the grid is fairly big (128x128), however it gives some interesting visualizations!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>You can edit the configuration of the simulation using the mouse functionality to add or remove high and low temperature boundaries. If a boundary does not have a fixed temperature block it is considered an open boundary (dT/dx=0 or dT/dy=0).</p>\n<p><strong>Controls in edit mode</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Mouse left click - add tile</li><li>Right left click - change tile type</li><li>Z - Start simulation</li><li>X\u00a0- Hide UI</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls during simulation</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Z\u00a0- Go back to edit mode</li><li>X\u00a0- Hide UI</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T07:36:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10b/10b669ed6738c12e65013cde316b5f93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lui Habl"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
