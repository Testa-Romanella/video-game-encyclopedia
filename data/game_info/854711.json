I added these elements to the game:</p>\n<ol><li>Mercury</li><li>Venus</li><li>Mars</li><li>Jupiter</li></ol>\n<p>I tried to make some aspects of the planets similar to the real world. I added a tilt to Earth's axis and I set Venus' rotation to be quite slow and backwards. I also gave the comets a slight halo effect similar to how they would look in reality.</p>\n<p>Created by Nick Garijo</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T08:59:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e3/3e3c812501a562fef61f6b5d24d33e6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["GaryJoe"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
