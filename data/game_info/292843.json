Dangerous creatures begin to emerge, attacking the people and polluting the land, and normal police forces are unable to compete with them. To stand up against these threats, a brand new, special police unit known as Neuron is formed.</p>\n<p>Choose between two playable characters \u2013 one male, one female \u2013 on your adventure. The character you don\u2019t choose also appears as your younger twin, and a fellow member of Neuron.</p>\n<p>In order to resist the creatures, humanity developed a special weapon: the Legion. The Legion acts as your partner, and helps with your investigations. However, it\u2019s in battle where the Legion shows its real ability...</p>\n<p>Work together with the Legion and use all sorts of combat styles to fight your enemies.
