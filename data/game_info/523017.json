Watch as time loops, but your experience and memories remain.<br/><br/>When the loop resets, the content changes, making every run unique. Dynamic missions and rewards force you to strategize how best to gather the intel and gear you need to take on the Trust strongholds. As you grow your power, the Trusts will improve their troops with random escalations, keeping you on your toes.
