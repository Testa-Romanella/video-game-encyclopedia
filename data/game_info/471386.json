A\u00a0pause menu and \u00a0sound effects would be awesome.</p>\n<p>Some Bugs I know of that you might experience are:</p>\n<p>The log you have to push sometimes gets stuck.</p>\n<p>The controls are not intuitive.</p>\n<p>jump is space or up, movement is was and arrow keys, attack is left shift.</p>\n<p>If you play my game please let me know what you think in the comments. Please remember I am a complete newcomer to Game Design. This is my very first game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T03:39:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/367/3671e91b60c46792b3b2bcae3b273e28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["aj_draws"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
