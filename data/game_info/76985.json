Cat Selfie shows a bouncing \"flaming laser\" ...cat's love chasing lasers!  Cat Selfie takes a photo every time your cat touches the screen.<br/><br/>Works great for your babies and toddlers too!<br/><br/>Tips:<br/>The first time you touch the screen after installing the app, it will ask you if Cat Selfie can access your photos.  Please select \"OK.\"  If you don't select \"OK,\" Cat Selfie will not be able to save your photos.  If you accidentally hit \"Don't Allow, \" go to the Settings app, select Privacy/Photos, then set Cat Selfie to On.<br/><br/>Cats seem to like it more if the device's screen is full bright.  If you'd like to adjust your brightness, go to the Settings app.<br/><br/>If your cat has front claws, only use Cat Selfie if you have a great screen protector.  Nobody needs scratches on their screen.<br/><br/>Images are automatically saved to your camera roll.  Please go to your Photos app to view your Cat Selfies. Enjoy!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:06:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa9/fa95b7ce6e47e1695c4ed0e51744ee4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Acceleroto"], "genres": ["Family"], "publishers": ["Acceleroto"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
