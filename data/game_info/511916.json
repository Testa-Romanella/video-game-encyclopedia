Holding the button will block any oncoming attacks and double the recovery time of your opponent's attacks, giving you a window to retaliate. Be careful though, take three hits to your block and your stamina will break, giving the opponent a free hit. You can recover stamina either by having your block broken, or by landing successful hits on your opponent.</p>\n<p>One of the challenges for this game is getting the timing right so the game doesn't feel clunky, but also doesn't move too quickly, as well as adding depth with the limited control scheme. I've not had a chance to test this with someone else, but I hope that it provides a satisfying, if a bit rough around the edges experience.</p>\n<p>I wrote in a log throughout development, here's a link if you're curious (Warning: Rotten\u00a0language):\u00a0https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ps7j_31WRo4qJeinyubpddU10XAsr74BiXJAaG2zApU/...</p>\n<p>To close the game, simply press the \"Escape\"\u00a0key.</p><p>The following assets that were used\u00a0are not owned by me but are free for non-commercial use:</p><ul><li>https://opengameart.org/content/512-sound-effects-8-bit-style</li><li>https://freemusicarchive.org/music/sawsquarenoise/OverHeated_Alfa_02/Fire_Darer</li><li>https://opengameart.org/content/castle-platformer</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T03:40:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f46/f464973a81a38b20bbc2fca2bdd34fab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AviWasTaken"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
