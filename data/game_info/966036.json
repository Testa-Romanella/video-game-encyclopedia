But you can't simply take out any puzzle tile you want...<br/><br/><br/><br/>As you progress through the game, a variety of different tiles will appear, each with their own rules, making the puzzle deconstruction rather more complex, especially when those tiles interact with each other in unforeseen ways.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Locked tiles, directional tiles, rotating tiles, and many more await you in this logic game.<br/><br/>This game was primarily designed as a casual, relaxing experience, with no game over, limited life system or timer of any kind, but I hope and think it will still be interesting for people looking for a challenge, as the later levels can be quite complex.<br/><br/>Please feel free to try the demo before buying the game!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-08T04:31:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ed/8edf3fbd997b93d836d9484aaa3bfefc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["moumix"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Moumix"], "esrb_rating": null}
