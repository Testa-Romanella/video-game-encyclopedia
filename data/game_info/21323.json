Then she noticed a note on the table. She picked it up and read: \"Your melon looked delicious, so I took it. From Farta X\" <br/>Fuming with rage, Eryi set out from her house to get her melon back from Farta.<br/><br/>Eryi's Action is a 2D \u2018trapformer\u2019 by developer Xtal Sword that is visually inspired by Super Mario, but has gameplay akin to games like I Wanna Be the Guy. Don\u2019t be fooled by its adorably charming looks \u2013 this game abounds in traps and wants you to die! However, where IWBTG was murderously difficult, Eryi's Action is additively challenging and FUN! <br/>  Trap placement is often laugh-out-loud funny and seriously engaging. Some traps simply need to be learned to avoided, but others are puzzles that will require your skill and wits to beat. Either way, Eryi\u2019s action delivers laughs, frustrating and satisfaction &amp; all for just $4.99!<br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><ul><li>12 action-packed stages &amp; boss fights! <br/></li><li>Adorably charming world &amp; characters! <br/></li><li>Fiendishly cunning traps! <br/></li><li>It\u2019s okay to fail!
