Countless hours have gone into perfecting the steering. The drone aligns with the rotation of your hand, and pushing the trigger cranks up the power. Don't worry, a tutorial will guide you through the basics, and with a bit of practice you'll buzz around the room in no time.BINAURAL AUDIOSteam Audio is used to leverage HRTF-based binaural rendering. This refers to a way of recreating how a sound is affected by a listener's head, ears, and torso, resulting in subtle cues that allow you to pinpoint exactly where a sound is coming from.CHALLENGESYou'll discover 25 unique levels packed with lasers, heat-seeking missiles and other dangers. You fly through the checkpoints as fast as you can -- the faster the higher the score. You can get up to 3 stars on each level, but you'll have to work hard because it's exclusive to the best players.LOCAL MULTIPLAYERWanna play with friends, family or colleagues? Drone Hero offers local multiplayer using pass-and-play. All players will be put through a set of random challenges. You'll all fight, but there will only be one winner.GLOBAL LEADERBOARDClimb to fame on the global leaderboard.
