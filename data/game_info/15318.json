Each object in the scene attracts each of the others in a cosmic tug-of-war that we call Gravity. Toss out a few boulders and contemplate the wonders of the Universe.<br/><br/><strong>Check out the Screenshot and Video pages to see what's new</strong>. <br/><br/>Fill your Universe with a collection of cosmic chunks: boulders, white dwarfs, comets, and chunky fireballs. Add some trails to your rocks to trace their paths. Or bust out the sparkly photon cannon - a delete button with a kick! It's a big physics based playground. Create a random cluster of boulders and watch as they collect into larger, chunky groups. Launch a super-massive White Dwarf and observe how it affects the other bodies in the system. Create a small 'solar system' and see how many chunks you can get into orbit. <br/><br/><strong>It's your Universe. Do What You Want.</strong> (^_^)<br/><br/>There are two versions of the sim. You can pilot a simple spaceship through the void with your gamepad or go full roomscale with your Vive wands or Oculus Touch controllers. The roomscale version features a new kind of 'pinch and pull' movement that makes it easy to move around in 3D space. This isn't a game - more like a physics-based toy. Might even be educational. It certainly gave me a new appreciation for how Gravity works.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b3/1b3b9bc5d14de9bac3e00adc5bb859d9.jpg", "website": "http://CrashedLander.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 29, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Don Whitaker"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Brain Blinks"], "esrb_rating": null}
