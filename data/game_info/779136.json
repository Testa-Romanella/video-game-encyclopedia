The second part is being worked on. ETA: mid/late\u00a0June</p>\n\n<p>You've come to the town - a little unnamed thing - in the first train you\u2019ve managed to catch, with naught a plan to follow. In a hurry, you\u2019ve severed all ties with your past, carrying the remnants of your old life in a portable suitcase.\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the station, right where the horse carriages wait for the passengers, you found a note.\r\n</p>\n<p>\"Opaline Manor is looking for aides: maid, servants, pages. Promised good pay, lodging, and weekly leave.\"\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Despite the rumors surrounding the manor, you took the note, and headed down the moor.</p>\n<p>- supernatural intrigue,\r\n</p>\n<p>- dark fantasy, romance,</p>\n<p>- customizable protagonist (name, pronouns, background),\r\n</p>\n<p>- one (1) gender-chooseable love interest,\r\n</p>\n<p>- 4 endings (full game),\r\n</p>\n<p>- around 20k words (full game), and approximately an hour of playthrough.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Warning: depiction of death, mentions of religion, themes of murder, shape-shifters, blood, self-medicating via alcohol, poisoning,\u00a0suggestive themes\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rating: 17+</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The Devil </strong>-\u00a0Modesta/Modesto Malyar, the mistress/master of the Opaline Manor. A proper heir, it can be said just from one look at [her/him]. Though \u2018proper\u2019 isn\u2019t a word that suits the famed Devil. Flashy and larger than life, lover of all things luxurious, Moodesta/Modesto once had the whole world under [her/his] feet. Nowadays, with only the most expensive champagne for [her/his] company, Modesta/Modesto lives as [she/he] drinks: to forget.</p>\n\n<p>[playlist]</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Mare </strong>- a stranger with eyes like daggers, clad in an aura of coldness, guarded behind a wall of secrets and silence. The townspeople say that nobody who\u2019s come in contact with the mare lived to share the tale. Others claim that the apparition, though bloodthirsty and sangfroid, is akin to a fae - fickle but not malicious. Whichever is closer to the truth, you should hope to never find out.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>The Maid </strong>- shy like a mouse, clever like a fox. The oldest daughter of a large family from the nearby village. Being hard-working and responsible doesn\u2019t conflict with her predilection for daydreaming.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>The Lady</strong> - the owner and Mistress of the Manor in all but name. A minor noble and the dearest friend of the deceased Lady Malyar. Widowed young, with no family of her own, she overseers the Opaline Manor in [Modesto/Modesta]\u2019s place. In her sparse free time, you can find her in the garden, rolling the beads of the rosary between her bony fingers.</p>\n\n<p>Engine: [Ren'Py by Tom Rothamel]\r\n</p>\n<p>Writing, GUI, coding, art: [PDRRook]\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Proofreaders/editors:\u00a0[Dom] [\u00a0Steph 'Jeneara' M] [victoriel]</p>\n<p>Beta players:\u00a0\u00a0[Dom] [\u00a0Steph 'Jeneara' M] [victoriel]</p>\n<p>Opening music by [Setuniman]\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sound and ambiance by [TheMovieMacher] [Magmi.Soundtracks]</p>\n<p>Fonts, Free for Personal and Commercial Use: [Quickhand] [What's Love?
