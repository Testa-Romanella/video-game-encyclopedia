If a player runs out of ammo, they must wait for a few seconds as they reload. Running out of ammo with a powerup changes the player back to the default ammo type.</p>\n<p>Players lose health whenever they are hit by a bullet, and are removed from the game when they run out of health.\u00a0Rounds end when there is only 1 player standing.</p>\n<p>The team consisted of 2 programming students and 2 design students, myself included.<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Please note that this game is local multiplayer only. The game will always spawn in 4 players, even those that cannot be controlled, and there is no pause menu.\u00a0</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T06:08:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/071/071537731757d9698153777ae3f607c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nicholas Burke"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
