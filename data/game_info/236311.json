The further you go, the faster you fly, the tighter the gaps. Survive until the next bonus stage for big scores.</p>\n<p>This is a simple game that I\u00a0made for my five year old son Toby (in his alter-ego guise as Super T). It's designed to help him get used to using a controller or keyboard for games. For that reason it starts slower than many similar games\u00a0might, and it's deliberately simple and clear for easy understanding.</p>\n<p>But make no mistake, it gets fast enough to challenge adult gamers as well as children. Perhaps you can show your unruly charge how it's done. Or vice versa?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cf/4cf55a094903960459267a5f99416067.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mugs Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
