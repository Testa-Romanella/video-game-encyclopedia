Or just to beat the game. That too.</p>\n<p>But don't get comfortable too fast! After the first few levels, things will start to escalate and you'll be soon\u00a0struggling to stay alive.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>May the force of Chiquito be with you.</em></strong></p>\r\nControls\r\n\r\n\r\nKeyboard with Mouse\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Use\u00a0<strong>W, A, S, D or the arrow keys</strong>\u00a0to move the spaceship, and the mouse\u00a0<strong>left click</strong>\u00a0to shoot the enemies.\r\n</li><li>Use the numeric keys\u00a0<strong>1, 2, 3\u00a0</strong>and\u00a0<strong>4</strong>\u00a0to activate power ups.\r\n</li></ul>\r\nGamepad\r\n<ul><li>Use the\u00a0<strong>left stick</strong>\u00a0to move the spaceship, and the\u00a0<strong>right\u00a0</strong><strong>stick\u00a0</strong>to shoot and control the direction of the bullets.\r\n</li><li>Use A, B, X, Y buttons (Switch /\u00a0Xbox controller) or the equivalent ones to activate power ups.</li></ul>\r\nPower Ups\r\n<p>Use the power ups wisely.

Let Mr Chiquito de la Calzada protect you for a few seconds with an impenetrable shield of jokes that will make enemies unable to reach you.</p>\r\nVicent\u00edn\r\n\n<p>I\u00a0can't figure\u00a0how Vicent\u00edn is able to party for that long every single weekend.

Use Mr T's huge fireballs to erase your enemies. Doesn't matter how many are coming towards you. Heat them up.</p>\r\nTerESIIca\r\n\n<p>She's the mascot of Albacete's ESII. Pretty stylish for a keyboard's key, right? Bait enemy ships to chase her while you get rid of them peacefully from afar.</p>\r\nVersion Details\r\n<p>For the first version, I wanted to keep it as close to the original XNA game as possible. That means resolution will suffer a bit on fullscreen mode. I plan to fix that in the upcoming 1.1 release.</p>\r\nOpen Source\r\n<p>This is an Open Source game.
