And so producing a prototype that showcases the possibility of implementing such technology in order to promote tourism in Algeria's historical locations. <br/>Our team was composed of 5 students, each student worked on different aspects of the project.</p>\n<p>The task distribution went as follows: <br/></p>\n<p><strong>AISSI Mohamed Salim:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Modeled the buildings and objects that are part of the garden area in the museum, as well as texturing them.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>HAMMOUCHE Yanis:</strong> <br/></p>\n<ul><li>Worked on modeling key elements and main pieces of the museum, that needed the use of advanced technics such as sculpting.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>DJEMA Rania: </strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Worked on building the Main hall, modeling it, and texturing its walls as well as the object contained in it.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>MOUFFOK Tayeb Abderraouf:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li> Worked on modeling part of the objects in the main hall and texturing them.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>HARKAT Adel Larbi: </strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Working on building the bathing room, texturing it, modeling the objects contained in said room, and texturing them as well.</li><li>Worked on the level design of the museum (integrating the different models and objects into unity), building the unity project, and managing the physics as well as the emersion ( sound and lighting).</li><li>Worked on the UI and user interactions.</li></ul>\n<p>The objects were later used in an android app as part of an augmented reality project, that complements this simulation where the visitor can scan a QR code and look at the objects up close, learn their use and what they are made of.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T12:33:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ba/2ba9ccc4de3f4f4c38c786399dfe337a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["L4RBI"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
