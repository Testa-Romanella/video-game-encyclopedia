Who would do such a thing? You don't know much, all you do know is you need some celestial moons to get her back. Thankfully you have your trusty wand with you.

Unthankfully, the wand is just as much an enemy\u00a0as it is a tool - while it can retrieve moons and shoot obstacles, the energy sparks won't go away, use your weapon wisely to fend off the mysterious forces trying to stop you from stealing those moons for the sake of your grandmother!<br/></p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>In Game:\u00a0</strong>Use the\u00a0<strong>&lt;WASD&gt;</strong>\u00a0to move &amp;\u00a0use the\u00a0<strong>&lt;MOUSE&gt;</strong>\u00a0to fire your wand.<br/><strong>Menu:\u00a0</strong>Use\u00a0<strong>&lt;WASD&gt;</strong>\u00a0to navigate and\u00a0<strong>&lt;SPACE / ENTER &gt;</strong>\u00a0to select.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game was made in 48 hours for the 41st GM48 Game Jam\r\n</p>\n<p>Check out the original version 1.0 on GM48 here:</p>\n<p>https://gm48.net/game/2016/moon-stealers</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T05:48:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfb/dfbf0e9c94877205c3a7a249cbbc6018.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tydecon Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
