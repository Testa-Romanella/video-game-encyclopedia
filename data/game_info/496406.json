You can the old game here, if you want to take a look. The old version was made in a little over a week with the Unity game engine, while this version was made in a little under 3 weeks with the Godot game engine.</p>\n<p>This version of the game has new features, a new layout with new puzzles, an overhauled visual style, and more!</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Controls for keyboard and mouse:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD to move and mouse motion to move around</li><li>Space to jump</li><li>E to interact with objects and continue/fast-forward dialog boxes</li><li>F to toggle the flashlight on and off</li><li>Left click and right click to use acquired items.</li><li>Escape to pause and skip dialog</li></ul>\n<p>Controls for Xbox 360 controller (only controller tested, others may work though):</p>\n<ul><li>Left stick to move and right stick to look around</li><li>A button to jump</li><li>X button to interact and continue/fast-forward dialog boxes</li><li>Y button to toggle flashlight</li><li>Left shoulder button and right shoulder button to use acquired items.</li><li>Select/Back button to pause and skip dialog</li></ul>\n<p>Currently there is no options to configure the controls in the game, as I didn't want to delay the release of the game to add them. Likewise, there is no graphics options either. This may change in an update, so if you are having any issues with the default controls or graphics, please let me know in the comments below!</p>\r\nChange log:\r\n\r\n* Version 1.0.0 (09/18/2020)\r\n  * Initial release!\r\nCredits for assets used:\r\n\r\nTextures:\r\n* Flame and smoke textures by Kenney.nl (CC0)\r\n* The overwhelming majority of environment and asset textures by CC0textures.com (CC0)\r\n* Door texture by 3DTextures.me (Free, but unknown license)\r\n* Gate and character textures by TwistedTwigleg\r\n* Solid colors are from a color pallet I used in Dreams of Fire.\r\n|\r\nFonts:\r\n* OpenDyslexicMono-Regular - opendyslexic.org (SIL-OFL)\r\n|\r\nMusic and Sounds:\r\n* Drone_Atmosphere - From MatiasMacSD - From the Sonnis.com GDC 2017 Bundle\r\n* Fear and Horror - From the OpenBundle - Downloaded from GameSounds.xyz\r\n* Sound effects from the Sonnis.com GDC 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 bundles.\r\n* Dialog samples from MicreaKitsune - OpenGameArt (CC0)\r\n|\r\nEverything else:\r\n* Created by TwistedTwigleg unless otherwise noted.\r\n* (I think I credited everything used above, but if I missed something, please let me know!)\r\n\r\nFinal notes:\r\n<p>Thank you for looking at the game!
