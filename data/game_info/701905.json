Press SPACE to jump.</p>\n<p>-If you press SPACE while in mid-air, the cleaner will glide with his bag, giving you more air-time.</p>\n<p>-The starting platform will disappear after 6 seconds, so try not to stay on it for too long.</p>\n<p>-While you cannot touch a bird's head as it will kill you, if you jump from under them, you can use them as a platform.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the #TeamSeas association.</p>\n<p>(Savers of the Oceans is\u00a0set to release on Google Play as soon as Google validates it, so keep an eye out for that if you want to generate money for #TeamSeas by watching ads!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T08:48:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/274/27464b5a317d234060e50406c175350a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jijigri"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
