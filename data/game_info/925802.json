The Kanji are ordered by their frequency throughout 5000+ Japanese Novels, and there are over 3000 Kanji. This app is simply a prototype for a tool I\u2019ve wanted for a long time.\r\n </p>\n<p>You pick up cards from a pedestal, and place them around the environment. The environment is a simple square room with a bunch of tables.\r\n </p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to add more interesting environments in the future, but for now I\u2019m not planning on working on this project further. If it gets a lot of good feedback, I\u2019ll come back, add more to it, and work on smoothing out the kinks.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Grip - Grab\r\n </p>\n<p>Left Hand - Smooth Movement\r\n </p>\n<p>Right Hand - Teleport Movement\r\n </p>\n<p>Primary Button - Grab a new card from anywhere.\r\n </p>\r\nSave File Location (If you want to erase or manage multiple save files)\r\n<p>/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.PlayingwithColor.VRKanjiCards/files/KanjiTransformData.json\r\n </p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>If I missed a credit or credited someone incorrectly, please feel free to reach out to me on Itch.io or any of my socials, so that I can correct it.\r\n </p>\r\nProgramming, Shader Programming, Baked Lighting, Design, and Development\r\n<p>By David Draper aka Playing with Color\r\n </p>\r\nTextures\r\n<p>Little Martin : Retro Texture Pack\r\n </p>\n<p>https://little-martian.itch.io/retro-texture-pack\r\n </p>\r\nKanji API\r\n<p>By onlyskin, benjaminokeefe, and MikeNatsu\r\n </p>\n<p>https://kanjiapi.dev/\r\n </p>\r\nKanji Frequency List\r\n<p>By NukeMarine\r\n </p>\n<p>Restructured by David Draper\r\n </p>\n<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/g6zxs6/a_few_years_back_5100_japanese_novels_were/\r\n </p>\n<p>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zbClv0H5VgswEDAkVmF3ikiVnoi6yGsW/view\r\n </p>\r\nCreated in Unity\r\nThings I\u2019d like to add\r\n<ul> <li>signs that if you touch with certain cards they will have that kanji appear on them\r\n </li><li>multiple kanji transforms save files\r\n </li><li>customize which parts of the kanji info are shown\r\n </li><li>example words\r\n </li><li>signboard that shows all kanji highlighted by placed or not\r\n </li><li>make it so kanji line up with each other\r\n </li><li>select and pick up multiple kanji\r\n </li><li>group kanji to align them and pick them all up in a big group\r\n </li><li>example sentences\r\n </li><li>themed areas for different kinds of Kanji</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T09:06:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d5/7d51eb14dc8f49f59d03b784f30b6988.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Playing with Color"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
