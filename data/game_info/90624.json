{"id": 90624, "slug": "endless-atc-itch", "name": "Endless ATC (itch)", "name_original": "Endless ATC (itch)", "description": "<p>\r\n\tEndless ATC is an easy to play simulation game, where you are an air traffic controller at the approach radar of a busy airport. The goal is to guide the planes safely to the runways to get a high score. If you make no errors, the number of planes you have to control gets larger and larger. How many flights at a time can you handle?\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe game shows you a tracon radar screen with locations of planes and runways. Arrivals and departures will appear randomly. The interface is simple, but the simulation is on scale and the planes behave realistically. So: easy controls, hardcore simulation.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tWARNING: this sim is realistic so it may bore or frustrate you if you're unfamiliar with aviation :) Try out the demo to find out if this is a game for you.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Instructions</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\t\u2022 Select a plane, give it a descend instruction (to about 2000 feet), guide it to the blue line at a large distance from the runway (there are arrows to help you), and clear it for an ILS (Instrument Landing System) approach, which means it will follow the line to the runway like in real life. It's also handy to check out the screenshots and the video.</p>\n<p>\u2022 So in order to land, a plane must comply to three conditions:\r\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the ILS mode of the plane is activated, </li>\n<li>the plane has to be descended low enough to intercept the glideslope; the blue circles mark the heights of 2000, 3000 and 4000 feet, </li>\n<li>the plane must intercept the ILS at a heading of 50 degrees or less with respect to the runway (in reality they use 30 degrees).</li></ol>\n<p>\r\n\t\t\u2022 You can also lose skill points when planes:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>fly too close to eachother (generally: overlapping circles and altitude difference &lt;1000 feet), </li>\n<li>leave the airspace (outer grey circle), also if they are departures leave the airspace at or below FL100, </li>\n<li>missed approaches / go arounds,</li><li>area violations / flying through weather.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\r\n\t\t\u2022 The amount of planes that you have to control is about the same as the amount of skill points you have: the higher the skill value, the more planes you have to deal with. You can also achieve 'goals' by landing a certain amount of planes in the correct way.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\u2022 Challenge yourself even more by enabling crosswinds and thunderstorms!<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\t\u2022 Some planes have an additional tag, for example 'RD'; only these planes need to land on a secondary airport.</p>\n<p>\u2022 The full version now includes lots of variation with 6 airports: <strong>Amsterdam</strong> Schiphol, <strong>London</strong> Heathrow, <strong>Frankfurt</strong>, <strong>Atlanta</strong> Hartsfield\u2013Jackson, <strong>Paris</strong> Charles de Gaulle, and <strong>New York</strong> JFK.<br/></p>\n<p>\r\n\t\t\u2022 In the menu there are options including speed multiplier, radar update rate, and a 'skill cap' for a more relaxed gameplay: this 'cap' limits the rate of inbound traffic.</p>\n<p> <strong>Updated:</strong>\u00a022 Aug 2018:</p>\n<ul><li>higher departure capacity from parallel runways,</li><li>change runway configuration (by tapping 'rwy chg' in the airport menu). Can be handy if there's weather near a runway, however after a runway change it takes a few minutes before the airport is ready for new approaches).</li></ul>\n\n<p>\r\n\t\tFor more detailed instructions, changelogs and questions, see: startgrid.blogspot.com\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Features</strong><br/>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>endless amount of planes, multiple runways, </li>\n<li>give radar vectors like a real air traffic controller,</li>\n<li>realistic mechanics and pilot behavior, but easy to play,</li>\n<li>amount of traffic adapts to your skill level, </li>\n<li>automatically saving game; resume where you left off,<strong>*</strong></li><li>choose from 6 different airports (EHAM, EGLL, EDDF, KATL, LFPG, KJFK),<strong>*</strong></li>\n<li>text-to-speech output.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em><strong>* </strong>not in the demo version</em>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/121/12175286132d417b7d5c4c06a1a00357.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 260, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["startgrid"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
