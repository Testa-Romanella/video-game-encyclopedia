Collect power-ups as you go to extend your run and get a high-score. Let me know what score you get.</p>\n<p>Power-ups include:</p>\n<p>ForceField - Invincible for a short period. Duration bar at the bottom.</p>\n<p>Health - Simply +1 health. Visibly fix the ship if health &lt; 3.</p>\n<p>Timer - A small clock item that reset the obstacle spawner to 1.5seconds.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>W or UpArrow: UP</p>\n<p>S or DownArrow: Down</p>\n<p>R: Restart</p>\n<p>BackSpace:\u00a0Clear High-Score</p>\n<p>Escape: Back/Quit</p>\n\n<p>This project was based on a tutorial I saw on YouTube, but I\u00a0made it my own by adding my own features, variables, art and style. I learnt a lot during this project and I believe it will make future projects more successful.</p>\n\n<p>I have not added any sound to this game because that was not at all my focus on this project\u00a0(It will be for a future project). All art, code and UI was done by myself (helped by a lot of googling).</p>\n\n<p>Here's to the first of many projects. If you find any bugs or exploits, please do let me know so I am able to sort them out. I may return to this project in the future to add a few more features, tidy up the code, add sound + music and remove any bugs that are found.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T06:29:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9a/d9a1386df6d0c75d4b357a7bfb5c4c9c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Oliver Kirby"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
