This demo consists of 18 stages, including a final stage bossfight!</p>\n<p>Controls for the game can be found under the\u00a0Controls option in the main menu.<br/><br/>If you run out of lives and have at least 100 coins, a new life will be awarded and 100 coins will be deducted. Coins can be collected thru-out the stages. Bonus coins will also be awarded for achieving a quick time, collecting enemy souls, and for clearing out the filth.\u00a0<br/><br/>You have an unlimited number of axes to throw so be generous with your aggression!\u00a0<br/>Boosting can get you out of some sticky situations, manage it well.\u00a0Keep an eye on your Jump bar, double and triple jumps are possible with timing. (or just panic smash...it works for me!)\u00a0Collect Diamonds for permanent buffs.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Game design and coding by Isaac Sykes.</p>\n<p><strong>Music:</strong></p>\n<p>Stage: Flight Training\u00a0 \u00a0Song: Blob Monsters Return\u00a0by Eric Matyas at\u00a0https://soundimage.org/</p>\n<p>Stage:City Bleak\u00a0 Song: City Moon\u00a0by Eric Matyas at\u00a0https://soundimage.org/</p>\n<p>Stage: Alpha Quadrant\u00a0\u00a0 Song: Constellation\u00a0 by Trevor Lenz\u00a0https://opengameart.org/users/trevor-lentz</p>\n<p>Stage: Uptown\u00a0\u00a0 Song: While the City Sleeps\u00a0by Eric Matyas at\u00a0https://soundimage.org/</p>\n<p>Stage: Downtown\u00a0 \u00a0Song: Delivering the Goods\u00a0by Eric Matyas at\u00a0https://soundimage.org/</p>\n<p>Stage: City Bleak\u00a0 \u00a0Song: 10 Past Midnight\u00a0by Eric Matyas at\u00a0https://soundimage.org/</p>\n<p>Stage: Downtown Plaza\u00a0 \u00a0Song: City of Dread\u00a0by Eric Matyas at\u00a0https://soundimage.org/</p>\n<p>These guys...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...drawn by Nicole Sloan\u00a0https://drawingsbynicole.com/<br/></p>\n\n<p>This project is in early development and all assets are subject to change.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-15T03:40:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/408/4087f7d28bfb10c829f88ca432f5bd28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 188, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["isyx"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
