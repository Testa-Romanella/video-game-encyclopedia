Rook, to drive the invaders out of Gravebourne by any means necessary, and prevent them from spreading their influence to the rest of Neumont.\u00a0</p>\n<p>_________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>This game was made for the 7DFPS gamejam, and it was made to run with the GZDoom engine, made in Slade and Ultimate Doom Builder.
