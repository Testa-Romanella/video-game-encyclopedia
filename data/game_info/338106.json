My first attempt to make something awesome with Godot engine.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Summary:\r\n  </p>\n<p>Take control of Blue or Red and bop your opponent senseless! Use your stick to bop your opponent, reduce their life bar, and win the round!</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n  </p>\n<p>&gt;Blue:\r\n  </p>\n<p>A and\u00a0D = Move left and right\r\n  </p>\n<p>W and\u00a0S\u00a0 = Move arm up or down\r\n  </p>\n<p>Shift or Space = Use in combination with A, D, W, or S keys to execute special moves.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>&gt;Red:\r\n  </p>\n<p>Left and Right arrow keys = Move left and right\r\n  </p>\n<p>Up and\u00a0Down arrow keys = Move arm up or down\r\n  </p>\n<p>Keypad 0 or\u00a0Enter key =\u00a0 Use in combination with the Left, Right, Up, and Down arrow keys to execute special moves.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Downloads:\r\n  </p>\n<p>I've exported a Windows and a Linux version. The Windows version was tested briefly on my\u00a0machine only. The Linux version is completely untested, and I'm honestly curious if it even works. Feel free to comment if you're a Linux user and it works!\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>I\u00a0may expand on this idea in future, but for now expect the game to be really janky. There is no end goal beyond completing rounds due to time constraints.
