The project was built using as base the 2DShooter project from the course.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Modification include:</p>\n<ul><li>New style and feel, making it look like a magic dungeon.</li><li>New Sound Effects and music.</li><li>Instead of scoring points as the main missions, now the intention is complete each maze as fast as possible, i.e. time trials.</li><li>The game offer 10 levels, but each level is randomly generated based on a seed, so technically the are infinite mazes.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Design, Development, and Animations: Andres Perez</p>\n<p>Music by:\u00a0\u00a0https://tabletopaudio.com/</p>\n<p>Archer and Arrow Sprite by:\u00a0https://ansimuz.itch.io/tiny-rpg-forest</p>\n<p>Bow and Arrow Sound Effect:\u00a0https://www.zapsplat.com</p>\n<p>Wall and Background Texture:\u00a0\u00a00melapics / Freepik</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T04:04:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14a/14add6360e8e5ca0de3f336725b332b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["andresperezl"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
