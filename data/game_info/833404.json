Empty guns must be dropped, or \"stage-loaded.\" Stage-loading is a three-button reload system. When a weapon is not at maximum capacity, it can be reloaded by pressing <strong>Z-X-C</strong>\u00a0(or <strong>1-2-3</strong>, or whatever keys you prefer to bind), in order. How and when you press these buttons is at your discretion. You are free to use third party macro programs, or \"charge\" the reload by pressing 1 and 2 before a reload is necessary.</p>\n<p>&gt;Bunny-hopping and accelerated back-hopping (a-la Half-Life 2)\u00a0is possible in APOSTATEzero.</p>\n<p>&gt;A slo-mo ability is available.</p>\n<p>&gt;Doors can only be opened with IEDs. If no IEDs are in your inventory, <strong>t</strong><strong>here is always another solution.\u00a0</strong>Be mindful of your environment.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>APOSTATE1 is an upcoming cyberpunk first-person shooter that takes place in a parallel timeline where the axis powers prevailed during the second world war- eventually leading to a near-apocalyptic technological singularity.<br/></p>\n<p>Players will assume the role of an \u201cOperator\u201d- an employee of the now-dominant Kaiber Corporation, who will task them with simulating future attacks against critical infrastructure by a group known only as \u201cThe Apostates.\u201d</p>\n<p>The AGI \"IXIA\" will guide you through these simulations. She will provide you the body and mind of one of three Apostates that she predicts will be alive during this period.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T18:00:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e2/4e2ebd014c63d6a827ab561f73019d18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Etesep Software"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
