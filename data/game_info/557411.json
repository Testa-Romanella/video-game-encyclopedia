After sending a distress signal back to Lunar M Corp. it's up to you to hold out until the extraction team arrives by loading and operating turrets, repairing doors and running for your life!</p>\n<p>This is my first gamejam and my first actual released game, so I hope you enjoy the experience and feel free to leave comments below!</p>\n<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>\n<p>Survive 9 minutes by slowing the alien advance. Use the toolbox to gain repair charges that can be used to fix doors; likewise use the ammo crate to refill turret ammo. Grenades can be throw to instantly kill aliens, and the Command Terminal can be used to turn turrets ON and OFF... be careful though,\u00a0 as if your power supply reaches zero the facility will shut down!</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Tips -</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Toolkits and Ammo Stations -</strong> These objects provide charges of their respective contents. You can only carry one type at a time, at each station takes 25 seconds to resupply. To select a tool stand in front of a station and press <strong>E</strong>. To resupply a turret or fix a door stand nearby and press <strong>Q</strong>. If your action is successful a wrench icon will appear on the screen.</p>\n<p><strong>The Command Terminal -\u00a0</strong>Using the Terminal will be a critical part of your survival. To use it stand in front of the terminal and press <strong>E\u00a0</strong>(also e to close). When in the terminal screen you can select a turret and\u00a0press <strong>Q</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong>to turn it ON/OFF. Turrets are a great way to hold off the aliens, but beware - they use ammo and <strong>Power</strong>. If your power reaches Zero, you lose. The command terminal is also useful to monitor the alien attack, by watching for flashing door icons.</p>\n<p><strong>The Kill Switch -</strong>If your power is looking low you can press <strong>K\u00a0</strong>on the terminal screen to engage the kill switch. When engaged all turrets will deactivate and power will regenerate at 20 units/sec. You can not access the Terminal screen while the kill switch\u00a0is active. To leave the screen with the kill switch engaged, press <strong>E</strong> or <strong>Esc</strong>; To cancel the kill switch press <strong>K</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Grenades</strong> - Grenades are great for accessing rooms filled with aliens to replenish turrets. Pick up grenades throughout the facility and throw them with <strong>J</strong>. Grenades instantly kill aliens and can kill large groups.</p>\n<p><strong>Doors -\u00a0</strong>Doors can be opened with <strong>E</strong>. It's recommended to close doors again after passing through a doorway however sometimes it can be strategic to leave them open for retreat. When a door is destroyed you will hear it no matter where you are in the facility, so check the terminal regularly.</p>\n<p><strong>Lose Conditions</strong> - There are <strong>3</strong> lose conditions; die to the aliens, run out of power and reactor failure. While the first two are self-explanatory, the third happens when Aliens are drawn to the power in the floor reactor and try to destroy it.</p>\n<p><strong>Win Condition</strong> - Survive the timer! It's 9 minutes until the extraction team arrives, and the time bar can be found at the top of the Terminal screen.</p><p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p><p>Game Design, Art, Programming and Music by Atlas Grey</p><p>Sound effects courtesy of the official Nokia 3310 Jam 3 Sound Pack by Trix\u00a0https://twitter.com/Trixelized</p><p><strong>Thanks for playing!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T09:42:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6d/f6daed6e962ec5368f2455e5d06d6fab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AtlasGrey"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
