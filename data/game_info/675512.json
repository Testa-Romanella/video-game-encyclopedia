Unfortunately I planned poorly and ran out of time soooo it\u2019s pretty ROUGH. You are a car that can GLIDE, but also go between universes, someone planted these unstable orbs and you must stop them with the device attached to your trailer. The longer time passes the more unstable the device gets and the harder it is to control. Originally planned to make more items become unstable however I ran out of time, soo the theme is kinda a little low in the game currently. Web port soon!
