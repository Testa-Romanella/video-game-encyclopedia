Survive the assault of the demon casino and roll as many times as possible to make a great fortune!<br/></p>\n<p>Loot Goblin is an isometric action game where the main mechanic is rolling a slot machine, the more you roll, the more you earn but rolling too much in a short span of time and a little bad luck can easily be your undoing.<br/><br/>Submitted as an entry for my first game jam, the Juicy Jam. I did this project solo, I'm not an artist but so I tried my best in the given time frame, I created all 3D assets using blender. I am also not a sound designer but I borrowed some great royalty free sounds:</p>\n<p>https://shapeforms.itch.io/shapeforms-audio-free-sfx</p>\n<p>- Shapeforms Audio</p>\n<p>http://sonniss.com/gameaudiogdc</p>\n<p>- Sonniss<br/></p>\n<p>https://onemansymphony.bandcamp.com/album/royalty-free-soundtrack-collection</p>\n<p>- One Man Symphony<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T07:42:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f9/8f98ee8b25784d72e98b1c7218b9aa98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NukedDev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
