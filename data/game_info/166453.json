NOTE: for anyone rating this game for LDJam39, the download includes another zip of the original release of the game that was finished in time for the jam, for fair rating purposes.<br/></p>\n<p>If you play it, let me know what you think. Thanks! And sorry about the swearing.<br/></p>\n<p>- Steve<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf2/bf20ef193a962dd2571b238fff2aa2d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Steve Lee"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
