The game was made with members of Signature School's Programming club but is separate from the organization as a project. I wanted to try my hand at a simulation game involving many interacting elements. Everything is affected by everything. Guards can shoot you, but can also shoot each other. Potions can be used on the player or the guards. The elevators can be activated or broken by both the player and the enemies. These behaviors combine to generate a narrative in the gameplay. It was a great time, and please\u00a0<strong>let me know if you want more!</strong></p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Programming -\u00a0<br/>Ryan (GamerHangout)</p>\n<p>Programming Assistant (programmed unused assets)-<br/>Elijah</p>\n<p>Art-<br/>Sal<br/>Logan/Cathackcz</p><p>Music/SFX-<br/>Aidan</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T16:16:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f8/4f80adb7511034a3aa9c90722afb8869.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gamer Hangout"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
