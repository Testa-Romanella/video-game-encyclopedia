For example: 2+2 = 4, 4+4 = 8 etc... <br/><br/>Three different game modes:<br/> - Classic 2048<br/> - 6x6 grid<br/> - Timed mode - score as many points as you can in 60 seconds<br/><br/>Can you get the 2048 tile? If you can, why not keep going and get 4096, or 8192? What about a 16384 tile???<br/><br/>If you are struggling you can use a Double Bomb to double the value of a tile, or a Remove Bomb to remove it from the game board.<br/><br/>Features Game Center leaderboards and achievements.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:08:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f12/f12e8432794f4c5ebd4f020ab1e42db2_ZBYKvnQ.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["SyGem Software"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["SyGem"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
