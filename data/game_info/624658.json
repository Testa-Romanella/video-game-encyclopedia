This is my first time using Unity for a Trijam so it was pretty challenging;\u00a0the\u00a0game\u00a0is very simple and a bit rough  and\u00a0I\u00a0went over\u00a0the 3 hour time limit, but\u00a0I'm\u00a0pretty\u00a0happy\u00a0with\u00a0how it\u00a0turned out\u00a0and it was a good learning experience, as always! All code and art was made during the jam. The music and SFX were made before the jam for a different project.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T03:55:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3e/a3e37b048e361f78339477654b2f2e12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheoClarke"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
