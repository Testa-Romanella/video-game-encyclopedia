It's shooting your friends with a twist.\u00a0 Quite literally. The only way for your character to move is to roll at high speeds and your head launcher rolls with you. Do your best to jump, dodge and roll out the way of your shooty tooty friends, while shooting and tooting right back at them.</p>\n<p>Expect brighter and bolder colours when this game is fully realised, like Geometry Wars meets platforming.</p>\n<p>If you like the game, leave a comment! Give me your thoughts and tell me what you'd like to see put in.\u00a0If you really like the game,\u00a0leave a donation! Even a dollar is enough to buy me some groceries in LIDL.</p>\n<p>Thanks for checking me out, you're not so bad yourself.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>This prototype is only available to play with 2-4 players.</strong></p>\n<p>Controls are:</p>\n<p>Player 1 Keyboard:</p>\n<p>Movement - WASD\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shoot - E\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Dodge - Q\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Ready - 1</p>\n<p>Player 2:</p>\n<p>Movement - IJKL\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shoot - O\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Dodge - U\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Ready - 2</p>\n<p>Player 3:</p>\n<p>Movement - Arrow keys\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Shoot - RightCtrl\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Dodge - Bck Spc\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Ready - 3</p>\n<p>Player 4:</p>\n<p>Movement - Numpad Arrows\u00a0 \u00a0 Shoot - Num 9\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dodge - Num 7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Ready - 4</p>\n<p>Controller PS4/Xbox:</p>\n<p>Movement - LeftStick + X/A\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Shoot - Square/X\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dodge - Circle/B\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Ready - Options/Start</p>\n<p>(All controllers work but pairing them up is a little buggy.
