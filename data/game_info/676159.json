And you, are a bottle of potion,</p>\n<p>who wants to become the greatest alchemist of the world!</p>\n<p>In order to do so, you shall find the hidden magic circle.</p>\n<p>But watch out for every step you make, since the chemical you carry may easily get spilled.</p>\n<p>And then, BOOM! The reaction with the ground might kill you.</p>\n<p>Also, you may collect elements on the way, and mix it with the chemical inside you to form a new component.</p>\n<p>You could use the potion you carry to corrupt the door that gets in your way.</p>\n<p>Do keep in mind that some chemicals are inert and would not react with others.</p>\n<p>By the way, the reaction with the door could also form a new element and thus changing your chemical.</p>\n<p>Use your wisdom to solve the puzzles!</p>\n<p><strong>## How to Play</strong></p>\n<p>You can click the ground to move the lovely character. If the destination is not reachable, the movement will be forbidden.</p>\n<p>You can collect elements in the scenes. If the given element can't react with the concoction in your bottle, nothing will happen, or you will get a new concoction. You can judge the type of elements and concoctions by the colour.</p>\n<p>Concoctions in the bottle will be spilt after every movement. The ground blocks may be eroded if they can react. Be careful that you can't move to a null block.</p>\n<p>You need to break doors using some specified concoctions, or you can't pass them. When you get the <strong>**Magic Circle**</strong>, you win this game. Don't worry about trying! If you make a wrong decision, you can press `Z` to undo it. You can also press `R` to restart the whole game.
