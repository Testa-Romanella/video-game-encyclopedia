But then these fuckers came around:\r\n\t\t</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Meet Jim, Jack and Johnny. </strong>These Three Dudes got caught after they tried to fought the law and the law won. And today they tried it again!<br/>\r\n\tAfter watching all four seasons of Prison Break they thought they would know how to escape this place but after Jim accidentally set a gas bottle on fire the prison cells got open and a wild riot started.</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tLuckily Adam has some supper powers left from his previous job in a superhero theme park and can lift up these guys (\"E\" or right shoulder trigger) to bring them back in their cells. He also stealed this cool move from his buddy Max called Bullettime (\"B\" or left shoulder button) where he is actually invincible for a little time.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAnd now its up to you to bring Jack, Jim, Johnny 7 other dudes back into their cells!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tGood Luck!\r\n</p>\n<p>You are more then welcome to give Adam small tip for is awesome prison guard job.
