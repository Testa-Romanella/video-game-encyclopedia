{"id": 428758, "slug": "endgame-road-to-salvation", "name": "Endgame: Road To Salvation", "name_original": "Endgame: Road To Salvation", "description": "The world is under siege from an unknown enemy.  Gates are appearing, spawning demonic entities. Major cities have been destroyed with overwhelming force. Most of the population has been decimated, but the dead rise again to feast on the living. There was no warning, no signs, but there is no doubt. This is the apocalypse. There are rumours of massive fortified strongholds around the world, properly defended against these dark invaders. The closest stronghold is called Salvation, but getting there will prove to be a long, challenging road. If there is any hope of survival, it rests far to the North at the gates of Salvation.<h3>Description</h3>I am proud to present the first release from Indie/Anon Games, Endgame: Road to Salvation. It is a road trip combat style of game with rpg/survival/roguelike elements and full ragdoll physics. It is a unique hybrid of top-down/twin stick shooter and third person camera control while driving. As the player, you have to drive North and reach the safety of the distant stronghold Salvation, delivering your caravan with as many survivors as possible from the cruelty of the Apocalypse. You can accomplish this monumental task by staying armed, fed, and mobile, and keep your caravan fed and safe. The undead are more active at night, meaning you should find shelter and stay hidden, and hope that nothing tears down the walls around you. This is a really difficult game and you may be forced to make tough decisions on the fly, but the random generation and AI storyteller will keep you moving.<h3>Drop In/Out Local Co-Op</h3>The game contains local co-op split screen, which needs 1 gamepad controller and 1 keyboard/mouse. Single Player can be played with either the keyboard/mouse or a controller. Player 2 can drop in or out of the game at any time, maintaining their character through a slot-based save system. Co-operative play allows certain privileges such as reviving a fallen player, controlling a trailer turret, or just to have a friend watch your back.<h3>Some features include:</h3><ul><li><strong>Dynamic Weather/Temperature and Day/Night System</strong> - Enemies are more restless at night, try to find a safe place to sleep before the sun goes down, or be prepared for a long night.<br/></li><li><strong>Character Creation with Extensive Skill/Attribute System</strong> - Pick a random character or customize your own with multiple classes.<br/></li><li><strong>Vehicle Modification System</strong> - Multiple vehicle mods can be found, transferred from other vehicles, or crafted.
