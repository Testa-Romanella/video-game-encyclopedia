To stop them, you must become a deadly weapon, smashing them with your minimalist energy. But they keep coming, and they're only getting more severe. How long can this go on?<br/></p>\n<p>Move your ship using the left analog stick. When your ship is fully charged and flashing, you can press the A button to unleash a charge attack. During this charge, you are invincible and any enemies that you hit will be killed. Be careful, because when you aren't using your charge, the touch of any enemy is instant death.</p>\n<p>When you have defeated all enemies in a gallery, you will automatically move to the next one. As the game continues, enemies become more and more aggressive. You can watch for patterns in their behavior. Watch out for flashing enemies, they may be just about to charge you!</p>\n<p>You score points by destroying enemies, and you earn more points by destroying multiple enemies in a single combination hit. The game ends if you come in contact with an enemy while you are vulnerable, or until you have cleared all the galleries. Just how many are there? <br/></p>\n<p>Coded by Xin Jin Meng.<br/>Music by Xylo Ziko (http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Xylo-Ziko/)<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks to Richard Allen, Richard Anuszkiewicz, Archillect, Carolina Carvhalho, The Daily Task, Laurent Desgrange, Fahrul (http://redafs.com), GramUnion, kilavaish, Moult, Myoshka, picmix, Norman Rafferty, ravenectar, stoepsorama, Troyka,\u00a0 Victor Vasarley, and the r/GameMaker  Discord.</p><p><em>1.0.0.4 update (Post-Jam)<br/></em></p><ul><li>Keyboard support added.
