To the waters and the wild with a faery, hand in hand,\u00a0for the world\u2019s more full of weeping than you can understand.</em></p>\n<p><em>~ W.B. Yeats</em></p>\n<p><strong>Story</strong></p>\n<p>Five years ago, Nora and her family moved away from the town in which she'd grown up - mostly due to media frenzy around her strange disappearance into (and re-emergence from) the woods, her lack of memory of those events, and the unexplained injury her twin brother acquired while helping search for her.\r\n  </p>\n<p>But due to her ailing grandfather's health, her family is back in Pine Hollow in time for her senior year in school. And\u00a0the town is just as Nora remembers it. Or so she thought. However, Nora quickly learns there's more to Pine Hollow than she realized and more to herself than she ever knew.   </p>\n<p>Armed with the newfound knowledge that she's not quite human \u2013 and neither are many of her classmates \u2013 Nora works to uncover the mystery behind her past disappearance and whatever happened to her brother. Desperate to repair their strained relationship, and equally driven to learn as much as she can about herself, Nora finds herself drawn deeper into the paranormal community in Pine Hollow \u2013 and the life of one of six guys with his own, unique problems to deal with.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The most important lesson she learns is that life isn't a faerie tale and even if it was, not all faerie tales have happy endings.</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<p>-45,000 words in demo (700,000\u00a0 in completed game)<br/>-6 love interests<br/>-customizable MC name<br/>-20+ planned endings<br/>-smart, strong willed MC<br/>-developed side characters<br/>-30+ original backgrounds<br/>-branching story with choices that have real impact on the story path<br/>-loads of Faerie shenanigans</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b1/3b1878f20cac2a83b319ab207a75f001.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 269, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Steamberry Studio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
