Thrown into the pit with nothing more than a blunt dagger and scruffy robe, suddenly surrounded by a screeching, scraping flock of birds you feel the satanic rage engulf your vision, the primal hunger for blood taking over - and you just paint the walls red.\r\n</p>\r\n\u26e4Pledge allegiance to the demon bird\u26e4\r\n<p>\r\n    The <em>Satanic Bird Cult</em> accepts up to 4 cultists for a frantic local-multiplayer brawl. Players dash around the underground cellar and compete in pinning birds to the dungeon walls.\r\n</p>\r\n\u27b5 Pinning birds and gaining points\r\n<p>\r\n    What every cultist thrives on is pinning as many birds as possible to the dungeon walls in order to summon the ancient one. A thrown dagger will travel through the air for a limited distance taking with it every bird it hits on the way. If the dagger hits a wall every encountered bird will be released from its pitiful fate and the player gains points.\r\n</p>\r\n\u27b5 The eighth commandment\r\n<p>\r\n    For the roguish cultist, it is possible to steal an opponents kill by interfering with their dagger with a skillfully aimed shot of their own.\r\n</p>\r\n\u27b5 A dashing cultist robe\r\n<p>\r\n    Players can freely run and dash around the dungeon floor and lure the mindless birds into a perfectly aligned multi-kill.\r\n</p>\r\n\u27b5 The sigil on the wall\r\n<p>\r\n    The glowing red sigil that moves over the wall is a direct portal to hell. Birds pinned to the sigil will sack the player an additional amount of points.\r\n</p>\r\n\u26e4Perform the ritual\u26e4\r\n\r\n\u26e4Summon the ancients\u26e4\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n        Samuel Femb\u00f6ck aka SamFembck - Game Design and Programming\r\n    </li>\n<li>\r\n        Thomas Hofer aka SlowTom - Game Design and Programming\r\n    </li>\n<li>\r\n        David Florian aka daweed_art - Game Design, Concept Art and 2D Animation\r\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>Satanic Bird Cult</em> was developed as a student project at the University of Applied Sciences in Salzburg.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T23:56:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e7/0e7dd927dc385a5cca1e7564cd7278f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Pigeon Protocol", "SlowTom", "Samuel Femb\u00f6ck"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
