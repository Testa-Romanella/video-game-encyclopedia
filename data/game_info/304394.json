SAVE THE WORLD.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Zarkadian K:Nights is a visual novel by Studio 4th ZERO. Assist the enigmatic \u201cSukui\u201d (\u6551\u3044) and his rebellion against the eight deadliest, most elite generals in the world-encompassing Holy Empire and save the world from the chains of tyranny that the Empire has placed upon you.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>YOU PLAY A ROLE IN THE STORY:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t the type of game where you take control of some bland main character. You are your own character...(sort of). You are psychically connected to Sukui and experience the adventure (primarily) through his eyes. One of your roles as a \u201csecond mind\u201d is to assist Sukui in making important decisions, on behalf of the entire rebellion.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>NO COOKIE CUTTER CHARACTERS:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Every (main) character exists and has a unique personality and story. Whether one is arrogant, insane, or reluctant to fight is anyone\u2019s guess. However, while assisting Kyun, you will eventually have to watch each general be killed in order to proceed... This provides a moral dilemma. Who is more justified in their cause? Is it you and the Zarkadian Knights for wanting to bring peace? Or is it the Holy Eight, each joining the Empire for their own specific reasons?\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>MULITIPLE ENDINGS!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>As per usual with any visual novel game, this game features more than one ending! I won\u2019t spoil how many endings there are to the game, but I can say there is at least 1 ending...</p>\n\n<p><strong>WARNING!</strong></p>\n<p>This game contains\u00a0<em>very</em> loud noises. Please use caution when playing with headphones.</p>\n<p>This game is unsuitable for those under the age of 15.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-29T03:23:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/522/5224fdb67c7d5768caf1f841ea7016cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Studio 4th ZERO"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
