There were plans to update the game with new enemy types across different waves(including walking alpacas with their OWN guns, and maybe some creepy alpaca god or something!). But then there was some really depressing life stuff happened and it just kinda vanished in the aether.</p>\n<p>Recently the downloadable files have been recovered from the obscure reaches of dropbox to be sent here, on itch.io! Now YOU can experience this really simple and honestly kinda bare-bones game where you just shoot a gun in one direction as a hydra-like horde of fuzzy mammals quickly overwhelm you.<br/></p>\n<p>Will this game gain any updates on Unity? Oh god no! Those original source files are lost forever in a dead laptop, and to go back to Unity after what happened recently? Yeah, hard pass!</p>\n<p>BUT will this game get a sequel, perhaps on a new, cheap, and pretty well supported engine? Well... only time will tell.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T09:14:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cab/cab6da50d019f24fc9b1510a7f72f527.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AnthonyPanics"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
