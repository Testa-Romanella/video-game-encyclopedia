{"id": 148172, "slug": "goblin-market", "name": "Goblin Market", "name_original": "Goblin Market", "description": "<p>The Goblin Market is a text-adventure-horror game prototype with some graphical elements. It is based on the 19th century short story, The Yellow Wall-paper. I made this prototype to assess how to integrate historical text and ephemera within a game environment to help connect players to the history that shaped the making of the original story by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. I am trying to assess the narrative and text elements along with basic exploration in this prototype.</p><p>You can read more about my thoughts on the design process:</p><p>http://explorelostworlds.blogspot.com/2015/01/the-...</p><p> </p><p>Previously, I developed a Skyrim mod to explore characterization and quest game mechanics. You can read about that http://meaningfulplay.msu.edu/proceedings2012/mp20...and see some video here:</p><p>The next step is to bring the characters and mechanics from the mod and the Goblin Market narrative together in a 3D environment. All proceeds from this game will go towards hiring students to help create the final game. I work for free:)</p><p>Comments about the game are really appreciated. In particular I'm interested to know if:</p><p>1.) Do you think the idea is interesting</p><p>2.) What do you think about bringing in real history elements, like pages of books, newspaper clippings, advertisements, artifacts, etc?</p><p>3.) What do you think of the narrative?</p><p>Note: I made this by myself this winter in about a week as I didn't have much time.  I used Flash to prototype so I could get something together quickly.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f8/6f8dabb45f442948f6be00e87f920762.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Elizabeth Goins"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
