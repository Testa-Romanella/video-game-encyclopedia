Then the machines took over.\u00a0\r\nNoria, a young engineer, lost everything the day the automated police forces went haywire.

And I was glad to see I didn't instantly died when letting the robot see me. (nod)\r\nVoice acting top notch.\r\nVery well done.\"\r\n2017-07-14 21:41:40 by\u00a0Cassiebsg</p>\n<p>\"This demo has fantastic visuals and atmosphere, but it's just a small taste of what's to come. Still, Silverspook paints a well written and visualized world with a promising protagonist.\"\r\n2017-07-12 14:16:28 by\u00a0Blondbraid</p>\n<p>\"Although this was just a small taster for a larger project, this has got everything: badass music, great art &amp; animation, decent voice acting, a couple of nice puzzles and heaps of cool. If I was ever on the fence about buying Neofeud, this has pushed me off of it (into the yes garden).\"\r\n2017-07-12 05:03:38 by\u00a0Stupot+</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eac/eac1eb980f59b2240201493f7ee2aaaa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["silverspook"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
