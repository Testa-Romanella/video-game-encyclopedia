Diagonal movement is supported. Use the arrow keys to move. Exiting at the top of the zone resets the puzzle.\u00a0How many times can you make it across the ice?</p>\n<p>Due to real world obligations, I had to leave this game jam entry in prototype form. I used my WIP \"demake\" framework as the base and built out procedural ice slide puzzles. This quick prototype demonstrates how a singular top-down mechanic could be formatted into a standalone game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T09:46:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe2/fe29756df41d0d6283a09a75097b84ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bryantjamestech"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
