However, if you don't have The Quest, you can also play the expansion as a standalone game.<br/><br/>Just when you thought you could enjoy a peaceful vacation on the Island of Buyan, you learn its Prince has been assassinated and the artifact providing its ancient defense of invisibility has been blown up. It looks like some powerful and evil force is determined to rule Buyan and enslave its people. Grab your weapons, it's time to fight for freedom again.<br/><br/>To access the new areas (not applicable if you are playing the expansion standalone), go to Mithria harbor and talk to captain Hanty, then select \"Luko V\" as your travel destination. It's recommended you reach at least level 80 before taking on the challenges posed by this expansion.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T01:59:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a9/9a9b5e60872a6b62340aef5c1cec4621_0mOHRIa.jpg", "website": "http://www.redshift.hu", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Redshift"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Vilya, BT."], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
