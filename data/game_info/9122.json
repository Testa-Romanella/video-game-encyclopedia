We hope you enjoy your visit: explore the town, take in the sights and sounds (mostly groaning), dine on whatever you can find, and get to know the locals (though we suggest you avoid the dead ones). For recreation, try zombie combat: use what you find, or visit one of the town\u2019s many weapon-crafting merchants for your choice of the finest hand-scavenged implements of zombie removal. If you decide to stay, we recommend you find one of our relatively comfortable safe houses \u2013 but please remember to board the windows and doors. Have fun, and good hunting! <br/><br/>\u25c6 Create and customize your own survivor with hundreds of items including weapons, clothing, and equipment. <br/><br/>\u25c6 Fend off zombies from your safe house, then take to the streets to scavenge for loot: find kick-ass weapons, useful supplies, and hidden surprises. <br/><br/>\u25c6 Explore Festerville\u2019s restaurants, apartments, police stations, stores and more... but make sure to return to safety before zombies get you! <br/><br/>\u25c6 Go on quests to help other survivors: choose your own path to uncover the story of this off-beat zombie apocalypse. <br/><br/>\u25c6 Sign in to Game Center and help your friends survive! <br/><br/>Like us on Facebook for the latest news and updates: <br/>facebook.com/ZombiesAteMyFriends <br/><br/>PLEASE NOTE:<br/>- This game is free to play, but you can choose to pay real money for some extra items, which will charge your iTunes account.
