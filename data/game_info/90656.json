Choices will not be restricted to one of two obvious \"good versus bad\" options. Instead, this game's goal is to embrace Persona 4's choice system which is all about TIME (the main obstacle). No playthrough is ever quite the same as WHO you decide to spend time with will then cost the player's options for other character interaction. Sacrifices will have to be made, and yet, there's plenty of opportunities to explore different relationships. This game will also avoid the cliche' paragon of virtue versus complete sociopath. <br/>Players also have to balance out the limited amount of monetary/sexual resources in their afterlife as the dark entity known only as, the Tax Man, comes to collect at the end of every month cycle. Having little to no sexual encounters comes with a cost, as the Tax Man has imposed sexual quotas to all citizens living in his city. Players can of course make up the difference by paying cash to the Tax Man, but that means spending more time at work as a stripper to pay off those debts\u2013and a stripper's job is not without its share of dangerous encounters Choose wisely who you want to spend your afterlife with, as there are no second chances just like real life on any given day. </p>\n\n<p>Creator's Comments:<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to read about and special thanks if you try out my game.
