However I didn't have time to implement the core absorbtion so... well you won't be able to\u00a0finish the level ^^'</p>\n<p>The second part of the gameplay is centered around the lifetime of the \"virus\" we're playing, which is precisely 60 seconds. The idea here is that you can spend some of the energy you gathered to recharge that battery and expand your lifetime. But I had no time to implement that either, so you'll have to live for only 60 seconds for the moment x)</p>\n<p>The last part of the gameplay will be the defenders, who will be maid to protect the core and doing so by chasing the virus around the map, until they touch it, destroying it by the same time. But they don't exist for the moment so, you should be ok...</p>\n<p>The controls are ZQSD and ENTER to absorb energy.</p>\n<p>And that's pretty much it x)</p>\n<p>**************************************************************************************************</p>\n<p>Hope you'll find the idea cool,</p>\n<p>Best regards,</p>\n<p>Peace.</p>\n\n<p>DELVie</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T12:12:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/266/2669397bb06a5c74e964f01c03f18f34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DELVie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
