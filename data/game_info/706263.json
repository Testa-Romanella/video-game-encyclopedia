The core gameplay is based on the players thinking of 10 terms that fit into a specific category. Each term's point value is calculated the same way as a scrabble word; you get more points for using longer words, and get bonus points if your words include a higher number of rare letters. Players are encouraged to share their scores with their friends, to compare each others' knowledge, and to make the game more competitive.</p>\n<p><em>Below is an example of my score in the \"Land Forms\" category:</em></p>\n\r\nInspiration\r\n<p>Word Warble is based on a folk game that I used to play while hanging out with my friends. The game works by suddenly surprising someone by\u00a0grabbing them and yelling a prompt into their face, like: \"NAME 10 CITIES THAT START WITH THE LETTER 'O'!!!!\". Then you\u00a0must vigorously and repeatedly tap the middle of their forehead, until they finally manage to name those ten cities, despite all of the stress and surprise they are facing at that moment. I thought it would be a great idea to take this game and bring it to excel, because the game is not overly complex, and because\u00a0excel is great at doing all sorts of crazy calculations. Giving my simple game a complex scoring system would be a great way to take advantage of these affordances.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T15:11:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3df/3df7be4da47585592724d0f745ec81ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Josh Finkel"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
