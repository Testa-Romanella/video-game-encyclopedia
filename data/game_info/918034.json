Search for key objects, solve puzzles and face dangers in order to escape.</p>\n<p>If you want Selene's story to continue, the only way to do it is with the support of the community so that this can grow and be completed.</p>\n<p>The game is in a very early stage of development, since this is a prototype that as a developer I made in order to learn and experiment with new technologies and methods. All this to be able to complete and improve the game I'm currently working on: \"Unbearable\". I invite you to take a look if you liked \"Project Selene\" since it is a similar experience but longer and more complex.</p>\n<p>UNBEARABLE: https://farelas.itch.io/unbearable</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\r\nInputKeyboard/MouseJoystickAimShootRunSHIFTInteractECrouchCInventoryIPauseESCAPE", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T07:08:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/098/098b09ef3bf128c2d6da8cae46b048d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 336, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Farelas"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
