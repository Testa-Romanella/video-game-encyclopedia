To navigate the levels, the player must hold down L and R to jump, and alternating between L and R allows Donkey Kong to hold onto or let go of the pegs on the levels. When Donkey Kong is only holding onto one peg, he will spin, allowing him to climb up the pegs. The game features new moves, new items, and minigames. It also uses the dual screens to give the illusion of one tall screen. The game features a multiplayer mode for up to four players.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2007-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-09T16:42:18", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 3.17, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 2, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 14, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": ["Paon"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
