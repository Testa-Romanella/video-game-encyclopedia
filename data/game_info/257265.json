In this first-person shooter you will need to fight for your life. You will need to show full awareness in order to fulfil the game goal of finding 12 documents in a procedurally generated level protected by machines that don't even know what mercy is.<br/><br/>You will be equipped with a weapon and some spare ammunition but be aware that you will definitely need to scavenge for more to fight the machines. To even stand a chance you will have to operate your weapon in full detail. Use the keyboard (keys can be remapped) in the Mouse+Keyboard version. Use motion controllers in the VR version.<br/><br/>Good luck!<br/><br/><strong>Key features:</strong><br/><ul><li>Ability to play with Mouse+Keyboard and/or in VR (HTC Vive, Oculus Rift)<br/></li><li>Procedural generated level with high replayability<br/></li><li>Hyper-realistic and detailed weapon mechanics<br/></li><li>Simulation of gun malfunctions (failure to eject and double feeds)<br/></li><li>Realistic bullet ballistics based on real life formula including bullet drop, bullet travel time and ricochets<br/></li><li>Localized sounds for an even more immersive experience<br/></li><li>Key remapping (for the Mouse+Keyboard implementation)<br/></li><li>More to come</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:52:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/927/927e1fbb00cf4c2500d1ab2a2b4363e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 207, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Koenigz"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Koenigz"], "esrb_rating": null}
