Both online play and local play using a single mouse are available.<h3>Game Modes</h3><br/><strong>\u201cMinimal\u201d</strong><br/>A game mode where players compete to clear tables in the smallest number of shots.<br/>The mode is designed primarily with solo play in mind, but it's also available in multiplayer.<br/><br/><strong>\u201cPoint Ball\u201d</strong><br/>A PvP-only game mode. Players alternate turns every shot and compete for points by clearing balls from the table.
