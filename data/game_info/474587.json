There is no direct unit control (like in the earlier Settlers games)\u00a0and this is just a small demo that was created in one month by one developer so you have a few objectives (basically build all \"higher\" tier buildings) and that is all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is <strong>not\u00a0</strong>a full game but just the first level or a vertical slice of what it could be if more time was invested. The game uses Unreal Engine 4 and is available for Windows PCs only.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T06:32:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71c/71cda15c14ebf1b9961545445cea1c00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Apolyon6k"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
