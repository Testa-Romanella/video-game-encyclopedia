Please do not judge on small actions I could've made a mistake on. As I have just started on getting used to the controls and what you can do and why I take so long.</p><p>This was supposed to be a joke game and probably won't have a sequel or continuation unless good feedback has been achieved.</p><p>The current space the game takes up is up to: <strong>450MB</strong> or <strong>392MB</strong></p><p>If you have much space to spare, please playtest this. If there is any error such as the game not launching, feel free to tell me!</p><p>Currently in development and 'slowly' worked on. Currently, a debug build should be here and just little to do.
