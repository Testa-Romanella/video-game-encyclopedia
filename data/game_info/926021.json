When crashing into another car, a \"Lose\" window is displayed. When you press the pause button, the game stops and the corresponding window is displayed.</p>\n<p>To ensure the infinity of the road, parts of the route are generated and all objects are moved to the zero position when certain coordinates are reached (the tiles of the route and the maximum distance are filled through a separate component in engine).</p>\n<p>For the interest of the movement, other car models were used as bots. For them, the behavior and the spawn system on the track are described.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls configured for gamepad and keyboard.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T10:37:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4d/f4d2dededaccf6670405fd03b2570142.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["maxrbs"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
