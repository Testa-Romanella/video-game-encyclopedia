Play in a bullet hell roguelite hacking minigame,\u00a0gain insight for new highscores, and use them to increase the difficulty. Complete tasks to unlock new items and characters, and dial up the\u00a0difficulty as high as you can handle.\u00a0<br/><br/>I made this game in about 6 months, but I still have tons of ideas and things I'd wish I could add more. If you like the game, please consider downloading and leaving a small donation as I would love to expand the game and release it on steam. Thank you!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T19:12:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be3/be3a003f9198e7ab21f1cf5f5c5833ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["ButteredCoffee"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
