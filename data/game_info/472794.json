{"id": 472794, "slug": "alterplaces", "name": "Alterplaces", "name_original": "Alterplaces", "description": "<p>Made in two weeks as part of My First Game Jam - Summer 2020.</p>\n<p>More of a demo/proof of concept due to the time constraints of the jam, and the fact that it's the first thing I've ever made with Unity and every step was a learning process. I intend to expand it in the future, hopefully into a full (if still probably short) game.</p>\n<p>If you have the interest, you can find the devlog here. It's somewhat incomplete as I was putting most of my energy into development, but I hope to write up a postmortem to add to it after taking a breath or two post-jam. I learned a lot and am really glad to have participated. Big thanks to the community and everyone in the MFGJ discord!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Arrow keys to move</li><li>Space to jump</li><li>Left shift to swap to dark world</li><li>Z to swap to light world</li><li>Left shift + Z to swap to void world</li><li>P to pause</li></ul>\n<p>Controllers may also work, but all won't be supported. As tested with an Xbox One controller:</p>\n<ul><li>LS to move</li><li>A to jump</li><li>Left and right bumper to swap worlds</li><li>Menu/Start to pause</li></ul>\n<p>As it is right now it's fairly easy to get yourself into walls when swapping between worlds, but you can always swap to the void world to fall offscreen and trigger a respawn.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Design, programming, art, and music by Justin Crandall<br/></p>\n<p>TripFive font by PixelMush</p>\n<p>Massive thanks to the YouTube channels of Bardent, Brackeys, and Lost Relic Games<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T03:50:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21c/21c009adcb57977a3be2db8ab28c42a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["theioti"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
