You can build farms for resources, towers to defend your kingdom, and barracks to create units to go to war! You can then upgrade these buildings in interesting ways to become more powerful. There are a lot of upgrades, and a lot to discover!</p>\n<p>The game turned out to be a little bit bigger than our previous game jam, as it has a total of 50 different buildings and 28 different units. Making it was a blast though! But we might need some sleep now...</p>\n<p>Anyways, hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>Piet and Stan</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T08:19:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/825/825e80ff82c5c31d2f1f006563abc419.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["standepuydt"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
