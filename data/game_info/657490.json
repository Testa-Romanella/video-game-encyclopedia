The game does not offer a solution or outcome to the investigation, however through the gameplay we hope to promote discussions about harassment found both in the work environment and in the wider social arena. Allowing the player to experience all sides of the investigation process we hope to bring awareness of the impact that harassment can have, and how important it is in the context of recent and current real world developments that staying silent should no longer be an option. We all need to talk about these issues</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T03:43:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/339/339e4f74173deb2c426cbf9c982ccf95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LittleFleet"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
