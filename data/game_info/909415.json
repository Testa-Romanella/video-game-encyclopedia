You progress through two levels, the cargo level and city  level, defeating enemies in strategic turn-based combat and picking up  clues on your way that progress the story of our four characters:  Nadiya, Dreyar, Astra and Joe. Collect all the clues in the two levels  to complete the game, and explore the narrative of CyberCity!\r\n This project was done for the Multi-Platform Games  Development Module (ECS657U) at QMUL. Our game took inspiration from  Persona 5 and many other turn-based strategy games. For a few of us in  this group, it was our first time developing a game. <br/></p><p>Creators:</p><ul><li>Aadam Huda</li><li>Sarah Brahimi</li><li>Ibraheem Samih</li><li>Gentian Veliu</li><li>Hina Matsuzaki</li></ul>\n<p>Any Feedback is great :).
