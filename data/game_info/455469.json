The reason we signed up for this game jam was to take some pressure off of myself from making bad art.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game offers a deck building experience where you can build up a collection of powerful cards to take down the enemies.</p>\n<p>The story - not present in the game - is something along the lines of a the player, named Antapollo, has lost his parents to a band of vampires in 1890's London. Antapollo's goal is to become the strongest vampire to exist, not caring for any of the cities and villages he is burning. He wants to become strong enough to take down the entire band of Vampires that killed his parents.</p>\n<p>This project was incredible, but it was also too ambitious - and of course being my first game it's a mistake many new developers make. <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-15T05:27:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4db/4dbb3ac8070e7fd93c4d12b80821681d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChristofB"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
