Unlike that game, the button you must press keeps changing. The upcoming pipe will show you what you need to press.</p>\n<p>Play in <strong><em>Training Mode</em></strong> if you're still building muscle memory with your keyboard. Each short level will introduce a new key to press and give you a few pipes to practice what you've learned so far.<br/></p>\n<p>Move on to <strong><em>Arcade Mode </em></strong>to play infinitely and go for a high score.<br/></p>\n<p>Or play in <strong><em>Classic Mode</em></strong> if you prefer something more similar to the original game. The gameplay is slightly more challenging \u2014 though still much easier than the original Flappy Bird \u2014 and only uses the X key.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-13T06:58:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3e/e3ea41baf8435ca213405945b6d57cca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["beekins"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
