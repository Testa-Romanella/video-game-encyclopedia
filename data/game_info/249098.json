{"id": 249098, "slug": "npc-name-gen", "name": "NPC Name Gen", "name_original": "NPC Name Gen", "description": "Few things can bring your role playing session to a grinding halt faster than one of the players engaging a background NPC and saying, \"Well met, stranger!  Who are you, and what is your business here?\"  Coming up with a decent, racially appropriate name right there on the spot can be challenging, and can derail your narrative while you sit and ponder.<br/><br/>Now, you can rely on NPC Name Gen to spit out random names for you in the blink of an eye, thereby keeping your game on track.  It's incredibly easy to use - just select a race, and tap the \"Give me a name, quick!\" button until you get one you like.<br/><br/>All the normal player races are represented, with orc and dragon thrown in for good measure.  Names are generated with an algorithm that produces results that are not only racially appropriate, but generally pronounceable as well.  Tiefling \"virtue\" names are also included.  <br/><br/>In addition to the name, the generator will sometimes decorate the name with a reference to the NPC's stature, station, profession, appearance, or reputation, to give a little extra flavor and provide a role-playing cue to both game master and players.  For example, your players might randomly encounter a half-orc named Rethgaz the One-Eyed, a gnome called The Amazing Nimeravar, or an elf who goes by Fin'ifol the Ranger.<br/><br/>The generator is designed to minimize duplicates, providing you with an impressive variety of original character names.
