A tiny game harvested from an appreciation of nature, and in anticipation of the coming season.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is my first Bitsy game and my first completed personal game, made for the Harvest Bitsy Jam. I'm about to start my final undergraduate year of games design, so I made a small game to help me get back into the swing of game development.</p>\n<p>I hope you'll enjoy this little project, feedback and ratings here are absolutely welcome!
