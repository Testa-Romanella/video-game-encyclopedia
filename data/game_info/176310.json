Use your ship's ability to freeze time to your advantage, dodging bullet and allowing you to fire your weapon. Once you've fired in stopped time, unfreeze to let the bullet fly and pierce through multiple enemies! You can only fire when time is stopped and this uses up your energy so being strategic with your shots is extremely important. While waiting for your energy to recharge you'll have to dodge our 10 unique enemies and try to stay alive. Can you reach the infamous Crimson Watcher and defeat him? Try your hand at Chrona Machina!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9d/e9daf6b862247316b6d78aa01851aed8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Stranger Space"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
