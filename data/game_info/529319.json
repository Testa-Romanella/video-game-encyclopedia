The game code\u00a0was written in a day, however I had produced the graphics beforehand.</p>\n<p>The aim of the game is to place a tent adjacent to each tree in such a way that the correct number are in each row and column, as shown by the numbers alongside. \u00a0When you have the correct number in a particular row or column, the number will turn green.</p>\n<p>You can move the flashing selection box around the grid using the joystick (arrow keys), and place or remove a tent by pressing fire (Z).\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>As you complete more levels the size of the grid, and therefore the complexity of the puzzles, increases. The quicker you solve each puzzle, the more points are added to your score, up to a maximum of 99 per grid.\u00a0Puzzles are created using procedural generation so there is an endless number to solve.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can currently play in the browser above - after the competition deadline has passed, the game will be available for download to play on real hardware, TheC64, VICE\u00a0or other emulators.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T05:58:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff1/ff13326e696bb700998a3b5ba16081f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Arlasoft"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
