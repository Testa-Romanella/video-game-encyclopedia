Tagged targets have a ID number and they are marked <em>BLUE</em>. Targets without an ID are marked <em>RED </em>on the <strong>Radar Monitoring System 3000 [RMS3K]</strong>. Triangulate the target to send a report. Some targets may have an old ID from the <strong>RMS2K-1</strong>. They are marked <em>GREEN </em>on the <strong>RMS3K </strong>screen overlay. You may want to report these targets as well to get some benefits.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tEach misleading report or missed target without an ID will have consequences.
