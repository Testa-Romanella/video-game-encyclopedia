Conquer 5 unique levels in a single run in this refreshing take on the roguelite genre. With dozens of items, gear, abilities and perks to synergize together on each run, you must prepare yourself to become as powerful as you can before the boss arrives! Fall at any point, and its back to the very beginning...<br/><br/>Between runs - unlock new stats, items, gear and even new playable characters to drive off the Murkor invaders once and for all!<h3>A unique light and darkness mechanic</h3><br/>Whilst adorable and clumsy in the light, Murkors transform into powerful beasts when in the shadows. As the sun sets in each stage, choose how to combat the enemy and use light to your advantage to keep those pesky Murkors under control! Do you cross that chasm engulfed in shadow? Or can we get a bit more light in here??<h3>Earn XP and farm your gear</h3><br/><br/><br/>The boss is coming, and you're on the clock! Complete randomized quests and challenges throughout each stage to prolong the boss' arrival and get yourself geared up with new weapons, abilities and tech. Earn XP, farm better gear, and head into the battle as strong as you can be. Chests are scattered throughout each stage - find and unlock as many as you can to improve your chances of lasting until sundown!<h3>No two runs the same</h3><br/><br/><br/>Each run in Die After Sunset is completely unique - from the challenges you complete, the perks and abilities you are rewarded, to the chests available to loot. Quests and challenges arrive procedurally in each stage - it's up to you to decide which ones you can tackle to reap its rewards. The better you complete each challenge - the better your rewards. Synergize your weapons, gear and abilities each time and build your unstoppable run!<h3>Meta-progression is the best progression</h3><br/><br/><br/>Between stages, unlock a variety of new gameplay stats, items, abilities, and even playable characters! Enemies occasionally drop 'Mucus' which can be banked once per stage, if you can find the deposit. From minor upgrades like a faster dodge and double-jump, to game-changers like 2 banks per run and item vending machines!<h3>Take on the invaders in co-op mode</h3><br/><br/><br/>Coming soon as a FREE Early Access update - stand your ground in the battles for Earth alongside your friends in co-op!
