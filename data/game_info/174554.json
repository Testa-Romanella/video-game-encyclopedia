You must become the richest Bob Ross in the world.</p>\n<p>In order to do so, you must collect and sell the most valuable asset in the universe: the Wilderness Trail\u2122 paintings. And to do that, you must hunt down and capture as many Wild Bob Rosses as you can, to bring them back to your sweatshop and enslave them.</p>\n<p>The more enslaved Rosses you have, the more Wilderness Trail\u2122 paintings you produce. The Wilderness Trail\u2122 paintings are used as ammunition and as food, so manage them well. If you starve, you die.</p>\n<p>Beware of the Military Bob Rosses.
