The game takes place in a fictional family pizzeria called \"Freddy Fazbear's Pizza\", where the player takes the role of a security guard who must defend themselves from the restaurant's animatronic characters that become mobile and homicidal at night. \r\n</p>\n<p>Cawthon conceived the idea of the game after receiving criticism of his previous game, <em>Chipper &amp; Sons Lumber Co.</em>, for its unintentionally frightening characters that had animatronic-like movement. Developed in six months using the Clickteam Fusion 2.5 game engine, <em>Five Nights at Freddy's</em> was released for PC in August 2014 on Desura and Steam. The game was later made available on iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. \r\n</p>\n<p>Upon release, the game received generally positive reviews from  critics, with praise for its originality, simplicity, and atmosphere,  quickly gaining a cult following. It was the top-selling game on Desura for the week ending August 18, 2014, and became the subject of numerous popular \"Let's Play\" YouTube videos. The game's success led to the launch of a media franchise,  including several sequels, spin-offs, books, and merchandise, with a  film adaptation in development. The game's popularity has also made it  subject to numerous imitations and fangames. \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T14:11:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/612/612b44fad997b4c68ab4ce14e0b1606e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 226, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zeb89 Number 1 Fan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
