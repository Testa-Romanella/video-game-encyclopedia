The attention to detail is stunning!\u201d \u2013 5/5, App Store<br/><br/>\u201cThe graphical look, feel and timing is absolutely spot on.\u201d \u2013 5/5, App Store<br/><br/>\"Great authentic graphics, interface and sound too. When's the next one coming out?\" \u2013 5/5, App Store<br/><br/>\"Highly addictive!\" \u2013 5/5, App Store <br/><br/>\"One of those games that I can honestly recommend to anyone without a blink of an eye.\" \u2013 AntyApps.com<br/><br/>_________________<br/><br/><br/>Space Pilot 2094 is the first in a new range of Game &amp; Watch inspired, retro LCD games that have all been carefully designed from the ground up to look, feel, sound and play authentically. Just like the original hand-held games from the '80s \u2013 they will be easy to pick up, but difficult to master!<br/><br/>In Space Pilot 2094 you must guide your ship left and right, avoiding the falling asteroids while keeping an eye on your fuel level \u2013 which can be topped up whenever the tank appears at the bottom of the screen. Run out of fuel and it\u2019s game over. Hit three asteroids \u2013 time to call Houston! As the obstacles increase and things speed up the game will get difficult, but never impossible, thanks to the clever patterns you can learn from repeated plays.<br/><br/>Can you \u2018clock\u2019 the game by reaching a score of 999 and resetting everything back to zero?<br/><br/><br/>**  NO IN-APP PURCHASES \u2013\u00a0NO ADVERTS  **", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:56:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/919/9198d4b5d5494b6a6216b8290520db28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Mark Stoneham"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Mark Stoneham"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
