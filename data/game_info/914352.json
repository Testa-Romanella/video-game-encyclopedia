Next time I'll have to request time off or scale down my goals better for the amount of time I have. All-nighters aren't an option either since I currently work driving a vehicle, and risking the lives of others for a Game-Jam just doesn't sit right.<br/><br/>Either way, this was fun! I decided to do it on a whim and really needed the break from my current project Card Combo. It was exhilarating jumping into a fresh project and just rocking out some tasks. <br/><br/>The Project File I uploaded is mostly intended for Educational dissection, however if anyone wants to rehash into their own Project go for it I guess, just email me about it! I would love to see how it helps or what it turns into! thelettucepie@gmail.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T12:56:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45e/45e6bf41fd2580cb3adb58187ce73acb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["lettucepie"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
