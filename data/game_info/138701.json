There's a lot I'd like to improve in the game such as the sounds, wave designs, a lot of gameplay polish, enemy models and some messy code. I didn't have time to do these though as I only had 10 days to make the game and around half of them were taken up by other things such as work and visiting uni's.</p>\n<p>I'm happy with how the game turned out as a whole though, even though there are quite a few things which I'd like to change, I\u00a0still think I did well to make the game with the time I had. I also learnt a lot about 3rd Person games as it's the first time I've tried 3D\u00a03rd person. I might go back over this for a future update of the game if I get time around college.</p>\n<p><em>Will probably post source code/project files later.</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Rigging &amp; Animations - Mixamo</p>\n<p>Music - Blame the Forsaken</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/105/1051d915726f10d4526f29f23d82e45c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Anthony Sturdy"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
