{"id": 818966, "slug": "dice-fudge-quest", "name": "Dice Fudge Quest", "name_original": "Dice Fudge Quest", "description": "<p><strong>Dice Fudge Quest </strong>is a strategy with turn-based RPG mechanics, made for the <em>GMTK Game Jam (2022)</em> by Cheesecake and BalloonLantern.<br/><br/>Play through varied sets of encounters (Well, only one for now), where your goal is to defeat your foes while not getting defeated yourself. BUT! There is a twist, all actions are determined through six sided dice. Each side of dice has a unique functionality, whether it is to attack a target, heal up or defend (avoiding all damage for the round). Make sure to click your die to roll it!\u00a0The enemies are also bounded by this rule and you can see their outcomes before your turn and use that information to strategize accordingly. Speaking of, how is there any strategy in this game? Unlike the enemies, you have a limited use reroll button, which allows you to change unwanted results. So if you see you're in for a deadly attack, you could attempt to spend some of the uses to get a Defend result.<br/><br/>Have fun, and perhaps come back in the future! We are planning on making an expanded version with all the ideas we didn't have time for once the Jam is over\u00a0:)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T14:24:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c48/c48e58a54f550337254052131baab9c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["balloonLantern"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
