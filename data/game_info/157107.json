He has all the talent in the world, but what little motivation he once had has all but dried up.</p>\n<p> Branak has the opposite problem. He is a Wisp, a newly inducted member of the guild, with seemingly misplaced dreams of greatness. He is determined to prove himself in the eyes of his superiors and take his place among the Wraiths.</p>\n<p> They are partners.</p>\n<p> In the midst of completing a job and evading their sworn enemies, the Knights of the Thorn, they are presented with a bigger job. Much bigger...and far more noble than they would typically agree to.</p>\n<p><em>Grant me the resolve to return to the treasures<br/> I cannot yet obtain, the ingenuity to obtain those I can,<br/> and the wisdom to know the difference.<br/> - Wraith Prayer</em></p>\n<p><strong>Battle System:</strong></p>\n<p> Almost everything on-map in Canvas is evented, including the battle system.
