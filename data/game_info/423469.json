I spend my free time taking pictures of every detail of a Bug-type Pok\u00e9mon. Colorful wings, long horns and small eyes. For this reason, I want to share my passion, so I want to run a small photo contest! I'm inspired by the Bug-Catching contest in Johto. You should take pictures all Pok\u00e9mon that you meet. I'll evaluate your photos assigning a score; you could become the best photographer! Use the app to take pictures. I'll be waiting for you... good hunting and you gotta catch 'em all!\"</p>\n\n<p>This is an alpha,\u00a0Let me know for advice or bugs in the comment section.</p><p><strong>Pok\u00e9mon (Day)</strong></p><ul><li>Butterfree</li><li>Beautifly</li><li>Hoppip</li></ul><p><strong>Pok\u00e9mon (Night)</strong></p><ul><li>Venomoth</li><li>Dustox</li><li>Zubat</li></ul><p>You can find shiny version!</p><p><strong>Instructions (Desktop version)</strong></p><p>SPACE - Shot<br/>ALT Left - Flash (to flee Pok\u00e9mon)<br/>F - Speed up game time (only when the clock hits zero the first time)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T04:18:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81e/81e81e642c61d2018f6ecf86c52fd91c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Michisco"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
