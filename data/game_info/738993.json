I'm not going to be working on any of these files however may remake some of the ideas or use them in different ways (My other game\u00a0Cruxflaw being an example)<br/><br/>For any advice on controls, check the youtube video. If you want to see the development of the P.E.E.A.C droid project or 5 days before, feel free to check out my channel!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T07:37:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7d/a7d8a8e97d8343b07e5bc773001abc8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jackawaka"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
