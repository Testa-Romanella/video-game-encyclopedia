Press <em>ESC</em> to open the menu.</p>\n<p>This game has been made for the Godot Wild Jam #8, with the theme <em>Black Hole</em>.<br/></p>\r\nRules\r\n<p>Part of the game's fun is figuring out how its system works. So I recommend you to play a bit before reading the section below.</p>\n<p>Your ships move automatically, and plant a seed every 5 moves. You can select a ship to edit its moves by clicking it, or using the button on the bottom left. The closer your ship is to the black hole, the slower it moves.</p><p>Once a seed is fully grown, it can be collected by a nearby ship. After a ship has collected a seed, it will plant a flower on its 5th move.</p>\n<p>By planting flowers, you unlock additional ships (which makes the collect easier). You can have up to 3 ships. Then, there is no end game! Just stop when you feel like it.</p>\r\nAssets\r\n<p><strong>Font</strong>\u00a0:\u00a0<em>Playtime With Hot Toddies</em>, by GemFonts<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-22T04:45:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7f/b7ff10921adb95f4bda38a5d57d34a0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Itooh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
