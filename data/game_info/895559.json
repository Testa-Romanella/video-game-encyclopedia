This\u00a0is based off of a Scratch project that I made when I was eight years old.\u00a0I wanted to make this game to expand my skills and to finally be able to say I've made a game before. I do not recommend you donate (unless you insist) until I have posted a couple projects. Thanks for checking this game out!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T15:01:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/191/1919e84d45e9c57d0a0f8a22277da081.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fFOAM"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
