What started off as a simple 2 variable generator, is getting constant updates for max entertainment. more like, I'm constantly experimenting with the small amount of\u00a0knowledge about coding that I know and this project is a huge lab experiment.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>This project is free, but I will be selling the C# unity scripts that make this game possible for anyone who doesn't know how to code, or doesn't like how time consuming coding is.\u00a0All of the codes in this project will be compiled into one ZIP. if You bought a zip, and I update the zip. message me on me on facebook, and i'll charge for only the new codes through paypal/cashapp then email you the codes. I'm not sure how much other guys charge, so i'll charge depending on the complexity of the code.</p>\n<p>Why? because a code that can generate random sprites, strings, and sounds can be used, and is used in a lot of AAA titles.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed1/ed1f544d6b0be5b1949b913adb4e6e4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Marko&Co Entertainment"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
