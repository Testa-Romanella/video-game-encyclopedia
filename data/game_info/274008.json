(There are some control issues if the game isn't fullscreen. To go fullscreen use the 2-sided arrow button on bottom right).</p>\n<p>In your adventure, you are accompanied by your friends.\u00a0 You need food to survive, but there is not enough food for everyone. Sacrifices must be made.</p>\n<p><strong>KeyPoints:</strong></p>\n<p>-&gt; <em><strong>You control the hero character</strong></em> and your party consists of a sidekick gunman, three civilians and a medic. <em><strong>Your party will follow you</strong></em> wherever you go.</p>\n<p>-&gt; It is game over <strong><em>if the hunger meter goes full</em></strong> or<strong><em> if the hero is dead.</em></strong></p>\n<p>-&gt; You <strong><em>cannot pick health vials</em></strong> if the medic is dead.</p>\n<p>-&gt; The<strong> </strong><em><strong>effect of health and food pickups gets divided </strong></em>by the characters. So \u201cSacrifices must be made\u201d.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to opengameart.org users Michele Bucelli and bevouliin.com for the graphics.<br/></p>\n<p>P.S. This was my first ever LD Game Jam. The game didn't turn out as I had originally thought but I am glad I could finish it in time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c61/c61c11a9c9733e33ad3ea96723059cb1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["najmm"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
