They come back corrupted. To save them, Steven will have to face uncomfortable truths about his friends, his family, and himself.</p>\n<p>(Rose Quartz is Rose Quartz AU, canon divergent from A Single Pale Rose)</p>\n<p>Content warnings for body horror, depictions of PTSD, and\u00a0graphic descriptions of violence, including blood and injury.</p>\n<p>Made in Twine, SugarCube, and Another RPG Engine.

This is a non-commercial fan-based work.)<br/></p>\n<p>For the curious, I have included the modifications I made to the base engine to implement the game's features. I can release more detailed documentation if there is interest.</p>\n\r\nKnown Issues\r\n<ul><li>The game will not work in Internet Explorer due to JavaScript compatibility issues.</li><li>Don't refresh the page while the game is running if you can help it. The JavaScript doesn't always refresh correctly, and this can cause numerous errors.</li><li>Effects that have no removal message, such as Stonewall, still force the player to click through the effect removal notification at the end of a round. This is an issue from the engine I used; I'm looking into it.</li><li>Respawn counters behave erratically and unpredictably. I'm looking into this.</li><li>The character boxes in the battle screens change positions slightly when links are clicked. I have no idea what causes this.</li><li>Music does not loop nicely. This is a limitation of the default audio functionality of SugarCube. I have been told there is a way to make it use WebAudio instead, which would support gapless looping, but I do not know how to do this.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T04:01:11", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["A Friendly Irin"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
