Be careful tho, the monster can hunt you too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The whole game from the menu to the playing experience is voice-controlled, be sure to check out the rules before playing so that you know which commands are possible and which are not.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Developers</em></strong></p>\n<p>Ali</p>\n<p>Luca</p>\n<p>Chelsey</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T07:43:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ca/1ca3d54116127c4c99187335bfabf4d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PrinceAliSaga"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
