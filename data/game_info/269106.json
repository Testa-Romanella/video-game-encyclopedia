It's probably still really really buggy but I don't want to fix it due to it being a mess. The game itself is inspired by Cavestory and momodora. Throughout the development I kept cutting things out until I decided that I was just going to make a 10 minute experience tops. After that I decided to increase the volume of enemies and powerups until I felt it enough. As a result\u00a0I had removed the map from the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It seems I\u00a0have also not written a script to close the game.</p><p>Special\u00a0Thanks:<br/>Friends</p><p>Family</p><p>Brackeys:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYbK_tjZ2OrIZFBvU6CCMi</p><p>MortMort:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/user/atMNRArt</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/148/1480cc4488067bbaa801bf7441cd3e11.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chaowei3"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
