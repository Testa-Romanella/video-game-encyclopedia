{"id": 545617, "slug": "reasons-to-live", "name": "Reasons to Live", "name_original": "Reasons to Live", "description": "<p>Reasons to Live is an early prototype of a\u00a0writing project combined with a platformer game based on a moral argument against suicide and explores grounded reasons\u00a0to continue living. It takes the two perspectives of a suicide victim and the people left behind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Currently working on a 2nd draft of the writing, background sprites/animation and typographical level design. The vision is to make\u00a0the pixel art gradually increasing detail as the perspective of the character gets higher in resolution.</p>\n<p>It doesn't intend on having a formal conclusion\u00a0because it doesn't have to end. Credits should be available at all times instead of only at the end. The credits will make up the text at the top of the game, reachable by climbing.</p>\n<p>The audio version for accessibility for full blindness is currently being designed. It intends to explore the basis poem inside a gradually uplifting soundscape.</p>\n<p>In the next release, we are making the platforms easier to cross to mimic the small short term goals needed to get out of a downward spiral. The poem will be able to be read by just using travelling left and right but you will have the ability at any moment to climb upwards and explore.\u00a0The intention is to eventually have the text serve as platforms in certain areas.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I would love to get your feedback, especially in areas of improvement for you :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T05:31:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0cc/0cc977b671b559b90dd41c2637a5aa12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["The Republic"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
