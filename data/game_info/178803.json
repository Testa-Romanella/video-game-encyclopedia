Match the different potion types to make a larger potion. Once your potion is big enough, you can create a \"Super'Splosion to gain tons of points. This also allows you to get some \"SuperBonus\" points. Once you have 4 SuperBonus points, the SuperBonus begins. For a short amount of time, potions are worth huge amounts of points and getting a Super'Splosion during this time will get H U G E amounts of points! Try and get the highest score possible!</p>\n\n<p>I also put in the source code in this page, a <strong>fair </strong>warning my source is not organized very well.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/647/647605bb2bec323a981644006645c395.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["snipr_sr"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
