Now, as a Helios agent, it\u2019s time for covert damage control. Your mission: infiltrate the research station, assess the threat level, and destroy their work if necessary. Good luck, agent.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The star of this game is a robotic chaser, powered by AI, that follows your player as you run throughout a labyrinthine space station. Your robotic nightmare is learning from your every move. Each item you use, every path you take, and every juke you attempt will help it adapt and anticipate your next move. You\u2019ll have to think creatively, innovate new strategies, and keep changing your own tactics if you want to outsmart the machine.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Evade your enemy with 2D, side-scrolling platforming. Run, jump, slide, and even teleport to traverse the inner workings of the space station.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>It\u2019s not just the AI robot learning and adapting\u2014we are too! This is an Early Access game, so as we learn more about its performance and get ideas from players, you can expect even more features and new ways to experience the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T02:32:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/325/325a53c76b1e0ab65209f2b17376875c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Strife AI"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Strife AI"], "esrb_rating": null}
