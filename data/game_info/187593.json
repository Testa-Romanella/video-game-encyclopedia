Developed solely and entirely from scratch for LD41 compo by Nolan Graham in GameMaker Studio 2. Music was created in Bosca Ceoil. I would like to ask the judges to rate the game based on mechanics rather than content, as I focused more on mechanics than I did on making the game massive. I tried to showcase the different mechanics throughout the game as best I could with time constraints on the amount of content I could add. That being said, hopefully you enjoy.</p>\n<p>Controls: WASD to move, left-click to shoot, R to restart from the title screen, with archer use shift and input desired direction to charge.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd4/cd42fa4074bfbffa18fa784485a82d05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ngepic"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
