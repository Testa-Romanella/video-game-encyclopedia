The theme is 'Harvest', hence, Harvey, our protagonist.\u00a0The idea is somewhat Overcooked-inspired, but applied to the 'Harvest' theme.\r\n    </p>\n<p>I got bored with doing the planting, watering, harvesting, and delivery myself, so added a few bots to make it more interesting. They can get stuck between tasks, but watering any dry plants can help release them. Good luck!<br/></p>\n<p>Movement via WASD, actions via E.\r\n</p>\n<p>This project is open source, and implemented as part of Dino.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T20:31:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d3/4d37613d80431d89905485fdc94144d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["russmatney"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
