Note that your speed and the quality of the shots are both taken into account to count your points. Depending on the level of complexity, and the game mode, you have a limited number of attempts.</p>\n<p>Targets can be fixed or moving. Beware of the similarity between some of them. Coins are hidden here and there, collecting them will increase your score. And if you have the time and the energy, try to find the hidden objects to get even more points.</p>\n<p>Three game modes are implemented: campaign (progress), random (quick game) and custom (select your world and the difficulty).</p>\n<p>New worlds and new targets will be added in the future updates (currently: three worlds, several hundreds of targets).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-19T05:40:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24b/24bbf60b5da4208f4bf7abb64d900e8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 249, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Boite"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
