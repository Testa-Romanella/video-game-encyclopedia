It is in very early access and because koosh_studio only has 3 people including my boss we will put this as a side project. We want to get endy the enderman 2 finished it will have high graphics and it will be 3d and also made with unreal engine so stay around.this game is 40% done so it will take a while to finish also we are now going for making a good game instead of many bad games so we are not out of business yet. And I am 11 years\u00a0 old this company is runed by kids. Our budget is low and my salary even lower. I hope u enjoy this early access game. It has like 10 levels so just donate to us if u want to get this game done faster or raise our budget.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T05:14:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e8/6e85494436e49188c8a43065126a69bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Koosh_studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
