Your surreal journey will twist even the sharpest of minds. Traveling through a vast, weirdly beautiful terrain, you must concoct potions, cast spells and lure the help of some very bizarre inhabitants to uncover the secrets that doom Kyrandia.\n<br/><br/>\nCrafty Kyrandian veterans from the first Fables &amp; Fiends adventure, The Legend of Kyrandia, may recognize their favorite land of giant frogs, talking trees and really strange berries. But this isn't just the same old Kyrandia! Challenging puzzles, new characters, and lots of self-conscious wisecracks from our heroine make Hand of Fate more challenging than it's predecessor.Return to the whimsical land of Kyrandia where giant frogs, talking trees, and other equally strange denizens make their home!\nThe State of Mind System enables you and over 50 characters to change your mind, mood and mayhem based on preceding events.\nSolve puzzles, encounter side-quests!
