But there's a twist: Benjamin, the main character, is aware that he's in a video game, and he's aware that the video game he's in sucks. But due to an unfortunate series of infinite-loop Yes/No choices where No is not really an option, Benjamin is forced into agreeing to be the main character of the game despite his objections. Along the way, he is joined by Anthony, his best friend who is obsessed with the strategy guide of the game that they are currently characters of, and Carol, the not-so-secret game developer self-inserted into the story, and things really start to go off the rails.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures:<br/>\r\n2 story routes to play with their own unique endings<br/>\r\n3 additional hidden endings and many other easter eggs to discover, including entire other games hidden within this game<br/>\r\nBackseat Developer Crystals- these allow me to tell you where to go from over your shoulder just like your friend does when they force you to play their crappy RPG maker game<br/>\r\nFull voice acting with all characters voiced by the same person<br/>\r\nA mostly original soundtrack with music made by Eric Francis", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-29T02:59:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a9/1a9adaa2665882efc1cd0d226ffe1220.jpg", "website": "https://ericfrancisrock.com/twomoons.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eric Donaldson"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Eric Donaldson"], "esrb_rating": null}
