By walking the user through hundreds of thousands of dead bodies in photorealistic CGI scenes, the creator Ali Eslami aims to inspire an active awareness towards big data that represents massive deaths, and compassion for the people behind those numbers.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOn the basis of a virtual journey through the history of European bloodbaths, an ocean filled with body bags containing recently drowned Syrian refugees, and casualties of the Syrian civil war, DeathTolls Experience immerses us in the meaning of these figures, opening up an emotional perspective on this suffering and terror.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:55:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed2/ed27a9c58d8a55533a474f5aa0124e46.jpg", "website": "http://alllesss.com/deathtolls-experience", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 100, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ali Eslami"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["XRBASE"], "esrb_rating": null}
