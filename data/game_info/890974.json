Upon escaping, your total time and number of kills are displayed. There are a total of 120 slimes in the Realm, divided into 80 light slimes and 40 dark slimes.</p>\n<p>If a fired arrow hits a wall then it will stick, and must be recollected. However if an arrow hits an slime, it becomes available immediately. You start off with 10 hearts and walking into a slime will make you lose one. After taking damage, or walking between screens, you get a brief period of invincibility.</p>\r\nCONTROLS:\r\n<ul><li>WASD - Movement in the menus and game.</li><li>SPACE - Selection in the menus, fire an arrow in-game.</li></ul>\r\nASSETS USED:\r\n<ul><li>Kenney Font Package - Kenney</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T15:06:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eaf/eaf0c844bc9a8d555cf71139aa0d87a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Donian"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
