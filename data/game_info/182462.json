However, the scurvy dogs who hid the treasure laid traps and pitfalls all around the riches, and you forgot your weapons. Fortunately, your partner and you have planned for this moment, training all the way across space. You have mastered the art of lifting each other, balancing atop each other\u2019s heads, and hurling each other like human turnips. Nothing can keep you from gaining the riches you desire!</p>\n<p>This is Space Heist, a 2D couch co-op platformer with pirates!
