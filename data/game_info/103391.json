We know I'd be well within my rights to gun each of you down where you stand, drinking my wine, eating my canapes-- if I were that kind of man.\" You choke a little on your drink.</p>\n<p>\"But we both know I'm not that kind of man, don't we? I'm a kind, benevolent man. A <em>betting</em> man. We're going to play a little game. Somewhere in this house, there's a duffle bag with two million dollars inside. Two of you lucky sons of bitches get to split the money between you. Unfortunately, the rest of you are going to have to die.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe rules are like this, see: you kids have thirty minutes, that's it. At the end of that time, two of you had better be left standing, and you'd better have found the cash.  If more than two of you are alive, everybody dies. If just one person is alive, that person dies. If two people make it but haven't found the bag, well, they die too. There should be some weapons around the house. Oh, don't try to escape, or you'll die. See you in twenty-nine minutes.\"</p>\n<p>7-page PDF, 8.5\u201d x 11\u201d, perfect for printing.
