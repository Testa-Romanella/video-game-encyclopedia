Just watch out for obstacles and enemies.\r\n\r\nImportant notes\u00a0:\r\n<ul><li>There are times when two platforms might get repositioned on top of each other making it hard to jump up on the other, however, the player has great control for movement in the air so you can jump and then move horizontally to the other platform.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>If you jumped on the left/right side of the platform and you want to jump to the other side but there is another platform right on top of it, in this case, you can\u00a0hold press the space bar so you will jump and the cube will stick to the bottom of the top platform for around 300 milliseconds so you can move horizontally to the other side. Watch the\u00a0following video showing the mechanic.</li></ul>\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe controls:\r\nA/D\u00a0 or\u00a0 Left/Right\u00a0arrows\u00a0for moving horizontally.\r\nSpace bar to jump, hold to jump higher.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T11:20:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/413/4138176b55bff5bc52e007cc34d8ea5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TareqMalkawi"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
