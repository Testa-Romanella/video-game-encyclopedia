Humans have just been created and it is your goal to make sure that they survive. However humans have a tendency to eat a lot and procreate all the time. The result is there are too many humans using up all the food resources in the world. If a village or city don't have enough food the population will decrease and eventually die out. To prevent human extincion you have a few tools in you belt:\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>You can bless the land which will give a boost to food in an area.</li>\n<li>You can create an earthquake that will kill some o the humans and destroy some food.</li>\n<li>Or you can even send the <em>Angel of Death</em> that will kill all humans in an area.</li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tBy perforimg these actions you can keep the humans from overexpanding. However each action has a timeout cost associated with it and you can't use the action again before \r\n\t<em>X</em> amount of time has passed. And the timeout cost rises each time you use perform that action.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAt the end you must realise that humans are fated to die.
