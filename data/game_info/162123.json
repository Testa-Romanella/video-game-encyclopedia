It has 3 levels. First get your score to 5000 by killing enemies, then kill the boss with 300 health. Finally there is a third level with the final boss. He has 5000 health. You start out with 50 health and can pick up bandages to gain more health. You have unlimited ammo. Right-Click and Left-Click are your two weapons you can shoot.\u00a0I hope to make many more. Thanks for playing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a40/a40eadaf982d686607447a13cbf2d9e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pennogilvie"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
