You can fly, and diving onto enemies and obstacles will grant the player additional speed. Difficulty is determined by how quickly players choose to navigate through the levels, and quicker completion results in better rewards.</em></p>\n<p>The game is available on Windows and Mac; please try it out and let me know what you think. It is very short, but I am interested in hearing if the concept has potential, suggestions on improving the gameplay,\u00a0as well as performance on your computer\u00a0(lag, framerate, scaling issues, etc).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T06:24:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdd/bdd33387a803c954b4f4a84516c1f320.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Kyle Schaub"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
