It took us a long period of 3 years to develop the game with small number of developers and lack of resources, finally it comes out, really appreciate that Steam platform makes it so much easier for small teams to publish games. Though Time to Hunt is far from perfect in many aspects compared with Fortnite, PUBG, Naraka: Bladepoint.....we will do our best to make the game more complete and satisfying!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T05:19:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aed/aed022f8d3ea7170ff783a7d238f58a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 427, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wuhan NetCiao Technology Co"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Wuhan NetCiao Technology Co"], "esrb_rating": null}
