When the doors open, he realizes he is not where he should be. An uncanny, strange yet familiar place lies before him.<br/><br/>ABEL is a narrative and contemplative walking simulator, telling the story of Carl, a man overrun by sadness and grief. Explore liminal spaces, manipulate objects and delve into the traumatic events that changed Carl's life forever.<br/><br/>ABEL is a student project, developed by a 5-persons team from CNAM-ENJMIN, in France. This short experience should last around 15 minutes. For an optimal experience, we strongly advise to use headphones and to play in a quiet setting.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-14T04:10:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ab/5ab06d11777baeefeb8cfb78af306c8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CNAM-ENJMIN"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CNAM-ENJMIN"], "esrb_rating": null}
