I am sorry to say that the game is only available on Android devices because google is much more reasonable when it comes to pricing. To all apple users who desperately want to play Ancient Heart I recommend using an emulator even if it doesn't give you the full touch screen experience.</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>1) Coding/Game Development<br/>- TobyDev<br/>2) Art<br/>- rvros (https://rvros.itch.io/)<br/>- Jesse Munguia (https://jesse-m.itch.io/)<br/>- TobyDev<br/>3) Music<br/>- Juhani Junkala (https://opengameart.org/users/subspaceaudio)<br/>4) SFX<br/>- TobyDev</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T16:15:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ee/4ee264e4f7c638d23bcf70531344d4f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TobyDev"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
