You can choose a different hat, targeting and gun for\u00a0each robot, each having their strengths and weaknesses. As time goes on, more and stronger aliens will start showing up.</p>\n<p>This game was made for Jonas Tyroller's WOWIE Game Jam 4.0.</p>\n<p>The Web version is buggy, playing the PC version instead is recommended. Also, in the Web version, there is an unfinished weapon called TNT, it does nothing and we are sorry for leaving it in.</p>\n<p>!WARNING: SMALL BUG: When starting the game for the first time you will he put in the tutorial mode. However for some reason a bug doesn\u2019t allow you to lose in that game mode. So please close and reopen\u00a0the game after learning the basics and click \u201cPLAY\u201d on the menu as the bug isn\u2019t present there.
