(<strong>S</strong> \u2013<em>some</em> <strong>Mor</strong> \u2013 <em>more</em> \u2013 <strong>ish</strong> \u2013 <em>Fish</em>). The whole story of this game is that a fish that was wounded in world war 2 became a mutant cannibal. Now all it can eat is other fish. And also breathe outside water. Don\u2019t ask me how, it\u2019s a game. Just help the fish eat s\u2019more fish.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Game Mechanics &amp; Instructions</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You control the boat and the hook/bait with your mouse. Move your mouse left and right to move the boat, move your mouse up and down to control the hook. Left click to pick up a fish. \r\n  </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>A score rush mechanic has been added to make the game more challenging. What this does is, once you reach a certain point. (For example 5). Your score will start to decrease by 1 point every ~5 seconds. Once your score reaches 0, the game will end. Collect as many fishes as possible and try to avoid the torpedoes. These end the game instantly as soon as your hook touches it. \r\n  </p>\n<p>Press P to Pause the game.\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Music - Joji - Will He (Instrumental)</p>\n<p>Images - PNG.pix, pngpix.com, clipartpng.com, shutterstock</p>\n<p>Banner Art - Priyanka Nath, KIIT.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/551/55184174d34523183d6c4d87e40466cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lucky ( \uff89 \uff9f\uff70\uff9f)\uff89"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
