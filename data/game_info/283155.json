The thrill, the adrenaline, the kick, the elation!<br/><br/>Yeah we don't know anything about that either :(<br/><br/>We are just like most of you, the average Joe punching in hours and getting paid to live by and then some. It is a trailer truck transportation job. You know, the usual stuff where you get to deliver the cars to the dealership. But this particular assignment just got interesting. <br/><br/>So apparently these guys, who own these really fast &amp; expensive sports cars have them parked in multiple places in the city and they want you to transport them using your trailer truck. What? Who does that? Who leaves their ride for someone else to pick up? Well we are as clueless as you. But here's the cherry on top, you get to start them up and take them to the gas station for filling up before you transport them. They don't mind if you take a longer route to get to the filling station if you know what we mean.<br/><br/>Too good to be true? Don't even think. Jump in and blaze away.<br/><br/>Hey, do let us know how the ride was. Have fun :)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T11:17:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7a/a7ae3413250f11e041c0c4e1a0d1c318_2N7QSaS.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["elinx technologies"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": ["elinx technologies"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
