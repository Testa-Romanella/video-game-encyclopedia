If so, then this is the game for you. Hard way to heaven is an old-school platformer game, which will take you a lot of effort to complete.<br/>\r\nThis is why there are only 2 difficulties in the game: hard and impossible. The only exception is the first level which became a lot easier than we anticipated.<br/>\r\nIf by some miracle you finish all the solo levels, 4 extra levels will appear in the menu. They seem quite similar to the other levels, but these were the original ones which were later made easier because of their extreme difficulty. We are eager to see how many of you are able to finish even one of these original levels. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMain features:<br/>\r\n\u2022\toffline, split screen  co-operative<br/>\r\n\u2022\t18 levels (+4, if you prove  to be worthy)<br/>\r\n\u2022\treal challenge", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:54:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c9/7c9b5013040b0e8b110601d7193cb289.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nagy Zolt\u00e1n"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Nagy Zolt\u00e1n"], "esrb_rating": null}
