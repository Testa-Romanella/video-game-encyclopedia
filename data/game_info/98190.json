A year before the events of the game everyone at ARC research and development suddenly went missing, and none of the bodies were ever found. Locals believe that the government had something to do with the cover up. </p>\n<p>Overtime was originally a 48 hour game jam project, but we decided to continue work on it. This is a prototype of our work to this point. Undecided if it'll go anywhere from here.</p>\n<p>We do plan to implement controller support at some point.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Game/ Level Design, Art - Joey Simas</p>\n<p>Programming - Gage Langdon</p>\n<p>Programming - Ivan Soria</p>\n\n<p>Really appreciate any feedback you have!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e41/e41e9b0a9cd06f2927d1eb97387cf900.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joeganaut", "Gage", "omiver"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
