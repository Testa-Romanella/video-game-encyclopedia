The game can also be played on an emulator using the \"A\" and \"D\" keys to move the ball left and right and the space bar to jump.\u00a0Avoid fireballs and bombs while completing 100 missions. Every mission is unique: collecting stars, surviving until time runs out, navigating a maze full of bombs, jumping through hoops while avoiding fireballs and many others. A dynamic weather system will change the time of day and weather throughout gameplay. Watch the sun rise and set and turn to a starry night.\u00a0Collect coins to buy more soundtracks for the game.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Beach Bounce also includes an endless mode with increasing difficulty and bullet hell with tons of fireballs from all directions. Made in Unreal Engine, the game includes emissive materials and 3D graphics.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>The game currently contains 4 worlds with different themes: Beach World, Haunted House, Haunted Beach and Dark World.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Made by a solo dev, this is an ambitious project with 100 levels and more to be added. Some of the missions even include platforming style gameplay where the jumping is disabled and you have to navigate moving platforms.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T02:46:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/393/39337867afb2c3f3070236a5c982a1e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["justaguyproduction"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
