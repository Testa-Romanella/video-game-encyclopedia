It may seem simple at first, but beware, those gems get quicker and quicker the higher your score climbs. <br/><br/>Every point you earn is a gem that you can put towards buying extra lives, so you can pick up where you left off and go for that next high score! <br/><br/>Don't let your friends have a higher score than you, use those extra lives to zip right past them.
