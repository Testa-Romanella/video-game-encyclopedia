Waiting builds accuracy, but firing takes some away. Featuring over twenty unique stages and over a dozen different obstacles and level modifiers, A Quick Death takes a classic video game mechanic and pushes it to its most extreme conclusion. Challenge your friends to seven rounds and fight to the quick death.<br/></p>\n<p>Update: This game is now on Steam Greenlight! We could use your vote!</p>\n<p>==Note: This game is in alpha.
