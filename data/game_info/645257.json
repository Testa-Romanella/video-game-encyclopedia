{"id": 645257, "slug": "old-salt", "name": "Old Salt", "name_original": "Old Salt", "description": "Players begin the game as one of six factions with control of three islands, a fleet of ships and a handful of gold.<br/>A player obtains victory over the other players by controlling 6 islands or being the last ship sailing. There are many routes to that victory but the journey will without a doubt involve sailing your ships, firing cannons, seizing islands, and using faction abilities.<h3>Sail ships</h3>Players can move up to 3 ships on their turn and are able to move a ship up to 3 tiles unless aided by Known Tradewinds<br/>Ships are able to turn in any direction players desire. Think of the movie Pirates of the Caribbean where they dropped anchor and drift a U-turn and outmaneuvered the Black Pearl.<br/><br/><h3>Fire cannons</h3>Step one of firing your epic cannons, count the number of tiles to the target. That is the minimum you need to roll to hit the target.<br/>Step two, pay your crew to load and fire that cannon! 1 coin to fire a single shot. Roll to see if it is successful.<br/>If successful, place a damage token under the target, if unsuccessful, roll better next time.<br/><br/><h3>Seize islands</h3>When seizing an island, a player must first be adjacent to the island they would like to control. Once in position, pay 2 coins for the island along with a mast that belongs to the faction you are wrestling island control from.<br/>Seizing an island that is defended is very costly. For each enemy ship that controls that island within 2 tiles adds 1 coin to the overall cost of seizing the island.<br/><br/><h3>Use faction abilities</h3>When playing with faction abilities, each player selects 1 of the 6 factions to be. Each faction comes with 3 exciting and unique abilities that no one else has access to. These will help players turn the tide of war.<br/>Abilities can cost coins to use or be limited on when you can use them, such as on your turn or when you seize an island.<br/>On the left side of each faction card is an illustration, some adjectives to describe the faction and a quote the faction can be heard saying from time to time.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T04:22:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77e/77e63639877db779873a59b683a79aa9.jpg", "website": "https://kneeshaw.dev/oldsalt", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["aslant", "Kneeshaw Developments", "Never Board Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Kneeshaw Developments"], "esrb_rating": null}
