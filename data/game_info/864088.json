{"id": 864088, "slug": "laernia", "name": "Laernia", "name_original": "Laernia", "description": "<p>Born of chaos, you slither forth into a desolate world. By moving through the landscape you consume what is left, and by digesting it you change yourself.<br/><br/>In Laernia, you move through the world until your Vitriol fills up, and then you can spend resources to choose boons, mutations... curses? Choose wisely, because shedding your old body means having to fight it with your new form. Is there really a life without this chaos?<br/><br/>On the map, move using <strong>WASD</strong>, and view the resources of nearby tiles by pressing <strong>SPACE</strong>. Entering a tile consumes its resources and adds them to yours. Beware, once depleted, that tile will only drain you if you enter it again.</p>\n\n<p>This display shows your resources, which change upon entering a tile. The first three are <strong>MIGHT</strong>, <strong>AGILITY</strong>, and <strong>WILL</strong>. Then comes <strong>DECAY</strong>, <strong>VENOM</strong>, and <strong>EMBER</strong>. Lastly, together at the bottom, are <strong>VITRIOL</strong> and <strong>ANIMA</strong>.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Red, blue, and purple are used to purchase evolutions, and also are where your combat attributes are primarily derived. Teal, green, and orange are what scale the evolutions of their respective trees. Lastly, white represents your health and violet vitriol fills up with most tiles you traverse. When it overflows, the evolution screen appears.<br/><br/>Here you can see your resources to the left and right. Each upgrade costs 9 of the colored orb above it. If an upgrade has a negative corresponding resource (the ones on the right), it may well end up hindering you in the combat to come. That is, as soon as you press Confirm.</p>\n\n<p>Combat is automatic and based on your choices and the attributes that derive from them. If you win, you might find yourself in that new body of yours for a little while, until the chaos consumes you again.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EVOLUTIONS</strong></p>\n<p>~ DECAY</p>\n<p><strong>Nothing to Lose I</strong>: 15% damage reduction</p>\n<p><strong>Choke the Life I</strong>: Attacks deal 5% max life damage</p>\n<p><strong>Memories of Death I</strong>: 20% chance to revive on death (UNTESTED)</p>\n<p><strong>Oblivion I</strong>: Attacks drain resources by 2</p>\n<p><strong>Nothing to Lose II</strong>: 20% damage reduction</p>\n<p><strong>Deep Festering I</strong>: 250% current Decay is added to life</p>\n<p><strong>All Consuming I</strong>: 20% damage taken is dealt to the attacker (NOT IMPLEMENTED)</p>\n<p><strong>Memories of Death II</strong>: 30% chance to revive on death (UNTESTED)</p>\n<p><strong>Choke the Life II</strong>: Attacks deal 10% max life damage</p>\n<p><strong>Oblivion II</strong>: Attacks drain resources by 2</p>\n<p><strong>Deep Festering II</strong>: 250% current Decay is added to life</p>\n<p><strong>All Consuming II</strong>: 20% damage taken is dealt to the attacker (NOT IMPLEMENTED)</p>\n\n<p>~ VENOM<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Envenom I</strong>: Attacks deal 5 unblockable damage</p>\n<p><strong>Formless I</strong>: 10% chance to dodge (NOT IMPLEMENTED)</p>\n<p><strong>Daunting threat I</strong>: Enemy deals 5% less damage</p>\n<p><strong>Envenom II</strong>: Attacks deal 10 unblockable damage</p>\n<p><strong>Galvanic Ire I</strong>: 15% current Venom is added to speed</p>\n<p><strong>Corrosion I</strong>: Enemy takes 10% more damage</p>\n<p><strong>Toxicity I</strong>: 50% current Venom is added to damage</p>\n<p><strong>Formless II</strong>: 10% chance to dodge (NOT IMPLEMENTED)</p>\n<p><strong>Daunting threat II</strong>: Enemy deals 5% less damage</p>\n<p><strong>Envenom III</strong>: Attacks deal 15 unblockable damage</p>\n<p><strong>Galvanic Ire II</strong>: 15% current Venom is added to speed</p>\n<p><strong>Corrosion II</strong>: Enemy takes 15% more damage</p>\n\n<p>~ EMBER<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Incandescence I</strong>: 55% current Ember is added to damage</p>\n<p><strong>Lambent Mantle I</strong>: Enemy takes 12 unblockable damage when striking you</p>\n<p><strong>Rebuke I</strong>: Attacks have a 10% chance to stun (NOT IMPLEMENTED)</p>\n<p><strong>Incandescence II</strong>: 55% current Ember is added to damage</p>\n<p><strong>Ephemeral I</strong>: 10% current Ember is added to speed</p>\n<p><strong>Wrath's Abandon I</strong>: Each attack increases your damage by 5</p>\n<p><strong>Ruination I</strong>: 15% chance to double attack (NOT IMPLEMENTED)</p>\n<p><strong>Lambent Mantle II</strong>: Enemy takes 18 unblockable damage when striking you</p>\n<p><strong>Wrath's Abandon II</strong>: Each attack increases your damage by 5</p>\n<p><strong>Incandescence III</strong>: 55% current Ember is added to damage</p>\n<p><strong>Ruination II</strong>: 10% chance to double attack (NOT IMPLEMENTED)</p>\n<p><strong>Rebuke II</strong>: Attacks have a 10% chance to stun (NOT IMPLEMENTED)</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Game by Eerywax</p>\n<p>MinimalPixel Font by Mounir Tohami: https://mounirtohami.itch.io/minimalpixel-font</p>\n<p>Sounds created with ChipTone by SFBGames: https://sfbgames.itch.io/chiptone</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES<br/></strong></p>\n<p>This\u00a0game\u00a0was\u00a0made\u00a0for\u00a0Roguelike jam 4 (https://itch.io/jam/roguelike-jam-4) but will continue development.<br/></p>\n<p>Plans include:\u00a0</p>\n<p>&gt; Implementing unimplemented mechanics.</p>\n<p>&gt; Unimplemented mechanics include stuns, dodges, reflected damage, egg-laying (on the map), vision scaling.</p>\n<p>&gt; Polish for the game: adding evolution animations, music, more appropriate sounds, an in-game tutorial, and a bit of unintrusive story/lore.</p>\n<p>&gt; Bug fixes: Restarting from the ending screens currently does not reset the map state properly.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Thank you for playing Laernia!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T06:32:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f4/9f44914afde7df519b47298e7a1c273a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eerywax"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
