The game is loosely connected with Imagic's Atlantis, in that the same small spacecraft appears in both games. The objective is to gather specimens from different planets in a spaceship which contains the survivors from the city of Atlantis.</p>\n<p>There are two versions of the cartridge. One allows the player to toggle the starfield display with the Black &amp; White / Color TV switch. In the other the starfield cannot be disabled.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1982-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:26:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eda/edac741dcb6f107d04940f5813e84b66.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Atari 2600"], "developers": ["Imagic"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Imagic"], "esrb_rating": null}
