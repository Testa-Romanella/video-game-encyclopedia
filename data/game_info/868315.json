One of its most popular attractions at said festival is its \u2018haunted\u2019 corn maze: a spooky location full of both free candy and \u2018zombies\u2019 alike! The \u2018zombies\u2019 in this case are merely farmhands in green face paint, but you get the idea. Every year, people of all shapes and sizes challenge the maze to see if they can escape unharmed with the bounty of free sweets that reside within. Now, if you so choose, it\u2019s your turn to take that challenge! Will you be able to survive the onslaught of farmers dressed in silly costumes? Will you acquire an array of cavities from all the candy you can eat? Only one way to find out!\r\n</p>\n<p>In much the same vein as the last project I worked on, Maize is quite obviously a rip off of a well-known, arcade-y title; in this case, it is Pac-Man. Hopefully, even with that knowledge, you will still find this game to be fun and interesting in its own right! Particularly, I would be curious to know how the different characters affect different people\u2019s play experiences. Either way, thank you as always for playing!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T07:26:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e49/e49d1967b7466d5f98a2f92b0793fa59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Phil Johnson"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
