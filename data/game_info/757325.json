This planet has no natural gravity; instead, its gravity is artificially produced by a satellite. The satellite is monitored from a station on space. Bzpkszp works in that station along with three other crewmates: Eureka, Broco and Zaru.\u00a0Bzpkszp's work is simple: watch some monitors and make sure the satellite is working all right. Sounds easy, right? Nothing could go wrong...right?<br/></p>\n\n<p>Created with Rpg Maker MV<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T09:06:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e9/6e989a34cad8d2ddbb413dec00e1303e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Axel Vejar Dossow"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
