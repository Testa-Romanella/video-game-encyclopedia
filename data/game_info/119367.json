But in spite of this immmense honor, he was broken-hearted. Indeed, the woman that he loved died and he can never join her. Hercule is thus condemned to live eternally by contemplating a celestial body which reminds him ceaselessly his absence. Jealous person, he can't stand seeing the happiness of Beaver and Pollux gathered in the constellation of the Gemini, and is going to break thus indefatigably the alignment of their stars. Blinded by the greed, he doesn't realize consequences of his acts. The Star so removed from its constellation sees its life expectancy strongly decreased as long as it will not have found its initial place. It thus has to go as quickly as possible avoiding space traps.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c8/9c8c86a618e4629718a42097ca35ef05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["TripleA"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
