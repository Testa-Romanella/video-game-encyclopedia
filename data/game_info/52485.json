{"id": 52485, "slug": "ghost-manor", "name": "Ghost Manor", "name_original": "Ghost Manor", "description": "<p>Ghost Manor is a horror video game that was released by Xonox in 1983 for the Atari 2600 and VIC-20. It was generally packaged in a double ended cartridge and a cassette tape along with one of three other games in an effort to appeal to budget conscious buyers who would purchase two games for the price of one cartridge and one cassette tape. There was also a more limited release of single ended cartridges and cassette tapes containing Ghost Manor by itself. The double ended cartridges and cassette tapes paired Ghost Manor with the platform game Spike's Peak, the fighting game Chuck Norris Superkicks, and a strategy game called Artillery Duel.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1983-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d9/9d9f4173504a023c62cf138fbd90aeec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Atari 2600", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Xonox"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Xonox"], "esrb_rating": null}
