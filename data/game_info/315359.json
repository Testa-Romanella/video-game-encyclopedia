Not you specifically though! You're part of an army. You're just cannon fodder, as you only have 1 live left. You need to rank up and collect some lives from humans. There's a friendly hell shopkeeper which will give you stuff, in exchange for some of those lives.</p>\n<p><strong>Ludum Dare</strong><br/><strong>JPiolho</strong>: Sadly I barely had time to work on this game so it's very unfinished but I did my best to leave it in a playable stage to resemble a game. I want to continue working on this game for some time though. <em>There is no sound in the game.</em></p>\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong><br/>- Arrow keys to move<br/>- Ctrl / Mouse 1 to attack<br/>- Kill humans to earn lives<br/>- Cops will shoot at you<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong><br/>There is no exit button.
