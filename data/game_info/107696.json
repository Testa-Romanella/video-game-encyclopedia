{"id": 107696, "slug": "burnout-2", "name": "burnout.", "name_original": "burnout.", "description": "<p>burnout. is a game about burnout, depression, and the others. When you\u2019re depressed, there are things people say that hurt more than they help, no matter the intention.</p>\n<p>In this game, you\u2019re running through every day hoping to get to the end of it. But your fatigue is limited, and each day it will get worse. If your fatigue reaches 3h, it\u2019s game over. If you make it through 30 days, it\u2019s a less bitter game over.</p>\n<p>To jump from platform to platform, just press the space bar. Warning : the jump is \u201cstatic\u201d, as in it will always be the same. Because when you\u2019re depressed, things seem to be the same over and over again. So plan your jumps ahead.</p>\n<p>Platforms are text messages you receive during the day. They might be completely neutral (you don\u2019t care), good for you (your fatigue doesn\u2019t lower), or bad (your fatigue goes down faster).</p>\n<p>Once your fatigue runs out, it\u2019s the end of the day, and the next one starts. Until you either run out of power or patience.</p>\n<p>There is no way to quit a running game until you either lose or lose a little more. Depression doesn\u2019t stop like that, what were you thinking?</p>\n<p>Made with Unity3D in a very ugly fashion.
