{"id": 905751, "slug": "industrialists-dilemma", "name": "Industrialist's Dilemma", "name_original": "Industrialist's Dilemma", "description": "<p><strong>Industrialists Dilemma </strong>focuses on the industrial revolution in the context of the fabrication process in three industry sectors. These sectors had the greatest influence in the early revolution and therefore were chosen to represent the industry sector in the game. The resources were chosen according to the industries and the scientific updates match the ongoing revolution of the factory processes. The urban tiles in the game reflect the changing urbanization in cities and the changing standard of living and the working and housing conditions of the factory workers. The player is an aspiring Industrialist trying to maximize his profit by getting access to resources but also making sure that the working conditions and the pollution in his factories are kept in check.</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p><strong>Goal: </strong>You are an aspiring industrialist and want to create the perfect urban factory city with maximum production, the best working conditions and minimum pollution Fill the bars at the top to win the game! <br/></p><p><strong>Gameplay:</strong> You start with a humble wool factory and a corresponding wool farm tile and open booster packs to build your city. You can only buy each booster once per turn. During the night a random tile will spawn making your life harder or giving you an advantage for the next day. Keep your money in check! Once your money goes below zero you lose the game. But keep in mind, that if your working condition or pollution bar goes to zero, you lose aswell. <br/></p><p><strong>Mechanics:</strong> Factories will only work if they have at least one corresponding resource on an adjacent tile. Keep your resources steady with urban boosters. Use science boosters to make use of recent inventions to heavily boost either your productivity, working conditions or pollution. But keep in mind every invention or new factory comes at a price!<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Sophia - Art and sound design\r\n    </p>\n<p>Fabian - Lead software engineer\r\n    <br/></p>\n<p>Isabelle - Game design and project management</p>\n<p>Dominic - Director</p><p>Font used: Buttershine Serif by letterflow.std@gmail.com<br/></p>\n<p>-&gt; Everything else is made by us, spaghetti code included :-)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T05:20:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ee/2ee8a18f6375a56a0a4b89a2ffe13064.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["StudioZyyt"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
