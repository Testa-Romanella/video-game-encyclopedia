Thats it.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>There is a ball, and there are things that want to hit the ball.\u00a0Your job is to stop that from happening.<br/><br/>The only way you can do so is by spinning a giant dice to both control the ball and block the things from hitting the ball. Every ten seconds, the face of the dice changes, meaning that you may have more or less chances of blocking the things.</p>\n\n<p>CREDITS:<br/></p>\n<p>Programming: The4thAD (Me)</p>\n<p>Art: Me</p>\n<p>UI:\u00a0Me</p>\n<p>Level Design: Me</p>\n<p>Sound Design:\u00a0Me</p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T07:02:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/253/25344f5a327bf113f3f5cd3e50008e4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["The4thAD"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
