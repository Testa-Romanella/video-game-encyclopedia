It's easier that way, especially since  tensions between humans and supernaturals are higher than they have ever  been.\r\n    </p>\n<p>Things take a turn for the worse when you find yourself saddled with a  human girl. But it shouldn't be too hard to find the nearest human  settlement and leave her there, right?\r\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Content Warnings: </strong>body horror, gore, violence, death, drug &amp; alcohol use, strong language\r\n    </p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Discover what has become of the world in the wake of the zombie apocalypse, and do your best to try and survive it.\r\n</li><li>Try to get through full moon after full moon without losing yourself.\r\n</li><li>Bond with the kid you've found yourself stuck with; be a parent, an older sibling, or a mentor.\r\n</li><li>Pick up even more survivors and form your own strange kind of family in what remains.\r\n</li><li>Romance 1 of 3 possible options.\r\n</li></ul>\r\nThe\u00a0Kid\r\n<p><strong>Ruby (f)</strong> - your new ward.\r\n    </p>\r\nShe's a troublemaker, but she's also just a scared kid (no  matter how much she would hate to admit it). Like it or not, you're all  she has right now.\r\nRomance Options\r\n<p><strong>Jamie (m/f/nb)</strong> - a childhood friend that you never thought you'd see again.\r\n    </p>\r\nIt's strange to see them again after all these years,  stranger still to see how much they've changed. Their mother was a witch  and, though their talents lie more with technology, that knowledge is  still very valuable.\r\n<p><strong>Lucy (f)</strong> - a friend of a friend, and maybe even potentially just a friend.\r\n    </p>\r\nShe seems to be taking everything in stride. She's a  survivor through and through, always looking for a way to make the most  of the situation. You don't know how much you can trust her, but it's  clear that Jamie does.\r\n<p><strong>Ren (m/f) </strong>-\u00a0a\u00a0stranger\u00a0that\u00a0you\u00a0aren't\u00a0sure\u00a0what\u00a0to\u00a0make of.\r\n    </p>\r\nThey are a bit of a mystery. You can't quite figure out what  their goal is or why they are so willing to travel with you, but  regardless you can't pass up a doctor in these trying times. Even if  they do have an unusual diet.\r\n<p>----------</p>\n<p>You can find me on tumblr.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-05T02:18:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e7/1e779bdcaba2b9d6c19d6e1b3539f475.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Whisper Game"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
