Shoot with space.\r\n</p>\n<p>Hit bricks and collect powerups.\r\n</p>\n<p>To disable the music press M and to disable audio press N (but sounds already playing will still be played until they end)\r\n</p>\n<p>Powerups are randomly generated for each play.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you have the Catch-powerup you can move in the direction and shoot to give the ball an angle. Also moving while hitting the ball will cause the angle to change in the direction you moved.\r\n</p>\r\nTools used:\r\n<ul><li>Unity 2021.1\r\n</li><li>Aseprite\r\n</li><li>Ableton Live with Sylenth1 and VSTSID\r\n</li><li>Gimp\r\n</li><li>Audacity\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>All graphic, music, audio and code was created during the Jam.
