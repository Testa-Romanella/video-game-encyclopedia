What will we think of next? Nothing but you and the calming iterations of putting seeds into the ground and taking them back out after they've gotten larger and more vegetable-y. Maybe you'll even discover some new recipes to put them in! No need worrying about how your actions affect anything happening at night, because probably everyone is asleep and everything is fine. No reason anything that happens at night could affect anything happening on your farm because, as I believe I've said, everyone is sleeping at night.<br/></p>\n<p>A Wholesome Game About Farming takes roughly 2 hours to complete, and features classic farming mechanics like:</p>\n<ul><li>Purchasing and planting seeds<br/>\n</li><li>Harvesting and selling crops<br/>\n</li><li>A simple crafting system where you can discover new recipes<br/>\n</li><li>Spying on people<br/>\n</li><li>Sneaking up on your victims<br/>\n</li><li>Placing obstacles for your victims<br/>\n</li><li>Hiding the evidence\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>You'll play as a struggling yet resilient and kind-hearted old farmer named Jep, and if there's any such thing as a \"vampire\" named \"Raluca\" who you \"play as\" at \"night\" I've certainly never heard of her and have no idea what you're talking about.<br/><br/>Happy Farming!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T10:41:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/886/8866e8517b581ded647497de5e33e6cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["s3rp"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
