You see, I've wanted to make video games ever since I played my first game on the\u00a0Nintendo Entertainment System, back in the 80's. I've always had a love for technology, but fell in the trap of working in IT support, management, etc. Wrong place to flex programming muscles.</p>\n<p>A few years back, I switched gears and took a job as a database developer. A few unexpected web projects and automations later, and my programming chops are finally to a point where I thought I'd give making my own game\u00a0a try. A simple platformer!</p>\n\n<p>I'm sure there are bugs, but\u00a0I'm honestly super proud of my work here, and stood on the shoulder of so many giants, offering wonderful tutorials on YouTube. Most of the\u00a0assets I used were also\u00a0found right here, on itch.io!</p>\n<p>If you choose to, thanks so much for playing! Definitely let me know your experience. I'm here to learn and grow. \ud83e\udde1</p>\n\n<p>###<br/>I definitely recommend a gamepad, although a keyboard works!<br/>To quit, just press Esc on the keyboard.\u00a0<br/>To go full screen, press Alt+Enter, or the select button on your gamepad.</p>\n<p>###<br/>If you're curious about the assets I used for this game, here is full list:</p>\n<p>\ud83c\udfa8 Player and Slime art is from: HERE<br/>\ud83c\udfa8 Dungeon Art is from: HERE<br/>\ud83c\udfa8 Icons are from: HERE<br/>\ud83d\udd09 Music is from: HERE<br/>\ud83d\udd09 Sound FX are from: HERE</p>\n<p>###<br/>Made with Godot!<br/><br/>https://godotengine.org/<br/></p><p>###<br/>Spoilers!
