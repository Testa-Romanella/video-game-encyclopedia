Tell it stories and keep the baby calm, if it makes a deep growling noise, don't be scared, just rock its crib. \"The Spider's Dream\" is a great story, but full of lies, change it to fit your truth, or let the story be, like your baby likes it.</p>\n<p>If you wake up the baby three times, you lose the game. There's no end.</p>\n<p>Music by Prod Jay; Lullaby by Kevin MacLeod</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T07:08:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a19/a19baec08133fe20cbb705031c8e6a91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AM (onion)"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
