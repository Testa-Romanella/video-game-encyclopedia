Populate by strange beings called \"Entity\" and robots, it's up to you to explore their kingdom in its monochromatic decors. You will surely meet strange people there, sometimes friendly, sometimes hostile and sometimes...we don't really know.<h3>Game play</h3>Solve puzzles, find your way, and advance to the Core of their world. But sometimes the world itself doesn't want us to move on so... Glitches might help you. These strange objects that you will find during your adventure, will give you abilities that will help you overcome obstacles that might seem insurmountable.<h3>Original resources</h3>The game's graphics and music are completely original. A monochromatic and cute graphic touch combined with an electro, 8bit and lo-fi mix soundtrack for a slightly dreamlike atmosphere.<br/><br/><br/>Your influence on this world depends entirely on the Entity you embody. If she dies, the game will close and you will have to resume from the last save.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-22T07:58:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8cd/8cdff06adeaa88ef0c3c8dc0c74191b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ecko Ongaku"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ecko Ongaku"], "esrb_rating": null}
