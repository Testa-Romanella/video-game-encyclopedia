It's still in the early stages of development, and I plan to add more to it in the near future. As of now, there are 18 levels in the game.\r\n</p>\n<p>This is just a little something that I put together for fun. For now, it's just a demo which is still in development that I will continue to work on. Not long ago, I created another game similar to this one called YulePlat. It's nothing fancy, just a little something that I put together for fun and for others to enjoy. Like YulePlat, this game will eventually have gameplay options as well as added minigames. It's a platformer game that starts off easy and becomes more difficult with each level. I hope you have as much fun playing it as I did creating it. Please, enjoy!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T06:36:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e1/1e152c06dbc0e2ec5c814b57f200aafa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["M.Y.
