{"id": 325028, "slug": "zone-10", "name": "Zone 10", "name_original": "Zone 10", "description": "Zone 10 is an original take on the tower defense genre. In the game, you can mine asteroids to gain money and spend it on building and defending your own custom maze. We have designed specialty maze blocks that when placed next to each other form pathways, obstructions, and different colored platforms. The various colored platforms allow you to place corresponding turrets or landing pads that allow you to fight off incoming enemies. The game takes place in deep-space where you command a spaceship that is in charge of defending a space station from attack. The game is divided up into two phases separated by a timer. The first being, \"Explore\", where you use your spaceship to mine asteroids that are defended by marauding pirates and then use the proceeds to purchase maze blocks, upgrades, and defensive equipment such as turrets and ships.  \"Phase two\" follows \"Phase one\" once the timer reaches zero and during which the enemy will attack your starbase. The two types of enemies are separated into space ships and assault troops. Assault troops are dropped onto your space-station by transport ships and will follow your maze to the command center and kill your officers within your starbase unless killed themselves. Spaceships will harass and blow up your turrets and/or your spaceships.
