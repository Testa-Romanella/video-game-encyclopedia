Created by Simon Mesnard (ASA, Catyph, Myha...) and magnified by an oriental-sounding music composed by Yazorius, Bo\u00efnihi has a gameplay never before seen in the series, halfway between Myst-like and traditional adventure games.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Story</strong><br/> <br/>\"An astronaut has been wandering through space for 4 years, and finally landed on an uncharted moon, where a mysterious hermit used to live alone. Bo\u00efnihi was his name, and he was one of the rare survivors of a terrible event known as \"Day Zero\", which happened long, long ago...\" <br/><br/>Bo\u00efnihi is an independent and self-funded game, mainly created by one person. It has been envisaged as a 1st person adventure with a hybrid gameplay (3rd person camera). You will go through an exotic story based on the exploration of a faraway moon and the solving of didactic logical puzzles. This game is reminiscent of the Myst series but also point and click games like Syberia, The Longest Journey...<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Gameplay</strong><br/><br/>Hybrid gameplay, between 1st person adventure (Myst, Rhem...) and 3rd person (Syberia, etc.)<br/>Please note that a large part of Bo\u00efnihi is played with mouse, however moving the character is closer to what you could see in Grim Fandango and so playing with keyboard is mandatory (arrows or WASD). <br/>Visit the regions of the moon of the hermit, take notes on a piece of paper, and solve the puzzles!<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/> <br/><ul><li>A new episode in the The Black Cube sci-fi series (ASA, Catyph, Myha...), which can be played separately<br/></li><li>Visit the moon of Bo\u00efnihi (4 regions: Peibin Lake, Library Island, Ailhon Woods and Hydra Crest)<br/></li><li>Play as a Terran astronaut.
