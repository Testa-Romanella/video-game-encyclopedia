In an effort to help the fish, you clear the lake so their home can thrive once more!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Use the <strong>WASD</strong> keys to move your character around and adjust the camera with your mouse. Once you're in a good fishing spot, hold <strong>F</strong> to cast your fishing rod! Then wait until something bites...and when it does, quickly hold <strong>R</strong> to reel it in! Hit <strong>C</strong> to cancel!</p>\n<p><strong>Tip</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You don't have to fish on the pier.</p>\n<p>Watch out for when the line turns red!
