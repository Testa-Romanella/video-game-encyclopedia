Long time no see...\r\nThis might be the first game jam game under a new company in a year. Hopefully I have been forgiven for my past mistakes...\u00a0\r\nThe internet has been going around with rage games like Getting Over It, Stick with It and a game called Cursor Chaos. So I thought and do my part and give a rage game too, just that you guys can go crazy with it.....\r\nThis\u00a0version of the cursor dodge is more\u00a0\u00a0juicier with art from best of both worlds- Pixel and Vector....\r\nThe rules are very simple-\r\n1. Protect your cursor from 15 levels of increasing difficulty ranging from a few\u00a0 \u00a0enemies to complete bullet hell.\u00a0\r\n2. You have 1 life. When you die, the whole game restarts.\u00a0\r\nThe web build is available to play, but just for fun, I have ported it to Windows, Mac and Linux with Android Build coming soon after the jam...\r\nThe install is as follows-\r\nInstall instructions\r\n<ul><li>Download .zip file\r\n</li><li>Place in a folder on you desktop\r\n</li><li>Right click &gt; Extract Here\r\n</li><li>Click on the application-Chaotic Cursor Crisis\r\n</li><li>\u00a0Sit back\u00a0&amp; get crazy\r\n</li></ul>\r\nIf you have problems, or you're on MAC / LINUX / VIRUS WARNING, comment in the jam comments or on this game main page\r\n<p>\n</p>\n\r\nNote-(THIS ISN'T A GODDAMN SEQUEL TO LOGIC GATEKEEPER!!!!!)\r\nCredits\r\nMusic-\r\nMain Title music is \"Inceptive-Action\", from a Newgrounds user.
