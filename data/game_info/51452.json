Although this world can be lonely, she is kept company by her friend BOT. It advises her and encourages her to do the tasks she is assigned, although it knows much more than it lets on. In order to survive in this passive yet hostile environment, BOT will give Vesta a real helper \u2013 DROID. He may be a bit rough around the edges, but he'll handle physical tasks that would be impossible for a fully grown adult, let alone a little girl. Besides, he is the perfect weapon to defend against the dangers lurking in the remains of this abandoned complex. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nJoin Vesta as she explores various environments over 36 levels full of obstacles and enemy robots. She'll need her brains and DROID's power to traverse this varied landscape, properly manage the little energy left in the complex, solve the numerous puzzles she finds in her path, and even fight to survive. But most of all she will need to discover the truth of this story.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3bb/3bb619f34198a02a07e77590325c987a.jpg", "website": "http://finalboss-games.com/vesta/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"owned": 37, "beaten": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 85, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 538, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["FinalBoss Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["FinalBoss Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
