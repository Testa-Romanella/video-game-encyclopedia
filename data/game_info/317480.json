Keep hitting the right notes to not fall into darkness.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Use D, F, space bar, J, and K for the corresponding keys.</p>\n\n<p>This was our project for our subject in Computer Science. The idea behind this is that the protagonist is very sad and music makes her feel less sad. Missing the right notes fades the background signifying her giving up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is an unfinished game so expect it to be buggy and should be played on window mode.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T06:06:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63c/63cb46f847a7a9d737fe9a94df06b2f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CPOrt"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
