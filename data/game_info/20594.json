Your rescuer is an old man from a local village who slowly nurses you back to health, and to repay his efforts you start to carry out small tasks for him. There is one task in particular however, that rekindles your adventurer's spirit... and so begins the Journey of the King.<br/><br/>During your journey you will gain companions and fight alongside them against old and new enemies alike.
