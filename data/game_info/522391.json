It's 8 pages with some layout and colour background, keeping with the Aether design theme. It gives you all the information you need to port a character over quickly when paired with the Aether core rules.\u00a0<br/><br/>Note that the Aether Core Rules now cost $35 instead of their original 30, because they now come with this pack as part of their bundle. If you already own the game you got this package for free, so go redownload the files.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T05:12:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d20/d20191258571cec7f16fa1ab9312220c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EldritchCrow"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
