I was using it as a learning opportunity beyond my first game, Asteroidsds. It was started in less than a month after that project, though honestly the work done here probably would add up to under three months. That being said, I enjoyed some of the characters that I made, and am very interested in expanding on the idea in the future; perhaps towards something more action based.</p>\n<p>P.S. This is my first foray into audio besides a drum beat for a game jam entry I made, and I'm still unsure if it's any good. My highest hope is that you don't end up having to mute the game lmao (but tell me if you did, I'll work on that)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T05:12:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/708/708bf70a5e874b4825242a0eac6fa9db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Shoelariat"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
