(I was supposed to just make a text adventure in Java that utilized class oriented programming and 2D arrays, and I ended up with this.) It ended up surprisingly fun and fleshed out so I uploaded it. It has up to four party members and an ATB style combat system.\u00a0It also happens to be one of the few games of mine that actually has an ending. That being said, enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-23T03:18:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c2/5c219884455e40338d67626f71d9c481.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["S34_M0NST3R"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
