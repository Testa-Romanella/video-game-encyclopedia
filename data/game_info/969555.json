You play as a character inside a crashed server trying to remove the viruses that crashed the server. Get from level to level by using the gate which will be broken until you have the wires to fix it and all the viruses on the level are gone. Get a feel for the mechanics, time your second jump, and avoid panic and you'll do just fine.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T12:54:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd5/cd5e6a9b54f8a998389795eb9888f65e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Antion Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Antion Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
