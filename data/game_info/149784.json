GUNS.\r\n<br/>GUNS.\u00a0SPORTS.<br/></p>\n<p>In the future, sports wont be played by elite athletes. Instead, we'll watch grotesque mutants vs. dangerous heavy machinery.<br/></p>\n<p>It's a tower defense game so play accordingly:<br/>- Just like current day football, you must stop the rival team from getting to the touchdown line.<br/>- You have 4 different turrets available to you: Shotgun, Goop, Flame &amp; Punt.<br/>- You can upgrade or sell turrets. Upgrading costs the amount of the tower\u00a0and doubles it's power. Selling only returns x0.8 of the cost.\u00a0<br/>- Just like in current day football, there are 12 quarters to a game, and 12 downs per quarter.<br/>- Just like current day football, you have to survive as long as you can.</p>\n<p>The American Dream\u2122 realized.<br/></p>\n<p>Created expressly for #LOWREZJAM 2017.<br/></p>\n<p>Quick developer notes:<br/>- Unfortunately I came in really late to the #LOWREZJAM and I have big dreams.<br/>- Pathing is a mess and can be pretty unrpredictable at times. I would've liked to write my own solution but no time.\u00a0<br/>- \u00a0I had to make a hard choice on the last night between extra towers and graphical polish, or sound effects and music. I chose towers and eyes. Would like to go back and add sounds if allowed.<br/>-\u00a0Also, haven't really had a chance to test at higher levels so hopefully nothings breaks!</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4eb/4ebe9c9762abbd885c4dfbcc233fb48d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BigStompyRobots"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
