You're playing as a car driving along a road. Your goal is to avoid the other cars slower than yours. \u00a0You'll get bonus points\u00a0if you avoid them in rhythm, when the opposite cars start coming to you. How much points will you get?</p>\n<p>Controls: Arrows to move, Spacebar to start the game</p>\n<p><strong>Known issues:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>The car flow may not exactly follow the music rhythm. It will be fixed in an update after several tests.</li><li>At some point, the car may stop rolling for unknown reasons.
