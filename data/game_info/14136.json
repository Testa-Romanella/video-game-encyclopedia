Blitzkrieg is the latest development in WWII real-time strategy gaming combining flexibility, historic accuracy and endless playability into one of the most challenging and enjoyable games yet!Blitzkrieg's unique and completely flexible campaign structure puts you in control of deciding how your forces will fare in each of the major engagements that comprise three central Campaigns. Hardcore vets have the option of engaging the enemy immediately in a desperate struggle for battlefield dominance, or more cautious players can choose from pre-defined or unlimited randomly generated side missions as they gain experience, promotions and weapons upgrades as well as wear down the enemy before the central conflict.Historical accuracy is pushed to the edge as each unit is endowed with the actual capabilities and characteristics that existed at the time. Details such as the thickness of a tank's armor down to the range of infantry rifles add a level of previously unprecedented realism. Each campaign has been meticulously researched to provide an accurate depiction of the battles that took place, while still maintaining the flexibility (and fun!) necessary to let you play the way you want.Two robust editors are Blitzkrieg's keys to unlocking endless game play possibilities. The Mission Editor allows you to generate and add your own missions, chapters and campaigns according to the options you want most, from level of difficulty to type of action. The Resource Editor gives you total license to redesign the game, add or modify units, characteristics, colors, textures, sounds and more - unlimited freedom to play the game on your terms.Key Features<ul><li>\tFlexible campaign structure that frees you from standard difficulty and level settings<br/></li><li>\tHistorically accurate campaigns where you lead the Allies, Germans or Soviets through actual WWII battles in real time<br/></li><li>\tMission and Resource editors let you create new campaigns, chapters and missions as well as completely modify the game environment and units<br/></li><li>\tRealistically rendered 3D terrain including over 350 various buildings and objects<br/></li><li>\tCommand over 200 types of military vehicles and equipment and more than 40 different infantry units that interact naturally, based on their actual physical properties and characteristics.<br/></li><li>\tBuild bridges, dig trenches and pits, lay mines, resupply and repair units and call in air support when needed<br/></li><li>\tBattles feature different seasons, climate zones, and weather conditions that affect game play</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2005-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-08T19:12:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/711/7119853fce71c435ad96898f2698dc0f.jpg", "website": "http://ru.nival.com/games/history/blitzkrieg", "rating": 4.03, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 18, "owned": 395, "beaten": 12, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 16}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 35, "suggestions_count": 558, "game_series_count": 14, "reviews_count": 35, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nival Interactive"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Nival", "Nival Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
