The government cannot do anything with widespread crime, so it simply ignores that. Four street fighters from a gypsy community unwillingly become the test subjects for a new drug called Necro. After escaping from the laboratory, the main character returns back to their community only to find it in ruins and the whole population becoming drug addicts. The protagonist becomes eager to get revenge on those, who did that. Further into the game, the main character starts taking Necro themselves, which causes horrible hallucinations.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Mother Russia Bleeds is a beat &#39;em up game which is largely inspired by titles such as Streets of Rage and Double Dragon.</p>\n<p>The players advance through a level, that is divided into multiple sections. In progress further, the players have to kill every enemy they encounter in a section. At the end of each level, a boss fight is held.</p>\n<p>Apart from hand-to-hand combat, the players can use the world&#39;s items, such as pipes, knives, bottles, and pistols. One of the defining features of the game is the health regeneration system, as the players can pump Necro out of their enemies corpses and eject them to themselves. A choice is given - regenerate health or become a berserk that has much more strength and speed.</p>\n<p>The game can either be completed solo or in a four-player co-op.</p>", "metacritic": 70, "released": "2016-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T01:30:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/450/450ccffea136d06ef8d18802d583f8e5.jpg", "website": "http://motherrussiableeds.com/", "rating": 3.59, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 90, "owned": 1236, "beaten": 142, "toplay": 38, "dropped": 74, "playing": 11}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 135, "ratings_count": 231, "suggestions_count": 562, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 233, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Devolver Digital", "Le Cartel Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Fighting", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Devolver Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
