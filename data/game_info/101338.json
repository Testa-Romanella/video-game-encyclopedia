Press any button to start the game once it's loaded...\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis game was made for TOJam10, and was designed to be played with the \r\n\tNovint Falcon, a force feedback controller. We have since updated the game to be more stable and to support mouse &amp; keyboard/Xbox 360 controllers, so as to expand beyond the few people who still have one of these devices. To play the version that works without a Falcon, download \"Tomb of Taak in Taman_NoFalcon.exe\".</p><p>If you are one of the few people who has a working Falcon, download the \"Tomb of Taak in Taman_Falcon.exe\" file and you should be able to experience the game properly. Otherwise, we recommend using a controller so there's at least some haptic feedback, but mouse and keyboard will work if no controller is plugged in.<br/></p><p>For those not in the know, TOJam10 is a game jam hosted annually in Toronto, Ontario. Over 400 game developers get together and try to make games in 3 crazy days. Other TOJam10 games can be found here.</p>ControlsFalcon<p>\r\n\tW,A,S,D to move, Falcon input moves your hand, the middle button (the one with the Novint logo) interacts with the environment.\r\n</p>Controller<p>\r\n\tLeft stick to move, right stick to move your hand.
