It's not about speed, excitement, competition, or optimisation. It's about the feeling of being alone in nature, focusing on the motions, and trying to keep a good speed without getting tired. The goal is to maximize your \"bliss score\" in every trip.</p>\n<p>You can play with the keyboard or with a controller that has shoulder buttons (like the typical PlayStation or Xbox controller). If you have a controller connected, the tutorial will show how to play with a controller. Otherwise, it will default to keyboard instructions.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T08:44:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9bc/9bc07767aa7df22ce1d0e24e8ac961f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Hardcore Narrativist"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
