Made with python+pygame.</p>\n<p>Notable features:</p>\n<ul><li>Dynamic building damage and recursive floor collapses. Damage and collapses can even happen on floors you currently aren't on!<br/>\n</li><li>Entities on all floors step and perform regardless of whether or not you are on that floor.</li><li>Actionable entities are similar to player. NPC firefighters can use some of the same skills as you.<br/>\n</li><li>Mostly all sprites are uniquely made by Finch. The rest are from oryx design labs\u00a0https://www.oryxdesignlab.com/</li><li>Particle effects for fire and dust.</li><li>Final grade based on an assortment of scoring criteria.</li><li>Unique UI features showing relative damage of all floors as well as mini-maps of the floors above and below you. Watch out for those collapsing ceiling tiles!</li></ul>\n<p>Berlin Interpretation checklist:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Random environment generation</strong>: Floors and entity placement are randomly placed. Albeit poorly.</li><li><strong>Permadeath:</strong> You only get one shot.</li><li><strong>Turn-based</strong>: Game actions are turn-based. Effects are real-time.</li><li><strong>Grid-based:</strong> Entities confined to bounds of floor grid.</li><li><strong>Non-modal</strong>: Partial. Game includes menus. Other than that the game is in one state.</li><li><strong>Complexity</strong>: Lots of complexity in dynamic building damage and floor collapses.</li><li><strong>Resource management</strong>: Need to manage hp and skill cooldowns.</li><li><strong>Hack'n'slash</strong><strong>:</strong> Requirement not met</li><li><strong>Exploration and Discovery:</strong> Must explore multiple floors to find the civilians to rescue.</li><li><strong>Single player character</strong>: Requirement met.</li><li><strong>Monsters are similar to players:</strong>\u00a0Partial. All actionable entities are based off of the same parent class. There are a few custom methods of derived classes\u00a0not worked into base classes. However, for the\u00a0<em>most</em><em> part</em> the requirement is fulfilled. For example, all unit entities share similar behaviour and methods. A few hacky attributes were stuck on specific entity types\u00a0at the end for the sake of speed of devlelopment.<br/>\n</li><li>\n<strong>Tactical challenge</strong>: Hopefully the case with more balance tweaking.</li><li><strong>ASCII display</strong>: Requirement not met</li><li><strong>Dungeons:</strong> Randomly generated floors.</li><li><strong>Numbers:</strong> Requirment not met. Most numbers are hidden from the player</li></ul>\n<p>This game utilises my existing WIP engine called RLEngine.
