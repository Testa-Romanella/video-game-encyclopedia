In addition, I added a lot more functionality to the game itself, including more areas to explore, lighting that reacts to player movement, and a moodier feeling through the lighting. The animations I have included are: An animation for The Bench to begin spasming on the basement level, an animation for Flickering Lights as you descend\u00a0beneath the House, and fully animated and functioning Birds using Dinopunch's Living Birds pack. In addition, I\u00a0animated a sliding door on the basement level. Besides this, I also included a dynamic particle system to simulate fireflies buzzing in the night, and also have pivotal moments where player action can light up a room or summon these fireflies to them through triggers.</p>\n<p>Packages I added to this build:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Trees, Mushrooms, and Bush assets courtesy of JustCreate's Low-Poly Simple Nature Pack.</p>\n<p>Rock assets courtesy of Broken\u00a0Vector's Low\u00a0Poly Rock Pack.</p>\n<p>A Swing asset, courtesy of NEKCOM Entertainment's Swing pack.</p>\n<p>A multitude of ground and wall textures, courtesy of A Dog's Life Software's Outdoor Ground Textures and 18 High Resolution Wall Textures packs.</p>\n<p>Bird Assets and Animations courtesy of Dinopunch's Living Birds pack.</p>\n<p>A stunning wooden floor ready-made material courtesy of Casual2D's Wooden Floor Materials.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T10:05:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d4/9d49a72bd774f8dfb3c2d20c0b2f1212.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ben Reyes"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
