The interactive experience\u00a0\"Monkey Fight\"\u00a0beams you into the brains of these remarkable war machines, allowing you to control their movements and witness the terrific gladiatorial conflict firsthand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You will have a choice between four unique weapons, as well as two game modes. Additionally, you may choose to play a free-for-all, or you may do battle between two teams.</p>\n<p>In order to start a game:</p>\n<ol><li> Extract the zip file to a folder.</li><li>Take a moment to be thankful.\u00a0There are so many alternate universes in which you were never able to experience Monkey Fight.</li><li>Open the game.</li><li>Enter your monkey's name.</li><li>Hit \"start game\".</li><li>Fiddle with the settings.</li><li>\u00a0Hit \"host server\".</li><li>If you want your friends to actually be able to connect to your server, you have to port-forward port 7777 on your computer.

With your fists, you can left click to punch or right-click for a resounding slap.</p>\n<p>* This was the long-lost first game I ever made. It was created in the summer of 2020, but this is the first time it is being published - I had thought the project files got completely wiped when my hard drive failed last summer, but it turns out the final build file was still around\u00a0on dropbox. I guess you could call it a miracle. Unfortunately there's no Mac build though. Sorry Mac users.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T14:41:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d09/d090f9b9768634add6d39dcc03b7b90f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["maxy3702"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
