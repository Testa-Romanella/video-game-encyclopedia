The prompt was \"what does home mean to you\",\u00a0 and our design concept for the game was based around having a safe place to come back to that felt like home. The game is a slow-paced, atmospheric survival game where the player must collect wood for their fire, which is slowly burning out. The player's torch also requires sticks from the fire, so they must continually return home in order to delve farther and farther into the darkness.</p>\n<p>This is a prototype made in two days, but we hope to expand the game's concept beyond this first version to include more gameplay elements based around the lighting mechanics we have in the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-22T02:42:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbf/bbf74c274742d165270f9688fcd56c95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nick Sundermeyer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
