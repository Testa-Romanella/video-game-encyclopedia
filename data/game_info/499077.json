The theme was \"Eye for an eye\" which I interpreted as follows:</p>\n<p>You are the futuristic robot Robox who has to (fight eye for an eye) against incoming waves of space trash. Quite a busy robot, as there is a lot of future space trash coming in. You need to press different buttons depending on the target and you better be quick! Or else you are back to the infinite loop of incoming space trash :)<br/></p>\n<p>All assets (art, music, coding) done in abour 3hrs, and all by myself. The only exception is the \"Hakuno\" Font which was free to use, the owner of the font is:</p>\n<p>https://justtheskills.com/product/hakuno/</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing and best regards<br/>misterG<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T06:11:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1eb/1ebaf5d4553d8b64bda3f92f8b5bbaaf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["misterG420"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
