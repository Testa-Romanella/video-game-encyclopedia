{"id": 579615, "slug": "what-the-dub", "name": "What The Dub?!", "name_original": "What The Dub?!", "description": "What The Dub?! is a multiplayer party game where each player overdubs missing dialogue from hilariously awful B-movies, woefully outdated PSAs, and bizarre industrial films, with their own witty (or just plain stupid) dubs. Players watch the dubs and vote on the best one. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins! It&#39;s just that easy!<br />\nOver 300 so-bad-they&#39;re-good clips to dub!<br />\nPlay head to head with 3 to 12 players. Supports local multiplayer. Use streaming/screen sharing to connect with remote players.<br />\nEnter text using your phone, tablet, or computer.<br />\nYou write the dub, we do the talking! Your dubs are played back via text-to-speech.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2021-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-02T09:26:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aec/aecd9b7c404879dee4542c97ffd0e9d3_TaLYpmN.jpg", "website": "http://www.WideRightGames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 38, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 4, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 122, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 215, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Wide Right Interactive", "Mark Zorn", "Kurt Wojda"], "genres": ["Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Wide Right Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
