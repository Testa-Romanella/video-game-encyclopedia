In our game you will find many fish species that can easily be caught but not easy to reach the shore! I think we should wish you good luck?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Speaking of fish, we have an advanced artificial intelligence system. Each fish behaves differently. You must consider weather conditions or the time of day. I wonder who will be smarter? <strong>You or fish?</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>Have you ever seen such water effects? Certainly not! This is not only due to the advanced water system - Ultimate Water System but also our combat system. Each species of fish fights differently, and will strike at different times of the day. Huh! A lot to discover before you!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rain, fog, wind, heat! Day and night! That's all in Pro Fishing 2018.
