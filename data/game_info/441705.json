On the left hand side of the user interface there is a clock that displays the user\u2019s current time and which may be hidden and unhidden by pressing \u201cC\u201d. By right clicking and dragging, the user is able to \u201cpaint\u201d in whatever pattern they choose. With a left click, users are able to delete the objects they created. On the left side of the user interface, there are three sliders corresponding to each of the three available colors. Above those sliders is a dropdown menu allowing for the choice of one of three shapes to paint with. Below these sliders is a box that displays what color the user shall be painting with; white indicates all colors present and black indicates no colors are present (black). The user may hide and unhide the right main menu by pressing \u201cM\u201d. On the bottom right hand side users can \u201cliquidate\u201d the screen completely clearing their canvas. They may also toggle whether painted shapes disappear after a few seconds. In addition, users may also toggle whether their painted shapes appear with a random scale and random rotation. The user may hide and unhide the smaller right menu by pressing \u201cL\u201d. Finally a white canvas has been added to improve the look of the original grey horizon.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T09:13:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04e/04e73f2bc12039bb5684fbbae11a8a1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AJS259"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
