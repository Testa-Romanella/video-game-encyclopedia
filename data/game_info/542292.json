I made this as part of the 'High Level Game Development' module of my degree (coursework yaaaay).</p>\n<p>The main gimmick in this game is that you're basically on a timer. You start with 60 health, and every second, you lose 1 point of health. The only way to regain health is by stealing it from your opponents. By shooting them. But if you miss, you lose even more health. Last contestant standing wins.</p>\r\nSUPER HELPFUL INFORMATIVE TIPS\r\n<ul><li>By walking into a weapon box, you can replace your currently equipped weapon with a completely different random weapon.<ul><li>And the first shot with this new weapon won't cost health!</li></ul></li><li>It's possible to heal yourself above 60 health if you're good enough.<ul><li>But this bonus health will drain faster than usual.</li></ul></li><li>After 60 seconds, if the game hasn't ended, everyone will start losing more health per second.</li><li>If you've just stolen a lot of health from your opponent, you might want to run away.<ul><li>However, the closer a contestant is to death, the faster they become, so you probably won't be able to get very far</li></ul></li><li>Bots have ears too.</li><li>There may or may not be a hidden minigame providing a scientific recreation of the development process of this game hidden away somewhere in this game.<ul><li>Go look for it yourself, this section's supposed to be for helpful tips.</li></ul></li></ul>\r\nCREDITS FOR THINGS MADE BY OTHER PEOPLE\r\n<ul><li>Standard Assets (for Unity 2018.4) by Unity Technologies (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/asset-packs/standard-assets-for-unity-2018-4-32351)</li><li>Speedball Player by Character Ink.
