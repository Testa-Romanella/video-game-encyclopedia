What are you? Not sure.\r\nThey \r\nhave constructed you as a weapon. Then you became a person. It is beyond\r\n your understanding. Your skull gives you memories, your heart gives you\r\n feelings and your automaton body will give you freedom.<strong>They wanted a weapon so they will get a weapon!</strong><br/><br/>As they will see, mechanical vampire is a dangerous creature and you \r\nare armed with special swords. Their hooks help you climb walls and \r\ntheir blades will drain your enemies' blood in order to pump it into \r\nyour own veins. Your mechanical limbs grant you astonishing speed. You \r\nare a predator - skull hunter. Your body is very durable. Are you the \r\nmonster they wanted you to be? Created for killing, you are now killing \r\nfor freedom.<br/>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong><br/>By clicking the left mouse button, you can perform deadly nimble vampire ninja moves! One second you are here and in less than an eye blink you are somewhere else, cutting your foes in half. Aim, click and wait for your body to move! You must aim behind the enemy to strike them down.\u00a0 You can also chain the attacks (max 3) since it takes some time to perform one.</p>\n<p>You can also run by pressing the right mouse button, but while running, you are vulnerable to shooting and you are unable to perform any damage.<br/>You must kill all enemies in a level to gain access to the next one.<br/>Blood powers your body. If you run out of blood you will die (does this mean you are a living being?) Do not forget to hide behind walls so no one can hurt you with their pathetic rifles.</p>\n<p>Here's the visual instructions which my girlfriend did for you:<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Game created for https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-40-hunters.<br/>Theme: Hunters<br/>Limitation: Mouse control only</strong></p>\n<p>Used engine: ct.js<br/>Used graphic: Background and environment by Kenney.
