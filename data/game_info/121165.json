It was quite challenging since we don't have a lot of experience and we've only participated before in a couple of LudumDares, which are 72h long jams. However we think the game turned out pretty good for the time given!</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Keyboard:</strong></p>\n<p>Move: W, A, S, D<br/>Open recipe book: TAB<br/>Action: CNTRL</p>\n<p><strong>Controller:</strong></p>\n<p>Move: Joystick<br/>Action: A<br/>Open recipe book: B</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy our game.
