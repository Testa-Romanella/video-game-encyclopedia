The museum takes you step by step through the course of the Apollo 11 mission, from the rocket that took the astronauts to the moon, down to the module that got them back. In this futuristic museum, holograms tell the story of the mission from start to finish, as well as having some actual objects from the Apollo 11 mission, including Neil Armstrong's spacesuit, and the spent command module the astronauts spent the majority of the mission in. The experience features these elements through use of the Smithsonian Digitization Program Office's photogrammetry and scan data used to capture these objects for virtual settings. This data can be found at their website here**.Feel free to download the game here. As I\u00a0improve upon the project and eventually bring it out of this beta stage I will start moving to releasing the project on platforms like Steam and the Oculus Store. It will then and always be non-profit and free for download.</p>\n<p>*Only compatible on Oculus Rift (S).</p><p>**Disclaimer and Terms of Use for Smithsonian Assets used</p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>----------------------</p>\n<p>Assets used from:</p>\n<p>NASA</p>\n<p>3D Warehouse User Bry2008</p>\n<p>Unity Asset Store Users Mass Games, Barking Dog, and Creepy Cat</p>\n<p>and the Smithsonian Digitization Program Office</p>\n\n<p>Created by Stuart Richardson in association with the Smithsonian DPO</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-31T10:43:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd0/bd05dcf2052e8c352ca0007e3e3d1313.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StuartRichardson"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
