I ended up makeing a game about the ancient myan ballgame called Ulma. Hit the ball through the hoop. If the ball hits your player it will turn white symbolizing the sun. If the other team hits the ball it will turn black symbolizing the moon.\u00a0 The passage of the sun and moon over the sky was of great ceremonial significance to the game of Ulma. you must be pressing a direction to hit the ball that way when you contact the ball</p>\n<p>This is my first gamejam so I tried to make as small of a game as possible and still be somewhat fun. This game was made start to finish in the course of a weekend. I\u00a0have a couple of ideas for developing this into a full game possibly on moble but that may or may not happen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/803/803a4298f2937e5bd2882e1e49413e5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["geekdude"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
