You\u00a0 as his moderator must help him grow and create a beautiful community along with him.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/>JAM THEME INTERPRETATION<br/></p>\n<p>We ourselves are starting as streamers and even though we haven't had toxic people we know they exist and that they can even make a streamer quit. That's why we thought about moderators and how their actions that might go unnoticed actually help a streamer a lot.</p>\n<p>Of course, a moderator on their own can't make a streamer get viewers. It's also the streamer's job to attract people.\u00a0 And if the streamer quits, the moderator will lose their job. Both of them need to work together\u00a0 to achieve what they want.</p>\n<p>For that reason, we thought that making a game based on this almost unseen\u00a0collaboration would totally fit the theme and be entertaining as well.</p><p>NOTE:\u00a0We saw that the deadline\u00a0 was changed to 8 PM but just in case we left the 6 PM version.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T09:57:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b5/6b5fc5b73306a7b628cc16456747b75a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TeamMadnessGames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
