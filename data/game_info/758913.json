The original list of available words came from\u00a0Charles Reid (Github: sgb-words.txt).

The player has been summoned to the library to use his Word Power to\u00a0restore the damage done by a mischievous gremlin. Solve 3 wordle puzzles to reshelve the fallen books and win the game.\u00a0 Players can view their own stats of wins and losses.</p>\n<p>Game time is approximately 10-20 minutes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T07:16:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ffb/ffb04d603486a4adb978b3b2d0be8f0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LadyJJ"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
