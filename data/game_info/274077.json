Your objective is to simply not die for 10 minutes. Plan your item usage wisely, deciding whether to use, throw, burn, or save items is critical to your survival.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/>* W/A/S/D: Move<br/>* Left Click: Use Item\u00a0 (Heal/Melee Attack/Shoot)<br/>* Right Click: Throw Item\u00a0 (Throw at fire to fuel it)<br/>* 1-5: Equip Item<br/>* ESC: Pause Game</p>\n<p><strong>Notes</strong><br/>* The melee attack makes you dash toward the enemy closest to your cursor, so long as they are within melee range.<br/>* Throw attacks stun longer than melee attacks. Ranged attacks do not stun.<br/>* Every item has throw damage, except for the bandage. Throw damage on melee weapons is weaker than it's melee damage. Throw damage is equal on guns. The kunai is an exception, being a melee weapon with higher throw damage than melee damage.<br/>* Throwing items stuns longer than melee attacks, but the stun duration is also dependent on each item. The bandage despite not doing damage, stuns for as long as the stick and the rock.<br/>* Machine enemies spawn every minute, on the minute. They have much more health than any other enemy, and drop the strongest weapons. (minus the gnome.)<br/>* Speaking of the gnome, it adds the most fuel to the fire, and can destroy machines in 1 throw.<br/>* Pills and rocks do not add fuel to the fire.</p>\n<p><strong>Hard Mode</strong><br/>* You move slower.<br/>* Items have less durability.<br/>* The fire dies faster.<br/>* Both the cold and enemies deal more damage<br/>* Enemy projectiles travel faster and further.<br/>* Enemies fire more frequently and have more health.<br/>* You get to feel better about yourself.</p><p>Music: https://www.purple-planet.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/076/076174a49450100b011952211d78fa0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nuLily"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
