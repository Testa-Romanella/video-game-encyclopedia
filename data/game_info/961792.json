A strange virus has simultaneously struck Earth and its surrounding colonies. You are sent into the body of your mentor, Major Jackie Fox, to investigate.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nA strange artifact within her body, the Solaris, seems to slow down the virus's evolution. Its location is unknown. Your mission is to find and get this artifact.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNanoforce Tactical Surgeon Fighter is a Shoot 'Em Up inpired by classics like R-Type, Thunderforce, and Gradius. Its weapon system is simple. 4 buttons, 4 shots. Frontal, backward, homing, and special. Your ship is equipped with the \"Graspers\" set but  you can equip other sets by collecting them during missions. Including \"Needle Drivers\", \"Tissue Distruptor\", \"Cranial Drills\", and many others.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game also includes:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- 7 Intense levels with secrets, bonuses, shields, secret bosses, secret levels (2)<br/>\r\n- 3 Game modes: ARCADE, STORY, and GREEN<br/>\r\n- More than 20 different weapons<br/>\r\n- Immersive story<br/>\r\n- Different endings<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game is not a bullet hell. It is inspired by classics like 16bits old school shmups, but with a modern touch (big blue/pink patterns).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNotes:<br/>\r\n- During the trailer, you can see hp at 999 or less. It's just for testing purposes. Hp max is set to 1 and can go as high as 5.<br/>\r\n- No inertia. I know this feature seems \"fun\", (moving in fluids, propulsion, gravity) but it's not my vision. The player can move at different speed by using the analog controller (if provided) and constant speed using directional inputs.<br/>\r\n-some elements during the trailer will be slightly different in the game (some graphics enhancements)<br/>\r\n-there will be some updates with hidden levels and bosses later, during 2023/2024 (for free)<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game has been built using SHMUP Creator! A powerful Shoot 'Em Up creation tool. Thank you to its creators for their kindness.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-05T05:29:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca8/ca8d15a4900be958a4ab106bbcb3d765.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 440, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alec's factory"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Alec's factory"], "esrb_rating": null}
