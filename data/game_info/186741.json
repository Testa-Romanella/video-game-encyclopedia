Throw a first person camera into the mix, and you have Super Rock Paper Scissors 3D!</p><p>Super Rock Paper Scissors 3D plays as a first person shooter, with only melee-weapons. Every now and then, the game prompts all players to choose rock, paper or scissors, and after that players chase each other around the map, trying to attack and avoid other players.</p><p>This was an excercise for us in making an online multiplayer game. We have used just under two weeks\u00a0developing this, so it's a little rough around the edges, but it definitely serves as a proof of concept.</p><p>We hope you'll gather some friends and\u00a0give it a try. If not, at least we learned how to make online games in Unity 3D.</p><p>---</p><p>Our plan is to\u00a0make\u00a0seven games in fourteen weeks. This game was the second of the seven.</p>\n<p>You can follow our progress on Instagram by following @StudioGauntlet</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee5/ee579bb989dc0eda59ee508341adeaca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GauntletGames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
