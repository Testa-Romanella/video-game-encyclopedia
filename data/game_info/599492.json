The combat system is very basic, its kinda like the old zelda games.\u00a0I've been working\u00a0on this game in my spare time.

I hope I\u00a0can learn from this project and become a better developer out of it.\u00a0I may or may not continue working on this project but I\u00a0would love feedback on it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T06:44:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b4/1b49574850dc5d15e98f5d4680030107.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lancer1"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
