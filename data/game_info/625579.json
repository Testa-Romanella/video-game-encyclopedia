His lover... a toaster.\u00a0</p>\n<p>One day whilst Francis was polishing his dearly beloved toaster some crows swiped it up and stole it from Francis. Guess all thats left to do for the small robot is to go on an adventure across the lands to reach his sweet little kitchen appliance and be reunited once more.</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>THIS GAME IS NOT COMPLETED.</p>\n<p>As this game is being developed by two young artists who are not particular strong in coding the game right now is definitely buggy and a bit incomplete. For this game jam we wanted to present to you the first level of our concept and create it to be more like a tutorial and a taster of what the full game could be. There are some elements missing and a few bugs so feedback would be appreciated so we can fix those as we continue to develop the game. thank you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T07:43:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7af/7aff77da36a313fdc7bb7ce8dff4a6ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LPierce"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
