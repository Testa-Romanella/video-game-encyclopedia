We are here to solve that! We are looking for local heroes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this game you play as a hero who goes through recent crime reports in a newspaper, here you will be presented with several quests. You can choose which quest to take up i.e. which crimes to fight. In the meantime, you have to also look at your stats and bars and make sure you are alive and doing a good job.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The combat part is turn based and in each quest you will be facing different enemies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh and the whole game is made on Microsoft Excel.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Note on Excel: </strong>When you start the project, enable macros and avoid forcefully changing tabs or play with options/ numbers/ variables out of turn. Follow the game-flow please!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note on BYOG 2019 (Using the theme):</strong> The theme presented was\u00a0\u201cTo know what is right and choose to ignore it is the act of a coward.\u201d My interpretation of this was: when you are presented with choices and responsibilities,\u00a0 you sometimes will take up the \"coward's\" way.\u00a0 Sometimes on the player's journey, to survive they will take unethical quests to save themselves and to continue working as a hero.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some quests might be moral right while others might be tactfully correct.\u00a0<br/>The trick is a compromise. Yes, you choose to ignore what is right, but is that the act of a coward or a responsible hero?<br/>Will you take a villains approach for a chance at surviving? Would you take a bad deal for a good ending?</p>\n<p>Does knowing and ignoring the right thing for self-preservation or the greater good make you a coward?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T05:06:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/577/577b07c8f27309e82b16949d0040a21f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 218, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TanuWanu"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
