Quickly your predecessors set out on vessels of steal and iron to avoid the calamity. Since\u00a0then the old world was destroyed and forgotten while your people drift aimlessly across an endless ocean.\u00a0 The God of your forefathers\u00a0promised a land overflowing with milk and honey yet it appears as elusive as the being that sent you. Nevertheless\u00a0this promised land is your hope.</em></p>\n<p><em>Press on all ye faithful for the truth is hidden within the waves.\u00a0</em></p>\n\n<p>This is the first prototype of World of Water! This game was directly inspired by the story of Exodus and the flood as well as titles such as Silent Service and years of being around the ocean. I hope you enjoy this little demo and come back periodically as I have lots more to improve/add.</p>\n\n<p>Once you have played a bit of the game I would really appreciated it if you could fill out THIS feedback form. That way I can get data on where the game needs to improve.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Furthermore, if you find any bugs or want to shoot me your thoughts please email me at Noah109carrico@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-01T02:39:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/139/139343f57aa660209ca7df87ea150b25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AREGO"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
