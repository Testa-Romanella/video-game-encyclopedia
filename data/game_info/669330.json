You will be able to move through the magnetic fields of the sphere and you will place yourself in a very large sphere with 2 starting bases. Each base has a maximum of 20 people, that is, 20 vs. 20. The game consists of taking down the entire enemy team and if a whole team is killed, the opposing team wins. It's a bit tricky at first, fun and entertaining. Of course you can shoot your team, you have to be careful with friendly fire.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T02:00:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db1/db17f427655e01e35834cdd0600de156.jpg", "website": "https://eurogamesstudio.com/leaguespace", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 191, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EURO GAMES STUDIO"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Racing", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["EURO GAMES STUDIO"], "esrb_rating": null}
