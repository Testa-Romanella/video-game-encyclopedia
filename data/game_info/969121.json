Then, both players' actions resolve simultaneously over the course of a few seconds. Predicting the opponent's actions and choosing the right counterplay is the key to victory.<br/><br/>The basic actions are <strong>attacks</strong>, <strong>blocks</strong> and <strong>throws</strong>:<br/><br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Attacks</strong> can beat out other moves through superior range or speed. Some attacks also knock players down, restricting that player's movement and slowing their attacks next turn. This emulates the \"wakeup game\" seen in most fighting games.<br/></li><li><strong>Blocking</strong> prevents damage from attacks, and usually puts the defender at an advantage next turn, or grants a free counter-attack (\"punish\") against the opponent.<br/></li><li><strong>Throws</strong> can break an opponent's guard, but have short range.</li></ul> <br/>The game's six characters also have unique traits and special moves which change how they play the game.<br/><br/><h3>Modes and Features:</h3><ul><li>Arcade Mode (with story scenes)<br/></li><li>Online Multiplayer Lobbies<br/></li><li>Local Versus<br/></li><li>Interactive Tutorial<br/></li><li>Survival Mode<br/></li><li>Blitz speed variants<br/></li><li>Training Mode with frame data display<br/></li><li>Controller Support<br/></li><li>Accessible difficulty settings<br/></li><li>6 Playable Characters<br/></li><li>3 Selectable Art Styles</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T02:51:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5dd/5ddf2c84a0a0b8d5ca5d31f0939b26c2.jpg", "website": "https://megaknockdown.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 25, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 267, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["dhamster"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Counter Hit Studios", "Mega Memecast"], "esrb_rating": null}
