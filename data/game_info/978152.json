Do you wish to be a criminal, or a savior? That is up to you.<br/><br/>Choose between 15 distinct classes:<br/><br/>Warrior: A well balanced with a focus on strength. Made to do any quests.<br/><br/>Doctor: Healers that can heal the sickness across each nation, yet are weak on their own.<br/><br/>Thief: Shopkeepers never sell to them, with their moves constantly under watch. Going to The Prison, is the least of the thief's worries.<br/><br/>Hunter: They live for the hunt and the slaughter. They can be found to get good pay from hunting rare beasts.<br/><br/>Rune Master: The old and intelligent beings that can read cosmic words.<br/><br/>Summoner: They can summon creatures to protect themselves. Hated by most, they are targeted for creating abominations upon the world.<br/><br/>Ice Spearmen: Fishermen who fish whenever they can find any remaining, clean water.<br/><br/>Investigator: A detective that can use guns, talk to enemies when able, and can take on cases for others. If you are cunning enough, some will join you by speech alone.<br/><br/>Priest: The Gods need priests to spread their holy words, teaching them holy magic. <br/><br/>Brute: A Warrior that has no honor, fierce in the wild, yet cannot live among civilization.<br/><br/>Storm Evoker: The Forbidden one was one of these, a being that can control the storms. The outcasts worship Evokers, others fear them.<br/><br/>Fowler: Flying beasts that can travel to any place they please, but are hunted.<br/><br/>Fire Elemental: Due to the Great War, The Flame has made all Fire Elemental to be worshiped and adored. Yet not all feel the same way.<br/><br/>The Slime: A mistake not meant to live. An experiment to remove all bones so you can no longer be injured and stronger in battle, it comes with a downside. Your body is made out of a liquid mush that is weak to everything. Only those who wish for pain choose the slime<br/><br/>The Blameless: One who is random with their speech, and their spells. They cannot be blamed for their actions, as every time they open their mouths, it is unknown what will come out. Beasts of the Umbra Fields attack them last, knowing their randomness can be beneficial. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Whatever you become, you shall be the prey of others from man to beast. Master who you are and what you will become to manage your stamina, hit weaknesses, stun enemies, and kill to survive.
