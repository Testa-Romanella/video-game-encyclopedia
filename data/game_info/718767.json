This is a very simple Flappy-Bird-like game. You control the head of the Headless Horseman, that is trying to return to its owner.\u00a0That\u00b4s pretty much it.</p>\n<p>All sounds and sprites are not my own (since I am very bad at drawing and composing) and their creators are listed in the \"Credits\" tab.</p>\n<p>It\u00b4s the first project I completed on my own, so don\u00b4t be too harsh ;) \u00a0That said, I do appreciate any feedback on the game. Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T06:17:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e31/e3104a406b106cead7b50f9890c3c373.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zortordor"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
