At first, it all started with the usual hooligan antics, beginning with a slingshot and ending with the theft of the gramophone. However, one of the gang members decided to attack the mayor, infecting his brain with parasites. The mayor manages to call the robot scavenger that will send the bandit to a dump. However, the scavenger by mistake sucks the cleaner Joseph (you play as him). And the bandit washes off, kidnaping Joseph&#39;s girlfriend, Berta. From this moment the game begins. </p>\n<p>The most significant difference from other games made in this genre is that the interaction occurs only with those objects that the protagonist can reach. You can also increase and decrease your height (three positions: low standard and high). Also in the game, there are no dialogues, instead of which the system of animated clouds of thoughts is used.</p>", "metacritic": 85, "released": "2009-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T11:57:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/8cd/8cd179c85bd3de8f79bef245b15075fb.jpg", "website": "http://www.machinarium.net", "rating": 4.17, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 202, "owned": 2945, "beaten": 894, "toplay": 139, "dropped": 266, "playing": 26}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 100, "ratings_count": 886, "suggestions_count": 536, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 894, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "PlayStation 4", "PS Vita", "Xbox One", "iOS", "PC", "Android", "Linux", "Nintendo Switch", "macOS"], "developers": ["Amanita Design"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Family", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Amanita Design"], "esrb_rating": null}
