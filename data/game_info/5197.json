If you can deal with the gut-wrenching, Smack-talking, fluid-spitting, and limb amputating ways of your army, you can embark on your journey of vengeance to defeat the king.</p>", "metacritic": 63, "released": "2009-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-02T11:52:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/379/379a7800973dc09485f5be4a4ddd0ac4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 453, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PSP"], "developers": ["Now Production"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Tecmo"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
