The jam's theme was \"Don't Touch It\". This is the first time ever that I go rogue in a jam and it is also\u00a0my first game ever made with Unity. I know there is a lot of work to do, but if you enjoyed even just a little thing in this game, please tell me in order to continue the work on this, adding a lot of new levels and a deeper storyline!</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T08:03:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/532/53293917283006d09bebb381ea0dc7cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["VinnieM"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
