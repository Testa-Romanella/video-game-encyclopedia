Neurons are the primary components of the nervous system. They send and receive information in the form of electrical signals from the sensory organs, facilitating communication with the brain.<br/><br/>Nothing in the human body happens without the neurons knowing about it. Neurons perform the critical task of carrying information across the entirety of the human body.<br/><br/>The nerve cells transfer information by using both electrical and chemical signals.<br/><br/>The death of brain neurons can lead to irreversible diseases (e.g. Parkinson's disease)<br/><br/>Do not forget to charge your brains! This is exactly what you need to do in the game, while simultaneously charging the neurons in real life!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T08:02:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6d/e6d8c6f801fd274b3e5c5be593d1bb7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["usanik"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
