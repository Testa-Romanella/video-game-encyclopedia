Vanquish your opponents with \n      four different projectiles and the powerful beams of your gravity \n      platform. Intercept attacks and take careful aim at exposed \n      vulnerabilities. Deflect incoming projectiles or capture and charge them \n      with energy for devastating explosive attacks. Team up with a friend and \n      battle through campaign mode or with up to eight players on a single Wii \n      console in versus mode for an all-out battle. Customize your matches \n      with a variety of different options such as flooding the arena with \n      projectiles or making the game insanely fast.
