(15 if you are thinking really hard!)<br/><br/>In Root Down, you have two types of pieces. There are \"kicker\" pieces that must be next to a \"root\" piece to move. After a kicker moves, it turns into another root, \"kicking\" all of the neighboring pieces in the process. Kick an opponent's root, then kick it again to capture it!<br/><br/>Please use the \"send feedback\" button to send me your input, or email me: rootdown@abstractpuzzle.com<br/><br/>Thanks for reading, and thanks for supporting indie game development!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:52:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/772/772333d72987db62131ee16f03a223a9_b30DCZg.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Martin Grider"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Martin Grider"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
