They need to travel 99 floors up the space station, defeating the enemies that come by. This is a vertical slice of gameplay in this prototype (1 functioning level).</p>\n<p>Eliminate all enemies (watch out, you and they both die in 1 hit!). There's supposed to be a teleporter to move you to the next level, but of course, I forgot to put it in the level. <em><strong>Whoops</strong><strong>.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Oh, and also, you can not control when you shoot.<strong> It's tied to the rhythm of the game </strong>;)</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Mouse controls the main menu: you hold the cursor over the Play button to play! Also, when in the game, mouse/hold the controller cursor over the gun you want to choose. 2 music tracks! 2 different gun patterns!</p>\n<p>From there, use keyboard and mouse controls, or use twin-sticks on controllers.</p>\n<p>ESC quits the game!
