{"id": 78494, "slug": "crawl-snake-plus", "name": "Crawl Snake Plus", "name_original": "Crawl Snake Plus", "description": "Crawl Snake Plus is an addictive new mobile game that combines the classic game of snake with elements. In this game you are a snake instead of a blob and the goal is become the biggest and longest slither worm in the game.<br/>A single mistake is enough to make a giant worm turn into nothing and lead to game over, even against the smallest slither worm, granting this latter a chance of becoming stronger fast without effort. Focus on the slither light dots along the way, forget about the others except when you\u2019ve got enough length to trap them in circles. Note that it\u2019s possible to cross ways with your own body, without punishments.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:23:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52d/52d45f386ce92d7b0e72e744ce893752.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Nguyen Thi Thuy"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Nguyen Thi Thuy"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
