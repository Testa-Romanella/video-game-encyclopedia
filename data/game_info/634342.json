Each space you move over then becomes impassable. If your opponent ever can't make a move with any of their units, you win!\u00a0</p>\n<p>In addition, on each side of the board there is a goal square marked in yellow. If you reach the goal on the other side of the map, you win immediately! Surrounding the goal is a field of colored spaces: blue spaces are only accessible to you, and red spaces are only accessible to your opponent.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Difficulty:\u00a0</strong>Determines the number of squares the computer can move. Easy, medium, and hard correspond to 4, 5, 6 squares of movement, respectively.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls: </strong>Arrow keys move the cursor around and navigate the menus. Spacebar / Enter selects a unit to move, after which all the reachable squares are highlighted.\u00a0 Select a valid square to move. Escape deselects the unit or resets the game if no unit is selected.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:\u00a0</strong>after running the game, you need to click on it to give it focus before the keys work.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Note 2:\u00a0</strong>on Medium and Hard difficulty, it can take a few seconds for the computer to make its move<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T06:35:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ea/9eaf9b19a79b878c50b518251daf67c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Orbitalics"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
