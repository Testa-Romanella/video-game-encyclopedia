If it were realistic, far too little area would be created on which the player can move. The green areas symbolise the approx.\u00a022,000,000 km\u00b2\u00a0(ca. 15% of the total land area) of unused, wild natural spaces that still exist. Partially used area is excluded here.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Q: Is there a way to end the game early? Where is the game menu?<br/></em>A: Nope. Once you have started, you must complete your work until either time or fuel runs out. As soon as you have started to change the living space, there is no turning back.</p>\n\n<p><em>Q: I can't move more than 5 squares. What the heck?</em>A: The grid is built completely randomly. It is possible to get a level where humanity has built its cities, so you can't get any further or reach every green space.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><em>Q: How can I remove the hideous *insert colour here* bars on the sides of the fullscreen image?</em><br/>A:\u00a0Sadly, you can't do that at the moment, as far as I know. Part of the non-optimised state of the game is the limitation to only one aspect ratio of the resolution - 16:9. Other values lead to bars on the sides. Unfortunately, these can sometimes be very unattractive. More supported settings are possible for later releases. In the current state, however, the game is sometimes partially cut off when I enable the option, which is why it is presently deactivated. You can run it in window mode, though.</p>\n<p><em>Q: Will this game be completed at some point (aka V1.0)?</em><br/>A: To this I can answer quite clearly: Perhaps! For now I'm heading to the next assignments, but I hope to come back and improve one or two things. I don't think there will be more features in future, since the primary goal was to make a playable prototype, and therefore it's not very modular. But who knows...<br/>But to be honest: the version numbers used here were more of a rough estimate than real representation of state.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T05:33:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c7/2c7e6734a35a9601e95adc7979517508.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["elStudio314"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
