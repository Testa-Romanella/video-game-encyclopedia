The theme was \"Roll of the dice\" so i tried to make te game where the heroes and enemies must roll out to attack each other, in order to do that the player must shake the battlefield.</p><p>Battles are resolved based on the velocity of the colliding units and their stats. When they collide with the walls they will gain more velocity, so try to always keep them moving.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Thanks for playing.<br/></strong></p><p><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Use the primary click of the mouse to hold the stage, hold it down and shake it so that the units start rolling around the battlefield. Every time the units collide with each other they will deal damage based on their stats and velocity.</p>\n<p>Between each wave you can choose which heroes to fight, unlock new ones and improve their stats. Be careful as the waves progress the enemies will get stronger too!</p>\n<p><strong>DOWNLOAD AND PLAY</strong></p><p>Either install using the itch.io app or download files, unzip, open the .exe file.
