{"id": 680, "slug": "red-faction", "name": "Red Faction", "name_original": "Red Faction", "description": "<p>The series of video games, known for the destructiveness of virtual environments. The action takes place at the end of the 21st century. Humanity has colonized Mars and now is extracting minerals that are no longer available on Earth. The player takes control over the miner who goes by the name Parker, and who helps rebel forces with the uprising against the evil Ultor Corporation. The latter is entirely out of hand and violates the fundamental human rights: does not provide workers food and medicine and treats miners as slaves.</p>\n<p>The main game mechanics is the GeoMod technology, which allows players to extensively change the virtual environment. For example, with the help of explosives or other improvised instruments. Unavailable earlier freedom of action allow\u044b players to complete levels non-linearly, and change them beyond recognition. The version for the PC included an additional level of Glass House, in which GeoMod&#39;s capabilities could be used in full, and a multiplayer with 25 maps.</p>", "metacritic": 78, "released": "2001-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-12T08:27:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a81/a81632a0060ca9fc0e33552a5c52bb9e.jpg", "website": "http://www.redfaction.com", "rating": 3.88, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 96, "owned": 1612, "beaten": 264, "toplay": 49, "dropped": 70, "playing": 6}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 66, "ratings_count": 272, "suggestions_count": 433, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 274, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "PlayStation 4", "PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["THQ Nordic", "Volition"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["THQ Nordic", "THQ", "Nordic Games", "Nordic Games Publishing", "Nordic Trolls", "Graphsim Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
