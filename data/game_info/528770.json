Although this game is playable on PS5, some features available on PS4 may be absent.

Download it free-of-charge if you already purchased \u2018Flying Soldiers\u2019.<br/><br/>Get ready to command an odd squad of fun birds and devise a plan to bring them safe and sound to the end of the battlefield. An outlandish puzzle game that will challenge your mind to make these greenhorn recruits into brave soldiers.<br/><br/>Not everything is as it seems in this fun game, because these \"flying soldiers\" can hardly glide a few inches and they don't exactly have the abilities to go into battle. So, it's no surprise that, with squads made up of these \"characters\", they wouldn't be able to get themselves out of the mess they're in. Their only hope lies in your tactical skills to help them advance.<br/><br/>Spikes, traps, electric fences, and rings of fire are just some of the many dangers these daredevil soldiers must avoid over a total of 45 missions. You'll find yourself with three types of birds with different skills, but even the boldest won't make it through without your help.<br/><br/>It's not only about strategic placement of the limited objects available throughout the terrain. You also have to think about the soldiers' positions and skills; timing their movements right; and how they interact with objects.<br/><br/><br/>Offline single player<br/>Uses DUALSHOCK\u00a04 vibration function<br/>Remote Play allows users to connect to and play games on their PlayStation\u00ae4 or PlayStation\u00ae5 using a mobile device, PC, or another PlayStation\u00ae4 or PlayStation\u00ae5.<br/><br/><br/>Online features require an account and are subject to terms of service and applicable privacy policy (playstationnetwork.com/terms-of-service &amp; playstationnetwork.com/privacy-policy). <br/><br/>Software subject to license (us.playstation.com/softwarelicense). <br/><br/>One-time license fee for play on account\u2019s designated primary PS4\u2122 system and other PS4\u2122 systems when signed in with that account.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T03:31:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fd/3fd0f6f3949e23f47f2e3e8f5d6c5121.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 422, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Family", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
