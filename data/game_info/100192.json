The more fruit your Buddy eats, the more points you will earn. </p>\n<p>But remember: Buddies only have a limited amount of time to forage, and they don't like sour fruits. Eating a sour fruit will cause your Buddy to lose time. Also, some fruits are too big to be eaten and will stun your Buddy if they land on its head. Be sure to dodge these obstacles!</p>\n<p>Use your points to unlock and purchase eggs to hatch new Buddies, and customize your Buddies with cool markings and colorful wristbands.</p>\n<p>What are you waiting for? Come play!</p>\n\n<p>Patch 0.0.1:</p>\n<p>Save and Return to Hatchery now take you back to the Hatchery.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/078/0788ebd074d4895c4ab1ea19fc668267.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Emerald Interactive Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
