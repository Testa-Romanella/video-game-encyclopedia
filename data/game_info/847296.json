KILL DEMONS!\r\n<p>You play Vlad (not short for Vladimir, thank you), a vampire hungry to kill the Demon King. But be careful: His castle lies on hell's outskirts, and the roads ahead are infested with monsters.</p>\n<p>The Six Gates of Hell lie in your way. Gather enough blood in the Human Realm to defeat the monsters blocking your path and open them one by one. Open all six, and slay the Demon King in his castle!<strong>*</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>*</em></strong><em><strong>(Demon King and castle not included.)</strong></em><br/></p>\n<p>Vlad's Descent is a 2.5d side-scrolling action platformer where you gather blood to fight monsters and open the Six Gates of Hell. It was created in one week alongside the <strong>Epic Megajam (2022)</strong> off the theme \"<strong>As Above, So Below</strong>\". We had too many people to submit, but we hope you enjoy hunting monsters alongside Vlad.<br/><br/>*v0.2 includes a few bugfixes and some extra polish made after the official deadline of the Jam</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<strong>Dev Team:<br/></strong>\n<p><strong>Neil Goodman - Blender Enthusiast (Art) -  https://www.artstation.com/ubik<br/>Illya Hlushko</strong> - Demon and Garlic Puppeteer (Technical Design)<br/><strong>Callum Holland</strong> - Vampire Summoner (Technical Design) - @Techxorcist - callumholland.co.uk <br/><strong>Beth Reed</strong> - Dimensional Warlock (Level Desgn)<br/><strong>Miles Rodyakin</strong> - Metalhead (UI Art)<br/><strong>Callum Wagstaf</strong>f - Master of Gates &amp; Celestial Bodies (Technical Design)<br/><strong>Ben Wheatley</strong> - Realm Moulder (Level Design)</p>\r\nAudio from Freesound.org:\r\n<p>Blood drips, Shooting, and Generic Splat from LittleRobotSoundFactory | Laser from wcoltd | Bat &amp; Double Jump from Brsjak | Garlic from typeoo | Dash from Kastenfrosch | Heal from Shyguy014 | Dimension Jump from Timbre | Punch from EminYILDIRIM | Taking Damage from Under7dude | Garlic Emerging from tothrec2 | Jump from cabled_mess | Bat Projectile Hit from SlykMrByches | Garlic Death from d.n.audio.uk | Bat Death from kuchenanderung1 | Tower Death from InspectorJ | Woosh from qubodup | Bite from InspectorJ |\u00a0Sizzle\u00a0from\u00a0EverHeat | Squirt from\u00a0freakinbehemoth<br/></p>\r\nAsset Packs:\r\n<p>POLYGON - City Pack and POLYGON - Town Pack from Synty Store<br/>Stylized Desert Environment by Bad Rhino Games<br/></p>\r\nTools used:\r\n<p>Unreal 5<br/>Blender<br/>Audacity<br/>Photoshop<br/>Procreate<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T13:53:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9c/c9cea8dfad008c91e68a1bcc4b806334.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 190, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Techxorcist", "mrodyakin"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
