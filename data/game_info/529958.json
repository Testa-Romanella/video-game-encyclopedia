The longer you survive the waves of robots, the more frequently they spawn, all\u00a0while getting faster and dealing more damage. The goal is to see how high a score you can achieve, all while you're being attacked by these stealthy robots. Although you do have limited ammo, defeating robots will randomly drop more ammo for you so don't worry.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T08:40:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/732/732971da80e71a5d2f7dc9e8efa30c8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MattRX"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
