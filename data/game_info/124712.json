Nice animations for the main character!\r\nEelstork:\u00a0A hard to control, yet endearing throwback to Windows XP and the golden age of computer viruses.\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\nBeginning Info:\r\n<p>SLiME.BAT was a game where you were casually browsing memes and suddenly a \"slime\" virus infected your computer. It was made for GC Jam 3 which was a 3-day jam. Of course the idea had potential and I really could not do anything in that time limit so I decided to remake the game.</p>\r\nHere's the game\u00a0if you want to try it.\r\n________________________________\r\nAbout the game:\r\n<p>Your PC is infected by a strange virus created by BladeSides. It has taken control of 5 folders. Looks like you need to open them and fight the viruses off.</p>\r\nViruses:\r\n1. Slimegore\r\nEverything is sticky. Ew.\r\n2. Og'ster\r\nThis guy is tough and won't let back easily. Looks like you'll have to fight.\r\n3. Mozert\r\nClassical music can't be tough, can it?\r\n4. MLG League\r\nNeed I say anything? Well, these guys are DANK.\r\n5. BladeSides?!\r\n<strong>Holy shit! This is the developer of the game. Yo' gonna get yo' a** kicked!</strong>\r\n________________________________\r\nControls:\r\nArrow Keys/WASD - Movement\r\nShift/Backspace - Dash\u00a0\r\nSpace/Insert - Jump\u00a0\r\nCtrl/ The '/' Key or the '?'
