There are many features that we plan to have and we are operating on a buy it once scheme. If you buy the game now you will get access to every update to the game's PC version including a Steam Key when the game releases on Steam. \r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tBecause Voxel Force is in such an early stage of development it is on sale for a whopping \r\n\t<strong>75%</strong> off making it only <strong>$5.00</strong>. The price will increase as features are added to the game.\r\n</p>Controls<ul>\n<li><strong>W,A,S,D </strong>keys for movement</li>\n<li><strong>Mouse</strong> to look around<br/>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Left Mouse Button </strong>to fire or destroy blocks<br/>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Right Mouse Button </strong>to place blocks<br/>\n</li>\n<li><strong>1,2,3,4,5 </strong>to select different weapons<br/>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Left Ctrl </strong>to fire guns<br/>\n</li>\n</ul>The Kickstarter<p>\r\n\t\tWe'll be launching a Kickstarter campaign to further fund development of Voxel Force.
