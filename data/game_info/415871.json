Music wasn't made during the jam, it was taken from a collection of assets I've paid for previously.</p>\n<p>Due to time constraints, the magic system wasn't fully implemented\u00a0and so, you can create magic but you cannot use it. You can explore the world, and\u00a0interact with NPCs with cutscenes!</p>\n<p><strong>If you're lost, talk to God as he will hint to what you can do next!
