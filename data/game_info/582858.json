The theme was \"blast from the past\", hence the very creative game title.<br/></p>\n<p>There are some debts that are too big to pay. A severe debt has struck two friends and made them desperate enough to search for the ancient mechanical temple that is said to guard nearly infinite money. The temple works mysteriously, using small portions of its treasure to beckon thieves while its guardian studies and remembers their every move. Can the two friends take advantage of this and settle their monstrous debt?</p>\n<p>You control one of two characters and collect the treasure within a level. The treasure is always guarded by a turret that tracks your movement and fires a laser periodically. However, the turret also remembers every time and position it has fired a laser in previous levels and will re-fire those lasers as well. The whole process of charging up and firing lasers is called a round and you should aim to reach the treasure before all the turret's rounds are finished. The amount of money you earn from completing a level decreases the more turret rounds pass within the level. Once you are struck by a laser, the game is reset.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T20:21:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e36/e3653312e656e696ce48150fd20feb18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ihitthesack"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
