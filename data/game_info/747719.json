The game is controlled in a bird's eye view kind of style and you must go day-by-day selecting how many survivors do what tasks. Whether it is to defend the wall against the wave of zombies, farming and growing crops, entering the wasteland and search for medical supplies or luxury food.</p>\n<p>I think this is all you need to know but don't forget I'm a solo developer and it is still in early development. There will still be bugs and the game definitely needs balancing!</p>\n<p>To report bugs or hang out with me join my discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/jYRV2RJePt</p>\n<p>Happy playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T13:13:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/436/436ef6664ccee868e59bb2f015dee0c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ethan Cook"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
