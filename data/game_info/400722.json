But fear not, for there is a guide which will help you through these puzzling and vague scenarios.</p>\n<p>You will have to manoeuvre\u00a0through several rooms to reach and claim the treasure. To do so you must analyse\u00a0the room you are currently in and use the guide to enter the correct commands.</p>\n<p>The game and the guide were both written during a game jam, so whoever finds a spelling error gets to keep it and cherish it forever as their own.</p><p>The guide comes in the zip, but you can also find it here.</p><p><strong>TL;DR</strong><br/></p><p>\"Here is my seven page thesis on how to play my game. If you don't like manuals, take a hike but not into my dungeon\"</p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-23T03:35:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66c/66cb0f5a55cdf56093b10f1775ac813b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["andidebob"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
