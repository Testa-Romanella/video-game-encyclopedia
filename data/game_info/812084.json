The controls are simple, WASD or arrow keys, stuff like that. There will be a tutorial when you open the game and a controls menu incase you forget something. This game is more open world than\u00a0Mutant Madness 1. It takes place in a made up world with all sorts of creatures and mutants. This is just the demo so only the field region is available (and because I haven't made the other regions yet). Hope you enjoy this demo!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T15:55:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33f/33f906a2da0937e07c13485f9fffc45b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ArrieBoy22"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
