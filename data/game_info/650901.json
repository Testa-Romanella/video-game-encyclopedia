She has no special gifts, save for a comely appearance, and in a world infested with criminals, monsters, and other sinister threats, that often bodes more ill than good. Cast out into an unforgiving new world, Claire is forced to rely purely on her wits and wiles in order to survive.<br />\nWill Claire be able to forge a new life for herself, relatively unscathed from the horrors that stalk her? Or will she find herself meekly succumbing to the will of the rich and mighty, becoming little more than a toy for those with evil intent?
