While I'm not super happy with the game itself, I am super happy that I've learned so much from this project. With that being said, I wanted to say a big thank you to the members of the Mix and Jam Discord, for answering a LOT of my questions and using their time to help me. To them, I owe this entire project. I might return to this, but that's depending on how I feel after resting and looking at it again. With that said, Party Walker is a Rhythm based stealth game, where you use the music to sneak through the crowd. The goal is to put your own music on, without getting caught. As of now, the game is bugged (You can't win, and web version's only allows safe movement AFTER the beat has played). That being said, please download the game for the full experience, as while they're the same, the web version is a lot buggier and will need proper fixing before I release it</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T04:06:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8d/a8df14e4b0c8cb2c05edb73cb868f378.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheFluffycart"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
