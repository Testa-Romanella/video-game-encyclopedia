Sell your goods in exotic locations, fight off fearsome foes, meet colorful characters and listen to their stories. Inspired by the classic One Thousand and One Nights, as well as the writings of Jorge Borges and Ted Chiang.</p>\n<p>Caravana is a combat-focused 2D platformer with light trade management. The combat is paced and deliberate, inspired by the classic Dark Souls. Everything in this game, from the soundtrack to the pixel art, is a one-man effort.</p><p>Bonus features:<br/>Azerty-compatible controls<br/>Gif cam: press the \"G\" key or the left shoulder button to capture the last six seconds of gameplay in convenient .gif form! (Note: these .gif files are pronounced with a hard 'G'.)<br/></p>\n<p>The game evolved from a Ludum Dare 45 project (theme: Start With Nothing). It is currently in development, but the game is developed enough that I want to start getting feedback. If you check it out, let me know what you think!
