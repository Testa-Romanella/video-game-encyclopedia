Everything from the gameplay mechanics to the visual style of the game focuses on giving the player the sense of defying light. The basic controls of the ship are accelerating, performing a lateral shift either to assist driving or to hinder opponents, and using the particle engine boost that will provide the player an extra speed at the cost of a limited energy reserve.</p><p>Races take place in a futuristic environment: an advanced neon city where the track unfolds in intricate shapes and vertiginous ups and downs between buildings. This is be possible thanks to an anti-gravity (or magnetism) system that allow the ships to stay close to the tracks no matter what their shape and orientation is.</p><p><strong>- Developers -</strong></p><p>Andr\u00e9s Valencia  -  ams.itch.io<br/>Eric Oliver  -  saprolin.itch.io</p><p><strong>-  Free source audio  -</strong></p><p>Game Theme: Log Horizon Opening Instrumental [Astra Cat], by Astra Cat (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWU9ITfsXMWI46bR_ibCDLA) (CC BY)</p><p>Main Menu Theme: B1 by AJC HearTattacK<br/>(https://www.freesound.org/people/AJC%20HearTattacK/) , remixed by Timbre (http://www.freesound.org/people/Timbre/), remix #3 of 116327__AJC_HearTattacK__B1.flac (CC BY-NC 3.0)</p><p>Sound effects by: Michel Baradari (http://www.apollo-music.de/)(CC-BY 3.0) and ejfortin (https://www.freesound.org/people/ejfortin) (CC BY-SP)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/973/973711844373a294337510f1a37dac44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Andr\u00e9s Valencia T\u00e9llez", "Saprolin"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
