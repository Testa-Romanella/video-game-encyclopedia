The final game is estimated to be released Q3 2020.</em></p>\n<p>===</p>\n<p><em>Most people would ignore this shop called Desruc Dolls on the street if they passed it-- or wouldn't look twice, past the plush, porcelain dolls, wooden dolls, and general selection of well-crafted dolls arranged around the shop. They'd perhaps admire the curtains, stars stitched in a purple canvas, maybe even walk inside and take a look around the shop.</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>And then they'd turn around and leave.</em></p>\n<p><em>But this wouldn't be very fun if that was the end of the story, now would it?</em></p>\n<p>===</p>\r\nTHREE STRANGERS\r\n<p>Three guys walk into a doll shop? Sounds like the beginning of a joke.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There's\u00a0<strong>Alister</strong>, the gentleman who seems to have some sort of nostalgia for this shop...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Evan</strong>, the wizard who's grouchy all the time and wants an... 'experiment-buddy'...</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0Or maybe\u00a0\u00a0<strong>Dylan</strong>, the young man who seems to have a debilitating stutter...\u00a0</p>\n<p>What do they have in common?</p>\r\nA DOLL\r\n\n<p>They all seem to have the same interest in the same show-stopping\u00a0<strong>doll</strong>... which the player seems to get to decide their name and what they look like... (like a protagonist?)</p>\n<p>What am I saying, a\u00a0<em>doll</em> can't be the protagonist for a game.</p>\n<p>Right?</p>\r\nCHOICES, CHOICES\r\n\n<p>There's choices to be made. Will they lead you down a good path? Maybe a bad path? Or maybe there's some\u00a0<strong>truth</strong> to these choices...</p>\r\nA MYSTERY TO BE SOLVED\r\n<p>Why is there such a strange reaction to the doll's name? Why does the doll seem to remind the potential buyers of someone?</p>\n\r\nAND WHO'S THIS DOLLMAKER PERSON?\r\n<br/>\n<p>And of course you have your friendly shopkeeper, who... well... who\u00a0<em>is</em> she, really?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well.</p>\n<p>I suppose you'll get your answers once you play the game, right?</p>\n<p><strong>||DEMO CREDITS||</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Writing: ArizaLuca, Toni42<br/>GUI: ArizaLuca<br/>Art: ArizaLuca</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-20T03:06:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/597/597f77ab52ebd9be43b0dfefc084fd64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Astral Autumn Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
