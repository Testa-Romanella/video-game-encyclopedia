Then clear the stage within the 10 second time limit.</p><p>You can also press the QWE and ASD keys to press the green and red buttons if you prefer to use the keyboard. I don't think there is a shortcut to toggle the power though, so you still need to click on that.</p>\n<p>So what is it?</p>\n<p>An old game I made for Ludum Dare 27 where the theme was 10 seconds. Although it only has 5 stages, I quite liked this one, so I'm uploading to Itch. You can also find all the source on my Github.</p>\n<p>I don't think I actually entered this in the jam, but made it a week or so\u00a0after because I liked the theme. It was made using my own javascript game library when I was really into javascript+html5. Graphics were made from scratch in Photoshop and sound was produced with BFXR.</p>\n<p>Stage Editor</p>\n<p>This actually has a built in stage editor, although you can't actually save or play your stages. - I just thought it was an interesting thing worth mentioning. To activate it, you need to enter debug mode by pressing Shift+D. With debug mode enabled, the tile under the cursor shows a + to add walls when you click,\u00a0 and if you hold CTRL it will show a - to remove them. You can also press z and x to cycle between adding/removing walls and items.</p>\n<p>While debug mode is enabled, you can also hold c and drag to move the camera, but this is sort of pointless here, as the entire game fits on one screen.</p>\n<p>When I was making the game, I would make the stages in debug mode and then hit SHIFT+P to print the json for the stage into the javascript console, then copy and paste it into a file containing all the stages in order. This allowed me to design and tweak\u00a0the stages very quickly compared to how long it would have taken if I'd entered the data by hand. Even in a game jam, making tools is useful! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T07:09:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e33/e332893fc6950457657e7c9da9dd7989.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MrFlamey"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
