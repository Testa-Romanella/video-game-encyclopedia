It's based on the racing car minigame of the Brick Game 9999 in 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to move car.</li><li>UP arrow and SPACE keys to activate boost.</li><li>SPACE and ENTER to start/continue.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Known Issues</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Colors in Windows are slightly different as I use Linux and it seems that the terminal colors are not compatible. For this reason, I made a different version of colors\u00a0in order to look a little bit better. Use Linux, it 's free :)</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li>The boost is disabled when a different key is pressed than those provided for it. It stays active regardless of wheter you press and hold the SPACE key, for example, or just once until another one is pressed (after that you have to unpress and press the key again).</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li>You have to press a key to update frame when toggling to maximize windows. It will centered automatically when resizing, too.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Source Code</strong></p>\n<p>This game uses a customized\u00a0 version of\u00a0JoelOtter/termloop engine in order to embed resources. The source code is avaliable here.</p>\n<p>Hope you like it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T06:19:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b60/b60941b65b8f3195a1ead747993b2ed2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["liconaj"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
