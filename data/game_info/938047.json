Show your older brother that you are no longer a child! File your taxes!<br/><br/><br/>That\u2019s right, take on the role of the young Prince of Undead, trying to prove himself. Expand the bureaucratic glory of the Undead Kingdom across all the lands by establishing new outposts. Summon workers, mine bones, capture souls, and protect your Ziggurat at all costs. Place traps, employ ghosts and skeletons, use magic, add mods to spice things up, or ask your friends - Ghouls to help you out. It is up to you to pick the best strategy!<br/><br/><br/>All is quiet in the Undead Kingdom, the land of order and structure, ruled by the bureaucratic Lich King.

Turn your workers into deadly soldiers by building barracks and towers. Strengthen your defences even further with a range of passive buildings and mods. <br/><br/><br/>With a unique system of mods, you can change the way your very defences work. Add chain lightning to your fireballs or use your enemies\u2019 very own life force to heal your soldiers! Or why not both? Mix and match different mods to better suit the situation you found yourself in.<br/><br/><br/>Meet and befriend a cast of interesting characters. And then send them to fight for you on a field of battle! Discover new allies, listen to them bicker, learn their abilities and upgrade them to make them stronger.
