Where your path collides with the path of an enemy, the future danger is highlighted while you still have time to counteract.<br/><br/>Classic top down style gameplay becomes a symphony of interweaving 3d paths where future events are highlighted, and players have time to change the outcomes before it's too late.<br/><br/>zTime (Danger Noodles!) is in early access for Windows. Play it with Oculus Rift or HTC Vive if you have one.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/201/20160be5c5559425ff85f60d03a72bf0.jpg", "website": "http://www.ztimegame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 284, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hazardous Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hazardous Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
