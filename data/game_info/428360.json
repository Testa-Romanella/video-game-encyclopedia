{"id": 428360, "slug": "receiver-2", "name": "Receiver 2", "name_original": "Receiver 2", "description": "<p>THIS IS NO ARCADE SHOOTER, THIS IS 100% GUN MECHANIC REALISM<br />\nReceiver 2 simulates every internal part of each firearm based on manufacturer schematics and gunsmithing resources. Learn exactly how each sidearm works, including how to load and unload them, clear malfunctions, and operate their safety features.<br />\nNOT YOUR ORDINARY FPS<br />\nYou won&#39;t find any loot crates or bullet sponges here. Every enemy can be destroyed by a single well-placed shot, using ballistic simulation based on data from shooting incident reconstruction textbooks. Practice the Receiver virtues of resilience, focus, and courage to resist the Threat.<br />\nFEATURES<br />\nSidearms modeled down to every spring and pin<br />\nEnemies with physically-based damage models<br />\nBallistic modeling of ricochets, penetration, and bullet drop<br />\nTrain your mind to defend against the Mindkill<br />\nBecome literate in how guns actually operateFAQ<br />\nWhat is Receiver?<br />\nWe created the original Receiver game for the &quot;7-day FPS&quot; challenge to explore gun handling mechanics, randomized levels, and unordered storytelling. With Receiver 2, we are doubling down on the aspects that made the original stand out: the detailed firearm controls and the tense, surreal atmosphere.<br />\nWhy are you so obsessed with guns?<br />\nLove them or hate them, firearms are everywhere in our culture. If you want to understand it then you must understand them as well. While many games include firearms, we felt it was time to have a game that is actually about them.<br />\nAre there people or animals to shoot in Receiver?<br />\nWe don&#39;t believe so. All our information suggests that the Threat will only dream killdrones to attack you after the Mindkill, but there&#39;s no way to be sure.<br />\nHow is Receiver 2 different from Receiver 1?<br />\nReceiver 2 has the same basic gameplay structure as the first, but more of everything. There are many more sidearms available in Receiver 2, and while Receiver 1 simulated several moving parts for each gun, Receiver 2 simulates <em>all</em> of the moving parts.<br />\nDoes Receiver 2 have online multiplayer or VR support?<br />\nNo, Receiver 2 is designed to be a single-player experience played on a monitor with a mouse and keyboard.<br />\nWhat is the Mindkill?<br />\nYou are not yet ready for that knowledge. Only a Receiver who has truly Awakened can understand the nature of the Threat.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-18T20:51:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f2/3f2880faff39e06c9dec4e691fde2a6b.jpg", "website": "http://www.receiver2.com", "rating": 4.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 50, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 10, "dropped": 6, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 34, "ratings_count": 11, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 11, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Wolfire Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Wolfire Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
