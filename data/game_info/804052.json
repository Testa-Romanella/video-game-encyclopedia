The theme was \"Seaside\" and the limitation was \"everything dies in one hit\". This was not only the first game I've ever completed and made all the assets for, but it was my first game jam as well. \u00a0I really enjoyed creating Breakneck Beach in 72 hours. There is a lot I would have loved to make better, but the whole experience was really fun and I hope to update the game in the future.<br/></p>\n<p>The concept of the game is you are a body surfer at a beach with large waves and \u00a0rocky shoreline. You score points by riding the waves sweetspot. Waves have a current and will shoot you out in unexpected directions if you aren't careful! Sharks pop up all over the place, try to avoid them or you'll be eaten!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T20:14:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29c/29cfda9388df3c2467b36d472b7ff14c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["arcrutus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
