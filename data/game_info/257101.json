WORK IN PROGRESS !</strong></p>\n<p>What is AWAKEN?</p>\n<p>The core concept was to create a game, where the player decides how to play. The core player character can perform basic actions like movement, jumping / wall jumping, and a melee attack. But as the players progress, they can attempt to collect blue collectibles called \"Biocells\". If these are delivered to the \"Deposit Station\" at the end of each section, they can be later used in the upgrade menu. Accessible from the main menu, here the player can purchase and activate a variety of powers from 3 categories:</p>\n<p><strong>Utility Powers</strong> (Overshield. Dash, Grip)</p>\n<p><strong>Combat Powers</strong> (Energy Blade, Crushing Fists, -not available yet-)</p>\n<p><strong>Major Powers</strong> (Super Speed, Levitation, Wings)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Current bugs/ problems:</strong></p>\n<p>World not existing past level 1</p>\n<p>Only 1 power should be selected from each category but atm all can be taken</p>\n<p>Please comment your opinions/ideas/bugs so i can improve the game!</p>\n\n<p>Created by Andy Kowalski</p>\n<p>Music by Omar Quirino</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c47/c474696fa9d68bf2703da3a728a3f627.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Eyot_Zex"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
