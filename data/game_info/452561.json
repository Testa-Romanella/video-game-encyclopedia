Real-mastered", "description": "<p>I have always been a fan of the Homestar Runner universe, and this game is one of the most famous ones that was made for it. This project was borne out of a desire to see what TROGDOR! might be like if it had actually been an arcade game in the mid-80's. The flash version has imprecise pixel alignment (a common occurrence in pixel-art flash games), and I am not much of a fan of that. <br/></p>\n<p>This is still very unfinished. The in-game arcade background is particularly egregious. When I have time I would like to improve the main menu design, the in-game sprites and sounds, and the enemy behavior, as well as add all the interstitials and levels of the original game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-08T05:46:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbd/cbd7a232a81722a1c8b597a5586f12be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["squorshy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
