{"id": 92051, "slug": "in-the-kingdom", "name": "In The Kingdom", "name_original": "In The Kingdom", "description": "<p>In The Kingdom is a twisted retro first person shooter inspired by the classic titles like Wolfenstein, Doom, Quake, Rise Of The Triad, and Chasm.  Explore the hellish ruins of a forgotten castle fortress poisoned by dark magic and evil forces.  Survive to the last and discover a new destiny.</p>\n<p>--A Note--</p>\n<p>In the kingdom is a small vertical slice of a larger concept we hope to elaborate on.  We chose to create this as a \"Pilot episode\" in order to gauge peoples reactions to the idea.  This is our first attempt at a game created in the Unity engine and as such, glitches are bound to show up.  We will be welcoming feedback and continuing to improve upon this build in order to make a more stable experience, and hopefully a followup as time goes by.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48d/48d8486f80430698fcabed296d1fe773.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Amon Twentysix"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
