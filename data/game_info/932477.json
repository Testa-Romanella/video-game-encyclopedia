In this game, you will traverse a hostile alien\u00a0world, with precious little ways of defending yourself, and very limited\u00a0health. If you\u2019ve been hoping and wishing for someone to make a much\u00a0more challenging \u201cMetroidvania,\u201d with incredible pixel-art and a kick-ass\u00a0soundtrack, your prayers have finally been answered by a team of\u00a0die-hard fans of the genre.</p>\r\nDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not all alone! Introducing: SUICHI!\r\n<p>In most games like this, isolation is a recurring theme. However, in\u00a0SUGAMENIA, you have a powerful ally! \u201cSuichi,\u201d the flying robot, is here\u00a0to provide service with a smile! Suichi can deploy bombs, be used as a\u00a0platform to reach higher places, offer advice, and more.</p>\r\nWho am I? What am I doing here? Where do I go?\r\n<p>In SUGAMENIA, you play as Violet, a fearless space explorer\u00a0marooned on this unknown planet, trying her best to escape its vast and\u00a0expansive alien dungeons and labyrinths. With limited weaponry and\u00a0very low health, and with no way to heal between save points, jumping in\u00a0Violet\u2019s shoes makes SUGAMENIA a real challenge, even for seasoned\u00a0gamers. Where you take her is up to you, as you explore and navigate\u00a0this hostile and terrifying world!</p>\r\nWhat\u2019s that sound? Why is my toe tapping?\r\n<p>SUGAMENIA features an original chiptune and synth score that'll\u00a0remind you of the good old days of arcade cabinets, while also feeling\u00a0fresh, new, and exciting. The OST ranges from distant, faraway\u00a0atmospheres and textures, to haunting, unsettling alien melodies, to\u00a0extreme, intense electronic battle tracks when facing off against larger\u00a0and more deadly foes. Make sure you plug in your headphones!</p>\r\nWhat are these creatures? And why are they attacking me?\r\n<p>SUGAMENIA would not be a proper \u201cMetroidvania\u201d without having\u00a0its own host of freakish, dangerous, and terrifying creatures. All the alien\u00a0sprite work and pixel art was hand-crafted by two artists to delight and\u00a0frighten you! Watch out: These otherworldly terrors mean business.\u00a0Keep an eye on those hitpoints!</p>\r\nFeatures:\r\n<ul><li>A play-style unlike any other \u201cMetroidvania,\u201d with Suichi!</li><li>Original atmospheric and exciting chiptune/electronic music</li><li>Retro PIxel-art graphics, reminiscent of the NES</li><li>Free exploration of a large map, with a variety of alien locations</li><li>Unique and colorful enemies</li><li>Extremely challenging bosses</li><li>Head-scratching puzzles with unique and fun mechanics</li></ul>Controls:<ul><li>Compatible with <strong>GAMEPADS</strong></li><li>KEYBOARD<ul><li>Cursors: Movement</li><li>V: Weapon</li><li>C: Jump</li><li>X: Bomb (Needs upgrade)</li><li>D: Lock position &amp; aim</li><li>ENTER: Pause\u00a0/ Start</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>Please help us out by adding SUGAMENIA to your Steamwishlist!
