You start with a randomly chosen class, and are trying to reach the exit. There are alternate layouts for each floor, and treasures to pick up that will strengthen your character.</p><p>Touching a monster enters combat, which is resolved through your character's stats, and Rock-Paper-Scissors. You can also evade all combat if you pay close enough attention to the enemy movement.</p><p>There are 20 floors in this version. Further development is on hold, but if enough people pay money for this, I'll come back to it and build more floors and special mechanics, such as teleportation tiles.</p><p>Arrow keys to move, Space to select, ESC to enter the menu.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70f/70ff0f8c47ded0971374ce72c640ce53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CannibalInteractive"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
