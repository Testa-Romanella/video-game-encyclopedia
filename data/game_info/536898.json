The next player guesses the word behind the drawing. Then another one draws it again! <br/>\r\nThe cycle continues and if the first word is correctly guessed by the last player, that's a trophy!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAfter three rounds, the player with the most trophies wins!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n.. but that really isn't the greatest fun of the game as you will soon notice, with your carefully crafted drawings being completely misinterpreted ;-) <br/>\n<br/>\r\nDraw and Guess is currently available in multiple languages with hundreds of family-friendly words to draw per language! It is also very useful to practice vocabulary of new languages.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-28T08:16:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/046/0462a56d61ce6890f73ee216cd316e92.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 97, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 6}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Acureus"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Acureus"], "esrb_rating": null}
