{"id": 406378, "slug": "mint-to-be-demo", "name": "Mint To Be [DEMO]", "name_original": "Mint To Be [DEMO]", "description": "<p><strong>MINT TO BE</strong>\u00a0is a visual novel made in a self imposed game jam over the course of a week (and a little bit cause we have jobs 'n stuff). It has been created by 2 friends, being myself and Jayus, the main members of HeatbuT-T Creations. Despite the time limit, we will likely continue working on it to polish things after its release.<br/><br/>It was inspired by a game called Plant Daddy. Mostly because the name caused some confusion between the two of us and the joke turned into an idea we decided to go forward with. It's a bit of a joke game so expect some meme references.</p>\n<p><strong>Play</strong>\u00a0as a tired florist running her own shop all on her lonesome. On a normal day, things become abnormal (what a surprise!). Suddenly, MC has 5 guys show up in her shop that clearly aren't fully human. Now you have to feed and house these boys who you probably wish would stay plants because that takes up far less space. You have a shop to run, who has time for this shit?<br/><br/><br/>Five plant boys and only a week to get to know them. Pick wisely, or else... I dunno, restart the game or get a walk-through or something. All boys are unique in that they follow different common tropes. We got the depressed one, the stupid one, the stuck up one, the patient one, and the gentleman one.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T03:16:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83a/83aa11d50bf2c27c570c6bfb32897e8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lazygout"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
