This was made for the second E1M1 game jam and is a little rough around the edges. I went for a cute theme with the environment because it was simple and it's not the typical backdrop for a shooter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The inspiration for the environment came from classic cartoony platformers and\u00a0Lovely Planet.</p><p>Uploaded a new version just to fix some bugs I found with certain bullets and triggers. Otherwise the game is identical to the first build.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T09:24:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8a/e8a4341200400257a63e8312dee4e182.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["WillReardon"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
