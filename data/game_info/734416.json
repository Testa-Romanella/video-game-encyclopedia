{"id": 734416, "slug": "advanced-settings", "name": "Advanced Settings", "name_original": "Advanced Settings", "description": "<p><strong><em>Made for Oculus Quest 2.</em></strong> Install via Oculus Developer Hub, or Sidequest.</p>\n<p>Due to time constraints and a major as-yet unfixable visual bug that was a gigantic time-suck, I wasn't able to accomplish a full escape room exactly, but I was able to produce a tiny proof of concept with some hopefully dark and moody atmosphere. There is a clear final state, so you'll know if you've completed it. I don't believe it will be difficult. Please let me know in the comments if you get stuck and I can give you a hint.\u00a0My intention was to put a lot more settings into the game, and have the user go back and forth between physical tasks and changing Settings to solve puzzles in clever and out-of-the-box ways. I just didn't have enough time during the jam period to implement this the way I wanted. Life happens.</p><p><strong>BONUS POINTS:</strong> If anybody can tell me why the heck the floor is black unless the head is turned a certain direction, that'd be great. I wasted HOURS on this problem and I'm not any closer to knowing how that is happening. It was not intended. I wanted a dark floor to use a flashlight with, and ended up with a nightmare unfixable bug.\u00a0How is it even possible!!!!? I've pulled all my hair out. I spent all the time I could trying to fix it. Way too much time.</p><p><strong>DISCLOSURES:</strong>\u00a0\u00a0I started the jam out\u00a0with a project that had\u00a0the VR controller I ended up with at the end of my last VR game jam (Valem's), which is a lightly modified VRIF controller. Here's a full list of the Unity assets I used or had in the project intending to use\u00a0(mostly editor tools):</p>\n<p><strong>Editor Tools: </strong>VRIF (BNG Framework),\u00a0EasyColliderEditor,\u00a0Ludiq Peek,\u00a0MMFeedbacks/MMTools by MoreMountains,\u00a0Sirenix Odin Inspector,\u00a0Pixelplacement Surge (for Tweening and State Machines),\u00a0Probuilder,\u00a0TextMesh Pro,\u00a0Fullscreen,\u00a0MaterialOverrides (from the Unity FPSSample)</p>\n<p><strong>Particle Effects: </strong>FX Fire Free (just a gag joke)</p>\n<p><strong>Outlines (not even sure which one I'm actually using):\u00a0</strong>AdultLink Rimlight,\u00a0HighlightPlus,\u00a0OutlineEffect by Jos\u00e9 Guerreiro,\u00a0QuickOutline by Chris Nolet</p>\n<p>I also used a few CC0 sounds from freesound.org; just a few CC0 meshes from TurboSquid and cgaxis.com. I also used quite a few sounds from the free Oculus Audio Pack.<br/></p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Although I'm disappointed at what little I was able to accomplish, it was only three days for the jam, and much of that was already occupied time for me. I always find I over-scope right from the beginning, then get sidetracked with something that doesn't even end up in the final build, then life happens and takes jam time away.\u00a0/end rant<br/></p><p><strong>SPOILERS BELOW:</strong></p><p><strong>SPOILERS BELOW:</strong></p><p><strong>SPOILERS BELOW:</strong></p><p><strong>SPOILERS BELOW:</strong></p><p><strong>SPOILERS BELOW:</strong></p><p><strong>HINTS IF YOU GET STUCK:</strong> If you're on the rolly-cube part, there is a target location to drive it to.
