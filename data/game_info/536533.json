Procedurally generates dreams based on a set of parameters displayed at the dream's outset\u2014CLARITY, TENSION, DRIVE, SOCIALITY, and TEMPO. Runs in a terminal, but may become a 3D game someday.

I'd like to add more, and to tag it in a more sophisticated way so that the dream matches the parameters more closely. The repetition does have kind of a neat aesthetic effect, though\u2014kind of like a dream breaking up. Something to keep in mind\u2026</li><li>I hoped to add a feature where certain words would be highlighted and you could enter them into a console to navigate through the dream, with the words you pick having an influence on the next round. I really like that two-way feedback loop in LSD, so I wanted to explore it here. There wasn't time, but if I come back to this that will be a core priority.</li><li>In the long run, it would be nice to give this sound and graphics which are also generated based on the parameters.</li></ul>\n<p>All that said, as an experiment, I'm quite pleased with this; I think it shows the promise I was hoping for.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T07:29:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb0/cb00b566e9491153806c7c08e7f650f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["spinnylights"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
