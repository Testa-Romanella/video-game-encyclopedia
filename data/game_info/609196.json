We thought of a few more mechanics that what you see in game, but in the end this is what we had time to make. We're proud of it anyway as we managed to give it a well-rounded finish, we think.</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing!</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<ul>\n<li>Made by <strong>Hyperfocused Games</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Art and other creative stuff</em> by <strong>Luu</strong> (Twitter)</li>\n<li><em>Code and other Godot stuff</em> by <strong>Dani</strong> (Twitter)</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>\n<em>Music</em> by <strong>Mandy.B.Blue</strong> (Twitter)</li>\n<li><em>\"Level Win\" Sound effect</em> from Freesound</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T06:50:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/472/472058c7a8e0c6af581d554abac9f821.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Daniel Escoz", "Hyperfocused Games", "Luullaby"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
