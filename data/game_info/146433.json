In future versions of the game this image will only be a short intro. </strong></p><p>On the Landing started out as a short story I wrote for a creative writing class. It was chiefly concerned with how an individual dealing with anxiety finds their anxiety magnified when faced with indecision. As it is a short story that is set at night, I recently began exploring indecision and anxiety as it is related to insomnia. The piece is somewhat personal (hence the female protagonist), as I am one of many students who struggle with anxiety, but I thought it would be worthwhile to attempt to create a metaphorical representation of what individuals that suffer from insomnia go through. </p><p>This is an early prototype that will be undergoing several iterations in the near future. It was created as a gameful storytelling project for SIPI (Stories in Play Initiative). </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e55/e5556a39b82151d7d940ecd7aa4ddfec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Stories in Play"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
