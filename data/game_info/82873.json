Chess pieces are hiding all over a chessboard, and you can click around to give yourself some clues. But don't get too many clues, as they cut into your points. See how many pieces you can find before time runs out. Also includes \"Zen\" mode for more relaxed no-time-limit play.<br/><br/>As an added bonus, you can test your brain on hexagonal chessboards with all-new rules on piece movement.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:49:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a8/4a8f8f5322e574e945ca4ac31579f15c_Ivwtp2C.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["The Code Zone"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["The Code Zone"], "esrb_rating": null}
