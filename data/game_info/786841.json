Think of it like a zen garden for your computer screen.\u00a0\u00a0You can't win or lose.\u00a0There is no goal other than relaxation.</p>\n<p>Start by choosing a randomly generated island. Then move and arrange the trees, flowers, rocks, and even the clouds to suit your mood.\u00a0I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>This is a prototype that I made a long time ago and for some reason never published it. I'm interested in your feedback. Please share your suggestions with me and if there's enough interest, this prototype might be made into a full real game. I\u00a0might even convert it to 3D so you can see your island from all angles and add fun surprises. It's up to you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T12:43:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/614/6142a811bc0b12e734dad6854db5fee2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["John Watson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
