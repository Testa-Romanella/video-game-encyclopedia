Besides that, floating in space dodging planets and asteroids, to land inside some hidden mazes (all that driving a ship that can't take any damage) gives to the player the challenging experience of travel inside the space fighting against... the space.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Some awesome features</strong>\n</p><ul>\n<li>21 stages with two parts: Travel and Land.</li>\n<li>A tutorial (you will need at least one friendly voice when you are alone into the void)</li>\n<li>Epic 8 bits soundtrack!</li>\n<li>Extremely frustrating challenges and infinite lives to revive each one of your failures as a cosmonaut!</li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tThis game was made for a international GameJam (\r\n\thttp://jams.gamejolt.io/gbjam3) where the rules are make games with technical and aesthetic limitations of a Game Boy (like the number of colors or screen resolution, for example) and, this is the polish version of the prototype including more levels and a tutorial.\r\n</p><p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bec/bec6fe81431ecb807e29ac0714c1b2bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vortex Game Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
