I implemented this making the Player play as a chicken surrounded by monsters. The Player must lay eggs and sacrifice them in order for the monsters to temporarily retreat.\u00a0</p><p>The limitation of the Jam was <strong>Failure is inevitable</strong>. This was implemented making the game theoretically \"endless\". Every random time a new monster is spawned (indicated by a howling sound), so it is actually impossible to not fail at some point.</p><p>The game was developed with <strong>Unity </strong>for the game development, <strong>Blender </strong>for the 3D modeling, unwrapping and animation and <strong>Gimp </strong>for texture creation. I also used <strong>Modbox </strong>3.2.2 for the sound effect of the monsters approaching and <strong>Audacity </strong>for recording and tuning of the rest of the audio effects.</p>\n<p>All assets have been developed exclusively for this Game Jam, but the font:</p><ul><li>TheyPerished.ttf</li></ul>\n<p>Please visit my website for more information about me:</p>\n<p>www.sergiogardella.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T07:07:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83e/83e8ba00cfe616ac024167c00582a3f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SergioGardella"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
