It's a platformer\u00a0based on rhythm\u00a0developed on JavaScript with phaser for a school project, at ETPA Toulouse.</p>\r\nMechanics\r\n<p>The main mechanic of the game is the inversion of gravity. You wil use it to collect flowers that will give you scoring.</p>\n<p>This mechanic as simple rules when you touch a platform\u00a0you can reverse gravity , this mechanic will evolve when you reach half of the game\u00a0so you can use gravity inversion whenever you want.</p>\n<p>The goal is to use this mechanic to reach the end of the level without touching the void or obstacles\u00a0</p>\r\nLevel Design &amp; Sound Design\r\n<p>The level design was one of the hardest struggle I encountered while developing the game. First I had to found a good music (special thanks to Manaberry), then trying to make the level design match with the music and still remaing interesting\u00a0to play wasn't easy. I've done all the level with <em>Tile</em></p>\r\nArt Direction\u00a0\r\n<p>The game takes place in a 12th century\u00a0fictitious japan where you incarnate a young ninja that doesn't want to fight anymore. I\u00a0decide to play with silhouette to do a strong contrast between plans and objectifs.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T03:16:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/079/079de9567d155f641f78ca0c43be88c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SonnyPetit"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
