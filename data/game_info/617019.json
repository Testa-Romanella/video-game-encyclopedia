For this, I need to give the BIGGEST shoutout to my friend pethecat (https://pethecat.itch.io/) go follow him. He came up with most of the code and some artwork. The game is unfinished with no sound and only one level because we were using Construct 3 and I forgot to save for like 3 hr and then Construct\u00a0 3 crashed and the file was invalid which happened at like 20 minutes until submission time. Anyways, please go follow pethecat.
