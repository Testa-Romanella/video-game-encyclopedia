It seems that everyone else is dead. Only one of the passengers, a young girl, somehow managed to stay alive.<br/>Both of you end up stranded on an uninhabited island. Now you can't do anything but sit on the shore and watch the endless ocean, so far from home... Or maybe your home is here now?<br/><br/> <br/>Grab the items that have been washed ashore - logs, leaves, stones etc. Better have it and not need it than need it and not have it!<br/><br/><br/>Combine collected items into something useful - an axe or a fishing rod. With enough materials you'll even be able to build a proper house!<br/><br/> <br/>Decorate the house, lay a fire, make the island cozy and comfortable.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c13/c135a6547acd8149def641759cad9b27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 10}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Joystick Knights"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Joystick Knights"], "esrb_rating": null}
