This is making things unseasonably cold in Gensokyo - it feels like winter! However, when the girls go to investigate, they discover that the hidden objective behind this tree&#39;s revival may threaten Gensokyo even more than the chill already in effect...</p>\n<p>Unique Gameplay Mechanics<br />\nCherry Points<br />\n<em> In this game, you can collect springtime energy, which is measured in Cherry Points.<br />\n</em> Killing enemies while unfocused will get you more Cherry Points than if you&#39;re focused, but you can also collect Cherry Point Items to make the process go faster.<br />\nSupernatural Border<br />\n<em> If your CP reaches +50,000, the collected energy activates a Supernatural Border.<br />\n</em> This border protects you from one hit until your Cherry value reaches 0 again; at that point, whether you ended up needing it or not, it disappears.<br />\n<em> If you take a hit with a border up, it will wipe out all onscreen bullets.<br />\n</em> If you don&#39;t take damage with your border up, you&#39;re awarded a sizable Border Bonus for managing to keep your border until its natural expiration.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2003-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-16T13:02:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/394/394eec295e45e7edc6a3d1d893478273.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
