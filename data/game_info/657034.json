We decided to flip the script a bit and make the player spread chaos. That led to the idea of having the player be a storm going around destroying things, so naturally we picked a tornado.</p>\n<p>In this game you will control a tornado and target houses to spread chaos and destruction. Pick up debris and trees to increase your size and power.</p>\n<p>Be warned! If you get too big you need much more power to move, but if you get too small, having too much power will make you lose control.<br/></p>\n<p>Get as many points as possible, and survive until the timer runs out.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Game Jam Team:<br/></p>\r\nLead\u00a0ProgrammerBoxfriendAssistant ProgrammerJulianDKArtistRedstonetech125SFXGallagher1819MusicMinidevil24DesignMightyKnightt\r\n<p>All assets were made by our team, with the exception of the Fonts used.</p>\n<p>* Joystix Font</p>\n<p>* Karma Font Family</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T01:39:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db9/db9a0e0afdbfdee04e5b572dfb40ad7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MightyKnightt", "Boxfriend", "JulianDK", "Gallagher1819", "Redstonetech125", "Minidevil24"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
