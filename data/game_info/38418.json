After that, they find themselves on Easter Island, where a Moai Head tells them about a prophecy. According to it, the Island is about to be destroyed by a volcano eruption. Now Sam and Max have to prevent the catastrophe and save the Island. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Like all the other entries in the series, Moai Better Blues is a point-and-click adventure with the heavy focus on story, characters, and humor, where the heroes have to explore the environments, solve various puzzles, interact with different characters and complete some minigames. Unlike most of the previous games, the events of this episode mostly occur on Easter Island and only a small part of the action happens in the Sam and Max\u2019s neighborhood. The puzzles may require possession of certain items, getting information from NPC characters or, occasionally, completing minigames such as a musical rhythm game or, a surfing challenge or a driving sequence.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2008-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T13:38:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f8/2f863c54b1e9fcefa88d9662c59aae15.jpg", "website": "http://www.telltalegames.com/samandmax/moaibetterblues", "rating": 3.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 49, "owned": 906, "beaten": 38, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 49, "suggestions_count": 290, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 49, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "iOS"], "developers": ["Telltale Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Telltale Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
