You have 3 minutes to score 300 points on 3 different levels, each providing more challenges as you progress making it more difficult to achieve your goal. The first level introduces the basic game mechanics with no obstacles to prevent you from scoring the 300 point goal, don't waste time though or the clock will run out. On the second level you will be chased by enemies who can kill you and on the third and final level you will be tested by even greater enemies who deal even more damage and are even bigger, although they aren't quite as smart which will give you the opportunity to escape when needed. Can you pass all 3 levels?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T02:43:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/036/036ee9979e0885415a1c0c54556dcb1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 241, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lucien"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Lucien"], "esrb_rating": null}
