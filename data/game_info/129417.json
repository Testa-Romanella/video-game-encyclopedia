One represents the outside world and contains six heads for you to try on. The other room has nothing in it but a mirror that tells the truth.\r\n\u00a0</p>\n<p>I wanted to experiment with the player character's perception of themselves, and I try to think of the character not as a whole, but as an ever-changing sum of influences. The \"dividual\" in the \"individual\". A first person game where the player cannot see their own legs plays very much like a dream. And just like in a dream you never know what you'd see in the mirror. I wanted to make a comforting game, a healing game. Not sure if it has worked out.</p>\r\n\r\n  Show Attribution\r\n<p>Low Poly Character Model by canyon_ke</p>\n<p>\"Dym\" (rus. \"steam') -  apocalyptic song by Umka I Bronevichok (rus. \"Umka And The Armored Car\")</p>\n<p>Dentist Drill sound effect by alexanderwendt</p>\n<p>Whisper Ambience by Piggimon</p>\n<p>Little Fire sound effect by Glaneur de sons</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f9/9f934e123b9b25231fecbda7f6cc0de9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Francis The Basilisk"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
