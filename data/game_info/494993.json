{"id": 494993, "slug": "the-harpy", "name": "The Harpy", "name_original": "The Harpy", "description": "<p>Bitter, haughty, wounded, and nihilistic. The Harpy is about feeling like everyone has more than you and being more wrathful than envious. If these people can\u2019t appreciate their luck, can\u2019t stop complaining about how bad their perfect lives are, it\u2019s time you showed them what real suffering was.</p>\n<p>The Harpy is a Skin of the person who wishes to drag others down with them. You know them in the modern days: Those vlogger reactionaries, those dramatic ticking time bombs, the kids on edge to start some shit with anyone around them. That doesn't mean you cannot ever gain friends or comrades, Rose Whip even encourages you to direct you anger at specific targets. You are just a creature of excess, giving in wholeheartedly to whatever you do.</p>\n<p>Pick up this Skin if you want to be the alpha jerk, the mean girl, the Heather of the group. While the Harpy was originally found in Skins for the Skinless by Topher Gerkey he has given Sawyer Rankin permission to put his own spin on those Skins. This Skin is for Monsterhearts 2.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T04:36:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e69/e6935c66d75e7a4e77950bee0da99d13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ferretheim Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
