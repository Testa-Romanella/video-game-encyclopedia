What happened prior is unknown, but you are certain this is not where you belong, so you try to make your escape!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Run, jump and explore in this 2D action platformer while you try to figure your way out of the lab. You can also choose to attack, but it's not neccessary in order to complete the demo. Also there's still bugs, but mostly just minor ones.<br/></p>\n<p>This is a short demo, I'd say the experience may last around 5-10 minutes if you don't take your time to explore, but the average time has not been tested properly yet.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried my best to make it worth your time though, so please enjoy!<br/><br/>Kind regards<br/>- Craziux</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T09:06:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f54/f54c051c7e1b25ac0d05827883ed9ded.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Craziux"], "genres": ["RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
