And now he plans on destroying everyone else's planet too and becoming the most powerful entity in the universe.</p>\r\nHow to play -\r\n<p>The only way he can become hella powerful is by eating everything he sees. By eating asteroids and later, planets, he can get bigger and more powerful. Click 'E' when you come across an asteroid to eat it.<br/>But, beware of the suicide bombers! they can be seen sitting on big asteroids with the sole intention of blowing up everything that moves! To beat them, you can either use your laser by clicking 'R' or you can cheat your way out which will be talked about in the next section. Now, make sure you get big enough before you approach a planet because as soon as you get near it, they will sound the alarm and their space force will be deployed to beat you up. In this version of the game, you will come across three planets, each stronger than the one before, and if you take damage, you shrink, so be careful not to shrink too much otherwise you'll obviously die.</p>\r\nCheat! -- \r\n<p>Now here's how you cheat the game! You, the player, have the ability to pause the game at any time move anything to anywhere! Press 'C' to pause the game and try dragging things around. If you find a position for an object you're comfortable with, click 'V' to continue. Try using this to your advantage when you're in a tricky situation and it might as well come in handy.</p>\r\nControls -\r\n<p>Move - Left-clicking will make the octopus move towards the position of the mouse, kinda like click and drag, but better.<br/>Eat - E<br/>Attack - R<br/>Pause (Activate cheat) - C<br/>Play (Continue) - V</p>\r\nNOTE: Play this game in fullscreen for the best experience.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T03:38:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf4/bf484acf8d26853617656e410f9f0810.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Aditya"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
