This will help you if you want to play from different browser or if local save is damaged. Local save also will not work after new version is published.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>How to get online id and start saving online:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>1. click online button, fill in your wizard data and click \"so be it\"\r\n2. click save\r\n3. click online button again - you will see your id. write down your id.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>How to import online data:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>1. click \"import from online\"\r\n2. fill your online id and click import\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>What if you started playing earlier and do not have online id?\r\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Write me a message with your wizard name (at heeejhou@gmail.com) and i will send you your id.</p>\n<p><strong>Why can be saves broken?</strong></p>\n<p>This happens when new version of game is uploaded. I understand there are mechanisms in itch.io which \"disconnect\" your local browser save from the game, because new version is treated as a different game (simply said, im also not fully sure:D). Should this happen, please use online import.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T10:58:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c5/2c5fe17018b0f31891b496bf5a360faa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["opwis"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
