{"id": 866196, "slug": "mono-warp", "name": "Mono Warp", "name_original": "Mono Warp", "description": "<p>This game is a\u00a0second-generation style shoot em up with scrolling levels and a boss at the end of each level. The game is rather short. It has a total of 3 levels and can be beaten in little more than 10 minutes. That is, if you can beat it. The game is brutally hard, and even in Easy-Difficulty it is still a solid challenge. The game was created using L\u00f6ve version 9.0.</p>\n<p>The controls are as following:<br/><br/>Keyboard: \"z\" or \"y\" to fire, directional buttons to move, \"p\" to pause<br/>the game<br/><br/>Mouse: left mousebutton down to fire, right mousebutton down to make<br/>your spaceship follow the mousepointer - it's best to keep the<br/>right mousebutton pressed, so you can drag your spaceship around<br/><br/>Gamepad: \"a\",\"b\",\"x\" or \"y\" to fire, Dpad to move your spaceship,<br/>\"start\" to pause the game - (some gamepads may not be supported, but the game should work with most gamepads)</p>\n<p>All inputs work simultaneously. Note that you can also use each input method to select a difficulty on the title screen. With the mouse, you simply move the mouse cursor over the difficulty setting you wish to select, with the other controls press up and down to select your difficulty. Then you press fire to start the game.</p>\n<p>If you use a gamepad, the gamepad has to be connected to your computer before you start the .exe file. If you connect your gamepad later, it will not be recognized by the game.<br/><br/>More info about the game can be found in the readme.txt that comes with the download.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T13:45:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/162/162f26fc131af183b17bfdd3a410a5dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rastashmup"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
