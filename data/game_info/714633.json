Delve through one level of a dungeon, collect items, fight enemies, and vanquish the evil within. If you die, Chronos, the \u201cSword of Time\u201d, will bring you back in time to fight again.</p>\n<p>This is a proof of concept that mixes Zelda 1 style dungeons and roguelike perma-death. More work may continue on the project in the future.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T04:15:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5c/d5c8d378f88f8ae1a41adbcf4e763c2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Khaeven04"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
