{"id": 736235, "slug": "air-gallet", "name": "Air Gallet", "name_original": "Air Gallet", "description": "<p>Air Gallet is a 1996 vertical-scrolling shooter arcade game published by Banpresto. Players control a fighter jet through six level to destroy a terrorist organization, who are destroying major worldwide cities and brainwashing the world&#39;s population with propaganda. Its gameplay involves destroying waves of enemies, picking up power-ups and new weapons, and destroying bosses.</p>\n<p>Air Gallet was developed by Gazelle, an off-shoot of defunct developer Toaplan. It was directed by Tatsuya Uemura and designed by Junya Inoue, who wanted it to have a more boisterous presentation compared to his previous works. Gazelle&#39;s financial difficulties and strict time schedules forced its development to be hastily rushed. The game was released to mixed reviews; while its graphics and sprite layering techniques were praised, critics felt that it wasn&#39;t as polished or innovative as other, similar games were. Inoue has since expressed his disappointment in its quality.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-09T01:58:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/655/655f1dfbbee4a28e8f77b01cf259a0bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Gazelle"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": ["Banpresto"], "esrb_rating": null}
