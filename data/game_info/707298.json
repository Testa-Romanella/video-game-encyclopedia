Through experimenting &amp; pushing the limits of technology the goal was to open worm holes for faster exploration and exploitation of the universe. When the first attempt was made, an unstable worm hole was opened but not to anywhere in this known universe.. the wormhole released a temporal signal that caused the inhabitants of earth to almost instantly undergo some kind of demonic transformation. Earth was overwhelmed from within days.<br/><strong><h3>INSPIRATION</h3></strong><br/>The inspiration behind SYNDER would be such titles as the new DOOM games with a bit of Left 4 Dead to name some of the main ones. With this project I wanted to make a solid story driven FPS with some arcade mechanics to add to the experience. The story will take you through multiple hostile ares as you push through SYNCity gathering what you can along the way...<br/><br/><strong><h3>FEATURES</h3></strong><br/>FPS Survival<br/>Horde Mode<br/>Fully Voiced Story <br/>Large variety of enemy type <br/>Large variety of weapons <br/>Collectables[/u][/b]<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T03:05:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71a/71ae6c9d9da62a2dfa199039964f4a1c.jpg", "website": "https://supertype.ca/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 219, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["[SuperType]"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["[SuperType]"], "esrb_rating": null}
