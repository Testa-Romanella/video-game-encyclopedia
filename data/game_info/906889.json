The gameplay takes place in two locations (for now) in the future more locations will be finalized, each pair of locations symbolizes a certain country and its cuisine. The game is built on luck (boxes appear in one part of the location and food or coins fall out of them, but do not forget that each box has its own price and there is no guarantee that it will pay off, so be careful) The gameplay is described in detail in the game itself. I look forward to your ratings in the comments and good luck !!!!!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T12:38:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/479/479f6aaeb3b4fda14aa1afbb064ac91a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SpotGame"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
