Thank you, Iziminza \u2764\ufe0f<strong> I would like to correct i</strong>t:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>\"In the Gambling -&gt; Even &amp; Odd screen, you cannot change the amount you bet.\"</strong>\u00a0-&gt;\u00a0This mini-game will generate a random number less than or equal to the amount you have, and you will have to guess whether the random number is even or odd. If you guess correctly, your money will increase by that random number, if wrong, you lose money.\r\n</li><li><strong>\"In the Gambling menu, the two bottom entries do not work.\"</strong>\u00a0-&gt; These two mini-games are coming soon in the next version.\r\n</li><li><strong>\"If you want to buy fruit and enter 300$ into the unlabelled box, you have 0300$ apples and cannot sell any.\"</strong>\u00a0-&gt;\u00a0This is really a bug. But the text box in this section does not accept the amount of money, it\u00a0only accepts the number of fruits you want to buy. And you can only enter numbers in the text box, not the '$' character.\r\n</li><li><strong>\"The silly buyers often want to buy huge amounts of fruit that you cannot afford to buy or have.\"</strong>\u00a0-&gt; So you have to play mini-games to earn money and get enough fruit to sell to the Buyer.\r\n</li><li><strong>\"If you restart the game, the interest rate stays the same, so you can spend all your money to move it up and then restart. Repeat this to get arbitrarily large interest rates.\"\u00a0\u00a0</strong>-&gt; This is a bug.\r\n</li><li><strong>\"If you restart the game while on the bank screen, only parts of it are removed.\" </strong>-&gt; This is a bug.<br/>\n</li><li><strong>\"When you sell fruit, they do not disappear.\"\u00a0</strong>-&gt; This is a bug.</li></ul>\n<p>I will fix them in the next update \u2606*: .\uff61. o(\u2267\u25bd\u2266)o .\uff61.:*\u2606</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T10:47:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1b/f1b3d6faeb5b4ba497e03c47f062c28c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DottyGame"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
