Chambers. After finishing the wonderful SIGNALIS by\u00a0\u00a0rose-engine, I felt inspired to write a piece of music with a narrative based around TKIY, specifically Carcosa. This quickly turned into a video project and finally an interactive version based on the system I'm creating for a similar, more long-form project. Feel free to experience this in any way you like;\u00a0you can swim around as much as you want or just as little as necessary in order to not go under, while taking in music, words and visuals.</p>\n<p>Headphones and dimmed lights\u00a0recommended.</p>\n<p><strong>Audio</strong>\u00a0available on my\u00a0Bandcamp\u00a0page.</p>\n<p><strong>Non-interactive video version</strong>\u00a0available on Vimeo.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Swim\u00a0\u2013 WASD</p>\n<p>Menu<strong> \u2013\u00a0</strong>ESC<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Disk space requirements</strong></p>\n<p>Due to Lost Carcosa utilising heavily compressible video content in the game, the download size at ~100MB differs from an actual ~800MB in required space after decompressing.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Hardware requirements</strong></p>\n<p>The wave simulation in Lost Carcosa is quite demanding. If you are running into performance issues, choose \"Low Quality\" from the Menu (ESC). Please note that this reduces graphical fidelity and the intended aesthetic\u00a0severely and it may be preferable\u00a0to choose the\u00a0non-interactive video version instead.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T15:22:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f04/f04dd5a6a87670323bb18a225d17de7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Markus Koepke"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
