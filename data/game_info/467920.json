The Atari 2600 version of\u00a0 Space Invaders was a classic in itself . Not arcade-perfect due to the limitations of the machine, but great in it's own right, due mainly to the many\u00a0 game variations on offer.<br/></p>\n<p>This remake of the 2600 version includes all variations from the original - moving shelters, zig-zagging bullets, invisible invaders and two player co-op - and adds more. Eight different graphic styles are yours to try, such as a perfect recreation of the original, a homage to the arcade version, ZX Spectrum style\u00a0 and pen-and-paper among others.</p>\n<p>Having been very well received\u00a0 in Atari social media groups this version is now available here. If you've not played the VCS version before it's a must have. If you 're a 2600 veteran this will be the perfect stroll down memory lane.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T18:13:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/537/53794fbdcc58a9b11a17452926c7f88b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Langford Productions"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
