You have 90 seconds to complete 1 level. This level contains enemies and a boss at the end.</p>\n<p>Theme: Less is More: In order to fit in with the theme, the\u00a0 idea\u00a0 is that\u00a0 this 1 stage (less stages) can be played many times to complete (more time). Originally, I was gonna have it so the\u00a0 less health\u00a0 you have, the more\u00a0 damage you deal, but\u00a0 I wasn't\u00a0 able to figure it out in time.</p>\n<p>Pathfinding: A* Pathfinding</p><p>Font: DaggerSquare</p>\n<p>Any constructive criticism is encouraged as I only started (properly\u00a0 at least) GameDev at the beginning of this year.
