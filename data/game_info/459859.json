{"id": 459859, "slug": "alien-buffet", "name": "Alien Buffet", "name_original": "Alien Buffet", "description": "<p>You are an alien trying to blend in at a human buffet. You are passed potential food items one at a time, and you can choose whether or not to eat them. Different items will have different effects on you.</p>\n<p>Hit Left or A to Eat.</p>\n<p>Hit Right or D to spare.</p>\n<p>Get all six endings! Or don't.</p>\n\n<p>Made by Walter Verburg, Wolf Beck, Colleen Walsh, and Ziggy Stardust(no relation) for Ludum Dare 34: Two Button Controls OR Growing. We all had a great deal of fun making this, and we hope you get a few smiles out of playing it.<br/></p>\n\n<p>As a final note, a lot of people have said that a timer would make the game better, and that you should be able to click on the buttons. I myself thought that a timer would make the game better and that you should be able to click on the buttons, so I implemented those features after the original jam was over.</p>\n<p>We were all wrong, the timer doesn't feel right, and the mouse clicking is too slow. I think that part of the fun of the game is accidentally eating something stupid/horrifying without having any reason to even do so. I learned a lesson from, and now, you've learned that lesson too.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T04:25:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f1/4f1c9394a34c46db322377c2a17edb83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mister Walter"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
