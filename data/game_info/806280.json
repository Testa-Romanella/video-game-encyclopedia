The climate catastrophe has happened: Humankind had to move underground. The bots have taken control: They manage all aspects of life and boss the humans around. The few remaining human rebels don't have a chance.</p>\n<p>Ian has collaborated with the bots. At first, this had paid off handsomely. But then something bad happened, and now Ian finds himself a fugitive. So far, he has only been able to evade the bots by a hair's breadth. He is literally out there pantless: That's where this chapter begins.</p>\n<p>Ian is trapped and cornered on a \"park deck\" by a watering bot. He needs your help. Get him out of there!</p>\n<p>The game has standard BASS controls (left-click for interacting with things; right-click for examining things).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T21:42:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e3/9e32e1936202de3132af66fa43a706db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Peter G.
