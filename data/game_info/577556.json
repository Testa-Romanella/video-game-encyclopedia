Try not to crash into a building because then you lose momentum and the plane kinda just does weird shit when its got no momentum.<br/></p>\n<p>The only real controls to the game are the mouse you just look around to direct the plane. Pressing Escape will pause and then holding it down will quit the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T09:39:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae0/ae04c5d6f9ba86b22a6ae8b6b8cb729d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Fraser Brumley"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
