{"id": 963033, "slug": "breezy-2", "name": "Breezy", "name_original": "Breezy", "description": "In most normal golf games, you control where you hit the ball, and the wind is decided for you. Breezy flips this concept on its head to create an inventive precision platformer like nothing you've played before.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Controlling the wind means you can also control boats and even UFOs with the ease of tilting an analog stick. Breezy takes advantage of this in its over 120 unique holes. The 4 unlockable bonus characters change up the gameplay even further, especially when you combine them with the wacky random modifiers in the Remix Rush side mode.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Breezy holds a wealth of Golden Tees in hidden or hard-to-reach places. They're a test of skill, creativity, and strategy, and each one rewards you with a new character, course, or song. Oh, did I mention that Breezy has a jammin' retro-style soundtrack? <br/><br/><br/><br/>Inspired by the great platformers of the past decades, Breezy has surprises around every corner while still emphasizing and riffing on its core gameplay every step of the way. Breezy is not a long game, but it's super replayable with even more content to come in the future.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-03T02:57:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbf/fbf45465e62c0186b1d940835b120e89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mondobe"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mondobe"], "esrb_rating": null}
