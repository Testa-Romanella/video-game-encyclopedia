More of his stuff here:\u00a0https://renmine2.newgrounds.com/</p>\n<p>Might contain some bugs and lack in some features.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Originally the game was supposed to be longer</strong>, and the player would have had to gather more than 2 separate body parts, but we sort of ran out of time, and decided to just merge hands and legs/body. This also sort of\u00a0 makes the game title \"Fix Me\", incorrect,\u00a0 as there is just 2 different body parts, eyes and rest of the body.\u00a0<strong>However, we have plans to complete this game</strong>/make a second part for it, as this is just a submission for a Game Jam, so stay tuned!</p>\n\n<p>The game was intended to have more features, but the time limit came in too fast.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The game doesn't have any tutorial. It uses <strong>A</strong> and <strong>D</strong> for movement (left and right)\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>spacebar</strong> for jumping. You are supposed to get to the other side of the map, where you are at. There is also no end for the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T22:37:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b87/b8719833361965952cbfdb3f967b1896.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nwodtleM", "L-Slime"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
