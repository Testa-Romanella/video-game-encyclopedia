We are a small and passionate team, focused on creating high-quality video games across all platforms. And the reason why Legend Of Orion Adventure looks so awesome is our character art work was done by Li Kovacs!</p>\r\nDemo Reaction GameOn Expo 2019\r\n\r\nWhy Kickstarter?\r\n<p>The music, character models, Switch development kits, marketing, and the time we need for this project are all just out of reach, hampered by one dream-crushing reality: it\u2019s expensive. Help us meet our goal to create our very first console game, which we hope is the stepping-stone to our dream of working full-time to make even more fantastic games.<br/> To help support our kickstarter please find our page click here: Legend Of Orion: Adventure</p>\r\nRisks and Challenges\r\n<p>The amount we chose for this project is an almost exact estimation of the cost it would take to fund our small dev team to complete the project in 6 months. This is after you factor in taxes, unity pro cost, the cost of producing the various rewards and their shipping cost, and Kickstarter/Nintendo\u2019s take. These cost are based on the bare minimum each team member needs to cover their living expenses, a small budget for equipment upgrades/repairs, software cost(those creative cloud accounts can add up), travel expenses(gas) for team meetings, and web hosting expenses. A percentage of the funding will also be set aside to cover unforeseen factors such as issues with reward distributors/producers, shipping complications and charge backs to name a few.</p>\n<p>Even with out the funding we will still be able to produce the game, but at a much, much slower pace due to us having to work multiple jobs to cover living expenses.</p>\n<p>Sign Up For Our Weekly Updates Here</p>\r\nKeyboard Controls\r\nBuilder\r\n<ul><li><strong>W A S D \u2013</strong>\u00a0Movement</li><li><strong>Arrow Keys \u2013</strong>\u00a0Navigate Menu</li><li><strong>E \u2013</strong>\u00a0Action button</li><li><strong>Q R \u2013</strong>\u00a0Rotate Prop</li><li><strong>Z X \u2013</strong>\u00a0Zoom In/Out</li><li><strong>Return/Enter \u2013</strong>\u00a0Select Prop</li><li><strong>Backspace \u2013</strong>\u00a0Delete</li></ul>\r\nCombat\r\n<ul><li><strong>W A S D \u2013</strong>\u00a0Movement</li><li><strong>E \u2013</strong>\u00a0Action button</li><li><strong>Left Arrow \u2013</strong>\u00a0Attack</li><li><strong>Esc \u2013</strong>\u00a0Return to Builder</li></ul>\r\nGamecube Controller Controls\r\nBuilder\r\n<ul><li><strong>Joy Stick\u00a0 \u2013</strong>\u00a0Movement</li><li><strong>C Stick \u2013</strong>\u00a0Navigate Menu</li><li><strong>A \u2013</strong>\u00a0Action button</li><li><strong>ZL ZR \u2013</strong>\u00a0Rotate Prop</li><li><strong>X Y \u2013</strong>\u00a0Zoom In/Out</li><li><strong>+ \u2013</strong>\u00a0Select Prop</li><li><strong>\u2013\u00a0 \u2013</strong>\u00a0Delete</li></ul>\r\nCombat\r\n<ul><li><strong>Joy Stick \u2013</strong>\u00a0Movement</li><li><strong>A \u2013</strong>\u00a0Action button / Attack</li><li><strong>B \u2013</strong>\u00a0Return to Builder</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T07:42:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9b/f9be08b4f067d54996013b713674fa65.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StudioNoir"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
