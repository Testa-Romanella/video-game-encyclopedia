We want you to feel like a force of nature, to rain destruction on the landscape around you as you see fit. Many wondrous and bizarre creatures have been designed, both friendly and dangerous, each with their own unique personalities and behaviours.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis version of the game contains three fast-paced minigames: Cow Drop, Burning Spree and Time Trials.<br/>\r\nIn the future we hope to add a full storyline and quests.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T02:44:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67a/67a3a7491be7a523ff08af2d43bcb52d.jpg", "website": "http://www.spillagegames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spillage Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Spillage Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
