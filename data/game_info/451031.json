However, you are constantly being sabotaged by your shadow form, who tries to destroy the orb when you rest.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>_____________________________________</p>\n<p>Collect resources and craft defences to keep out the enemies. However, be careful not to make the defences too difficult, as on alternate rounds you must get past your own defences and destroy the orb. You can shoot and destroy your own turrets, but be careful not to make your defences too weak!</p>\n<p>____________________________________</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Esc - Pause game</p>\n<p><em>Defence Mode</em></p>\n<p>E - Toggle craft and place mode</p>\n<p>Scroll Wheel - Select item to place</p>\n<p>Left Click - craft item/place item</p>\n<p><em>Attack Mode</em>\n</p>\n<p>Left Click - Shoot</p>\n<p>____________________________________</p>\n<p>Made by Team Hacktic in three days for Benbonk Game Jam #1</p>\n<p>Source code:\u00a0https://github.com/matthew-bvrn/Trust-No-One-Not-Even-Yourself</p>\n<p>If you enjoy this game and would like to see us expand it, or you find the source code helpful, please consider donating.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T05:19:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a5/3a5d8dcb4c3dd020222477443fd1c5a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hacktic"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
