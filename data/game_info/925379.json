Consider donating if you can as this takes lots of time to develop ;) &lt;3<br/></p>\n<p>In this demo you are able to choose your team across <strong>12 different monsters</strong>, each monster has it's <strong>official statistics</strong> but as of for now, the moves are randomly assigned.</p>\n<p>I made a system that enables you to <strong>assemble a move</strong> by disassembling it into \"<strong>blocks</strong>\", stacking more blocks gives more effects, such as damage, status, recoil, heal and etc.. giving you the ability to create custom ones.</p>\n\r\n\r\n  CLICK\u00a0ME\u00a0TO\u00a0TAKE\u00a0A\u00a0LOOK\r\n  <p>\n</p><br/>\n<br/><br/>These are 2 moves assembled with blocks, each is customizable and serialized inside unity, giving you the flexibility and ease of use.<br/>\n\n<p>In the end i would like to be able to recreate it entirely, but it's still a long way to come. I am also working on the over-wold and the ability to have monsters encounters so stay tuned for other updates!<br/></p>\n<p>As of for now this demo features:</p>\n<ol><li>Team choice</li><li>Standard battle, along with moves, statuses and the ability to swap monsters</li><li>18 Official moves, with all their effects</li><li>12 monsters</li><li>Camera system and dedicated particle system</li><li>Official stats, along with the ability to increase or decrease the stats in game.</li></ol>\n<p>The next steps will include:</p>\n<ul><li>Adding other missing move blocks</li><li>Bag and Items</li><li>A custom editor to edit a monster</li><li>Simple over-world (for starters)</li><li>Encounters</li></ul>\n<p>I will update this as much as i can, so please stay tuned!</p>\n\n<p><em>This app is not affiliated, endorsed or supported by Nintendo in any way, also some images used in this app are copyrighted and supported under fair use, Pokemon and Pokemon character names are trademark of Nintendo, no copyright infringement intended.
