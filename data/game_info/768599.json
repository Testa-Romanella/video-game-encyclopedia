This might be a tough mission for a new recruit like you, but I see a lot of potential. Watch out for the variety of enemies and the fearsome final boss, after all it's the main reason why you're on this mission. Before you begin, I'll give you one last word of advice. If you take out the colorful enemies, you can increase the health of your chopper and the power of your gun.\u00a0 Some enemies may even drop some extra armor...and if you're really lucky rumor has it that you may even be able to become invincible.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Movement - W/A/S/D or Arrow Keys</p>\n<p>Pause - Esc</p>\n<p>Helicopter will shoot automatically</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong><br/>Variety of Filebase Assets - GameDevHQ</p>\n<p>Epic trailer action music by humanoide9000</p>\n<p>Intense Dark Action Orchestra by DeVern<br/></p>\n<p>desert_eagle.wav by seanmorrissey96<br/></p>\n<p>AR15 rifle shot by michorvath<br/></p>\n<p>308_rifle_01.wav by gezortenplotz<br/></p>\n<p>Sniper Rifle Firing (3) by FilmmakersManual<br/></p>\n<p>Sniper Rifle Firing (2) by FilmmakersManual<br/></p>\n<p>Collision 3 by JustInvoke<br/></p>\n<p>Explosion 1 by magnuswaker<br/></p>\n<p>Bouncing Power Up 1_5 by Joao_Janz<br/></p>\n<p>Machine Gun 002 - single shot.ogg by pgi<br/></p>\n<p>[Drums] house snare (slight intro-reverse) by waveplaySFX<br/></p>\n<p>Missile / Rocket firing by wubitog<br/></p>\n<p>Stuka01.mp3 by Sphyrna<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T07:48:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ba/2baa57430e7a5bb4342c51bf8e6f3016.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CodeTalker"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
