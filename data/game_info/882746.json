I was originally making it for the Vim Jam 3 game jam, but I ran out of time. Still, I wanted to finish what I had, and I'm proud of the results! There is no sound or music, but I might add that in a later patch. For now I'm just glad I got to make a game I can call my own! Anyways, allow me to summarize\u00a0the\u00a0game\u00a0and its controls. </p>\n<p><strong>Monster Stew!</strong></p>\n<p>Play as a goblin chef who must defeat an evil flying pot and its turnip minions! To do this you must use your trusty Cooker 3000 and shoot fireballs at the pot until its villainous meal has been cooked to perfection! Be careful of the pot's own fireballs however, and watch out for when the turnip terrors sprout up from the ground.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>A - Move left</p>\n<p>D - Move right<br/></p>\n<p>W - Aim up</p>\n<p>K - Shoot</p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n<p>Enter - Restart (Can only be done when you have lost or won)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T19:56:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ef/5efddfdc1f404d0778969db2c0fb0111.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["TexasArtToast"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
