It features an ingame map editor. The game is quite simple and was sort of rushed due to work but you can walk around and stuff.</p>\n<p>The Level Editor is not the best but it does the job, just remember to make sure there is free space in the middle area, cause the player always spawn there. You can save your level code and share it with your friends, or just keep it around to edit it later. atm if you want to launch a custom map you need to go back to the mainmenu and go to custom mode to load it.</p>\n<p>Some part of the configuration are a bit broken and the menu does not fully support gamepad controllers, but it does ingame.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T06:08:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f59/f591b864f09c6ed69a20cb33a1a0030f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["soart"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
