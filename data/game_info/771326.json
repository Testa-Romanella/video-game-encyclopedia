On his quest to find the Sacred Drops, he must first conquer four unique biomes that have turned mad from \u201cdry-eye-syndrome\u201d. In these biomes, plant, and animal life attempt to stop Quincy from stealing the Sacred Drops. Their source of aggression is unknown, however, Quincy must conquer those who stand in his way regardless if they\u2019re potted plants or turtles.
