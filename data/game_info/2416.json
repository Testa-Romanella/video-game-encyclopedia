And also something more.</p>\n<p>The game has four modes.</p>\n<h3>THE ARCADE</h3>\n<p>A crazy race in which every movement matters - reflexes work here. You can compete with yourself by running a double - your own best achievement. Success in this mode is the key to other modes, but not only. There are enough other surprises in the game.</p>\n<h3>THE NOSTALGIA</h3>\n<p>This mode is a &quot;Snake&quot; game, but with a few unexpected twists and turns. 70 levels that cause not only nostalgia (and they very convincingly cause it!), But also a strong interest.</p>\n<h3>THE LABORATORY</h3>\n<p>100 puzzles that can be solved for any length of time. The result of the solution is assessed higher or lower, depending on the number of moves required for the solution.</p>\n<h3>THE ARENA</h3>\n<p>This is not a race or a puzzle, it&#39;s a fight. We need to collect ammunition, and then throw it into rivals, lay mines and take into account the ghosts of dead enemies.</p>\n<p>In the game there are both single mode and multiplayer.</p>", "metacritic": 77, "released": "2014-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-09T14:59:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cc/4cc3adec03897d376924497b340745eb.jpg", "website": "http://www.pastagames.com/pix-the-cat/", "rating": 2.63, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 45, "owned": 967, "beaten": 10, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 50, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 51, "ratings_count": 92, "suggestions_count": 309, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 92, "platforms": ["PS Vita", "PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One", "Linux", "PC", "Android", "macOS"], "developers": ["NVIDIA Lightspeed Studios", "Playdigious", "Pastagames"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Focus Home Interactive", "Playdigious", "Neko Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
