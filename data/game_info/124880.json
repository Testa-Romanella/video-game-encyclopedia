It's meant to be different than most horror games that scare you with jump-scares. Instead of scaring you with a loud noise and something jumping in front of you, it scares you with a few different things.</p>\n<p>It uses common fears like, the ocean, darkness, claustrophobia, arachnophobia, and isolation to combine into what I think is a terrifying game.</p>\n<p>You are in a small group of survivors but the can only talk to you with your earpiece. You have to listen to them and try to escape before all of you are killed.</p>\n<p>The game is in the pre-alpha right now so don't expect everything to be the same, I'm planing on adding a lot more like fixing some audio, adding more to the game, and improving some graphics. The cover art for the games is going to be changed that was just quickly made so I could upload this.</p>\n<p>There is a new build coming soon that ads a lot of new features and a new submarine for you to avoid death.</p>\n<p>I'm sorry that the game isn't as good as a lot of other games, I have no money to make the game with and I'm the only developer except for one person that agreed to do voice acting on Reddit. Despite that I still think its a good game and it will be even better when I finish it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fa/4fa98b921d6ac59bd12f3e46265f592f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Kingderpy101"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
