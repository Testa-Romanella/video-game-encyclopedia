We wanted to touch the essence of what makes a puzzle hard, try to tease players' brain with levels that encourage intentional problem solving and do all of that with a simple set of rules.<br/><br/>If you find some levels difficult, tell yourself that our dear AI-solver-assistant sometimes required several seconds to find a solution! We're only just humans after all...<br/><br/>Anyways, have fun and tell us what you thought of the game!<br/><br/>- Crafty Weazel -", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T02:04:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8af/8af0f3c5500be8ff19e3561ae15f03f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Crafty Weazel"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Crafty Weazel"], "esrb_rating": null}
