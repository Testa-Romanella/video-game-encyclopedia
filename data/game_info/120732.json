{"id": 120732, "slug": "starblast-alpha", "name": "Starblast Alpha", "name_original": "Starblast Alpha", "description": "<p><em><strong>Starblast Alpha</strong></em>\u00a0<em><strong>is a 2-D classic arcade video game combining both ping-pong and 2-D shoot \u2019em ups.</strong></em>\u00a0Inspired by well-known titles such as\u00a0<em>Pong\u00a0</em>and\u00a0<em>Galaga</em>, it is primarily based on old-style graphics and gameplay and was developed based on NES graphical and audio limitations (for the most part). Not much else to say on the game other than it's a product of an idea I conjured up one day.<br/></p>\n<p>(spoilers: it's already out.)</p>\r\n- STORY -\r\n<p>What story? It's an arcade game.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n- GAMEPLAY -\r\n<p>You're given a space ship come built-in with a force field and a laser blaster. Your mission is to take down the enemy by any means necessary, either by shooting explosives or using the various power-ups provided, such as the Golden Bullet or the Trishot, shooting your way to victory! The two of you must balance a ball while soaring through the rapids of space. Miss the ball, loose the bullets. That simple. Don't worry, you can protect yourself!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n- WHO'S BEHIND ALL THIS? -\r\n<p>\u00a0<strong>Deaven Binion (CardinalCoder64)</strong>\u00a0is the creator, programmer, composer, and artist of the game. He's been programming games for a couple years now, but this is his first official game release. He doesn't like pineapples on pizza but likes 80's classic rock. Expect new titles to be announced from him in the future...</p>\n\r\n- SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS -\r\n<p>- Windows 7 or higher<br/>- 1.2 GHz processor or higher<br/>- 1 GB RAM or higher<br/>- Integrated Graphics or higher<br/>- If you're seeing this, you can probably run this game.</p>\n\r\n- COMPATIBILITY -\r\n<p>- Windows PCs only*<br/>- Joystick/controller compatible<br/><br/>*Ports for Mac, Linux, and possibly Android and iOS will be coming soon.</p>\n\r\n- CONTACT -\r\n<p>If you have any questions, comments, concerns, judgements, death threats, or anything else of that nature, please leave me an e-mail via <strong><em>cardinalcoder64@gmail.com</em></strong>.
