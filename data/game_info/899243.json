The tyrannical Angelic Generals are dethroned, and the galaxy-wide networks of sorceries that trapped souls within their net have been removed. A united humanity, armed with the gnosis of their own self-divinity, claimed heaven through violence, and have banished mortality forever.</em></p>\n<p><em>Some heralded the end of the Tyranny of Heaven as something of a grand finale for humanity. The reclamation of their gnosis, the liberation of their afterlife, and the global collective community seemed to them the culmination of humanity's destiny. After all, when you\u2019ve slain God, what\u2019s left?\r\n</em></p>\n<p><em>Hell.</em>\n</p>\n\n<p>HELLPIERCERS is an upcoming tactical tabletop roleplaying game developed and designed by Sandy Pug Games. We are launching a crowdfunder in early 2023. This is our early preview doc designed to give you an understanding of the systems and ideas that make up the game.\u00a0 It includes our unique swarm mechanics, the implications of our base building and character development options, and a taste of our demon faction system. Hopefully this gives you a good impression of what we're working on!</p>\n<p><strong>If you like what you see here, make sure to follow the project on Kickstarter!\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>This document does not represent the final version of HELLPIERCERS, and may be unbalanced, broken, and unplayable depending on how you define those three things. Certain mechanics are not fully fleshed out, and the vast majority of player options and advanced systems have been pruned, or have not yet been developed. The document also lacks a great deal of the lore and story we hope to build into the game. It's largely unedited, so expect typos and errors.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T12:25:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f2/8f2ba131aabc7e17f1e8c535f7f833c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sandy Pug Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
