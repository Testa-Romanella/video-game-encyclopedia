The \u00a0player must explore their surroundings, in hope of rescue.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Their only connection to the outside world is a one way radio issuing\u00a0 instruction and the periscope overlooking a war torn city. Can you survive? or is your fate already decided.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Using VR controls you can explore your surroundings which is a replica of a Sherman tank, you can pick up objects, teleport between the commander's and driver's positions. Immerse\u00a0yourself in this small world and see the last moments of a young soldiers life through the narrative events both inside the tanks and through the periscope looking out onto a war torn city street.</p>\n<p>This project was created as part of a second year university brief at the\u00a0University of South Wales, in association with\u00a0Tiny Rebel Games. The module brief was \"We're Sorry to Inform You That It's The End of The World\". Teams had to make games that were 10 minutes long, took place in one room, and ended with an apocalypse.</p>\n<p><strong>Development Team</strong></p>\n<p>Sebastian Gallop - \u00a0Lead Game Designer &amp;\u00a0Programmer<br/>Christopher Williams - Lead Artist &amp; Lead 3D Artist<br/>Bill Blanchard - Game Designer - Assistant Programmer &amp;\u00a0Narrative Writer\u00a0\u00a0<br/>Kyle Fowler \u2013 Exterior Level Designer- Assistant Programmer- Game Designer<br/>Ryan Gladman \u2013 Interior Level Design- 3D Artist- Game Designer<br/>Ethan Davies - Assistant Artist<br/>Charlotte Hill - Artist<br/>Laura Dobre- Script Narrative Writer<br/>Thejus Kayanadath- Graphic Artist<br/>Caitlin Emerson- Graphic Artist\u00a0</p>\n<p>With special thanks to Susan Cummings &amp;\u00a0Lee Cummings at\u00a0Tiny Rebel Games.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Find out more about the University of South Wales Games' courses at http://southwales.ac.uk/games and http://www.twitter.com/uswgames\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/893/8936944f39e50a765e2022e1d040b283.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["USW Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
