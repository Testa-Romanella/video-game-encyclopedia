{"id": 741619, "slug": "schuld", "name": "Schuld", "name_original": "Schuld", "description": "<p>Schuld (Guilty) is a surreal, psychological horror created by Kelven. The game was a submission for a Ten Words Contest. All text is fully translated, except for the title of the game itself. All the graphics of the game are also custom.</p>\n<p>Schuld is about a man who finds himself in a dying world, without knowing how he got there and why he is there. The game itself is very linear and the puzzles are not especially complex. If a walkthrough is necessary, there is one (in German) included in the game folder. However, it clearly spoils the entire plot, so be warned.</p>\n<p>The game is relatively short (as it was probably made under contest time constraints) and clocks in at about 1-2 hours, probably less. The game is not quite as incredibly polished as Desert Nightmare and is much more of a psychological horror. I&#39;ve attempted to make sure none of the screenshots have any spoilers.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T01:52:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a03/a032edae6801c05940535657acce5e20.jpg", "website": "https://rpgmaker.net/games/4247/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
