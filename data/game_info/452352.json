This means that TIME MOVES ONLY WHEN YOU MOVE.\u00a0You can also stop time for 7 seconds by pressing space but be careful, in those 7 seconds the bullets will still appear and they will be hard to dodge when time comes back. If you don't kill the enemies fast enough the game will become somewhat of a bullet-hell.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You, the enemies and even the boss, all have just one life so be careful and try to get a score as big as possible!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-08T05:01:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc2/bc258edee564da9c37473e317586e49a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["maxileo36"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
