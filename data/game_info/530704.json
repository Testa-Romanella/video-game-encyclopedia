Goaded and guided by an ominous figure who identifies only as god, and doomed to endlessly search for the \u201cneedle in the haystack\u201d, the player must wake themselves up with the aid of the key. <br/></p>\n<p>Use WASD keys to move, space to jump, and click \"e\" to select an object you think is the key. If you've guess correctly, you'll win the game! If you don't....good luck. <br/></p>\n<p>By Alex, Kenny, Sage &amp; Tina !!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T03:18:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef0/ef05469eb0a486031a29410106fd6a89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tina"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
