Recently my team and I have announced the latest installment in the series, \u201cMoonlit Farewell\u201d. This is a concluding story, following through from the events of Momodora 3. With this new tale, I also intend to close the book on many of the past games\u2019 mysteries and questions.<br/><br/>I\u2019m aware that many players are more familiar with the story of Kaho, which is set in a distant past. As such, I\u2019m designing \u201cMoonlit Farewell\u201d to be as enjoyable as possible without prior knowledge of Momodora 1 to 3\u2019s stories. Moreover, the series has always been focused on action and minimal stories. So please, don\u2019t worry too much about \u201ccatching up\u201d!<br/>Lastly, we hope to bring you our best game with this new title, using all the knowledge we\u2019ve learned in the past 10 years. Please look forward to it!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-28T08:23:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e6/1e64b88dbbcf56e36c15ac5a6b1416cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 6, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 7}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bombservice"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Playism"], "esrb_rating": null}
