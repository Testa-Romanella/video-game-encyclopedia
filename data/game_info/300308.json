Hitting the A button while continuing forward seems to do the trick, or just approaching from a further distance.<br/>* If an NPC doesn't have the correct dialogue assigned, it may repeat text from other parts of the game<br/>* There may still be ways out of the main game, which leads to a strange glitch zone. I tried to remove all of the bad warps, but I might have missed one or two.<br/>* Occasional, minor graphics errors</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-08T04:26:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b19/b192b9984277af258dbf8c550fb77bb8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Infinite Dungeon"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
