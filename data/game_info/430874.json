If the request was accepted, they\u2019d recreate the dream and send one single copy to the original sender on a plain floppy disk with one single word based on the dream scribbled in black marker. According to VISICNS website (aprox. 1998) there were 23 different dreams that were created before they disappeared. Only a few have been at least partially discovered and rereleased online as of now.</p>\n<ul><li>Bite\u00a0</li><li>Blink</li><li>Concrete</li><li>Eyes</li><li>Fairground</li><li>Fall</li><li>Greetings</li><li>Hope</li><li>Intruder</li><li>Kindling+</li><li>Laughter</li><li>Lot +</li><li>Mother #</li><li>Mountain</li><li>Stretcher\u00a0#</li><li>Queen\u00a0</li><li>Rose</li><li>Sores</li><li>Sphere</li><li>Stalker +</li><li>Sunday</li><li>War</li><li>Wasps\u00a0</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>+ Found\r\n</p>\n<p># Disk was found but was unrecoverable</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T07:07:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45a/45a65d191c35e7d97bfd09cbbaf33712.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Oh, Vacant Mannequin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
