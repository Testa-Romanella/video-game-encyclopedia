Create a big bang and shape the universe to your will in this space simulator. The game is randomly generated, with a different universe structure every time you play. Learn about the many alien races you have created, planet types, find various secrets, and 9 possible Game Over endings.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>How to Play:</strong> This game is very sandbox driven. Click \"Bang!\" to start the game and watch the universe be created. Explore planets, learn the story behind the alien races, and decide whether to help or destroy them. Align yourself with Benevolence (Good) or Malevolence (Evil). Find the secrets of the universe. Abandon all hope and start anew. The outcome is in your hands.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Controls: <br/></strong>\r\nWASD Movement: W up, S down, D right, A left<br/>Left Mouse button for Action<br/>Right Mouse button (drag) to Look around<br/>Mouse Wheel to zoom in and out<br/>Q and E to strafe vertically<br/>Hold Right Shirt or Left Shift for fast movement\u00a0\r\n</li></ul>\n<ul><strong>\n</strong><p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/>Sage Fremont\u00a0(@SageWare) - Director, Lead Programmer, Writer, Artist<br/>Daniel Manoiu\u00a0\u00a0(@gno-evenimente) - Sound\u00a0Design, Programming, Writer, Artist</p></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T06:04:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/102/102affeeaef9abf13f8d973811e04738.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BFLAT Interactive"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
