Obliterate your opponent using the exploding power of atomic crystals.<br/>The experience of unleashing a massive chain reaction on your opponent has to be seen to be believed! And just listen to that satisfying, popping sound!<br/><br/>Each player takes a turn to place a crystal but each tile can only hold so many before it explodes, sending its crystals into the adjacent tiles and claiming them for you:<br/>corner tile = 1 crystal<br/>side tile = 2 crystals<br/>middle tile = 3 crystals<br/><br/>When only your crystals remain on the board you get the sweet, sweet taste of victory.<br/><br/>Play against a friend or against the CPU<br/><br/>Need a quick game? No problem - adjust the board size to suit your time requirements</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T05:07:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/125/1256c89ed80a94c2bc7f693b926feed7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BarrowBloke"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
