To do \n      this, you will deploy different Bot weapons, such as a Sentry or Bomber \n      to destroy them before they get to your base. The game will start out \n      easy enough, at least in theory, with only something small, like twenty \n      weak enemies. Every level you survive will result in more enemies with \n      increasing strength. You gain points and money for every ship you \n      destroy, as well as a nice bonus at the end of each round. You use this \n      money to not only build more Bots, but also different kind of upgrades. \n      Featuring multiple maps to test your different strategies. Can you \n      survive the slaughter?\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0da/0da392cc792f440c1693d954cb44c98a.jpg", "website": "http://www.zenfaproductions.com/games/zacisas-last-stand/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii U"], "developers": ["ZeNfA Productions"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["ZeNfA Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
