My first 3D game! Originally intended to just be a little shitpost game for my friend ClicheChloe. This ended up blowing up in proportion although it is still a very short little game like 16 minutes to play through this.</p>\n<p>I learned ALOT from this project. It being my first 3D game and my second project with Godot I feel like I really understand how to use this engine and I just learned SO MUCH. Like how to use blender, how to make normal maps, and depth maps, all that stuff. But 3D game dev is like really annoying I feel and I'm very excited to just return to making 2D games :3</p>\n<p>So the overall big goal with this was to just make an FPS that FEELS fun to play and have cool game feel and yadada I think I exceeded that goal. The levels and stuff were secondary concern and really it was all created in a week lol... This why the game is so short I would've liked to make it longer but I just feel like it wouldn't be worth it and I really wanna go on and make my own original things.</p>\n<p>Music was all created specifically for this game by my friend spookl! check his stuff out pls or i'll come over and muhahaha troll you.<br/>https://twitter.com/satilte_</p>\n<p>Controls are located in the txt file!</p>\n<p>ALSO FYI The weapon sway fucks up for some people and is way more aggressive than it should be but I genuinely have no clue why this happens. It only happened to one person who tested my game. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T11:05:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/47a/47a9094ccd7b67f29dda64e001900695.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Cyborin"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
