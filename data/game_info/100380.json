Love and loss are both, deep things that pluck at the fiber of a persons soul. Even though it's painful, it reminds you that you're still going, and that while you last, there is so much beauty in the world around us. The hardest part of loss, though, is facing the empty space and growing around it. Though I may never meet you, a piece of me is within you now, and it I prays that you have a beautiful life time.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tLive Long and Prosper, my friends.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tMusic:</p><p>\" Piano \"Adlib\" ep 2, Nathan rmx\" - KGZ [ http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/262083 ]</p><p>\"Green Bird\" [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJjnbhSTuqQ ]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6c/b6c4181232deb6987465b2684c221446.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["trixel"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
