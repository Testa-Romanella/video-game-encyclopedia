Characters, art assets and music were borrowed from other games and artists; copyrights belong respectively to their owners.</p><p>Here is a feature breakdown of the game.</p><p>A member of the visual novel community reviewed the game, which you can read here.<br/></p><p>This was the second version I worked on and plays like a point and click adventure. The first version I made was a visual novel and can be played here. This version has a different story and script but uses the same two characters and spiritually exists in the same universe.</p><p><strong><em>NOTE: </em></strong><em>Please forgive some spelling and grammatical errors in the game's script. Given the chance, I would re-write a lot of sections to clean things up, cut down on redundant dialogue, and ground some of what the two characters say as some of it gets incredibly cheesy.
