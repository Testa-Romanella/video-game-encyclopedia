You will need to find keys to unlock some path and find ways to escape from moxina. Try to stay alive and don\u2019t lose your way in the forests.<br/><br/><strong>Story</strong><br/>Moxina comes from the pronunciation of M\u00f4-s\u00een-\u00e1 in chinese. It is a Taiwan Folklore as it is a child-like ghost that frequently appeared in the forest. It would hypnosis the targeted person and bring him to the forest. By toying with the victims, Moxina would feed the person with turd and insect by illusion.<br/><br/>The story begins with the main character becoming the scapegoat of his neighbour Mr.Huang and it continues...<br/><br/><strong>Graphics</strong><br/>You can enable the effects (Bloom, Film Grain, Motion Blur, Ambient Occlusion) in the setting. It would be highly recommended to turn on the Bloom and ambient occlusion to enhance the game experience. However, It will slow down the fps at the sametime. It's best only when it fits to your computer graphics setting.</p>\r\nMATURE CONTENT DESCRIPTION\r\n<p>The developers describe the content like this:\r\n</p>\n<p><em>This game may contain content that is not suitable for all ages such as gore, blood and frequent violence.</em>\n</p>\n\r\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\r\n<ul>MINIMUM:\n<ul><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br/>\n</li><li>OS:\u00a0Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system 64 bits<br/>\n</li><li>Processor:\u00a0Intel Core i5-6200U 2.3GHz<br/>\n</li><li>Memory:\u00a08 GB RAM<br/>\n</li><li>Graphics:\u00a0GeForce Gtx 950M<br/>\n</li><li>DirectX:\u00a0Version 11<br/>\n</li><li>Storage:\u00a05 GB available space\r\n</li></ul></ul>\n<ul>RECOMMENDED:\n<ul><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br/>\n</li><li>OS:\u00a0Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system 64 bits<br/>\n</li><li>Processor:\u00a0AMD Ryzen 5 3600 6-Core Processor<br/>\n</li><li>Memory:\u00a08 GB RAM<br/>\n</li><li>Graphics:\u00a0GeForce GTX 1660 Super<br/>\n</li><li>DirectX:\u00a0Version 11<br/>\n</li><li>Storage:\u00a05 GB available space\r\n</li></ul></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T09:24:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f7/6f728e7d7896e63cb18cef17da551310.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 323, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lsgamedev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
