Watch for the telltale shadow to avoid seeing your character be crushed by a falling cube while climbing the stacked cubes to ascend to the floors above. Push, pull, or shove cubes to make your climb easier and try to gain extra points by stepping on five cubes in a row on the same floor. In addition, you\u2019ll encounter<br />\nspecial cubes that can either be helpful or harmful to your effort.</p>\n<p>Choose from either TEN FLOORS mode, which challenges you to reach the tenth floor while scoring as many points as possible, or TOWER mode, which gives you the chance to climb as high as you can. Do you have what it takes to make it to the top or will you be crushed?</p>\n<p>Check out more Art Style games!</p>\n<p>For WiiWare:<br />\nArt Style: CUBELLO<br />\nArt Style: light trax<br />\nArt Style: ORBIENT<br />\nArt Style: ROTOHEX<br />\nArt Style: Rotozoa</p>\n<p>For DSiWare:<br />\nArt Style: AQUIA<br />\nArt Style: BOXLIFE<br />\nArt Style: DIGIDRIVE<br />\nArt Style: BASE 10<br />\nArt Style: Zengage<br />\nArt Style: PiCTOBiTS</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-17T19:53:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e78/e78a1c8a66f0fdd209096b1dd87d5efc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 11, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS", "Nintendo DSi"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
