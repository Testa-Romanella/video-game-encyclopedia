And you would be correct. Good on you for noticing that! :)\u00a0</p>\n<p>You might have also noticed that in the other version (i.e. the Unity version), I said it was the baseline for making the same game in C++...well here is that version.<br/></p>\n<p>I didn't track my hours like I did the Unity version\u00a0due to the C++ tutorials, SFML tutorials\u00a0and trying to figure out texture work in SFML...*sigh*...took around 3 days off and on. If I had to guess-imate, how long it took me, I would say between 20 -30 hrs.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>Did it take longer the expected? Yes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Did I learn along the way? Yes, I learn a ton.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Was it fun to build? Absolutely!</p>\n<p>Will I make more games? Yes, stay tuned.</p>\n<p>Will I make snake again? No. I think I am done for now. ;)</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless,\u00a0I wanted to share the result of my efforts with you\u00a0in the form of this version of Snake.<br/></p>\n\n<p>If you would like more details of my\u00a0development, source code, advice, or help about anything related to game dev or programming, let me know in the comments or by reaching out\u00a0on discord at aaron7eleven#3339. I am open book and would love to chat about games.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading this minor monologue. It really means alot. I hope you enjoy the game.<br/></p>\n<p>Don't forget...you're awesome! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T08:04:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/233/233ae7b008e2bd1296dd1f3faa634cb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["aaron7eleven"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
