Just wanted to share this game from the Year 2 Cohort Project we just finished! This was my first time Producing a game with a team and the results look incredible! The team have been incredible at bringing this game to life and the effort really shows.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We had to make a Horror game and we set out to create a really uncomfortable experience to play through. From initial reactions, we believe we achieved this. This was all developed in Unreal Engine 4, none of us had experience with the engine prior to this. We also only had a month to complete this from pre-production to Alpha level of quality.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Producer\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Bradley O\u2019Neill (Me)</p>\n<p><strong>Lead Game Designer\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Alejandro Leon</p>\n<p><strong>Lead Technical Designer\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Omar El-shafie</p>\n<p><strong>Technical Designers</strong></p>\n<p>Dawood Amir\u00a0</p>\n<p>Banji\u00a0</p>\n<p>Charles\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Lead Game Artist\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Tony Tyler\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>2D Artists</strong></p>\n<p>Sophie Aryan\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sebastian Moore\u00a0</p>\n<p>Luis Bull (AKA: Taurmega)</p>\n<p>Simon Pun</p>\n<p><strong>Lead 3D Artist\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Sam Miller\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>3D Artists\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Rafael Alarc\u00f3n</p>\n<p>Isaiah Abel</p>\n<p>Foad (AKA: Snipeinc)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T11:28:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f44/f44f0eeed94da7cbf0073a395e2a8d1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BRADLEY O'NEILL"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
