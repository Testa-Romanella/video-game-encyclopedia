For the environment, I chose the synthwave visual style, as I always found 80's style images quite interesting. The game will have a one-machine multiplayer option (multiple keyboard controls and joysticks or possibly mouse) and an idle option (with no obstacles) too.\r\n4 different worlds are planned for the demo, but I'm planning more for the full game.</p>\n<p>The game itself is basically a shoot'em up, the player has to either avoid or destroy the obstacles on the level.</p>\n<p>The game is not a racing game. It is based on one of my old games, (80's runner), which also included other types of levels, like spaceship, jet plane and dolphin as playable character. I presented the old game on a Demoscene event, but it wasn't as successful as I wanted, it didn't have any music, and the graphics weren't the best.\r\nI wanted to add some music (as for now, I'm creating it), much better graphics, and a better feeling of speed.\r\nThe character depends on the levels aesthetics, e.g.: there can be a car on a road, but also a dolphin in the ocean, a plane in the sky, or a vector-graphic model in an abstract environment. Players (when playing multiplayer) can tell themselves from others based on their color.</p>\n<p>According to my current plans:\r\nWhat will be:\r\n- Shoot'em up\r\n- A collection of 80s-90s style \"infinite movement\" levels, that constantly change.\r\n- A possible idle game to play while listening to music</p>\n<p>\r\nWhat it won't (shouldn't) be:\r\n- A rhytm game (the level doesn't change according to the music)\r\n- A racer (cars won't be the only thing you can control )</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T04:02:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a32/a32ee7a6de3021c57883cc67d5026ff7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Black Goby Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
