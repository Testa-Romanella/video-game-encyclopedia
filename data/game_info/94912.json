Every so often, a strange thing happened in this place: a yokai in the shape of a giant foot appeared and demanded to be cleaned. If the resident cleaned the foot, the foot left peacefully. However, if the foot was not cleaned, then the foot stomped throughout the house and destroyed everything.<br/><br/>Ashi Wash is our take on this Japanese folktale.<br/><br/>In Ashi Wash, you have three minutes to clean the giant foot. There are tools scattered throughout the house to help you. Get crackin'!<br/>Also included in the download is a Virtual Reality version of the game. We know you've dreamed of cleaning a giant obnoxious foot in VR and your dreams are about to come true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>clean a giant foot in VR</li><li>clean a giant foot again, but not in VR</li><li>fully voiced dialog</li><li>English subtitles (non-VR mode only)</li><li>a nice deck to gaze at the sunset</li><li>2 bds / 2 ba</li><li>puns</li><li>talking flies</li><li>a vinyl record player (<em>it's called a ~gramophone~</em>)</li><li>forced perspective</li><li>local leaderboard</li><li>Steam key with your Itch.io purchase</li></ul>\n<p><em>(VR mode has only been tested with HTC Vive and Windows Mixed Reality headsets.
