{"id": 136569, "slug": "the-ghoulish-ghosts-game", "name": "The Ghoulish Ghosts Game", "name_original": "The Ghoulish Ghosts Game", "description": "<p>The Ghoulish Ghosts Game is a hidden object game with a short story segment before each level, (that can be turned off). <br/></p>\n<p>Follow the little ghost\u2019s quests while you find objects in the picture on the right that are similar to the picture shown on the left.\u00a0 For example, if there\u2019s a skeleton on the left then find a skeleton in any shape or colour in the picture on the right. Once you\u2019ve found the object a new one is placed.<br/></p>\n<p>Objects are randomly chosen and placed. They are created to blend into the background picture, however, this is also impacted by where the random placement is.<br/></p>\n<p>Pass each of the 60 levels by finding at least 15 of the 25 objects before you run out of time or taps (if applicable.) Get gold by finding all 25 objects.\u00a0 The first 32 levels require you to find the same type of object each time. The last 28 levels also change the type of object you have to find each turn. <br/></p>\n<p>Mix and match the different settings to make this game as challenging or easy as you want it to be:<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Tap / Click Limit:</strong><br/>You can only tap / click the screen a fixed number of times. The limit is determined by your choice of timid, brave or fierce.</p>\n<p><strong>Timed mode: </strong><br/>You have a limited amount of time to find the object before it\u2019s replaced. The amount of time you have is determined by your choice of the timid, brave or fierce settings.</p>\n<p>If you turn off tap limit and timed mode then the timid, brave or fierce settings will make no difference to your game. </p>\n<p>If timed mode is turned off there\u2019s a skip button that will allow you to skip an object if you can\u2019t find it so that you don\u2019t get stuck.</p>\n<p><strong>This game is free and also ad free.</strong></p>\n<p>The Ghoulish Ghosts Game is available for Windows PC and Android devices.</p>\n<p>This game requires no permissions, however, if you tap on the images showing other games it will use your internet connection. Tapping on these images is optional.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f5/2f5bff1ce4ff03f7895d2f0400a3b3d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 237, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Evolutionary Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
