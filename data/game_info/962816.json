It has been described as a cross between a virtual album cover and an interactive music video. Lisle has taken his song creation and expanded the lyrics into a surreal landscape for the listener to explore and unlock. Lyrics referencing \u201ctime\u201d, \u201cphotographs\", and \"frozen winters\" are materialized inside the environment for the player to discover. Once all of the pieces of the game have been collected and matched to their proper times and locations, the player is allowed to enjoy the final song presentation in full psychedelic 3D glory.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-30T02:58:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12d/12d515398cdfdf439ebeb34859b14e3e.jpg", "website": "https://lisleenglecom.godaddysites.com/heavy-distance", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TFK Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["TFK Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
