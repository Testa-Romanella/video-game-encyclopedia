Due to the game's humungous scope, along with my game design skills not being up to the task, I decided to stop working on it in September of 2020. (For more info read here) At the moment I\u00a0<strong>do not\u00a0</strong>plan on picking this back up myself, however I may adapt its story into a comic sometime later.</p>\n<p>Considering that not many people ever got to play the game or see what it was, I've decided to make its first playtest build publicly accessible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PLOT DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>\n<p>After being marooned, you're rescued by Captain Jonas and his pirate crew. You join up with them, only to be captured (along with Jonas) by the World Navy. You manage to escape, but are forced to leave Jonas behind... Thus, it's now your goal to return the favor and save Jonas.</p>\n<p>However, that's easier said than done. The World Navy has their eyes set on the Full Moon Isles, and without Jonas there's no one to fund (or defend) the small town of Rogue's Rest. In order to save Jonas and, by proxy, the Full Moon Isles from imperial grasp, it's up to you to plunder dungeons and chart the unexplored Full Moon Isles.</p>\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game aims to be similar to older\u00a0<em>Legend of Zelda\u00a0</em>games, while bringing new ideas and improvements to the table. I grew up playing those games, and honestly, I wouldn't be the same person I am today if it wasn't for them. It's my goal to make something truly special, while not re-treading old ground.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong></p>\n<p>Sounds and Music: PSiMetronome\u00a0</p>\n<p>Game and Art: Carpetwurm<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T05:22:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e2/3e27c7552966f03cd3633198331b3ddc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Carpetwurm"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
