In this game you drive along a track, avoiding obstacles while trying to crash the other green cars to use their parts for a new ability.\u00a0Get the slide and spin to crash through the yellow barrels for more points, and use the jump to avoid the walls.</p>\n<p>Controls: Move with WASD, use abilities with J, K, &amp; SPACE once you've collected them. ESCAPE closes the game.</p>\n<p>Be aware: This game was not able to be finished in time, so it barely works. You can get a general sense of the gameplay I was going for, but that's about it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T16:51:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b4/4b430a95620561d0984a07b59ff7084f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ClockworkDragonfly"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
