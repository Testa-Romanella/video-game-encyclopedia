I founded the WTF Are We Doing Game Jam in 2013 with\u00a0Michael\u00a0Elliott and, for our first year, decided to make a simple platformer.</p>\n<p>We didn't have an overarching theme for the first year, but we did have an Idea Bucket that contained a bunch of suggestions.\u00a0Some were sincere, some were very silly, and some may have come from\u00a0Orteil's\u00a0Game Idea Generator. The prompt for this game was:</p>\n<p><strong>\"You are a velociraptor trying to sneak into a fancy dress party\"</strong></p>\n<p>Originally this was a very different game.\u00a0The initial level was you climbing a mountain to a fancy chateau, followed by a second level where you would have to\u00a0infiltrate the chateau without being spotted by partygoers.\u00a0If you made it to the bar undetected, you won!</p>\n<p>However, near the end of the final day of the jam\u00a0Stencyl up and killed my project, removing most of the assets in the game and then autosaving without prompting when I attempted to quit and reload.\u00a0I got real frustrated, having lost literally all of (admittedly pointless) collectibles and my level designs.</p>\n<p>With two hours left, I resolved to finish it out of spite. I\u00a0made a very simple and short level that was technically impossible to complete. I set the background to an aggressively unfriendly scrolling GIF. And\u00a0I disabled rotation protection on Vincent's sprite, so he no longer stood properly. This also had the unexpected bonus of allowing you to actually finish the level by glitching your jumps over the larger hills.</p>\n<p>So, this is it.\u00a0The first game I ever created. It's terrible and it's broken and it was never that great an idea in the first place, but I made it.</p>\n<p>Party hard, classy raptor.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Left and Right\u00a0Arrows to move left and right.<br/>Space to jump.<br/>Bounce off walls and corners to glitch physics for super-high jumps.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n\n<p>Code, \"Design\", &amp;\u00a0Concept by\u00a0Andrew Ferguson<br/>Music by\u00a0Travis Fishbein<br/>Raptor\u00a0Sprite by\u00a0Chris\u00a0French<br/>Title\u00a0Screen by\u00a0Erin Keaskin<br/>Remaining Assets by Stencyl and/or The\u00a0Internet</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb0/fb0c10b247c1471a45b8ff4e74a366d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Andrew Ferguson"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
