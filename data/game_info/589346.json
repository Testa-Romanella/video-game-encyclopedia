She was left in the middle of nowhere. One day, a group of children were passing by and saw her. One of the children picked her up and brought her back. She was happy as she has a new owner now but it was a false hope. The group of children lives in a house that is run by a witch who uses the children as sacrifices for her life prolonging ritual.
