Adjacent nodes are represented by the white nodes.</p>\n<p><strong>Aim of the game</strong></p>\n<p>Get\u00a0to the end of the level by moving from node to node. Along the way try to work out the fastest route to collect all of the coins without the node decay catching up with you.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Programming, Art &amp;\u00a0Animation: Rob Brooks</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fea/fea9094d0ba0a46b085e3c9354a269c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RobBCreates"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
