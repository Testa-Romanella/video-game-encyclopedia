You assume the job as the receptionist and your job is to make sure that you maximize the number of customers served in the given time frame. There are three types of rooms in your hotel. A room with a single bed, a room with three beds and a room with five beds. \r\nThe customers will pay higher for single rooms and the least for the rooms with the maximum number of beds. You make 10$ per customer in the single room, 7$ for the triple bed room and 4$ for the 5 bed room. Each customer stays for 10 seconds. To make things worse, every type of customer has a different waiting period and will leave if you do not allot a room before their waiting period is over.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>The Theme</strong></p>\n<p>You might now assume that all you need to do is fill the rooms as fast as possible but that\u2019s not quite true. Remember, less is more. Social distancing is still important and hence you will be penalized if the multi-bed rooms are at certain capacities.</p>\n<p>The customers may come alone or in parties. All members of a party must be placed in the same room. (You can\u2019t divide a party of say, four people into two groups of two.)</p>\n<p>You may choose to let the customer stay or you may choose to let them go. The money is credited as soon as you allot them the room.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>How To Play</strong></p>\n<p>Please refer to the in-game tutorial sequence for an exact in-depth guide.</p>\n<p>Happy playing!
