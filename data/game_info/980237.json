Choose your character from our lineup of wacky wizards, and do battle in a top down 2D arena! Each wizard has their own unique play style. The last wizard standing each round will be the winner. At the end of each round, you will pick cards which make you stronger... mostly. By the end of the game, the walls of the arena might not be enough to contain your power! The first to eight victories wins. But be warned, the headmaster of our magical university might catch wind of your brawling... Which of you can become the most impractical?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-15T08:08:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26e/26eba8815df67b0d891a26819460986f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 270, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Noodle Life Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Noodle Life Games LLC"], "esrb_rating": null}
