It takes two shots to destroy an enemy pin, unless you hit the pin with the same element, in which case the spell will instantly destroy the pin and continue onward. There are four spell types - Water, Earth, Fire, and Air, which correspond to the same four types of enemy pins.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The spells that the player fires is determined by a slot machine. When a player fires three spells, the machine will stop spinning, and the three elements that appear on the slot machine determine the next three spells that the player will fire.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The player advances to the next frame by defeating all of the pins in the current frame.\u00a0 The game ends when the player runs out of all of their lives, or when they finish all 10 frames.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T05:48:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5c/d5c5c7d1a02722a7cfafa9d74ee261b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ozotojc", "LoriTom", "andreabisaber", "Tavera04", "Dartagnan"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
