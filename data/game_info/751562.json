Not too proud as I followed a tutorial to make it. But I will upload my own original game soon! I also want to let you know that it gets harder over time. The difficulty also doesn't reset as it's a simple bug I don't feel like fixing.</p>\r\n-- Note --\r\n<p><em>First game and not much gameplay but I\u00a0will release a new game soon that is made completely by me and a lot more gameplay. However, this was important for me learning how to use Godot. Enjoy!</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T08:37:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b13/b135cfab83eb9ebd50160d83777385e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Broskit"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
