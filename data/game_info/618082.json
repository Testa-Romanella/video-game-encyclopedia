When we heard the theme \"joined together\", we thought we'd make a game with a marriage aesthetic! <br/><br/>Controls - WASD to control Husband Kitty, IJKL to control Wife Kitty.</p>\n<p>To win the game, you need to collect 5 tulips and 5 fish. Only Wife Kitty can collect tulips, and only Husband Kitty can collect fish. However, the two will get nervous if they're separated: if they can't see each other for 5 seconds, it's game over! <br/></p>\n<p>You will be given a score based on how quick you can finish the game. There are four different endings based on your score!\u00a0 It'd mean a lot to us if you commented what ending you got, and how you felt about the game! Any criticism is welcome. <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T09:16:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5c/a5c72bfd7840c265d579fd1904999cd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Strictlybull", "oxygencraft", "froggy3d"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
