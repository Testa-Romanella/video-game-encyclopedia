I had coded this at my friend's house when we were snowed in one evening in January 2019.\u00a0I knew nothing about numerical integration at the time, so the integrator I custom coded was horribly inefficient and thus you get some slowdown occasionally. There's also some jankiness with the grass bouncing the wrong direction from time to time. I still think this is neat though and am sad I never used it for anything!</p>\n<p>The source code is a mess and dates from a time when I knew nothing, but feel free to use it/modify it/learn from it etc.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T13:36:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/816/8169433963676626fbaa6486bafed49a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["saddleblasters"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
