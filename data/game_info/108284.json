{"id": 108284, "slug": "ayaya", "name": "Ayaya", "name_original": "Ayaya", "description": "<p>A little Touhou fan game I've made somewhere in 2015 featuring Shameimaru Aya as protagonist. It has a Christmas theme and Aya is on the quest to find a real identity of the Santa Claus in this game.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately this game was not finished and have only one level(from planned 3). I don't know if I'll finish it someday. I would like to though.</p>\n<p>Controls as usual in Touhou games with a little quirk:</p>\n<p>With keyboard:</p>\n<p>Arrows - movement</p>\n<p>Shift - Focus</p>\n<p>Z - tapping - fire, holding - charge wind powers and release</p>\n<p>X - bomb</p>\n<p>Ctrl - continuous fire without charging wind power</p>\n<p>You can also control with the gamepad, all standard ones should be supported, you can reassign buttons in the options menu.</p>\n<p>I'm little sorry about language select though - the story in this game is available only in Russian and Japanese languages ^_^;\u00a0 (I made it for russian and japanese touhou communities specifically)</p>\n<p>Only Windows build since it was written with my custom engine. And I think fullscreen is broken in this one so better don't try to switch to fullscreen. You can resize game window.</p>\n<p>Since this is just a fan game I used some assets that is not mine:</p>\n<p>Ingame sprites(Aya, fairies and bullets) - credits goes to ZUN(I have redrawn fairies sprites a little though)</p>\n<p>Music - Silver Forest and ZUN</p>\n<p>All other including dialog sprites and illustrations is mine.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/727/727342975f4e8e405a1acca8dad9dad5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 224, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Noro"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
