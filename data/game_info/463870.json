The them is \"Out Of Control\" and I had a not so good idea of Robot cars getting out of control and destroying everything ;-; It is also really bad. The lightning is terrible, but I am really proud of it as it is my first ever game jam. In the 2 days of the game jam I did more than I did in the whole process of learning so I would recommend getting into game jams if you want to learn. Also it would mean a lot to me if you would leave some feedback. There will be a video on how I made making the game in a few days and It will be quite a good quality video :) My channel -\u00a0GramOner</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T03:17:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5d/b5d6590ac5ed8f2aae6e961d6d56754f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GramOner"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
