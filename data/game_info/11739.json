The game can accommodate forward-facing setups, but you'll ideally want a 2m by 2m play space due to the way SteamVR chooses the forward direction of your play area. You must run through the SteamVR room setup for the game to work properly.<br/><br/><strong>Room scale:</strong> The game is currently room scale only with a minimum space requirement of 2m by 1.5m for 360\u00b0 setups and 2m by 2m for forward only setups.<br/><br/><strong>The Thrill of the Fight is still under active development.</strong> Future improvements include more polish, new opponents, and more.<br/><br/>The Thrill of the Fight is a boxing game designed specifically for VR. Enter a virtual gym and battle unique challengers with their own boxing styles and techniques. Use timing and skill to land the knockout blow. Evade punches, land jabs, and block blows to become the king of the ring.<br/><br/>The Thrill of the Fight is best described as a \"semi-sim\" with some simplified or unrealistic mechanics for the sake of fun and straightforward game play or to accommodate the limits of current VR technology. Mechanics are realistic where possible but the game is not guaranteed to be a fully accurate recreation of real boxing.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-22T23:14:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ed/2edd1d80844a66fab014630a47ea6af9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.5, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 114, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 5, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 10, "suggestions_count": 274, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ian Fitz"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Ian Fitz"], "esrb_rating": null}
