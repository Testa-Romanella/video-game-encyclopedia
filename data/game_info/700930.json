It's about you controlling a little character who has to collect garbage that is spawning every round (there are a total of 15 rounds in the game).\u00a0 However, his movement was made to be difficult to control. His speed is randomized and could change every time you collect an item and, once he reaches high speeds, it's hard to stop him. That being said, the goal of the game is to collect as much trash as you can during those 15 rounds while having all those difficulties on you. So, you have to be strategic about your movement/<br/>Controls: W and S (forward and backward) and the mouse (change of direction)\u00a0</p><p>Credits: Unreal Engine 4 and BenSound:\u00a0https://www.bensound.com<br/></p><p>How to play: Unzip the Zip file and find the unreal engine game</p><p>This game was inspired by the TeamSeas foundation which I recommend you go and donate in:\u00a0https://teamseas.org/</p><p>Thank you very much to PolyMars and Barji for giving me this opportunity and I hope you enjoy my first made game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T04:33:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8a/c8ab48e10a029d4f57c01bf36e12ad56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MrSashulia"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
