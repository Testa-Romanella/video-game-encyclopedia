However what is\u00a0not included within the demo however is the main romance system (although there is affection and you do get to give someone a gift before it ends).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T04:50:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf1/bf14250910d0ed134998feccd6b39ca9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Person of Few Talents"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
