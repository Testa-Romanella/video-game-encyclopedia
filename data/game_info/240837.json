It is a 2D mini game I created in a week for a school project. You need to finish the level in under 15 seconds (I called it square time because you need to finish it in 15 seconds or under, and your pretty much a square)\u00a0, or you are reset back to stage 1. It currently only has 5 stages, I wont be expanding because I want to work on a better game!</p>\n<p>Here is a demonstration video I made about it:</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1s01GKBwetaFfEolBisbqA</p>\n<p>I hope you like my game :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e1/8e1231c8d1cb5e517f2158c25fa0f52e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KAL0RD"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
