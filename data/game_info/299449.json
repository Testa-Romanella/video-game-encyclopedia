There have been a couple of 16-in-1 jams done before but these tend to be presented as 16 standalone games with a menu screen to pick between them. I wanted to do something that was an homage to Lazy Jones on the C64 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7DyoDJCqac), where you have 16 mini-games but also an overarching 17th\u00a0game that ties them all together.</p>\n<p>17 games, from 16 different developers in 10 countries: UK, USA, Canada, Australia, France, Russia, Hungary, Norway, Finland, Sweden. It all fits into 32k of memory.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Contributors were:\u00a0@Liquidream @platformalist @p01 @gruber_music @egordorichev @brintown @Enargy @viza @MrHodgepants @kometbomb @johanpeitz @2DArray @GregosEl @dollarone, plus UncleSporky and... me!</p>\n<p>\u00a0Fly around space collecting crystals to open \u201canomalies\u201d. Each one will send you to another dimension where a weird challenge will present itself. Do well and your ship will be refuelled accordingly!
