Choose your hero and assemble your team of characters, items and treasures to outwit opponents in strategic battles where positioning matters. Will you be the last one standing in this enchanted PvP arena?<h3>Strategic Gameplay</h3>Choose your Hero carefully at the start of each game, as each Hero plays differently.

Level up to find even more powerful characters and spells in your shops.<br/><br/><h3>Match 3</h3>Find three copies of a character to forge a stronger version and gain a potent treasure of their level. Master this core mechanic to dominate in this strategic turn-based autobattler set in a mythical realm. The right treasure can tip the scales in your favor!<br/><br/><h3>Replayability</h3>Spice up the game with the Chaos Queue, featuring random rule-changes like dual heroes or expanded boards for massive replayability.
