Though our main focus was the story xD. We hope you enjoy our little game and all had a great time working on your own games for this jam. We look foward to seeing your games as well. Good luck all.</p>\n\n<p>Why so early? yea.... life happens and the main programmer (jonathan, me writing this) got a job during the jam week so needed a break before starting on Tomorrow (March 1st), so that's why we are so early, though our game build may update nearer the deadline. with fixes and improvements.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T05:02:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8a/c8a001a00f8337a2d963c74cdf44a220.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Aztec_man", "Carter Games", "Lost_Carc0sa", "StuartHoneymanMusic", "James Stormer"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
