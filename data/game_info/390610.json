{"id": 390610, "slug": "the-veil-kewliomzx", "name": "The Veil (KewlioMZX)", "name_original": "The Veil (KewlioMZX)", "description": "<p>A mortal seeks something from the land of\u00a0T\u00edr na n\u00d3g, home of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann. However, this is not a place where mortals will usually tread. Can they seek the aid of the Gods themselves and find what they're looking for?</p>\n<p>Please note that this game is very much incomplete. For one, this has been my first game jam of any kind. On top of that,\u00a0outside of Desert Bus, this has been kind of an awful week, and a less-than-ideal time to be able to focus on making this game, paired with some severe writer's block in the middle of it. However, it was important to me to at least submit something workable, with at least one of the handful of puzzles I\u00a0wanted to put into the final project.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0may come back and complete this, but this is unlikely; this is actually working off a concept I had for another MZX game idea, and so, what I've learned from this project would probably go toward that project instead.</p>\n<p>If you're playing the embedded version, you can press Ctrl-Alt-Enter to toggle fullscreen mode. Also, due to some weirdness, if you click outside of the game applet, you'll need to click the lighter blue\u00a0 border around it in order to continue playing.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T02:04:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c28/c2865a9799e6ee8963e27312249ac650.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KewlioMZX"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
