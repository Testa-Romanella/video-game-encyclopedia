And if you\u2019ve never tried one, there\u2019s no time like the present! Use numeric clues to place multi-colored tiles into a grid and reveal a picture. You\u2019ll start with some fun and easy puzzles in the early Industrial Era, but by the time you\u2019ve reached the Space Age, you\u2019ll be faced with big, multi-colored grids sure to test the wits of even the most seasoned puzzle-solver.</p>\n<p>This is no ordinary picross game, however, and the fun doesn\u2019t stop with a single puzzle. The images you\u2019ll uncover within each stage form parts of a larger depiction of the era in question. Finish the stage, and watch the scene you\u2019ve assembled come to life before your eyes!</p>\n<p>Time Twins Mosaics is both relaxing and challenging, and sometimes surprising! It features 100 levels across 20 different stages, each corresponding to a different period in modern history, from the days of coal and steam up through the dawn of space travel. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0c/d0c0305d8d426a91b786f245fcd70189.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anawiki Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
