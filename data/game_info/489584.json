{"id": 489584, "slug": "music-factory-wye", "name": "Music Factory (wye)", "name_original": "Music Factory (wye)", "description": "<p><em>Music Factory</em> is a simple browser game where you build a music machine. Place pipes and instruments on the board and watch as the balls make a song come to life! Play around with the number of ball generators and instruments until you find a soundscape you like.</p>\n<p>It's also the first real game (that deserves the name) that I made from scratch, so that's something. I wrote it in JavaScript using the p5.js library.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Music Factory</em> is heavily inspired by <em>La P\u00e2te \u00e0 Son</em>, a browser game from the 2000s that I used to play a lot as a kid. There doesn't seem to be a playable version of it on the internet anymore, so you'll just have to believe me when I say it was great fun.</p>\n<p><em>La P\u00e2te \u00e0 Son</em> was quite a bit more advanced than <em>Music Factory is </em>(more instruments, more notes, more settings to tweak, etc.). I guess this is more of a proof of concept, or a minimum viable product? Still, considering it was made in a week for a jam, I'm pretty happy with it.</p>\n<p>Source code: https://github.com/vvye/music-factory</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T03:37:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/563/5633863c918bfbedde8e984d49648035.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["wye"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
