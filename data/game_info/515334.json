Make the journey to Golopoilis by rolling at top speed while collecting clay on the way.</p>\n<p>This game is fairly incomplete and faced a lot of difficulites developing. However it is playable from start to finish.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a prototype, made using Mudbun which is an unconventional modelling method using voxels in order to construct objects using a combination of blended primitives. <br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>Help the rolling golem reach Golopolis by collecting 7 holy \"quasar spheres\" whatever they are. Reach the end of the level after you've collected all of them to finish. <br/></p>\n<p>Please use a Controller! Xbox is prefered. <br/></p>\n<p>Left Trigger to Boost<br/>Right Trigger\u00a0 to Brake<br/>Sticks for Camera and movement<br/>A to jump<br/>Y to talk</p>\n<p>Keyboard is a lot worse of an experience, just there for accessability.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Modelling and a Bouncy player animation thing</p>\n<p>Mudbun and Boing Kit by Allen Chou<br/>http://longbunnylabs.com/mudbun/<br/></p>\n<p>Outline Effect<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/quick-outline-1154...</p>\n<p>Amplify Shader Editor:<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/visual-scripting/amplify-shader-edit... <br/>Some Textures were bought from Shutterstock (skybox)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hierarchy 2: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/hierarchy-2-166483 <br/>Normal Maps: I used a few normal maps such as a wrinkled paper map from: https://freepbr.com/materials/wrinkled-paper1/<br/>\u00a0Another site was<br/>https://3dtextures.me/</p>\n<p>Lighting is NGSS by Psychose Interactive: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/next-gen-soft-shadows-137380</p>\n\n<p>MUSIC:</p>\n<p>https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Digi_GAlessio/Love_Beats_and_Pina_Coladas/pho...</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/djgriffin/sounds/506771/</p>\n<p>https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-sound-effects-download/water-drops-...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T03:26:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/552/55296bc7eee3f8648c1bac13b6cb00c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["salfontaine"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
