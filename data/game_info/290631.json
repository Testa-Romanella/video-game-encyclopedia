This is a doom inspired FPS, about a brave child defending their cabin from vicious tree monsters. Using a super soaker and toy shotgun, defend against wave after wave of hostile trees. Keep your distance to avoid their brutal melee attack, but be prepared to dodge as they throw nests filled with angry wasps. Be on the lookout for useful power-ups hidden throughout the woods, and gather dropped loot quickly to stay in the fight.<br/></p>\n\n<p>CREDITS</p>\n<p>Art design - Adam Keating\u00a0</p>\n<p>Programming - Brian Pajak</p>\n\n<p>Post processing effect courtesy of Pixalation Asset: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/pixe...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:28:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abd/abd5ebc846154f6df66a807113bd0876.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Master Krepta"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
