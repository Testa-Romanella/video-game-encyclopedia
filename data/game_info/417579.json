We focused this weekend just on getting the basic systems working and making the environment look cool. If we decide to take the project further and make it more playable, we have laid solid groundwork here and could easily do so. <br/></p>\n<p>We got a very respectable amount of programming done, and learnt a lot about making environments in this style with simple, easy to make models. Good practice and research for future projects, plus I think the menu screen looks pretty cool. So overall a productive weekend.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T04:43:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/361/361edb1018d6be09436486ae37bca2b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eye Bleach Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
