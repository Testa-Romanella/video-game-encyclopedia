{"id": 146962, "slug": "red-forest-alpha", "name": "Red Forest - Alpha", "name_original": "Red Forest - Alpha", "description": "<p>========================================================</p><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>Set in a semi-apocalyptic world after a disaster caused by an energy\r\ncrisis, Red Forest is a highly customisable Anti-Gravity racer with elements of\r\nWipeout, F-Zero, Trackmania and Rollcage. With a base background story but no\r\nplot to speak of, it will encompass the usual racing elements as well as combat\r\nmodes and track creation.</p><p><strong>Backstory</strong></p><p>By the late 21st Century, the supply of fossil fuels was non-existent.\r\nGovernments and Global agencies struggled with alternative green fuels, but\r\nwith little effect. The ever expanding population and increasing energy demand\r\noutstripped the supply of green fuels. Desperate measures were undertaken.\r\nAfter extensive research into unstable chemical reactions, Red Fuel was\r\ncreated. A highly volatile chemical combustion with unfathomable energy output,\r\nit was developed by an international task force and introduced rapidly\r\nthroughout the globe. Sceptics believed that a disaster was inevitable. They\r\nwere right. One spark sent a shockwave throughout the Red Fuel distribution\r\nnetwork, leading to a chain of mushroom clouds and a fallout effect many times\r\ngreater than any nuclear disaster experienced by Mankind.</p><p>huge areas of the planet were uninhabitable, choked by the fumes left\r\nafter the explosion. Under the barrage of chemicals released in the explosions,\r\nthe ozone layer underwent a rapid change, tinting the sky red and raining down\r\nharmful rays from the Sun and other stellar bodies. Safe zones were set up and\r\nthe affected areas were abandoned, their soil a memorial to the billions that\r\nhad died.</p><p>But times change.</p><p>Still restricted in their energy production, the remaining societies of\r\nthe world lacked entertainment. Rioting and looting were commonplace, with the\r\ntechnology of the old world being the most sought after objects. Like a caveman\r\nfashioning a club out of a tree branch, new pieces of technology began to\r\nemerge. People brave enough to go into the still dangerous \u2018red forests\u2019\r\ncollected enough materials to create basic vehicles. An underground racing\r\nculture emerged and over time attracted larger and larger crowds. Eager to\r\nplacate their restless denizens, the rulers of the shattered societies\r\norganised tournaments, setting up protected viewing zones and distributing\r\ntheir energy so that certain high priority races could be televised in the\r\nramshackle public squares that had emerged after the disaster. The memorial\r\ngrounds of the \u2018Red Fuel Catastrophe\u2019 became the arenas of the \u2018Red Forest\r\nTournaments\u2019.</p><p>Some would enter as slaves, fighting for their freedom or just to\r\nsurvive to the next week, others would enter to prove their worth in a\r\nchallenge of skill, yet others entered to satisfy their own lust for\r\ndestruction. Not all entrants could have their motives so easily defined\u2026</p><p>========================================================</p><p><strong><em>Early ALPHA build. BUGS TO BE EXPECTED.</em></strong></p><p>That said- it's playable and fun. There are four ships, ten procedural tracks (all very similar for the moment- more track prefabs are in the works!)</p><p>The aim is simple: Use weapons and turbo boosts to reach the finish before any other racer. Each win earns you upgrade points useful to upgrade your ships.</p><p>This build provides upgrade points from the start, so you can experience the feel of the tweaked ships.</p><p><strong><em>Known bugs at this early stage:</em></strong></p><p>Collisions are over-active: Clipping the track edge or another ship may knock you too hard- in the future this is to be fixed so that clipping the track edge does not rotate you as much. A side effect of this is that your pod might take a while to reset after a nasty collision.</p><p>Generated tracks are similar: At the moment the track generator only has a handful of different prefabs resulting in rather similar output. More prefabs are being worked on.</p><p>Probably loads more at the moment.</p><p>Please report any difficulties- even if it's just something you don't like. I want to make this the game that you enjoy playing too!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b27/b27d702262049d78963cc801c0514589.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["SturdyGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
