It is a simple platformer, that was originally meant to have some more action elements, however I didn't want to spend too much time on this seeing it was my first time. As of right now there are three levels, which are not too long. It should not take more than a single sitting to play this game. Also the main character's name is Arhluen, she was named after a d&amp;d character<br/></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0Its not very good, but I'm still releasing it mostly to show other's how far I'll have improved in my design and development over time. There are a few glitches, however none of them have large effect on gameplay. The primary problem is that the animations are very much broken and I have no idea how to fix them, however that shouldn't stop you from enjoying these three levels over the 5~10 minute experience.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T18:44:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac4/ac42cad6a3320701fd9726a76baaf61f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Winter_d'Atne"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
