{"id": 374413, "slug": "love-thy-neighbour", "name": "Love Thy Neighbour", "name_original": "Love Thy Neighbour", "description": "<p>\"Being \u201cdirect\u201d depends on whom you ask.<br/></p>\n<p>Some people consider directness, frankness, etc, as very rude\u2026others (like me) appreciate the honesty. Personally, I feel like honesty is very valuable\u2026some feel like it prevents hurt, but if you ask me, it just makes things hurt more in the future when the truth comes out.</p>\n<p>I believe that honesty can sting sometimes, but it also shows people you\u00a0<strong><em>can\u00a0</em></strong>be trusted when they need actual truth about important things. Just don\u2019t make a point of being rude for no reason. Tact is a virtue.</p>\n<p>Examples from my life.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Monday</em></strong></p>\n<p>Wife: Does this skirt make my tummy look fat?</p>\n<p>Me: Yes, but you still look cute.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Tuesday</em></strong></p>\n<p>Wife: Do I look good in these boots?</p>\n<p>Me: Not really. It looks like your legs are all squished into them.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Wednesday</em></strong></p>\n<p>Wife: Do you still find me attractive after all these years?</p>\n<p>Me: I still think you\u2019re<strong><em>\u00a0gorgeous</em></strong>\u00a0after all these years!</p>\n<p>Point being, if you tell the truth when it\u2019s uncomfortable\u2026people will know you probably also tell the truth when it\u2019s something positive too. That\u2019s just how I feel about it, and it\u2019s always worked for me. I tell people when something doesn\u2019t look good, for instance\u2026so when I say something does look good, they know they can trust what I\u2019m saying. If I just said they looked good all the time, what would that accomplish?</p>\r\nSo, I think telling the truth and being direct is the best way to live. Just don\u2019t make an art form out of rudeness, because that\u2019s just totally pointless and destructive.\"\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Rob Schark</p>\n<p>All faces generated by GAN</p>\n<p>A concept piece made in a few hours for the Vale Tudo Game Jam\u00a0by:</p>\n<p>Andr\u00e9 Louren\u00e7o<br/>David Filipe<br/>Isaque Sanches<br/>Jo\u00e3o Antunes</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T08:20:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c8/9c885ebc75f9cb701debcde64b505220.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Isaque Sanches", "Jo\u00e3o Eiras Antunes", "David Filipe", "Andr\u00e9 Louren\u00e7o"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
