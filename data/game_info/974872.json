Just earning a listing fee, and there will be no updates in the future. The game will last about 5 minutes, so if you don\u2019t like it, just refund it. If you are willing to support and keep this product, sincerely thank you! ! At first, I decided to sell it for US$0.2, but this is far lower than the minimum price limit on Steam. The game can only be discounted after launch, and the lowest discount at launch can only be 40%. Accroding to Steam policy, discounts are allowed once every two months, and this game will be set to 80% off during every discount season.<br/><br/><strong> WASD Move </strong><br/><br/><br/><strong> K Shoot </strong><br/><br/><br/><strong> U Switch </strong><br/><br/><br/><strong> L Dash </strong><br/><br/><br/><strong> J Charged Attack </strong><br/><br/><br/><strong> J Full Charged Attack \u00b7 Prification </strong><br/><br/><br/><strong> Shooting consumes MP </strong><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-08T06:54:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d2/1d22a12e9282a859a9b0465d829a284f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 275, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CherryPink"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CherryPink"], "esrb_rating": null}
