It's a near perfect throwback to the old books where you are the hero.\u201d<br/>\u201cThis gamebook is absolutely brilliant. The scifi setting is highly detailed and well thought out.\u201d<br/>\u201cHeavy Metal Thunder is, by far, the greatest book I have ever read.\u201d<br/>\u201c...it's a long, extremely well-written story with tons of choices. Very re-playable.\u201d<br/><br/>-- Pocket Gamer (Silver Award)<br/>------------------------------------<br/>\"The kind of deathly sci-fi that you\u2019ll enjoy if you liked Dead Space or the frightening moments of desperation in Gravity.\"<br/>\"Heavy Metal Thunder is a cruel and unforgiving gamebook. It bashes you against the debris of space over and over, and is happy to leave you at the mercy of all manner of terrors.\"<br/>\"The whole thing is presented brilliantly. The skill check and fighting interface in particular makes tapping the screen to stop some dice feel surprisingly futuristic.\"<br/>\"It's refreshingly grim, and manages to keep you entertained throughout its hefty running time.\"<br/>\"Fans of the genre thirsting for something a little darker should definitely give it a look.\"<br/><br/>-- Pocket Tactics<br/>--------------------<br/>\"A big sweeping pulp sci-fi story of impossible odds and encroaching insanity.\"<br/>\"I had a lot of fun with Heavy Metal Thunder, and look forward to future installments.\"", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T04:52:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/228/228e47e54bcd223e798697b3ecc45d3e.jpeg", "website": "http://www.cubusgames.com/heavy-metal-thunder/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Cubus Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Cubus Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
