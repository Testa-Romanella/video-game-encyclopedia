Blessed with the multi tool known as the TriMortem you will make one hell of a mark on the cursed planet. Your destiny is set: to fight until the day you draw your last breath.</p>\n<p>Made with original art, sound effects, and music. Me and my friend made this game in 3 days as apart of #openJam. It was a lot of work but I think it payed off in the end. We are thinking about continuing to develop this into a full game in the future. Comment below what you think about the game and if there are any improvements you would like to see.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Coding:<br/>Isaiah Mitchell<br/>John D.
