If you know that heelys are way cooler than skateboards and love to read a shit-ton of dialogue, then this games is for you!</p>\n<p>This game was created by 18 game design students in two weeks for one of our class modules. The art style and music was partially inspired by a mix of all things 80s and 2000s. </p>\n<p>The game takes place in a somewhat bastardized mix of the UK and USA, mainly inspired by TV shows. We\u2019re from neither one of these places, so it most definitely is highly inaccurate. </p>\n<p>Enter a world of chaos and confusion while trying to get rid of a corpse, that might kind of be your fault. But do try to bond with your friends as well, before you all have to go your separate ways.</p>\r\nFeatures:\r\n<ul><li>3 endings</li><li>~45 minutes of playtime for each route</li><li>A soundtrack that slaps</li></ul>\n\r\nMeet the Characters:\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow us to get a look behind the scenes:\r\n<p>Instagram |\u00a0Tumblr |\u00a0Youtube</p>\r\nThe Team:\r\n<p><strong>Project Management:</strong></p>\n<p>Thanh</p>\n<p><strong>Concept:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Natascha</p>\n<p>Noe</p>\n<p><strong>Writing:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Noe\u00a0(Lead)<br/>Rahel<br/>Julian<br/>Anja</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanics:</strong></p>\n<p>Natascha\u00a0(Lead)<br/>Lenz</p>\n<p>Leo</p>\n<p><strong>Art:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Dana\u00a0(Lead)<br/>Annie<br/>Laura<br/>Natascha<br/>Saniya<br/>Yoshi</p>\n<p><strong>Coding:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Samuel\u00a0(Lead)<br/>Lenz<br/>Robin<br/>Luca<br/>Sebastian</p>\n<p><strong>Sound:</strong></p>\n<p>Leo\u00a0(Lead)<br/>Miyu<br/>Sebastian<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T07:08:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d16/d160d17357be69da5297574d1f42f668.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 210, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Sk8terboii", "LenzKleiser", "aoyuna", "godor", "lholzen", "Dragonstar", "milkimoone", "Tearsontape", "Laourino", "Jestercap", "Luna-Elaine", "Backpain Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
