There are 2 types of enemies : one rushes towards the player, the other one turns while getting closer. There are 3 different shot types, the player can switch between them using the directional arrows. The current shot is displayed in the iPod (color of the album). The shoots are in rhythm : green for piano, yellow for snare and red for kick. Finally, the life bar is in the ipod as well, it is symbolized by the music bar. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Thanks for playing and don't hesitate to bring us some feed back\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enjoy !<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T04:26:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e42/e42a73078c42263df87b3839a1b98694.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Celulo"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
