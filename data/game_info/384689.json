You can only jump from side to side to the closest circuit lines to get to your destination. You will be thrown to 3 different worlds containing 8 different levels.<br/><br/>You have to be careful about the timing and objects that you will meet in your way. Sometimes they will help, but in most cases they will drain your energy, speed up the energy consumption, teleport you to other circuit lines or simply end your escape. <br/><br/>Now get ready ...and don\u2019t get shocked!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-21T03:33:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d43/d43003b4b227a37304e570e215f1c6e5_DTqXOKv.jpg", "website": "https://mobilefunweb.wordpress.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Mateusz Swiech"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Mateusz Swiech"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
