There is one problem though, it doesn\u2019t have the coin to traverse the river that connects the living plane with the world of the dead. But the ferryman offers a deal: if the crow wins in his game, it is free to go. If it loses it must work for the ferryman, who knows for how long.<br/><br/>The <em>Crowyal Game of Ur</em> is an adaption of the <em>Royal Game of Ur, </em>an ancient mesopotamian board game, themed with pixel art aesthetics and some mythology.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n\r\nAlexander Schmidt <br/>Gameplay-Adaption, UI, Git-Master\r\nRobin TrurnitGameplay-Adaption, UI\r\nAndreas BurkhardtsmaierGameplay-Adaption, Soundtrack, Sound-Recherche\r\nGregor S\u00f6nnichsen <br/>Animated Art, UI, Soundtrack\r\nMonika HimmelsbachArtist", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T05:13:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/582/58285184ee7dd85fc4a71500da837937.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lhyxx", "gregorsoenn", "lexusinator"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
