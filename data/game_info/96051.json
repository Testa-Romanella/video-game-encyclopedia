You'll need to oversee mining operations, ensuring that your employers receive an abundance of mineral wealth, if you ever want to transfer back home. Unfortunately, a security AI gone haywire is sending swarms of automated attack drones to destroy the mines, so you'll need to use your Sentinel-class mech to hold them off.</p>\n<p>This is an early, WIP demo of Rust &amp; Dust. It consists of a tutorial &amp; 2 levels; an endless survival mode &amp; a campaign level. Some audio &amp; art assets are placeholders, &amp; there may be all kinds of fascinating bugs. The finished game will have a full campaign, more drones/towers, unlockable weapons for your mech &amp; an expanded soundtrack composed by Robert Arzola. </p>\n<p>Rust &amp; Dust has already been Greenlit &amp; will launch on Itch &amp; Steam when it's ready.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14f/14f3500206cdc761060b2bc268aa2c93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["r00k"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
