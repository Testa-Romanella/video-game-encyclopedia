Each level, and each section of each level is uniquely designed and not repetitive. It would sit at home with classic 8-bit/16-bit games, while also at the same time having it's own original mechanics and feel.<br/><br/>Traverse the city using the motorcycle overworld map, blast and think your way through the levels, destroy the AI brain in each sector, fight tough robot bosses to uncover who is behind the city's AI disruption.<h3>Game Features</h3><ul><li>Blast and think your way through challenging levels and tough bosses in Sentry City's cyberpunk-esque setting<br/></li><li>Unique side-scroller game-play that is part trial-and-error, part reaction time based, and part puzzle.
