Repeat.</strong><p><em><strong>DATAHIT </strong></em>is a game taking place in a dystopian near-future in which a governmental database holding information concerning every person in the country, including location, name, age, fingerprint, residence, job - was hacked by a super-corporation and is now sold to the highest bidder. One of those bidders is <em>SERIAL </em>- a Human Termination Agency. </p><p>You play as one of the agents, strolling around the busy downtown, trying to blend in, find your target using clues from the database, and discreetly terminate them.</p><p><strong>Special Thanks to Stan Erbrink for the sound effects and music!</strong></p><p><em>The game randomly generates NPC names.
