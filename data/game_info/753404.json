Made in almost a week with hardwork and browsing. All the game assets and programing is done by me!</p>\n<p>Welcome To The Perfect Space Invaders Sequel Only Much Better with Lots of\u00a0explosions!</p>\n<p>Its pretty good (relatively), being my first game I have ever published.\u00a0 (Many games have never seen the light and have been buried deep.) If you don't like something or just want to be noticed yelling something tell me in the comments!</p>\n<p>With this game, you are in for various upgrades, ruthless enemies and you will get constant fear when your next collectible will pop up.\u00a0 Unforgiving AND Frustrating!\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls: These are simple and easy to learn. [See in options] WASD to move, Mouse to turn around, LMB to shoot lasers and 'E' to activate/deactivate Shield.</p>\n<p>If I have much support (Donations and other stuff), I will make much better games in the future.</p>\n<p>P.S. Currently working on another game and have fun playing this one :)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T11:20:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2d/d2d24777fbe7eb74dbdeb0b425377000.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Deadpool945"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
