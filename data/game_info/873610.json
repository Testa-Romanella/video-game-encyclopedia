R. Giger, Moebius and the Out of the Silent Planet song by Iron Maiden.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Most of the level was procedurally generated using custom made Houdini Engine assets within Unreal Engine. The 3D models inspired by H.R. Giger were also procedurally made, while I combined the level with some assets from the Unreal Marketplace and Quixel Megascans. The level is largely compromised by my own work using Houdini.\r\n  </p>\n<p>I worked on this game mostly during lunch breaks in my day job, I also used very little spare time during the weekdays after my day job ended, I had very little chance to work during the weekends. Overall, the game was supposed to be entirely made by me, including all the 3D assets, but the time schedule didn\u2019t help.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Still, this jam was the perfect chance to benchmark my Houdini Skills generating open levels with a good detail amount and I must say, that overall, the time employed to develop the game was about 5 days out of 15 days. So,\u00a0I can vouch and say: Houdini Engine is a great game changer,\u00a0and I couldn\u2019t think of any other way of making anything nowadays without it.\r\n  </p>\n<p>I hope you liked my game,\u00a0and you enjoy it!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T08:54:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/079/079a27ee44c86e11da45f5d1431ec8d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Power Nap Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
