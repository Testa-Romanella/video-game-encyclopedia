Enjoy!<br/></p>\n<p>In this retro-themed game, you are stuck in a shifting office building, and you always find yourself back in the starting room when you die, or run out of time.\r\n</p>\n<p>Story: You\u2019ve been casing this office block for a while now. As you break in, alarms go off, guards rushing around, and A strange man in a lab coat runs away. You grab the closet thing you can find, An hourglass. Odd. You find yourself in a small room, with a large, locked door to your left, with 3 padlocks on it. There is also a series of rooms to your right. You will have to fight your way through the rooms, get to the boss, and take his key. After each boss is killed, the journey will get longer and harder. Good luck.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T20:15:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/394/394f74533a8044d3fe16ab6197d1cb5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wobble Blocks"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
