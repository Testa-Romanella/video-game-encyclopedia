Navigate Kamigyo-ku by dragging the next photo onto the white icon.\r\n\n<p><em>Headphones recommended!</em></p>\n<p><strong># Concept:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I wanted to connect real places that are \"joined together\" both physically, and in how they're used by people to connect their everyday lives.</p>\n<p><strong># Blurb:</strong></p>\n<p>I thought I'd make\u00a0a simple puzzle/photo diary that takes the player around my area, showing them pictures and sound clips from the places I went to (and connected)\u00a0this morning (Sunday, Jun 13th).<br/></p>\n<p>To bind it all together, I planned on drawing cute characters that walk through the pictures as the board (and the day) unfolds.<br/></p>\n<p>In the end, I\u00a0spent too much time taking pictures and not enough time coding\u00a0and making it look nice :( so I didn't have time for nice UI or much juice.</p>\n<p>I had a great day in Kamigyo-ku though, and maybe I'll get another chance to show you around. I'm happy with how it came out~</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T16:51:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a9/7a9f4cd023dbb54e41db5f49de030a17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Furl"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
