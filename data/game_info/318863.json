{"id": 318863, "slug": "darkstar", "name": "DarkStar", "name_original": "DarkStar", "description": "<p>ARPG twin stick-shooter. Grab your crossbow and slay everyone on your way to destroy the DarkStar!<br/><br/>Features random loot, procedurally generated enemies, lots of big bad bosses, a somewhat open world and kickass chip-tunes. Choose between 10 skills and different stats to make your character unique.<br/></p>\n<p>Inspired by classics like Legend of Zelda and Diablo. Decent retro graphics together with a tough challenge makes this a game you don't want to miss!<br/></p>\n<p>It also has hardcore (rogue-mode) if you like to punish yourself and an easy mode if you find it too hard. Once you're done, you can just start-over on another playthrough with the same character, only this time the enemies will be even tougher!</p>\n<p>Shout-out to cromwell for the music and strimmlarn for soundfx contributions. Also a huge thanks to all my testers.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7f/e7ffbc2cd011c8e89d0a3c57e09fc33a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["olga32"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
