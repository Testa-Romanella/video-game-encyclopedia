I wrote it at a time when  coffee shops where I live hadn't made up their mind if they should\u00a0stay  open for takeaway or hunker down until the lockdown lifted. This also  explains the somewhat light-heartened tone of this game.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The views on certain hot beverages expressed in the game are not the author's.\r\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T05:53:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e9/3e924abf1ad9c0fc2dcafef5bea770c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PogeSoft"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
