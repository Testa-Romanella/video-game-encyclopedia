To connect two computers, you need to click the mouse or touch on one of the computers and pull the line to the other computer. For a successful connection, there must be serial connection.<br/></p>\n<p>Agree, we often have such a situation that the connection with someone close is interrupted at the most inopportune moment. But have you ever wondered who is behind that very connection? How does he feel? You can find the answer to this question in this game - The Provider. The game is a simplified simulator of the work of a provider, a person who remains in the shadows, but your Internet connection depends on him, whether you are at a meeting in Zoom or Skype, or playing your favorite game. You will have the opportunity to feel what it is like - to establish communication, to lose and find a connection, to visit the other side of the screen. You will establish connection gradually, starting from a relatively small region, ending with the whole world. The main goal of the game is to connect all computers in series with each other in order to establish connection between people. You need to carefully build a connection, computer after computer without crossing nodes, and then you will be able to connect people. To connect two computers, you need to click the mouse or touch on one of the computers and pull the line to the other computer.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T09:50:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d75/d757ac52c1b6f514a645ba13e0013ca8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pr.clato"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
