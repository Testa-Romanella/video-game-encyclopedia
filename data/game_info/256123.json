Although they are different in names, they share almost the same rules with western chess. <br/><br/>Each player begins the game with sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns, each piece moving differently. Pieces are used to attack and capture the opponent's pieces. The object of the game is to 'checkmate' the opponent's king by placing it under an inescapable threat of capture. In addition to checkmate, the game can be won by the voluntary resignation of one's opponent, which may occur when too much material is lost, or if checkmate appears unavoidable. <br/><br/><br/>********************************************************** <br/><br/>Fatbird is greatly honoured to bring you Chess - Deluxe HD and will continue to add new features, please don\u2019t hesitate to rate us, we love to see your support and suggestion! <br/><br/><br/>Fatbird also brings you other games: Ludo, Mancala, Checkers, Tic Tac Toe, Gomoku, Dots, Othello, 4 in a Row, Backgammon<br/><br/><br/>***********************************<br/>If you love FatBird Games, please:<br/>Like us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/FatBirdGames<br/>Follow us on Twitter: @FatBirdGames", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:10:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/072/072206e061ab31fe343592dc6ac6a57f.jpg", "website": "http://www.fatbirdgames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Fat Bird Games"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Card"], "publishers": ["Richard Lee"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
