You decide to give it a go. In the game you are breaking blocks inspired by the artist Georg Karl Pfahler. When you have finished a level you are left with a blank canvas. Why don't you go create something of your own?</p>\n<p>This is a game that was made for a school project. I'm a student at SAE in Brisbane. The objective was to create a breakout style game based on the art from an assigned artist. I have created this project alone with help from my lecturers. Some of the artwork is taken directly from Georg Karl Pfahler and some are created in their likeness. I hope you enjoy this little experience and I hope that you can find your blank canvas.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-24T04:18:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/802/802963efb070b8ecf50e6816d247015e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MrMuZhiE"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
