For some people the game may turn out to be hard, so you must try hard to find out who frightened all Bugs and disturbed the Worm.<br/><br/><strong>From the developer.</strong><br/>This is my first animated project and I want it to be free of charge. It was rather hard to withdraw from the pixel art but the result exceeded my expectations. In the end the game turned out to have good animation and funny characters. If you try hard you can end the game in just a few minutes. I really hope these minutes will make you laugh and cheer you up!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-06T08:19:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bcf/bcf533454970f0bd1da6e941da765857.jpg", "website": "https://www.loginovskikh.com/", "rating": 2.25, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"owned": 158, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 5, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anatoliy Loginovskikh"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Anatoliy Loginovskikh"], "esrb_rating": null}
