I've actually had the prototype project for it lying around as well, so the controls are simple gyroscope for movement (works \"nearly\" the same as if there was a physical ball on on your mobile and you're trying to direct it by tilting the mobile.). The more orbs you eat, the harder it is to control. The game ends when you exit the bounds (fall out of the mobile screen :\"D)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T05:19:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/687/687e24f72aba5c1472ea76fb1bf08ee8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Valzur"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
