Usually a sequel takes the solution to a problem and duplicates it. This is why our expectations of game sequels are often more-of-the-same-but-better. I'd rather see more sequels that brought a renewed level of surprise and novelty, and I'm hoping that's what you find in Flipflop Solitaire.<br/><br/>While Sage was all about trying to capture the feeling of a tight, easy to play, tough to win, zen solitaire game, Flipflop is about knots. <br/><br/>In a typical Solitaire game, like Klondike, you're taking a knot of cards and untying it into sequences. Then you reverse those sequences into clean ordered stacks.<br/><br/>In Flipflop you take your knot of cards and tie it into other, hopefully better knots. Then you untie those knots into the final ordered stacks. Having so much control over the way your intermediary knots are constructed led to a lot more depth than I expected. <br/><br/>I hope you enjoy this game as much as I've enjoyed discovering it.<br/><br/>-zach", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T09:07:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fb/5fbd2c78b4413a62ec0fbee84cbf0f84.jpg", "website": "http://www.flipflopsolitaire.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Zach Gage"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Card", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Zach Gage"], "esrb_rating": null}
