The aim of each level is simple: get to the end while avoiding being shot/blown up/eviscerated by snipers, lasers, heat-seeking missiles, circular saws, and whatever other obstacles inhabit each one. You do have a few things to help you - a bow and arrows, and the ability to slow down time.</p><p>Controls, how to play, etc. can all be found from the main menu. You can use a gamepad or keyboard and mouse; however I would recommend the gamepad for the best experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e6/2e6ab844a80d0f2e7477c75df9c83d53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Conor O'Donovan"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
