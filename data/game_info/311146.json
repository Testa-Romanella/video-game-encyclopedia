I used it as an inner conversation with my inner voice, that one that tells you mean things and makes your life a little imposible.\u00a0Every day is a fight between me and it. Some times i win, sometimes it wins. All the things you are going to read are sentences that appear when it wins.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2.My inner voice is always mean,sharp and hurtful with me. I've tried to show this in the game.</p>\n<p>3.Although all the darkness that appears here, the game\u00a0worked as a therapy for me.\u00a0</p>\n<p>4.Use ARROWS to move and interact.<br/></p>\n<p>5.You don't have to read all the opinions. I encourage you to finish the game directly when you start to feel overwhelmed. Take your time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/915/915919c138e94badf447aa600db57728.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Marc Arroyo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
