I hope you're good at levitation, because baking is all about precision.</p>\n<p>This game was made for Mini Jam 94 where the theme was baking and the restriction that the game can only use two buttons. I think this game uses the limitation well because the unwieldiness of using two buttons to control a floaty physics object to guide other physics objects into a bowl are essential to getting across the game aesthetic I was going for. Let me know what you think.</p>\n<p>I used\u00a0Water 2D for the particles, but tweaked it quite a bit. It's a free asset though and the physics are a bit janky, but it mostly works and when it doesn't, it's kind of funny.</p>\n<p>I had a lot of ideas for the game I didn't end up implementing, like different containers for the ingredients which have different physics, different cakes you have to make, and random dialog that's thrown in while you're playing, but the core elements are all there. I also ended up leaving in some premade assets (like the spout and the weird piece of glass)\u00a0from\u00a0Water 2D that I was playing around with because I didn't have time to replace them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T14:30:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3db/3dbf67ba3d4ef695b17cc4643d1dff73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["overactor"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
