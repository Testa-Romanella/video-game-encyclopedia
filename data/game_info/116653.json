Any comments and advice will be highly appreciated. This is the fisrt chapter of the whole game.</p>\n<p>V\u00f6lusp\u00e1 is a course completion project under development. It is a game that aims to show another view of the Nordic myth of Ragnar\u00f6k, from the perspective of the main character, the wolf Fenrir. It is a narrative game, intended to tell a story, more than challenge the player. Its mechanics are a mix between interactive animation (Dragon's Lair, Telltale games) and narrative choices (Cinders, and Telltale games).<br/></p>\n<p>Its name comes from the prophecy that encompasses both Ragnar\u00f6k and the beginning of the world.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70b/70b90dd6fd1c2ed6706abbbe77a8db51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["maripgp"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
