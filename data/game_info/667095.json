At the end of each day you can buy a gift for your boss, such as a donut that makes him less mad, or an angry note that gives you a money multiplier, but makes the boss more angry. You are constantly on the edge of getting fired.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Warning: The web build is kinda scuffed and was rushed, so if you are willing to download the game, I would highly suggest downloading the windows build.</strong><br/></p><p>Yoink was made for the VimJam 2</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T05:21:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5b/a5b05c1b3a67c7ede382c45312b8f412.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["PumpkinBear111 Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
