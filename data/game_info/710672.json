To accomplish this, the player must use the building full of AC units\u00a0 to control the individual temperature of each room to freeze or melt enemies (sentient ice cream and hot chocolate). The player has a limited amount of energy that they are able to use in order to heat and cool the building.The more ACs on at one time, the more energy will be used. The number of enemies in a wave increases over time, and if the player runs out of energy, all the AC units will shut down.</p>\n\n<p>There is a detailed tutorial level to explain mechanics and settings in this game, and three different levels for players to have fun and challenge themselves. Levels are procedurally generated and different for every play. \u00a0Play the game now, become the AC Captain, save humans from eating too much by your action!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T10:32:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16e/16e3c0a380d61a71fcef4f3f81109149.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["TheBruceSwain", "YifanZheng", "KurtSha", "JefferyXue"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
