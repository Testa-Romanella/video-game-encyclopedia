In it, Travis Barker plays the role of one of the most dangerous criminals ever to roam the streets of Los Angeles, but he's not all the way there yet. He's still a drug lord, but the stakes are much higher.<br/>\nJust like the first game that Travis played, this one is no ordinary superhero. In it, Travis plays the opposite of Daredevil in the MCU, trying to bring down the leader of the Belter Gang known as \"Cousin's Ghost\".\n\nThe game is officially called \"Coulson: The Streets of the No-Name\" and is about the encounter with the villainous family known as the Belter Gang on their turf on the streets of Los Angeles. The game will actually capture the chaos in the streets of L.A. and present a terrifying story for new players to remember and relive in their free time.\n\n\"We felt like we were doing something fun and unique for some reason. We wanted to challenge the fans to remember stories of the no-name characters that always do speak their voices,\" said Travis Barker, Game Director.\n\n\"We've been doing gritty action games and we wanted to do something more in-your-face, with more violence. We wanted to make sure that even the slightest hint of what we were doing was going to have a terrifying effect on the player and the player's emotions and experiences.\"\n\nTravis Barker began his adventure in the Savage Worlds comic series,</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T10:07:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e00/e004d2771fd0bd95db3d1faf2ad268e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
