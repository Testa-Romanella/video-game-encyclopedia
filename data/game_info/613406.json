Basically Rock Paper Scissor)</em>\n\n<p>A game made for Manaki Senpai's birthday in 2 days (+1 of polish), that for some reasons\u00a0was sitting around on my itch unreleased for quite some time now (his bday was around 20 days or so when I'm writing this text). Finally decided to add some sounds, flesh it out a little bit\u00a0and finally publish it into the world. :D</p>\n<p>Gameplay it's really simple, it's just a glorified rock paper scissors: Fireball is strong against Heal, Heal is strong against Shield, and Shield is strong against Fireball...\u00a0Well, it's a bit more than just that: You can only use Heal when you're not at full HP and u Shield\u00a0takes 1 turn to recharge (so u can't spam it every turn), but it gives you a bonus on your next move if you successfully parry a Fireball with it. Other rules (that i may have forgotten) are written in the game menu on the down left corner</p>\n<p>You can play in singleplayer or local\u00a0multiplayer\u00a0(no, sadly I'm not at that level to add online multiplayer yet... i wish i was, but sadly I'm not...\u00a0:/), as well as customizing some game setting as max HPs, damage &amp; heal power. Some Keyboard Bindings are supported (bindings supported are\u00a0written on game UI elements)</p>\n\n<p>Once Again, Thanks Again To The Awesome Peoples Posting Assets On OpenGameArt, I Seriously Don't Know How I Will Do Without That Site...
