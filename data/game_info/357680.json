It's a two player pirate ship fight that runs on the command line because why not. There is also a single player mode where you fight a bot named rob, if you're lonely.</p>\n<p>The game has Ascii art, a few colors, multiple playable ships (each with their own unique strategy/playstyle), music, and sound effects, all on the command line.<br/></p>\n<p>--IMPORTANT--</p>\n<p>You need to have Powershell installed to play this game. \u00a0If you have windows you should be fine. \u00a0To play the game, right click 'pirate.ps1' and select 'run with Powershell'</p>\n<p>Powershell might ask if you want to change your execution policy, which essentially just allows our custom script to run.\u00a0 If you don't trust us you can always look at the included source code to see that this isn't a virus.</p>\n<p>If the two windows don't fit on the screen very well, all you have to do is right click where it says \"Windows Powershell\" in the top left of the window, select properties, go to the 'font' tab, and bring the font size down.\u00a0 I would recommend changing the text window\u00a0to font size 12 for both windows.<br/></p>\n\n<p>--NOTICE--</p>\n<p>The Linux version of the game is in somewhat of a beta state.\u00a0 All the gameplay elements are there, but there is no ascii art or sound effects. \u00a0If you are interested in a more fleshed-out Linux build, please let me know in the comments or at my email address below.<br/></p>\n<p>You can contact me with questions/concerns/bug reports at:<br/>mediumcharliegames@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-31T10:28:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8c/e8c0432d14e212b8913ef762f1896bdc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["mediumCharlie"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
