The theme is \"Stuck in a loop\".</p>\n<p>You play Dolen. A young man who has started a new job and moved into a new apartment. The game shines a spotlight on the issue of balancing work life and personal life. Having less energy from work lowers our motivation to do things for ourselves which can ultimately affect our personal lives but work lives aswell.</p>\n<p><strong>Guide:<br/><em>D - </em></strong>The 'D' at the bottom of the screen is your Dirty meter. This grows when Dolen doesn't clean his apartment. If you show up to work too dirty, you will lose points from your 'J' (job) meter.</p>\n<p><em><strong>J - </strong></em>The \"J\" meter at the bottom of the screen is your Job meter. This grows when you perform well at your job and show up to work clean. This is substracted from when you show up dirty. Each 10 points, you receive a small pay rise.<br/><strong><em><br/>E -</em></strong> The \"E\" meter at the bottom of the screen shows your energy. Don't overdo it and lose all your energy or you won't be able to work harder or do things for yourself at home.<br/></p>\n<p>Move the mouse over objects on screen and click to interact with them. Dolen must go to work each day and decide how hard he wants to work. You have a choice between 'Slack', 'Work' and 'Super Work'. The harder you work, the more energy you consume. When you arrive home, it's up to you to cook for yourself or get take out. Cooking for yourself creates dishes which you'll need to clean but that consumes energy. In the morning you can choose to shower and put away dirty clothes which consumes energy too. Not cleaning will make Dolens dirty meter grow. The dirtier Dolen gets, the less Job meter you will grow and can even go down.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/>Blaise Guy - Programming and Design<br/>James Clark - Art and Design<br/>Michael Ware - Background Music</p>\n<p>Everything made with Godot Engine and Aseprite.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T05:16:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c55/c55c343c364a571c2f84b09bc0dd9704.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["JamesC89"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
