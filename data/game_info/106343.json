The game is playable in French and in English<br/></p>\n\n<p>We all participated to the concept of the game and its story.</p>\n<p> Nighten wrote the script and the dialogue, and coded the game on Renpy.</p>\n<p>Lula made most of the graphics.</p>\n<p>I (Shertigan) mostly traducted the game in english but did also participate a little in graphics.</p>\n<p>Big thanks to Yiev Cactus for his help on the english traduction!</p>\n<p>This was our first Ludum Dare. It was a good experience even if we lost a lot of time on a different conception of the game (we first wanted to make a more interactive version of it on RPG Maker, but we realized we wouldn\u2019t have time to finish it), which is the reason why some graphics aren\u2019t really polished, there is no sound at all and some mistakes are presents in the script.</p>\n<p>To change the language of the game (English or French), just go in the preferences (main menu of the game)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f33/f33d1e7ac1e3db104bf362e67db25917.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["shertigan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
