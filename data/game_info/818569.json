I reached my\u00a0main goal for this jam which was to actually finish and submit a game. I didn't have time to add all the things I would have liked and also had little time to actually properly test the balacing. Nethertheless I think the game is kind of fun and I hope you enjoy it too.</p>\n<p>Quick summary of the game:</p>\n<p>It's a top-down twin-stick survival shooter (no controller support, sorry!) where you clear as many\u00a0levels as you can\u00a0by killing all enemies. <br/><strong>Power-ups</strong>\u00a0are located in the levels and the enemies sometimes drop them. Each item contains <strong>different effects</strong> of a certain category (health, ammo, movement). When an item is picked up <strong>a random effect</strong> of it's category is selected. Now comes the twist: The effect can be<strong> good or bad</strong> for you. But if you pick it up, <strong>you have to take the effect</strong> that was randomly selected. There is no way around it. You can have up to 3 effects, so if you pick up another one, you have to replace an exisiting effect. This can again be a good or a bad thing.</p>\n<p>There are only 6 different locations/levels but they are selected at random and\u00a0the amount of enemies increases with every completed level. So the game is basically endless (unless you die).</p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>\n<p>Oh and I'm very bad at time management, so\u00a0expect many bugs. Also there's no pause menu.</p><p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/>Just me :^)<br/>Sounds: mixkit.co,\u00a0zapsplat.com, sfxr.me</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T11:22:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bfe/bfe3607e1c11e4fd21ddc250dff42638.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ex0o"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
