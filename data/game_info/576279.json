So we carefully made each animation frame based on the actual videos capturing the performer's movements. in this demo you can control her using the mouse in a natural way. move mouse up and she will jump, left or right and she will move accordingly. buttons will trigger acrobatic actions. once she does acrobatic movements, by pressing again right mouse button, the hoola hoop show will start. the idea is to fight \"circus\" monsters using these skills, along with completing dexterity tasks. \u00a0this is a very early stage of development, good for testing mouse controlled movements.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T09:20:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ded/ded48d188e85d8d9a9fa85be63f386ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["henshinhyumanoido"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
