It's a game about planning, timing and discovery featuring an atmospheric soundtrack and cool sound effects!</p>\n<p>Game Features:</p>\n<ul><li>50 hand crafted levels + 50 \"Secret\" levels</li><li>Lots of things to shoot</li><li>A weird menu</li><li>Intuitive controls - all you need is a mouse!</li><li>Lots of music!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Who Am I?</strong></p>\n<p>I'm Michael and I make games and music under the name MGFM. I'm a sound designer and composer who has worked on both big and small games. On Brute I was aided enormously by Tyler Barber who provided graphic design help (logos, colour schemes and some sprites). Tyler also contributed music for the \"secret\" levels. It's great stuff, you should check out his album: https://tylerbarber.bandcamp.com/releases\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please enjoy the free soundtrack which can be found here, composed by both myself and Tyler: https://mgfm.itch.io/brute-ost :)</p>\n<p>The audio in this game is made mostly using analogue synth sounds and I would like to thank Analogue Solutions, Elektron and Korg for providing me with artist rates so that I could afford their incredible devices.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading this and thank you especially if you buy the game, I hope you like it - this is the result of many evenings and weekends hard work. It's a satisfying thing to interact with and it's colourful! I intend to make more games in the future and your support will assuredly help make that happen.</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>\r\nMick<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17c/17c2f72c72dd4f87cd2732f09ef44148.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MGFM"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
