But you don\u2019t get to be the hero this time: you are but the one and only gigantic sea monster: the Kraken.</p>\n<p>As the villain, you can only stop the game\u2019s hero for so long. She can always load the game back to the last checkpoint, grind your minions for experience, and come back stronger each time.</p>\n<p>If you can kill the hero enough times though, the forces of evil will promote to \u2018recurring boss\u2019 and unlock your next form. With greatly increased power, you will reappear at the end of Chapter 2! And try to destroy the Leviathan! But.. only for so long...</p>\n<p>PRO-TIP: if you've defeated the hero 3 times, you should try letting her win.</p><p>If you love recurring bosses:\u00a0http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecurringBoss</p>\n\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong></p>\n<p>D-Pad Left or X Button : Launch whirlwind (left part of the screen)</p>\n<p>D-Pad Up or Y Button : Launch Storm (upper part of the screen)</p>\n<p>D-Pad Right or B Button : Launch Sonic attack (right part of the screen)</p>\n<p>D-Pad Down or A Button : Launch Steam attack (lower part of the screen)<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>KNOWN ISSUES</strong></p>\n<p>When the hero beats, the text sometimes states that you've beaten the hero 0 times.</p>\n<p>The collisions of the powers are based on the particles and are not entirely consistent with the visuals.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p>This game was made for McGameJam 2018 by Eddy L\u00e9ja-Six (design), Alexandre Parodi (art) and Yohann Vaast (code).
