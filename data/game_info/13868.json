In most game modes, you take \u043brole of a Lord and have to develop your castle increasing its population, creating a stable economy and strong military while maintaining your popularity among the people. The game attends both the war and economics aspect. There are many types of resources in the game that can be divided into two groups: food and materials. The townspeople constantly consume food, so the player has to develop a stable production of meat, bread, apples, and cheese. Each of these types of food requires different structures and has different stages of production. <br />\nUnlike most other RTS, each military unit requires a different set of recourse to be created. E.g., crossbowman needs a crossbow and leather armor; swordsman needs a sword and metal armor. <br />\nThe game has two campaigns: military and economic. In the latter, you don\u2019t have to with other Lords, but only wild animals. Besides that, there is a free mode where you can develop your castle without any objectives or time restrictions and siege mode, separate scenarios that do not involve castle building but instead lets player attack or defend several historical castles.</p>", "metacritic": 81, "released": "2012-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-19T05:16:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88c/88c66f471e0b28d3f6711f162ef0848e_IOHyhbU.jpg", "website": "http://www.strongholdhd.com", "rating": 3.96, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 118, "owned": 1837, "beaten": 157, "toplay": 28, "dropped": 101, "playing": 12}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 33, "ratings_count": 306, "suggestions_count": 519, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 308, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["FireFly Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["FireFly Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
