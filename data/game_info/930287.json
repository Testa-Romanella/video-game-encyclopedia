In some worlds this maybe like our own conventions; with panels, guests, artist alleys etc. In other worlds it might be a macabre night market; and rituals performed at the dead of night.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Play as whimsical witches in this D6 dice pool game for 3 - 7 players. Discover and solve your own magical misadventures set up by your convention's coordinator. \u00a0Overcome odds with the power of your coven.   </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Included in this you gain the rules of play, the magic of made family and 6 witchy playbooks; Art, Beast, Garden, Lunar, Tea and Solar. <br/></p>\n\n<p>This work is based on the Buddy System, published by Jessica Marcrum.
