The\r\ncompetitive co-op gameplay encourages players to work together whilst\r\nfighting for high-scores, multipliers and rewards.</p>\n<p>You\u2019re\r\nDoomed is currently in Pre-Alpha, and we have an open participation\r\nin this, you can download the latest build from right here, there is\r\nalso link on our discord (discord.gg/88sNDNE). We\u2019ve been using\r\ndiscord to talk with and feedback to the community, the feedback\r\nwe\u2019ve had from previous builds has been invaluable and made a big\r\nimpact on the development of the game, and we can\u2019t thank you all\r\nenough! We\u2019ll be merging our updates to be seamless across all the\r\nplatforms we\u2019re working on, and we\u2019re looking forward to working\r\nwith the community here to make this game even more awesome!</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>Narrative</strong></p>\n<p>The\r\ngame takes place on a planet sized spaceship, the HMSS (Her Majesty\u2019s\r\nSpace Ship) Robert Falcon Scott, this is a scientific and exploration\r\nvessel designed to explore the galaxy. </p>\n<p>After\r\na night of partying to celebrate Ruby paying off her student debt\r\n(age: 96, occupation: security guard), four members of the Robert\r\nFalcon Scott\u2019s security team wake up near the ship\u2019s core, in an\r\nengineering deck locker room to discover the ship has been overrun\r\nwith an infection and the crew mutated. They must fight their way\r\nthrough the ship to the surface and escape pods before the ship\u2019s\r\ncomputer (who\u2019d really like to escape too!) flies the Robert Falcon\r\nScott into the nearest star.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Game:</strong></p>\n<p>You\u2019re\r\nDoomed is both a single player and local multiplayer game (up to four\r\nplayers), we\u2019ve been working to make the change from single player\r\nto multiplayer as seamless as possible, just pick up another pad and\r\nhit the start button and you\u2019re in! You or your friends can quickly\r\ndrop into a game together whether sat next to each other on the couch\r\nor on the other side of the world.</p>\n<p>As\r\nthe player moves between each room on the ship they will be faced\r\nwith large enemy hordes, which they must clear before they can\r\nproceed with the level. The game features fast paced and intense\r\naction, with a large volume of feedback being driving to the\r\nplayer(s), both on screen and through the gamepad.</p>\n<p>The\r\ngame\u2019s scoring system gives each player a set amount of points for\r\nkilling an enemy, however these points can be augmented by multiplier\r\nwhich the enemies drop upon injury and any player can collect. The\r\nplayer\u2019s weapon is also linked to this system, as the player\u2019s\r\nmultiple increases the weapon upgrades passing through several major\r\nand intermediary steps.</p>\n<p>One\r\nof the core elements of You\u2019re Doomed\u2019s gameplay is \u2018Competitive\r\nCo-op\u2019, where players must work together to get through the level\r\nbut are in competition with each other for points and multipliers.\r\nAlthough the game can be played as a single player experience,\r\nmultiplayer is also at the core of You\u2019re Doomed. There will be a\r\nparity of design between all the game modes (single and local\r\nmultiplayer), i.e. the game will largely be played in the same way.</p>\n<p><strong>Characters:</strong></p>\n<p>Four\r\nplayable characters are being developed for the game\u2019s launch, this\r\nroster features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buck\r\n\tMcLargehuge: A cocky rich kid from Etonberry on Sea, looking to\r\n\tprove his greatness to all.
