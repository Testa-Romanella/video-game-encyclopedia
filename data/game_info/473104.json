{"id": 473104, "slug": "garden-island", "name": "Garden Island", "name_original": "Garden Island", "description": "<p>A tiny game/prototype inspired by Viva Pinata, and Slime Rancher. Made over the course of\u00a03 weeks.<br/></p>\n<p>Grow, and water plants to attract different types of Newliks to your little island.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Once you have attracted a Newlik to visit\u00a0your island, it will need to eat some of your plants before it will become a resident. Once it is a resident, it will eat more plants to regrow the crystals on it's back. Once the crystals are regrown you can harvest them for a bit of money. Don't worry, the Newlik won't mind, it will just go eat some more plants to regrow. You can use the money from the crystals to buy some more plants, and attract some more Newliks!</p>\n<p>Currently there are 3 Newlik variants, and 5 plants.</p>\n\r\nGameplay Info\r\n\r\nPlants\r\n<p>While plants grow they require water. When their water gets low they will begin to flash brown, and grow slower. Be careful, if they run out of water, they will die. But don't over water them either, or they will flash blue, and die if over watered too much.<br/>A plants water level can be seen when looking at it with\u00a0either Empty Hand (1), or the Watering Can (3) equipped.</p>\r\nNewlik\r\n<p>Newliks will visit your garden if their \"Visit Requirements\" are met (which can be seen by opening the Journal (Tab) and navigating to the desired Newlik). <br/>When they visit they will appear as black and white, and will require to eat certain plants (Resident Requirements). The required plants can be seen through either the Journal, or the information window. Which can be opened by looking at a Newlik with a Empty hand, the info window will show you the number of plants that specific Newlik has eaten so far.</p>\n<p>Once a Newlik has fulfilled their Resident Requirements, they will become colored, and be able to grow their crystals. They have Grow Crystal Requirements, once they are fulfilled, their crystal will grow large and be able to be gathered (left mouse button with an Empty Hand) for money.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<strong>Keybinding</strong><strong>Action</strong>W, A, S, DMovementTabOpen Journal1Empty hand2Plant Menu / Planter3Watering CanEInformation\u00a0about the Newlik you are looking at<br/>Left Mouse ButtonGather Crystal when fully grown\r\n\n\n<p>Hope you enjoy this tiny prototype game. Any feedback is welcome, positive or negative!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Some development notes about Garden Island.</p>\n<p>This was made in 3 weeks, as such I decided to not put\u00a0much effort in to\u00a0the art as that would eat up a lot of time if I did. There is some polish lacking, though not\u00a0<em>too</em> bad for a prototype, though I wish I could have added a bit more.<br/>Ideally I would like to extrapolate this out in to a full game. If I do decide to, and you are interested in doing art, or helping with it, please reach out. I would love to talk to you. :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T04:55:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6e/b6eed7ea7210d19cfe97b8e7917ff95f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MechWarrior99"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
