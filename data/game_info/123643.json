I think it's rather pretty, and would have\u00a0done a lot more graphical effects with it but I was lacking time near the end.</p>\n<p>Just type numbers to create your own seed, then press space to generate it. Pressing space without entering a seed will generate a seed for you. Share any crazy seeds you find! :)</p>\n<p>It was created in my HTML5 IDE: GameBeans.io. I have also uploaded the source file which you can import into GameBeans and check out if you wish (in typical jam fashion however, it's not the prettiest, but it is small! :p)<br/></p>\n<p>If it doesn't work, please make sure you're using a modern browser that has good support for modern standards. If you're using IE or Edge, then that's likely the problem!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/724/724c92740a1289772944fbf215e16251.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JackOatley"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
