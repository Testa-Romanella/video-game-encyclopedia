It features many industry exclusives such as active depth control by Amity, and dynamic chain management. It also features hi vis lights so night work is now a breeze during tight harvest windows with your beets. And Lastly it has a gargantuan 10.5 inch scrub one of the largest scrubs in the industry.<br/></p>\n<p>The actual mod itself is a convert of Justin Gilbertson's beet equipment from FS19. But to make it compatible with 22 standards I have added.\r\n</p>\n<p>New Vmask Textures\r\n</p>\n<p>New Fs22 Animations\r\n</p>\n<p>New Fs22 Effects\r\n</p>\n<p>And New Fs22 Scripts.\r\n</p>\n<p>It is fully compatible with and required to be used with the Amity 3700. In tandem these machines defoliate and Lift the beets so you can transfer you sugary cash to the beet pile. One thing to note is that with this version of the mod I have excluded the track config due to some pretty harsh errors that destroy fps. I will bring it back with enough interest but it's not a feature from release. another important thing is that I have made the trailer tongue on this mod without collisions so although it falls through the ground it at least will drag you down less when the tongue hits the drawbar on your tractor. I recommend that you prop up your implement on the ground when you first buy it so you can connect it to a tractor so you can get hydraulic power to lower the landing legs. Just like in real life the landing legs are collapsed as standard and require hydraulic force from the tractor to lower or lift em.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anyways long description over so enjoy.\u00a0For more cool screenshots and project updates check out my FB Page.
