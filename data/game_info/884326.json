Choose from three separate retorts as you progress through an approximately 10 minute long discussion created in the spirit of Louis Malle's 1981 comedy film of the same name.</p>\n<p><em>Each retort will lead to unique dialogue:</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Tell me more: </strong></em>Andr<em>\u00e9</em><strong> </strong>will keep talking.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Trenchant Insight: </strong></em>Wallace will offer some insight of his own.<br/></p>\n<p><em><strong>Bon Mot: </strong></em>Wallace will offer a witticism.<br/></p>\n<p>For many years, I have been thinking about how to turn this 10 second gag into something that can be actually played. The end result is this! <em><strong>Play in browser</strong></em> or <em><strong>download the ROM</strong></em> to play on a system of your choice. I hope you enjoy! <br/>- Gumpy Function.<br/><br/></p>\n<strong><em>CONTROLS</em></strong><strong>GAME BOY</strong><strong>KEYBOARD</strong><em>Move Cursor</em><br/>D-padArrow Keys<br/><em>Select Retort/Progress Dialogue</em><br/>AZ<em>Start Game</em><br/>StartEnterChange Palette (from the Title Screen)<br/>D-pad, A, B, Select<br/>Arrow Keys, Z, X, Shift<br/>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: This is a fan game and not intended for sale or profit.
