Many of them were about me trying to learn specifics of coding and experimenting designs that were too weird to continue development while trying to make something funny with it. These projects were actually made four years ago, and it was part of my plan to take this long to go back to them, make them presentable and release them to the public here.</p>\n<p>Number 6 is weird. It's more an experimentation on what is possible to do than an actual game. I was looking for a multiplayer \"shooter\" in which one player would control the ship and another would control the obstacles, and this is the result.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Use the arrow keys\u00a0</strong>to control the ship<br/><strong>Click\u00a0</strong>on the numbered buttons on top of the screen to generate a repeating pattern.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: I didn't do, nor I claim to own, any of the music or art in this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-23T02:18:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de4/de4675ab85596ed7b21a3a98a0558c03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mauriciojuliano"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
