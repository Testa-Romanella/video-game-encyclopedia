You will need to cook, clean and socialize with your patrons. The place is a bit messy to begin with, but you can reorganize and optimize the flow of customers. Everything is movable, make the place your own! Once you earn some money, you can use the computer to order more furniture and appliances.<br/></p><p>Your customers will give you a review when leaving. Make sure to keep them happy to avoid your rating dropping to zero.</p>\n<p>All art, music and programming for this game was made by me in 7 days for the 7 day roguelike challenge 2023. I've tried to focus on the elements of roguelikes I enjoy the most - rich systems, interactive simulations and a strategic gameplay - while exploring another setting and player motivation than the traditional dungeon crawl. The layout of the cafe is randomized each time, and the customers have various random attributes, so that the game is different each time you play it.<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game, please let me know if you have any questions or comments!<br/></p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>You can play using the keyboard, numpad or a gampad.<br/></p>\n<p>Keyboard:</p>\n<ul><li>Movement: arrow keys or hjkl</li><li>Wait: .
