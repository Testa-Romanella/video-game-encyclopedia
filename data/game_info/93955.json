The icons on the keyboard in the Violet garden are now the right way round.</p><p>Drawn to a mysterious world of imagination, you are tasked with returning colour to this world.  Your only hope is to restore the strange machine that lies dormant around you.  Perhaps by solving each section, and learning the secrets of its workings, you will restore the sky.</p><p>Heavily inspired by Myst, and probably the most complex thing I've made for a jam.  </p><p>Requires mouse + keyboard. Minimal ideal resolution is 1024x768, performance is likely to be more affected at higher resolutions.</p><p><strong>NOTES</strong></p><ul><li>Still a few little bugs here and there, the geometry doesn't always make sense, the line-drawing messes up in a few areas, and it crashes on exiting which seems to be a Unity issue.</li></ul><p><strong>HINTS</strong><br/></p><ul><li>Your goal is to solve each of the seven sections, but one has already been solved for you</li><li>Use a notepad &amp; record anything you think might be useful</li><li>Try and figure out the numeric system, it'll help with a few puzzles.</li><li>Some hints for puzzles may be found in other sections.</li><li>Double-click to skip the walking animation, and press escape to pause, and escape again to quit.</li><li>For more specific hints, consult the Hints.txt</li></ul><p>Tools used:</p><ul><li>Unity 5 (free)</li><li>FL Studio Pro</li><li>Audacity</li><li>Paint.NET</li></ul><p>Special thanks to Sophie Houlden for doing Myst jam.  These types of games have always been a fond favourite of mine, and it was fun to try making even a simple one myself.  </p><p>Original 'sketch FX' inspired by <strong>Keijiro Takahashi</strong></p><p>Pencil texture by Otto Hablizel - https://www.flickr.com/photos/ohablizel/2558232294</p><p>Additional sound effects via Sonniss.com's Game Audio Bundle.</p><p>Additional thanks to my wife Kirsty and Peter Carr for additional testing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/def/def88f2457d47c351a936fa510430344.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 207, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["DragonXVI"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
