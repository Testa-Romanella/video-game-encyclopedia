My name is Daniel Frost, and this is my first game. This is a 2D story based platformer game. It's nothing special and in fact, I will admit that this game is trash. I made this game just to learn how the Unity Engine works. The game obviously surrounds around Joel from Roomie Official(YouTube Channel: RoomieOfficial). So yeah, this game was intended towards his community as a contribution.</p>\n<p>Also, you can find me at https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCRvEaby0Yd1veNjx-OFrbng<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T05:37:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aea/aea234ab4cd18d06003b1c3a7c410bf8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daniel_Frost@RetroBIT"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
