We also used the \"online\" modifier by developing the game to be playable in-browser, and the \"retro\" modifier inspired our zombies-ate-my-neighbors choice for\u00a0art style.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Jam version has some inaccessible scenes and some bugs! We ran out of time, as seems to happen in a 48 hour jam.\u00a0\u00a0I'll probably be releasing\u00a0\u00a0a \"polished\" version after with things straightened out so you can get the rest of the story.\u00a0 :)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hopefully will also be able to upload a HTML5 version of the game for those without flash... if java will play nicely with Stencyl.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: Polished-up-post-jam HTML5 version here:\u00a0https://esmorc.itch.io/fates-hand</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-18T03:03:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f7/9f7f688ab7a9c36e05c65b0e7e50be57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["esmorc"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
