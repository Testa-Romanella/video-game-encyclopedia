Hiragana\" is the first in a series of educational tools that I developed. It is designed to test your knowledge of the Japanese Hiragana syllabary by using a multiple choice quiz format.

If you can score high enough, you should be confident that you're ready to move on. By trial and error, you can rapidly figure out where your weaknesses are and improve. <br/><br/>Version 1.0 was released on October 15th, 2014 for Android, Windows, Mac and Linux, and developed with the Ren'Py visual novel engine.
