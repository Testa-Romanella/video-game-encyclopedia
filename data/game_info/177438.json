(Checked with both XB360 and ps4 controllers).</p>\n<p>Included are build for windows and OS X. (Checked on: OSX 10.12.5, Windows 7, Windows 10).</p>\n<p>Goal: You control the ninja. Get to the end before you lose all your energy.</p>\n<p>To dash (your move / attack) aim with the left analogue stick and charge up with the \u2018x\u2019 button on ps4 controller and \u2018b\u2019 on XB360 controller.</p>\n<p>If you charge for too long the dash will automatically trigger at full charge. Letting go early gives control over the force of the dash.</p>\n<p>The dash is deadly to enemies for 2 seconds but is cancelled upon contact with any surface.</p>\n<p>Each dash loses the ninja 1 energy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Coming in contact with a drone or mobster while not dashing loses the ninja 1 energy.</p>\n<p>Staying still for too long loses the ninja 1 energy.</p>\n<p>Regain all energy by killing an enemy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How our game matches the theme of \u2018Dual purpose design\u2019:</strong></p>\n<p>We believe our game matches this theme as the player character has only one action that is used for everything.</p>\n<p>The dash.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s both how the ninja moves and attacks.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s also tied to his number of charges (effectively life) with dashes losing charges and kills replenishing.</p>\n<p>Staying still causes a tick down to losing charges which means the character has to move and therefore has to kill.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Third-party resources used:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Game:</strong></p>\n<p>Unity Engine 5 (personal edition),</p>\n<p>FMOD (free license for indies and students)</p>\n<p><strong>Audio:</strong></p>\n<p>Logic Pro X,</p>\n<p>Native Instrument\u2019s Massive,</p>\n<p>Valhalla Shimmer,</p>\n<p>Party horn sound under public domain (https://freesound.org/people/soundstack/sounds/203246/),</p>\n<p><strong>Art:</strong></p>\n<p>Aseprite</p>\n\n<p><strong>Link to project and source code:</strong></p>\n<p>https://www.adambethell.io/projects/Dash_and_slash_PROJECT.zip</p>\n<p>https://www.adambethell.io/projects/Dash_and_slash_BUILDS.zip</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82c/82cb84b52a2838f302e1f76361953286.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["AdamBethell"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
