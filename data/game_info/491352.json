Reveal a platform to get across a gap. Cut through a platform to drop down past it. Make a ramp by cutting a platform midway, or even use a platform as an elevator to make it to the goal.<h3>Dive deeper into a mysterious world</h3>Use your power to venture deeper and deeper underground, through forests, caves, and a mysterious laboratory. Something is compelling you, but what? Why are there holes in reality? What awaits you at your destination?<h3>Relax to no-pressure gameplay</h3>Quick respawn times, forgiving platforming, and a calm ambience make sure that you won't get too frustrated. Levels focus on navigation and planning rather than quick reflexes and fast reaction time.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T01:57:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6b/f6ba4e5a8b2df334011da93b80d0b4c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Julian Heuser"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Julian Heuser"], "esrb_rating": null}
