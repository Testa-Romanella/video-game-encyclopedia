Set in a town under attack, players fend off endless waves of enemies\u00a0by building and upgrading towers. As the enemies scale in numbers and difficulty, how long will you survive while they\u00a0descend on the power plant?</p>\n<p>TD Town was created in Unity.\u00a0\u00a0Our goal was to work on our programming and game development skills. This was best achieved by creating a well-known classic, which was a Tower Defence game.</p>\n<p><strong>The Developers of TD Town:</strong></p>\n<p>Paul Gush</p>\n<p>Ryan Wakeford</p>\n<p>Sam Crosby</p>\n\n<p><strong>Special Thanks/Credits:</strong></p><p><strong>Font:</strong></p><p>Awkward by Void -\u00a0https://arcade.itch.io</p>\n<p><strong>Art:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Unit and town tilemap art by\u00a0Aleksandr Makarov -\u00a0https://iknowkingrabbit.itch.io</p>\n<p>Towers and projectile art by Kenney -\u00a0https://kenney-assets.itch.io</p>\n<p><strong>Music:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Gameplay music tracks by\u00a0Swngyill YOON -\u00a0https://yyyn0889.itch.io</p>\n<p>Menu music track by\u00a0Cyberleaf Studios -\u00a0\u00a0https://cyberleafstudio.com\u00a0/\u00a0https://cyberleaf.itch.io</p>\n<p><strong>Testers:</strong></p>\n<p>Thank you\u00a0to our testers for providing invaluable feedback.
