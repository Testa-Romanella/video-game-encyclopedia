Your goal is to combine guns and grab attachments to beef up your gun or swap them out instead to adapt to the waves of enemy types.\r\n</p>\n<p>The city is lost, but you aren\u2019t. Not yet at least. Survive the horrors of a long-lost city and try to make it out alive. Maybe you just might find yourself in the wreckage of a civilization long lost and dead, and face the horror that lingers in these alleyways.\r\n</p>\n<p>The team responsible for creating this game:\r\n</p>\n<p>Team GnG:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Alex Peters - Team Lead\r\n</li><li>Jake Smith - Programmer\r\n</li><li>William Coleman - Level Designer\r\n</li><li>William Martinez - 3D Artist</li></ul><p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T14:41:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c2/0c2ebd0bf59231047e79784569c4391e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CAGD"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
