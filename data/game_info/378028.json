Check out the settings menu. You will find some useful configuration options like the sensitivity of the hammer or the direction of light. Timing options can be configured as well.<br/><br/>The multi-player mode is the most funny part, but it needs some guidance and practice level. You need to be two persons with each having the \"Nail AR\" app installed on its device. Start or reset the App. Then you put both devices next by next, so that they view almost the same image trough the camera feed. Select multi-player on both devices and wait until the pairing process finishes (give it 10 seconds). Press the Game button on one device and the it will start on both. Start Hammering. The better player wins the match.<br/><br/>As always we wish you a lot of fun with this AR experience.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-30T03:55:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5c/d5cb8907f419a55e285a384055b242cf.jpg", "website": "https://zay.ch/mobile", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 237, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Philippe Zay"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Philippe Zay"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
