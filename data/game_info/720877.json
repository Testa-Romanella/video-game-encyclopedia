{"id": 720877, "slug": "where-are-my-deers", "name": "Where are my deers!?", "name_original": "Where are my deers!?", "description": "<p>\"Where are my deers !?\" is not just a Mario-style platformer. This is a short platformer like Mario.</p>\n<p>You have a hard (no) job of finding new reindeer for Santa. You will find out what happened to the previous reindeer when you play. I can only say that Santa has only one deer left. The deer alone cannot lift the sleigh, so you have to find new deer.</p>\n<p>Be careful, there are so many little Grinches in the area where the reindeer are suitable for Santa (Don't ask why). Little Grinches can be in small groups or singly. Remember, this is not Mario for you. If you jump on the Grinch, then the chances are high that you will get back from him.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading! Happy games to you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T08:17:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb8/cb82e98dcd05725a149fdccfbbe5ca06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Rikky_svg"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
