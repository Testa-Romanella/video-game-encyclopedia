Players will control two different characters with different magnetic pole. They need to\u00a0work with each other to solve the problems in their journey.<br/></p>\n<p>To make our game feel more casual, the whole game is designed in 2D style and every player\u2019s sprite, each level\u2019s blocks and trigger are done in traditional cartoon style. For game\u2019s level, the game sees players passing through many blocks with their own magnetism and across a range of increasingly complex levels. We also adjusted the difficulty of each level and minimize the death penalty to avoid having players become too frustrated to complete the rest of levels.</p>\n\n<p>Control:</p>\n<p><strong>Player 1:</strong></p>\n<p>Moving: \u00a0\u00a0WASD</p>\n<p>Change size: \u00a0\u00a01/!</p>\n<p>Gain Magnet Force: \u00a0\u00a0-_</p>\n<p><strong>Player 2:</strong> </p>\n<p>Moving: \u00a0arrow keys</p>\n<p>Change size: \u00a0\u00a0+/=</p>\n<p>Gain Magnet Force: -_</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1a/c1a3717042f69f09b9187af46fcaa956.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["allenf94"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
