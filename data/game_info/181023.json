For a nominal fee, WizCorp can help you HIRE and seamlessly integrate human resources into your business process.</p>\n<p>CAUTION: Thoroughly peer-reviewed and replicated scientific studies suggest that without proper STORAGE, amassing large quantities of aetherium may cause significant time dilation effects. WizCorp challenges the veracity of these controversial claims.</p>\n<p><strong>Concept</strong></p>\n<p>WizCorp is an \"idle clicker\" game where you are producing and converting resources to score points, which can then be spent on upgrades.</p>\n<p>If you let resources build up past a certain point, however, your \"auto-clickers\" will process less often. Note that upgrades later in the chain are less efficient than upgrades earlier in the chain.</p>\n<p>Source: https://bitbucket.org/dylanwolf/LudumDare40<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Tools and Assets<br/></strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Unity</li><li>Aseprite</li><li>\"Press Start\" font from codeman38 (http://www.zone38.net/font/)</li><li>Ludum Dare Resources (https://bitbucket.org/dylanwolf/ludumdareresources)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4bd/4bd902e6e0c7f8170e55a26b0290bc59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dylan Wolf"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
