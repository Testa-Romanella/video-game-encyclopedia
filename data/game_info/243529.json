Every cell represents a room of a castle, with open doors on all sides. You have to draw the map of the castle, closing some of the doors.<br/><br/>The number shown  in every room indicates the total number of other rooms visible from that one on straight lines, in all directions: up, down, left and right.<br/><br/>For instance, if you see the number 5 in a cell, it means that a total of 5 cells are visible from there: maybe 2 left and 3 up, or 1 up, 2 down and 2 right, or some other combination giving a total of 5. <br/><br/>Keep in mind that all the rooms can be reached from every other room: there are no  closed rooms, or closed groups of rooms.<br/><br/>To close a door, just tap on it.<br/><br/>If your guess is correct, the door will become a piece of wall, its color will become dark, and you will hear a \"toc\" sound.<br/><br/>If your guess is bad, i.e. if the door must be left open, its color will become yellow, you will hear a \"deng\" sound, and your choice will be marked as a fault.<br/><br/>When the map is complete, you will hear a musical sound,<br/>and an alert message will notify your success, or the total number of faults.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:14:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c06/c0672115fbb825be38e762ad3df2db5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Luigi Fonti"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Luigi Fonti"], "esrb_rating": null}
