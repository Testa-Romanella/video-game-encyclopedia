(Hyperpixel2022)", "description": "<p><em>Flappy Bird</em>\u00a0is an\u00a0arcade-style game in which the player controls the bird Faby, which moves persistently to the right. The player is tasked with navigating Faby through pairs of pipes that have equally sized gaps placed at random heights. Faby automatically descends and only ascends when the player taps the\u00a0touchscreen. Each successful pass through a pair of pipes awards the player one point. Colliding with a pipe or the ground ends the gameplay. During the\u00a0game over\u00a0screen, the player is awarded a bronze medal if they reached ten or more points, a silver medal from twenty points, a gold medal from thirty points, and a platinum medal from forty points</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T09:46:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3bb/3bb3ab84e5521d83f7e22f4f82a2123b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hyperpixel2022"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
