The island was also made for a cutscene / animation project.<br/><br/>The stars and moon, the lamps and the swords are all pixel art with billboards.<br/><br/>The shell homes are made in blender. The fog was a standard asset. The buildings were combinations of basic cubes made in Unity. Lamps light up when close. Randomization scripts are on the houses as well to make it feel a bit more unique. The ground also lights up as you walk around the city. Island is floating on top of a terrain and there is a bridge leading down into a canyon.</p>\n<p><strong>Press F to toggle animation!</strong></p>\n<p>The Character Model</p>\n<p>https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/demon-spawn-e03eb02bd7574d90b942831ca797bd61<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T15:07:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6b/c6b9c6cd823a4a0ba657aae10b785703.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Deus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
