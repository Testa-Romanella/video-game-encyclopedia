It's a fun little call-back (pun intended) to the days when you had to phone people to help you finish their games.

But thanks to time constraints and the programmer having a lot of rust to scrape off his Gamemaker skills, it became just one level - which maybe was for the best.</p>\n<p>Also, sorry Mac users - the HTML version of the game has all sorts of bugs and Praveen can't figure them out, so only the Windows version works for now.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f04/f04b22e63627c5782cc86f4affefafb8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PNam19"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
