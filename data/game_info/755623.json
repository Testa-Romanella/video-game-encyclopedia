The song in question for the game is <em>Crazy Train - Ozzy Osbourne</em>. But since the song is copyrighted we have replaced the song so we can put it up here.\u00a0You play as the conductor and only staff member on board the Loco Locomotive. Your goal is to make the train reach max speed before the timer runs out!
