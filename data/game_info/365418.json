The player controls Big Pumpkin, a Native-American boy who decided to help African-American slaves to escape after witnessing a cruel massacre against a group of slaves. The player can jump, shoot, climb ladders, crawl through tunnels, steer wheels to move platforms and open doors. Big Pumpkin has several weapons that can be used against the game's enemies. The enemies are wild animals and other humans that support slavery. Weapons include repeating rifle and double barrel shotgun. <br/></p>\n<p>Level objectives are set throughout the game. Objectives include protecting fugitive slaves, rescuing slaves and securing zones. This game combines classic platformers and fast-paced action where puzzles have to be solved to continue to the next level but not before clearing the zone of enemy waves. The game concludes with a battle between Big Pumpkin and a huge army who wants to bring down the underground railroad movement. The first version of the game will include 16 levels (4 different scenarios and 4 levels per scenario).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-16T07:10:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c50/c50b21bf401b4e64940bc39ff28534b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Benhur Ortiz Jaramillo"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
