The valid block is displayed at the right side of the screen.</p>\n<p>\"Cleared blocks\", the ones with black hearths, will take twice as many points from your score compared to the points given by color blocks.</p>\n<p>The \"empty blocks\" have no hearth. If you get one in your path, the game will end.</p>\r\nSpecial thanks<p>I'd like to personally thank to a talented artist and friend of mine that worked with part of the pixel art, Aliz.</p><p>You can find her on facebook:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/AlizRubi23/</p><p>Take a look at her website and get ready to love her art!</p>Planned features\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is just the basic concept of the game, but there are more things to come, which may (or nawt) include the following:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Skills. This will be the RPG part of the game. Once the whole game is functional, the idea is to allow certain skills to be learned and used by different characters.</li>\n<li>Unlockables. Stories of the characters, game themes, pieces of soundtrack. It all requires time now as the unlocking system is already implemented.</li>\n<li>Additional content. No, I don't plan on selling pointless DLC. This game is an introduction to a whole universe (or maybe more). Chakkan aims to create characters, stories and related digital content such as comics or videos.</li>\n</ul>\r\nSUPPORT CHAKKAN\r\n\n<p>\r\n\tThis is a free game and it is intended to remain that way. However, making games is no game at all. Production requires time, effort, passion and a lots of food. If you enjoy what Chakkan offers, any donation you could give to the project will be appreciated.\r\n</p>\r\nFollow Chakkan\r\n<p>\n<strong>Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ChakkanOrg/</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Steam Greenlight: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=821156522</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Blog: http://www.chakkan.org/</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThere you can see announcements, information and participate to make the game and Chakkan grow.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/665/665e021f2b78fa3794a3398458757c7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chakkan"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
