You've hit the edge, when you hear a slight thud of touching the wall.\"</p>\n<p>\"You have a special gun that lets you<strong> hear zombies if you point it directly at them</strong>. The closer they are, the louder they moan. If you hear their heartbeat, regardless of whether you point at them or not, that means they're very close.<strong> Aim with your gun by moving the mouse right and left</strong>. You<strong> shoot by pressing Left Mouse Button</strong> when you point directly at zombie.
