The town was hidden in a large valley in between two great mountains. That village was called \"Eve\". It wasn't a very big town. Maybe only around 60 people lived there, but they had everything they needed and they were happy.</p>\n<p>But on one day, an evil force called \"Nitram\" attacked the town and the surrounding forests.\r\n</p>\n<p>Nitram terrorized the villagers and they saw no other way, than to leave. Most of the people evacuated the village and left to a, what they thought, \"safe place\" through the cave.\r\n</p>\n<p>Nitram started summoning strange creatures and they swiftly took over the whole valley. Only a small amount of people managed to leave the cave fast enough. The rest got caught by the creatures.\r\n</p>\n<p>No one could stop the creatures. All hope was lost. While the people tried to fight against the creatures, Nitram began building a lair on top of one of the great mountains.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>That's where your story begins!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You were out traveling when Nitram attacked and return not knowing anything about it.
