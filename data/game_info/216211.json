This\u00a0can be a hard skill to master, but very rewarding once you do!</p>\n\n<p>Built as part of the 2018 GMTK game jam, this game was based on the theme \"GENRE without MECHANIC\". Think of this as a top-down ship combat game without the usual means of propulsion.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy my little game. please leave comments to give me any feedback you may have.
