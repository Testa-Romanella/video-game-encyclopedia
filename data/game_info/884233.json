The beginning levels are very easy so new players can easily start playing and not get frustrated that they losing quickly.</p>\n<p>Movement A/D\u00a0and Space to move Left/Right and Jump.</p>\n<p>After a few years of thinking, I finally decided to make a game. I am not like everyone and this is not my \"dream game\". It is just a game. I always want to make games. So I come up with a prototype which is playable but for now, is very boring. The reason for that is I hope that people who will play it leave a comment and tell me how they feel about the movement if it is ok or if something needs to be changed. This prototype is very simple, so I want to ensure that it is good enough for most players.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I will add more content and other stuff in the coming weeks, so it can be tested.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Currently, there is only one mode available \"Endless jump\" but the truth is it is not endless right now, you can reach a max 999 level. I DARE YOU to do it.</p>\n\n<p>All graphics are downloaded from itch.io pages currently cause of my lack of drawing skills. But in the future I plan to add my own images.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T14:24:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f73/f7328e0b0c8cbba14f689b9b185a14f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["limakonline"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
