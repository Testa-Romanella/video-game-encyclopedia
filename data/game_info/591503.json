You have to go down there and defuse the bombs! <br/>To protect you, we will provide the prototype of the ORPHEO suit. This will keep you safe from the heat and enable you to fly using a jetpack. Downside is, it is very heavy - so you won't be able walk in it.</p>\n<p>But beware, the extremists have placed many traps in the volcanic caves!</p>\n<p>GOOD LUCK!</p>\n<p>-- END OF MESSAGE --</p>\n<p>Made for LD48 Compo in less than 48h (did not have much time this weekend..), so I went for a classic, short, retro, 80s inspired platformer (my first, actually) with a cheesy story. :rofl: I hope it is playable and has not too many bugs.</p>\n<p>Created using Godot Engine, Pyxel Edit, Audacity, Bfxr, OpenMPT and my Miniak Virtual Analog Synth for this 80s sound.</p>\n<p>The HTML version is playable but has some flicker issues. I am recommending the Windows build.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T05:33:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba7/ba792f2758d670d428a23573f1cf200f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["zondarg"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
