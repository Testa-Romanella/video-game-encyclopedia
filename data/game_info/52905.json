It was released in Japan on November 20, 1997 and in North America on May 5, 1998. It was also re-released for the Japanese PlayStation Network on June 25, 2008. The name Einh\u00e4nder is German and denotes a type of sword that is wielded with one hand, here used to refer to the single manipulator arm possessed by the player&#39;s spacecraft.<br />\nThe game is based on the story of Endymion and Selene and set in a fictional future during a war between the Earth and the Moon. The player is part of the Moon&#39;s forces and must invade enemy territories to gather reconnaissance and enemy weapons. The music of the game was composed in electro/techno style by Kenichiro Fukui and was published in Japan as a soundtrack album. The game received positive reviews from critics, who praised its gameplay and graphics, but felt the game&#39;s short duration and lack of two-player mode were minor flaws.</p>", "metacritic": 89, "released": "1997-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-26T23:49:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14b/14b794ccd109a0f98f8b3ea6313043e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.22, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 9, "owned": 18, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 9, "dropped": 9, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 323, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": ["Square"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment", "Square"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
