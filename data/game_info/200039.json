Place units by selecting one from your selection bar and dragging it on the field. Or just click to select and click to place.</p>\n<p><strong>Units</strong></p>\n<p>The units will move on their own, you have no direct control. They will move to the other side, if not distracted by enemy units. Units of different types behave quite different:</p>\n<ul><li>The tank will ignore all units but the Cannon. He will try to kill the cannon, if he sees it.</li><li>The Cannon will not move but will distract the Tank and also shoot any ground units.</li><li>The Shooter Group are 5 little shooters - fast, deadly but easy to kill. They will attack both ground and air units.</li><li>The Airplane is the only air unit. Most units cannot reach it, while it unleashes a rain of bullets.</li><li>The Spinner does area damage in a small radius around it. Otherwise it's pretty tough and can act as a small tank.</li><li>The Impaler has a spear that does enormous amount of damage, although quite slowly. It is fast as well, so can be used as a runner, like the shooters.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Turns</strong></p>\n<p>The two players take turns. Every turn lasts for only 5 seconds, so be quick. Or you can use the whole turn duration to give your troops some time to hack and slay.</p>\n<p><strong>Cooldown</strong></p>\n<p>After using a unit, it will be locked for 20 seconds to prevent you from spamming too much of the same units :)</p>\n<p>Have fun and leave comments!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5d/f5d8a709f14cbf8fb211488848d93029.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["reddogstone"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
