{"id": 528704, "slug": "construction-playground", "name": "Construction Playground", "name_original": "Construction Playground", "description": "Control tough vehicles, heavy machines and powerful tools on a vast construction site - in virtual reality. In the final version of the base game, you will even be able to control a tower crane, to use two types of hammers to tear down walls and to build walls brick by brick. All features will be completed and optimized during Early Access. Additionally, there will be missions for aspiring builders to complete.<br/><br/>In addition to the base game, more vehicles and construction machines will be available for purchase as DLC at a later time. Current ideas include, but are not limited to wheel excavators, vehicle cranes, concrete mixers, crawler cranes and excavators, caterpillars and potentially even chainsaws and harvesters. Some new content might lead to new scenarios. And of course, each DLC will contain new missions, too.<br/><br/><strong>An overview of the features planned for the base game:</strong><br/>Using the tower crane, you can distribute building materials at the construction site. Move a charging bucket, pallets of stones or prefabricated wall parts off a flatbed truck. After demolishing a building with a hammer or a hammer drill, fill a container with the rubble that will be taken away by a dump truck. Build a wall, laying brick after brick, held together with mortar. Which of course you have to unload and mix first.<br/><br/>There is no better way than Construction Playground to let off steam playfully by demolishing a building, use massive construction vehicles and feel as if you're in the middle of a construction site - all in VR! It's an immersive VR experience on the construction site!<br/><br/>A list of the planned features to be implemented during Early Access was published in the forum here on Steam and will be kept up to date.<h3>Features (Early Access start):</h3>- experience a detailed construction site<br/>- control a tower crane<br/>- control a hammer<br/>- lay bricks<br/>- move around with teleportation<br/>- to be added during Early Access: day/night mode, tutorial, missions<br/>- integrate user ideas where possible, make the game ready for additional DLC<br/>- support for HTC VIVE, Valve Index and Windows Mixed Reality, Oculus Rift should work too<br/>- lower price than the final version<h3>Features (Final version *):</h3>- experience a detailed construction site<br/>- control a tower crane<br/>- control a hammer and a hammer drill<br/>- build walls brick by brick, including mortar<br/>- move around with linear movement or teleportation<br/>- day/night mode<br/>- tutorial<br/>- missions<br/>- support for HTC VIVE, Valve Index and Windows Mixed Reality, Oculus Rift should work too<br/>- additional DLC to expand the game<br/>*subject to change", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T02:44:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41d/41d27fd7b734d4a22df0d4a7b2c17186.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 236, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sunlight Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sunlight Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
