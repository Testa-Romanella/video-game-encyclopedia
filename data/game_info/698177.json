It is simple and you just use W and A or the arrow keys to move around and dodge the asteroids. Also gameplay on mobile will not work as there is no joystick system\u00a0so playing on desktop is recommended. If the screen is way too big then just zoom out through the web browser settings.</p>\n<p>Hope you Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T06:33:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a5/6a5ea8b8b737a5e6b910427cd38e877e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TitaniumDrizzle64"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
