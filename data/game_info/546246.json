This prototype was made using Jumper, a framework agnostic pathfinding library written in Lua.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What turned out to be more complicated was a common challenge in pathfinding based games: Cutting corners and tunneling through walls you are not supposed to be able to go through. I\u00a0ended up removing diagonal movement and only included orthogonal movement for this prototype.</p>\n<p>The dream is to make a with diagonal movement in open areas and orthogonal movement in closed spaces to avoid cutting of corners. I'll probably return to this problem later.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T08:04:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bcb/bcbb2fac6d49b3b1d9a6fd19cacc165a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["MASA"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
