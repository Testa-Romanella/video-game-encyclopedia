And each time you try to leave, the party gets stranger and stranger.</p>\n<p>This is my fourth Twine game/IF and fifth for my Twine/Game-A-Month series. This one's another short one, and easily my most linear yet. But I had this dream about looping parties that get stranger and stranger and felt way too inspired to not make it.</p>\n<p>Out of any of my projects, this one has the ending I'm most proud of. I just hope I set it up well enough.</p>\n<p>Credit to my patrons for their continued support!
