{"id": 569103, "slug": "cupcat", "name": "Cupcat", "name_original": "Cupcat", "description": "<p>Description\r\n</p>\n<p>Cupcat is a game about a cat rolling through a dark house to get the attention of a human by breaking his TV in order to free itself from the cup on top of its head. It can only navigate throughout difficult layouts and hostile pet dogs in order to find its salvation.\r\n</p>\n<p>Theme\r\n</p>\n<p>The game uses the theme of Speechlessness in its narration and storytelling without direct explanation, as well as in the inability for the cat to directly address the human.\\\r\n</p>\n<p>Secret Ingredients\r\n</p>\n<p>We use the secret ingredient of confusion through the use of limited vision and the puzzles you need to solve to break the tv and get your owner\u2019s attention.\r\n</p>\n<p>We also use the secret ingredient of touch through the cat\u2019s rolling and navigation through contact with walls and other objects, as well as the only way it can notify the human being through direct force.\r\n</p>\n<p>Finally, we use the secret ingredient of tragedy through the cat\u2019s unfortunate tale of being stuck so badly in the cup, the dogs that are fellow pets obstructing it, and, because of the cup, being unable to ask him for help in removing it.\r\n</p>\n<p>X-Factor\r\n</p>\n<p>The x-factor for this game is the vision system. The cat\u2019s vision varies with the state of the cat and follows the player through the levels, allowing the theme of confusion to work and requiring exploration and discovery to happen throughout the game. It helps illustrate the helplessness of the cat wandering through its home in search of help.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T04:26:38", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ryan Gehrlein"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
