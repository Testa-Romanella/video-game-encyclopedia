After first day of development most of the core game was in, but collision detection was getting to me. After another day of development I was able to correct this and finish off the base game. Third day added a timer and a title screen, and a way of playing a new round once finished.</p>\n<p>Use directional buttons to move your boxer, use twist buttons to punch (clockwise for left punch, anti-clockwise for right punch). Push down button resets game after a round completes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T14:33:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/281/281642ba76ff11fd5f83eca418d25454.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mikebloke"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
