(With the possibility of converting it into an analogue game)</p>\n\r\nStory:\r\n<p>Inhabitants from the medieval city of Rothenburg are seeking eternal fame and glory. They want to achieve this by exploring the dungeon from a seemingly abandoned castle near the city. However, the dungeon is owned by a lady who is not amused with their attempts to seek glory because they are ransacking her beautifully organised basement. Your goal is to guide one of these inhabitants to the end of the dungeon and hopefully amass enough Hero Points to be remembered for eternity.</p>\n\r\nHow to play:\r\n<p>Drag an drop your hero card onto the next card. <br/><br/>Your hero has four stats:<br/>Green: Attack<br/>Blue: Armor<br/>Red: Health<br/>Yellow: Hero Points</p>\n<p>They\u00a0decrease or increase by picking up items or fight against monsters. You need to find the gate to next dungeon floor to progress further. Remember, you always strike first, so think ahead.\u00a0Good luck!</p>\n\r\nThe folks:\r\n<p>Daniela Meinhardt (Art &amp; Idea)<br/>Fabian Schober (Implementation &amp; Management)<br/>Guido Prodnik (Game Design &amp; Organization)<br/>Peter Hafele (Sound &amp; Music)<br/>Regina Steinberger (Narration)</p>\n\r\n--&gt; GitHub Repository", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T04:30:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31b/31b437a9fe6754343df4036c8b3049e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Kruemelkatze", "Calidor", "noermel"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
