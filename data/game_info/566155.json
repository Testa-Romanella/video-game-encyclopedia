In this game you control sacks of cash that try to escape their robbers! The hook is that every time you slip, you drop your coins, and the next sack you control can pick them up, increasing your coin amount!</p>\n<p>Everything in this game was made by me myself. The art was made by me and code. I decided to challenge myself a bit more, and made this in one day instead of three!</p>\r\nJam\r\n<p>The theme of the jam was Failiure is Progress, And in this game Failiure is you slipping and losing the coins, and Progress is you collecting those coins you dropped, adding onto your score. The timeframe of this jam was three days, but i made this game in one day, as i wanted to challenge myself a bit.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>[W] - go upwards<br/>[S]\u00a0 \u00a0- go downwards<br/>Mouse - To navigate buttons</p>\r\nBabble:\r\n<p>This is actually a first gamejam game i have published in itch.io!
