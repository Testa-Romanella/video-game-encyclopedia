Try, (and fail) to make it past 3 (soon to be 6) rage-inducing levels!</p>\n<p>This game contains a lot of trolls. Disappearing and invisible blocks, unpredictable and bizarre AI, cats shooting fireballs, a very weird storyline, terrible art (i tried ok) and a troll music track and other sound effects.</p>\n<p>This game isn't even remotely fair and will (hopefully) induce a lot of rage. That's intentional.</p>\n<p>This game was a 2-week-challenge project and so likely has numerous bugs. If you notice one, please contact me or leave a comment!</p>\n<p>Controls\u00a0 | Description<br/>------------- | -------------<br/>WASD\u00a0 | Move<br/>ESC | Main Menu<br/>Space/Click | Skip text</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82f/82f1be6278e00f7324671e9c9c262377.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Vladiator"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
