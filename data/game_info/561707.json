Simple and fun, a cool game made by cool people if I do say so myself. I've nothing further to say because it is late (or early I suppose) and\u00a0I am tired.</p>\n<p>Code and most of the graphics\u00a0by me (robotabc773) and Great_Guy96, title and title graphic\u00a0by Guilloteen12, music by Koopstrooper, brainstorming and moral support by Shenanigans, Bruce Wayne, AEMARR, and firebolt973</p>\n<p>Note - The game may fade out and then not fade back in when switching levels when using the Web version. This shouldn't be a problem with any of the downloadable copies, and a simple refresh should make the game normal again, though you will lose your progress.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T07:26:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b71/b710a6355b6b3949a55060d7d487808b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["robotabc773", "Great_Guy96"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
