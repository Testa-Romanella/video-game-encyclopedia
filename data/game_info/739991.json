Now, the once great land of the Moth is a ruin left for you to explore.</em></p>\n\n<p>This rpg maker game takes some gimmick of the metroidvania genre - exploration of an interconnected world\u00a0and the use of some capacities scattered in the world needed to progress - in a 2d-platformer style inspired by game like LISA.</p>\n<p>My plans for this game are more \"modest\" than my other - mostly unfinished, lol - projects. I'll try to make it from the beginning to the end\u00a0fast and then add more optional contents whenever I feel like it.</p>\n<p>For now, the available demo let you explore the first area and fight two bosses.</p>\n<p>There is ennemies, some NPCs (not that much for now, but you'll see more of them in the future), an interconnected map, some collectibles and a healing system inspired by dark souls 2.</p>\n<p>I hope you will enjoy the game, I really like working on it right now, hope this will stay like this for a while !</p>\n\n<p><strong>GAME INPUTS :</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- arrow keys : move</p>\n<p>- Enter or Z : interact with NPCs or items / jump small cliffs.
