Any support on\u00a0itch.io,\u00a0Twitch, Patreon and subscribing to him on\u00a0Youtube will be amazing :)\r\n</p>\n<p>The full game has 5 levels. You use a\u00a0jetpack to fly around the floating islands and platforms, collect different weapons and\u00a0ammo, shoot and blow up aliens and drones and\u00a0collect items to get to the portal in the building with the cosmic globe above.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>We have added this game's 5\u00a0levels as separate games. The full game is the toughest because it has all 5 levels to get through with the same amount of lives as single levels.\u00a0 Single levels are great practice before taking on\u00a0the tough\u00a05 level game.\r\n</p>\n<p>Psychedelic Shadow will soon be streaming this game and others of ours on Twitch :)\r\n</p>\n<p>7-zip is a free unzipping program. When you have unzipped and opened the main folders\u00a0you will find the application file that has the red GameGuru icon and you double click on that and the game will load. In the game's About section in the main menu it explains exactly what to do and gives you the game's controls.\r\n</p>\n<p>Please also kindly\u00a0help\u00a0support us by donating to our\u00a0itch.io\u00a0games and\u00a0subscribing to our\u00a0Youtube channel, thank you :)\r\n</p>\n<p>Our email address is\u00a0grenadeware@gmail.com\u00a0should you like to contact us.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T09:05:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/509/509e9d768e3a6c61f4dd02dad39f713a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Grenadeware"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
