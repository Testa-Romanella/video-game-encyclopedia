There's no persistence between floors and no win state. Ran up against a number of game breaking issues right at the end. I hope to iron some of the bugs out in the near future and release an update.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T06:57:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30e/30e738851a02237fb5f23fd9806cc91b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Aran"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
