It will be frequently updated and will change drastically based on community feedback.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This alpha is free, but donations are appreciated, not incentivized. <br/></p>\n<p>Null Faint Phantomra is a passion project of mine and is something I hope to share and shape into a decent game over time. However, I can't get diverse feedback if it's just me and a few friends, thus this little demo was created to get much needed feedback.</p>\n<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\r\nThe story\r\n<p>You control Neoni Cryptionax. She's a Wraith who is working for Nevion as a <br/>\u201cViral Entity\u201d Hunter. She uses her power over the Phantomra to generate volatile matter in the form of projectiles and a large weapon. <br/><br/></p>\r\nConclusion\r\n<p>I should emphasize that this is very early and buggy, but I hope you can have some fun with it.<br/></p>\r\nControls :\r\nAction<br/>Keyboard&amp;Mouse<br/>Xbox One Controller<br/>JumpSpacebar(A)<br/>Look <br/>Mouse Movement<br/>Right Stick<br/>DodgeShift(RT) Right Trigger<br/>SprintShift (Hold)(RT) Right Trigger (Hold)<br/>Light Attack<br/>Left Mouse Button<br/>(X) <br/>Special Attack<br/>Q(B)Heavy Attack Slam (In Air)<br/>Right Mouse Button<br/>(Y)Change POV<br/>Middle Mouse Button<br/>Right Stick Click<br/>Inventory Menu<br/>Tab(Change View Button)/(Select)<br/>Main Menu / Pause<br/>Escape(Menu Button)/(Start)<br/>\r\n\r\nDebug Controls (Temporary) :\r\n1-3 (Change FPS(30/60/120))\r\n0-(Noclip)\r\nK-(Kill)\r\nJ-(Ragdoll)\r\nP-(LevelUP)\r\nSystem Requirements (Not Final) : \r\nLow-End 30 FPS Gameplay (720p)<br/>High-end 60 FPS Gameplay (1080p)<br/>CPU : AMD Ryzen 7 3750H<br/>GPU : AMD Vega 8, GTX 1050<br/>RAM : 8GB<br/>STORAGE : 5 GB<br/>OS : Windows 10<br/>CPU : AMD Ryzen 5 3600<br/>GPU : GTX 1650, RX 570, RTX 2070<br/>RAM : 8GB<br/>STORAGE: 5 GB<br/>OS : Windows 10<br/>\n<p>This game was, tested on both a high end 2070 class PC and a low-end Vega 8 class laptop.
