In the sewers you find monsters that end up murdering or not murdering you, depending on how much of an ultimate gamer you are. Good luck.\r\nACTUALLY USEFUL INFO:\r\n<p>You are the white dice with a blue outline, and in the beginning of your turn you roll yourself and your dice's number dictates the amount of times you can move. <em>So for example if you get a roll of 5, you can move 5 times before the enemies can move again.<br/></em></p>\n<p>All of the enemies move only once, except for the red dice enemy that you can find after level 4.</p>\n<p>After each cleared level, the Golden Dice shop opens at the right of the screen, where you can buy extra damage or extra health.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When you clear the whole game, you are presented with a golden dice collectable, if you pick it up, on each next replay you can see a little marker at the top right of the screen, indicating you have completed the game.<br/></p>\r\nCREDITS:\r\n<ul><li>Bitty Font: https://masharcade.itch.io/bitty</li><li>Sound Library: https://github.com/RiptideStudio/SoundLibrary</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T03:26:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/671/6715ffdf7ccfe782a37540c49ea31ece.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lennyi"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
