This is only a demo. A prototype if you will. This is not a fully fleshed out game.</p>\n<p>You can ONLY equip the ax and dagger at the moment. There are shields and swords that you can collect. At some point I'll update this so they can be equipped.</p>\n<ul><li>W,A,S,D or arrow keys\u00a0to move.</li><li>Mouse 1 to interact and attack.</li><li>I (eye) toggles inventory.</li><li>Mouse 1 to interact with inventory. Long press to view inventory item details.</li><li>1 to equip the ax, 2 to equip the dagger.</li></ul>\n<p>Expect a 10-20 minute play through to solve the puzzles and collect the optional treasure.</p>\n<p>This was a project I created to learn Unity 3D from scratch and also build out the game mechanics I want to incorporate into an actual game. I'll probably keep updating this over time as it's a sort of sandbox for me to try new things. I'd still like to incorporate blocking with shields, equipping better weapons and maybe health power-ups. I'll also be playing with better textures and more detailed architecture.</p>\n<p>Sorry for the hefty download size. There's a lot of stuff I did in the beginning that I\u00a0learned to do better later on. Better use of prefabs, better texture management, etc... I'll probably clean that up over time.</p>\n<p>99% of the assets used are free from the Unity Asset Store with the exception of a couple textures and assets from Jimmy Vegas's YouTube tutorials and a few models and textures that I created myself that I\u00a0couldn't find a suitable free version elsewhere. Most of the sound effects are CC0 clips from freesound.org.</p>\n<ul><li>Title music: \"She Turned me into a Lute\" was written and performed by a good friend David Fox.</li><li>Level background: \"Benedictus\" by Heinrich Isaac arranged and performed by David Fox.</li></ul>\n<p>Comments and suggestions are welcome. If you have any ideas that you think would be cool to include in here let me know!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-01T03:16:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e31/e3173d70dfcc9c7cc3388018a395cf89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fourth Woods Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
