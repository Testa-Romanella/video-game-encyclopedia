The walls crack roughly every 10 seconds around here! I'm not kidding.</em></p>\n<p><em>Send your team to fix it when that happens - the customers don't like it. And when customers are not satisfied, that's bad for business. You might get fired for it.</em></p>\n<p><em>Also find a therapist. This place can drive you nuts.</em></p>\n<p><em>Best regards,</em></p>\n<p><em>The previous guy.</em></p>\n<p>You pause for a moment after reading. Is this a prank?
