After 5 years it's my first gamejam where I tried to deliver a real game. After 5 years you realize what you didn't get and where your limits are. 1 week time, a flu and several customers who urgently want to have something ready. It was a lot of fun and it was just as chaotic as the game got.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A big thank you to Kindred and Jana for the great jam and Happy Birthday again!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T18:22:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f6/3f6a6aed39235425473b859e56c6e4b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Abandoned Game Dev"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
