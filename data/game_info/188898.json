So far I have created a simple world generator with an in-game UI and then added the ability to add cars that drive around the gamespace. <br/></p><p>Things I would like to add are: <br/></p><p>- Improved driver AI (stopping at junctions, not driving through other cars etc.). <br/></p><p>- An improved environment with 3D models etc. <br/></p><p>-Trafficlights, pedestrians/pedestrian crossing <br/></p>\n<p>This is where I will be uploading newer versions of the project as I work on them. I am also keeping a blog over at myunityjourney.wordpress.com where I will show and explain the code used. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4eb/4ebd8868527866b2dafba9577d99402d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["davidcnath"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
