Your job is to balance the voltage across the integrated boards to prevent short circuits while the company's software is running.</p>\n<p>The technology evolves really quickly, so with each software upgrade your task is getting harder and harder.</p>\n<p>Will you be up to the challenge?</p>\n<p>Your task is to connect the entry node (Battery) to the exit node (Output) using the items available in your inventory.</p>\n<p>Items in your inventory can transmit electricity. Electricity can be delivered from any direction available for specific item and will be passed to all others directions that the element has.</p>\n<p>\u00a0This sign represents\u00a0<strong>battery</strong>, there is the entry point of the electricity</p>\n<p>\u00a0This sign represents <strong>output</strong> to which you need to connect the battery.</p>\n<p>The numbers you see on the board are the <strong>voltage value</strong> contained in a specific node. When you put something from your inventory on the node with a value, you will add that value to the\u00a0<strong>balance</strong> as long as that item is connected to the path that is connected with the battery.</p>\r\n\u00a0This number represents the current\u00a0<strong>balance</strong>.\r\n<p>To complete a level, you need to place items so that the balance of the entire path is 0. So you need to connect input with output and have a balance equal to zero.<br/></p>\n<p>When you put something on a node, you won't be able to see the value under that node, but the value exists. To see that value you need to navigate to a specific node and that value will be displayed on your UI.<br/></p>\r\n\u00a0Voltage value stored in the selected node.<br/>\n<p>Some nodes in-game are occupied from the beginning of the level;</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Nodes that look like that\u00a0are\u00a0<strong>Blockers</strong>. They have no value, cannot conduct electricity and cannot be deleted. You need to build a path around them.<br/></p>\r\n\u00a0Nodes that look like that (with the little\u00a0squares at the corners)\u00a0behave like normal items that you can place\u00a0but they cannot be removed or rotated. You can use it to build a path but it's not mandatory.\r\n<p>Do not create looping paths or you will <strong>short-circuit</strong>!</p>\n<p>The game may contain bugs. In case of fire please refresh the page :)<br/></p>\n<p>There are 5 levels available so far.</p>\n<ul><li>Art: <strong>Snaki94</strong></li><li>Code<strong>:</strong> <strong>Xen</strong></li><li>Special thanks to <strong>Trix </strong>for the SFX pack</li><li>Made with <strong>Unity</strong></li><li>All resources were obtained from\u00a0Nokia 3310 Jam Resources\u00a0or created by devs.</li></ul>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T04:54:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b84/b845477a3d4f45ece6abd81f4ccd8cf1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["konrad9001", "snaki94"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
