I wanted to share it in case it is useful to anyone else, but I cannot guarantee frequent updates or patches. This tool is probably a bit buggy.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Due to the amount of views this page is getting, I'm considering making another editor specifically designed to be released and used by other I'm looking at options for what to make this in, and it will probably either be Java (Swing) or C++/SDL (ImGUI).\r\n</p>\n<p>This tool will be released in an updated, more polished version designed for custom level creation for Scorpion Skirmish. A link will be provided to the game and new editor pages in due course.\r\n</p>\n<p>If this tool was useful, please comment and let me know how you used it!\r\n</p>\n<p>The documentation and guidelines for use are basically non-existent, sorry. Instead comment and I will do my best to answer.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong><strong>:\u00a0</strong>You need to supply your own tileset image, although a default is provided.\u00a0Save it in\u00a0<strong><em>assets/tilesets/</em></strong>\u00a0as\u00a0<strong><em>tileset0.png</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Format:\u00a0</strong>The resulting level map is found in\u00a0<strong><em>levelmaps/</em></strong>\u00a0as\u00a0<strong><em>map.json</em></strong>\u00a0and is is split into 8x8 chunks. Each chunk is a 2D array, and each element represents a block and the tileset the block is from. The elements contain\u00a0<strong><em>-1\u00a0</em></strong>if the block is empty (i.e. air), otherwise the value is an integer representing the index of the block from the tileset. Blocks are indexed starting at 0, counting from left to right, then top to bottom. Elements are in the form \"t:x\", where t is the tileset number (which is dictated by which of the tileset palettes you copied that tile from) and x is the tile number. The format may change slightly in future updates.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Warning:\u00a0</strong>Although files for Linux and Mac may be provided, these are not officially supported, and have been compiled\u00a0by contributors.\u00a0The software is therefore provided without warranty of any kind, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.
