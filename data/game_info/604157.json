Like the real world, the tasks in this game are very mundane. You\u2019re stuck working at a busser job at this mediocre caf\u00e9. Everything is very bleh but once you finish your tasks, you enter this new area where it gives you a moment to just breathe. Sometimes we get so caught up in life that we forget to appreciate and reward ourselves with some peace and quiet. I want my audience to feel a sense of relief once they reach the final area because they have worked hard and they earned it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T04:26:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c7/1c70019e5bd953eff52d3ecdf968a731.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Amy Zhang"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
