The UI is extremely lacking and right now the game auto-starts when first opened. There is also only one level, but as soon as one enemy dies a new one spawns making it possible to grind the enemies until the player dies. Oh right, and sometimes the player will get a force and auto-move, but if you keep moving that problem is solved! :D</p>\n<p>Music by TeknoAXE<br/>http://teknoaxe.com/Link_Code_3.php?q=1661</p><p>Code written by Liioni and inspired by Brackeys tutorials! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T07:23:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbc/fbcb412c90cc25c13a0fbb1847a16598.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Liioni"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
