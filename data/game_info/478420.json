His father can do all 10 rewinds a time, but this game is not about his father:)</p>\n<p>Help this Tiny Rewind Alien to find exit from these confused rooms. You'll face a lot of buttons which should be pressed, laser walls, and even Sleepy Green something.\u00a0Use the most winding paths, then call\u00a0Rewind!</p>\n<p>I will be very grateful for your feedback!</p>\n<p>I hope you'll enjoy the game!</p>\n\n<p><strong>I'm sorry for that, but I accidentally uploaded two versions for Linux.
