You as the player wake up in one of the cells and need to get out of it. You can have <strong>ONLY ONE</strong>\u00a0item at a time in your huge inventory consisting of just <strong>ONE\u00a0</strong>slot. Your crosshair represents this <strong>\"SLOT\"\u00a0</strong>;) You need to overcome few puzzles here and there and get out of this old forgoten place.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<strong>LMB</strong><strong>Pickup Item</strong><strong>Q</strong><strong>Drop Item</strong><strong>ESC</strong><strong>Exit Game</strong>\n<p><strong><br/>Don't forget to rate it!<br/></strong><strong>Rate The Game</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The Idea</strong></p>\n<p>It all started with idea of\u00a0something that players expect to have a decent amount like the inventory slots. So I thought it is great idea to make it as big as one slot ;) So what type of game can use inventory sytem? Of course a simple <strong>dungeon-crawler</strong> but with <strong>only one</strong> slot it needs to be used in diffrent way. So idea was to create puzzles based around this problem with inventory. Unfortunetly I wasn't been able to do as much stuff with this idea as i thought at first. I realy does take time to create all this mechanics and levels so there is still lot's of unused potential.</p>\n<p><strong>Technical Stuff</strong></p>\n<p>Pretty much everything was created by me in 48 hours. The only thing I didn't do is the sound. All models where created in <strong>blender </strong>from scratch. I've tried to put as much detalis as possilbe to all locations and I feel like I did it pretty well. The game runs on <strong>Unity Engine 2019.2</strong> on <strong>built-in render pipeline</strong> with the use of <strong>Post Processing Stack</strong>.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T19:39:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2d/b2d2eb0cb2b5771be1c32ad49c28ca89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 204, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["V I R T U _"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
