Take control of your faction and stake your claim against up to six AI opponents on thousands upon thousands of randomly generated maps. Build powerful Command Stations to control resources and raise an armada to expand your territory and obliterate your adversaries!</p>\n<p>Customize your play experience with a variety of options to control random map generation to your preference. Looking for a quick game to pass the time on the bus? Jack up the resource frequency and lower the map dimensions. Looking for something a bit more challenging? Crank up the difficulty and tick Allied AI to tip the odds in favor of your opponents. Oh and by the way, the AI never cheats!</p>\n<p>While a game of Carpe Diem does require the setup and expansion of resource collection and unit production, the focus of the game is largely on tactical combat. The majority of your time in Carpe Diem will be spent commanding units on the offensive or defensive and anticipating which units to build next. There is no technology tree, all players are on equal footing in terms of what units they can field.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T06:55:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0b/a0bb545fb41262abc14fb9d98db6db86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Tryder"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
