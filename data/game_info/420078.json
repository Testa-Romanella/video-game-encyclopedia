Since 2019 February I worked on it every now and then, but when it came to the finishing the game I experienced many issues with putting it on mobile I lost motivation mid-summer an since then I haven't touched the game.</p>\n<p>But now I realized that since I worked on it for quite a while it might be worth it to upload it here. So here it is. Note that the game is quite incomplete since I didn't change anything since summer expect for the build settings. Sorry about the bugs!</p>\n<p>|Controls :</p>\n<p>Q - switch to red</p>\n<p>W - switch to blue</p>\n<p>E - switch to green</p>\n<p>You can also click the buttons to switch colors.|</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T02:29:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84c/84c018121d735b48fec743026abe351d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Robert"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
