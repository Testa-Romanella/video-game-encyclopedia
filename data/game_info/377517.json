It's rude,\u00a0rudimentary, and above all rough around the edges, but its vision is clear. The aim in making VOGUENET is to simulate a brief, tense, yet enjoyable user experience while lampooning genre conventions surrounding text adventures, the internet, and the overall obsessions of people. Intended primarily as a proof of concept, VOGUENET aims to be a powerful step forward into much greater ideas -- a post-apocalypse of the mind that brings\u00a0hope to a new beginning... Something that is aimed to be shown through its content as well as its own design process!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Essentially, I\u00a0view\u00a0VOGUENET as a small part of a much greater whole, but my goal is that it\u00a0can also be played as an entirely stand-alone experience -- giving the player\u00a0a slice of life in an abstract other world...</p>\n<p>\"VOGUENET W SOUND\" download features ambient noise and is considered (by its creator)\u00a0to be the preferred way to experience the game.</p>\n<p>USER AVATARS are made in collaboration between me\u00a0(Slantac)\u00a0and HallowVortex.</p>\n<p>All other assets by Petra Tsimberov/slantac.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-27T05:56:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7e/f7ed7a1b8db9a5b91205d6fb753390ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Petra Tsimberov"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
