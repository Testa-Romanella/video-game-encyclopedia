Work together with your teammate to complete puzzles, explore an abandoned mining station,  and avoid death. Oh, and don't run out of Oxygen. The tether which binds you keeps you alive. Don't break it.</p><p>We highly recommend playing with a friend. For the best experience, please use XBOX or PlayStation controllers. If you are having problems with the joystick, you can set your controls in the opening configuration pop-up. <br/><br/>p1 Horiz, P1 Vert, P2 Horiz, and P2 Vert are the axis that you will have to set up if controllers don't work. <br/><br/><br/>Tether was made during the Indie Galactic Space jam and won an Indiebox Award for demonstrating Indie Spirit. Have fun, and good luck! You'll need it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f2/1f2dce8521497898a50507e0a6016ad0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tether"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
