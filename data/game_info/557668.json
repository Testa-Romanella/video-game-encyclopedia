All you have is your trusty anti-plague spray. Can you do it?</p>\n<p>Plagued NPCs have a green mist surrounding them, spray them to cure their infection.</p>\n<p>The first level starts with one infected NPC, the second with two and so on. Infected NPCs die after 60 seconds,<br/>after that they get replaced with a new non-infected NPC to match the set population limit (Currently 75).</p>\n<p>If an infected NPC comes into contact with a non-infected NPC they infect him.</p>\n<p>NPCs may enter buildings upon which they stay inside for 20 seconds. If an infected NPC enters the building all NPCs currently inside are infected.<br/>Infected NPCs cannot die inside a building.</p>\n<p>When all infected NPCs are either cured or dead you win this pandemic level and advance to the next. Good luck. ^^</p>\n<p>In-Game controls:</p>\n<p>- F1 for Help<br/>- WASD to move<br/>- Left Mouse to spray<br/>- Right Mouse for spray bomb - M to toggle music on/off<br/>- F12 to restart current level<br/>- ESC to quit the game<br/>- Alt + Enter or F5 for full-screen<br/>- Mouse-wheel to zoom<br/>- F8 to display FPS<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Background Music:</p>\n<p>\"Danger Freak\"<br/>by Chris H\u00fclsbeck<br/>1988 Rainbow Arts</p>\n<p>_____________________________<br/>(C) Sinnesloeschen Games 2021</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T10:42:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a0/4a0f6f6c723e55a1f1ef8f3bf6f939e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sinnesloeschen Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
