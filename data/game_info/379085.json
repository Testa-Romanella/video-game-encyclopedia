{"id": 379085, "slug": "halloween-hearts", "name": "Halloween Hearts", "name_original": "Halloween Hearts", "description": "<p>Halloween Hearts is a visual novel where you can date/befriend spooky Monster anime girls (and guys)! There are 5 main routes to choose from, and 11 endings to get! (7 bad endings, 3 normal endings, 1 true ending).<br/>This game was created in about 1 month after I had a burst of inspiration playing visual novels all day. Estimated playtime (for all endings) is 1-2 hours, depending on your reading speed.</p>\n<p>-Content warning:\u00a0<br/>This game contains minor depictions of violence, horror, and mentions of death. Also, the very occasional screen shake, loud noises and flashes during certain scenes. There are also many descriptions of pre-marital HAND-HOLDING in this game (!!). If you are uncomfortable with these sorts of things, please avoid. Other than that, this game is actually pretty SFW. Recommended for ages 12+</p>\n<p>Full credits in the READMEyorripi.txt file included in the download!
