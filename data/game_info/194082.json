Watch out for spiders and the things that they carry. If they drop an item, you are cursed to pick it up and use it as a weapon. Not all items are good weapons (glass items, for example) and not all weapons can be used more than once. The more items you have, the more you switch between them! You don't get to pick which weapon you get to use next (you know, because of the curse...)</p>\n<p>Arrow keys or WASD to control character and mouse to move weapons.</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Created in Construct 2 by\u00a0</p>\n<p>Frederika Edgington-Giordano</p>\n<p>Ryan Morash</p>\n<p>Patrick Totaro</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Art Assets from:<br/>Weapons<br/>https://opengameart.org/content/vector-weapons\u00a0<br/>Creator Info: https://opengameart.org/users/adajo<br/>License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/<br/>Images extracted, resized, and reoriented.</p>\n<p>Tilemaps:<br/>Kenney's Assets<br/>https://kenney.nl/assets?q=2d</p>\n<p>Audio Assets from:<br/>Freesound.org</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c77/c77cb5d9dc4218ca84b91d6c8916b686.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Effigy13"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
