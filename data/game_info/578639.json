Only your flame can protect them.</strong></p>\n<p>I created this game inspired by Zyger's idea to use only the particle system of Unity.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game is divided iton two version :\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>The OP (Only Particle) version is entirely built with Unity's particle system and was created in only 3 days (It's a challenge I gave to myself to have fun)\r\n</li><li>The N (Normal) version was created well after the OP. It is created so I can update the game more easily.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>How To Play :\r\n</p>\n<p>The goal is to survive as long as possible. In order to do that, you must protect your hearts, which represent your lives. Here's your hearts in the middle of your screen\u00a0:</p>\n\n<p>To protect it, you need your cursor, however it is invisible! To spot it, right click on your mouse and small flames will reveal the position of your cursor :\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Your enemies are also invisible! To betray their positions, left-click for an explosion of light :\r\n</p>\n\n<p>After knowing their position, shoot them by right-clicking while dragging your mouse to aim. Release the right click to throw the fireball at them :\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Don't let the enemies touch you or your hearts, because you will lose a life and if you lose them all, it would be game over for you :(\r\n</p>\n<p>Remember these commands:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Left Click: Light Explosion (To locate the enemies)\r\n</li><li>Right click: Small flame (To locate you)\r\n</li><li>Right click + Dragging : Fire ball (To kill the enemies)\r\n</li><li>Esc: Pause (To take a break)\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>The music of the game is made by Eric Matyas.
