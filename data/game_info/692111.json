You are given the roll of knocking door-to-door on a religious quest only to be shot down. This game only takes a few minutes to complete, but it uses it's time effectively as it builds a narrative around you.  The art style is inspired multiple games, but keeps a strong PS1 theme.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T09:33:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cb/4cb49028bb528390aeb48c0584bff52a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JaybirdStudio"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
