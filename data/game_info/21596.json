A team of 8 worked on the original Carmageddon at Stainless, and 5 are still with the company today, although a couple of them are now kept manacled in a small padded room in the cellar.<br/><br/>Stainless Games now employs around one hundred mad, dedicated people of assorted gender, height and width. They can all be found dangling precariously from a small chalky rock just off the South Coast of England.<br/><br/><br/>http://www.carmageddon.com/bugger<br/><br/><br/>http://www.carmageddon.com", "metacritic": null, "released": "1997-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T13:10:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e5/8e5c282e63fae6fab80903e15341a6e8.jpg", "website": "http://www.carmageddon.com", "rating": 4.02, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 12, "owned": 478, "beaten": 31, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 24, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 64, "suggestions_count": 362, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 64, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stainless Games", "Stainless Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Stainless Games"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
