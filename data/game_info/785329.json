This town has multiple different Npcs with different quests for the player to access.\u00a0 The user can walk around in the world and interact with the items found in it. Uses Unity content such as particle effects, Cinemachine, and Dialogue System.\u00a0 There are multiple different items involved within the progression of quests and both main questlines invoke the theme of a town being tied down by multiple sides. Controls are WASD to move, Tab to use inventory, and Spacebar to interact with the NPCs.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>\u00a0EmaceArt-\u00a0Medieval Slavic Village Models and Prefabs</p>\n<p>Unity Dialogue System</p>\n<p>Mixamo for the free Models</p>\n<p>Snowforge - Necklace model</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T17:33:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/513/5135198543bc940592b101c58fd94111.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["shadowlink312"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
