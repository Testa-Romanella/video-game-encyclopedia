It was inspired by arcade games of the 80's and 90's. Gameplay consists of clearing enemy insects from a stage as quickly and efficiently as possible. The player controls a lovable chameleon (Lash) with the ability to capture and defeat multiple enemies with his lengthy tongue. <strong>Mighty Chameleon Brothers</strong> will remind you of old-school arcade classics, with bright and colorful visuals and fun cartoon characters! You'll love the simple yet addictive game play!<br/><br/>A lot of work and passion went into this project. Please note that the game is quite short. We weren't able to include all of the things we had planned, but we still hope you enjoy it!<br/><br/>Character design, graphic design, game design, sprite animation - <strong>Gallagher Laird</strong><br/>Programming and game design - <strong>Kevin McConnell</strong><br/>Music and sound effects - <strong>Emma Kramer-Rodger</strong><br/>Additional background artwork - <strong>Lance Buan</strong><br/><br/><strong>GAME CONTROLS:</strong><br/><br/>Start Game - Z, X, 5, Enter<br/>Arrow Keys - Move Character, Aim Tongue<br/>Jump - Z, Alt<br/>Shoot Tongue - X, Ctrl<br/>Reset Current Stage - Select, A<br/>Reset Game - 6<br/>Full Screen - T, F<br/>Quit Game - Q", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T14:04:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e37/e37119044df681570243a36284d997a1.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/MCBvideogame", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kevin McConnell", "Gallagher Laird"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Gallagher Laird"], "esrb_rating": null}
