Movement: WASD/Arrow Keys</p>\n<p>2. Weapons: Q for picking up weapons, R to drop them, and e/left mouse button to attack/fire. Mouse to rotate weapon.</p>\n<p>3. Dialogue: Space/Left click to speed up dialogue</p>\n<p>Game Premise/Idea: The idea behind our game submission to the Game Off jam was: What if we had a game, in which as it progressed, cliches got gradually removed? With this game, our original plan was to create thoughtful game which would discuss the use of cliches in game design\u00a0and if they were a good thing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Reality:\u00a0Of course, since this was our first game jam, with both of us being only beginner coders,\u00a0nothing went as expected, and we ended up cutting a lot of content and only having the first two levels/phases of the game(the desert region), and the final boss fight with the necromancer.</p>\n<p>Background Story: The ninja Suman finds himself lost in a desert, when skeletons appear to raid the village in which he was residing. After fighting them off, an npc named\u00a0Sabin comes out to so his daily tasks when he finds Suman in his way. The npc is surprised as the player/Suman should only be meeting him later.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>I hope you enjoy this simple game!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T09:40:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e2/5e2120193183bcd34bac4c4ff7080640.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Albroogy", "aklesh888"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
