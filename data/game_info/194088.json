Our words were Miner, Ethereal and Caution. The controls are relatively simplistic; A and D move and Space jumps. There is also a ghost mode activated by pressing E, this is temporary but makes you invulnerable from damage and allows you to jump infinitely, but also prevents you from picking up any collectables.</p><p>As a result of the short development time expect to see bugs. This project will be polished when time permits. </p><p>Made by myself - Programming, Designed Level 1 and 5. </p><p>Callum Milner - Art and Programming, Designed level 2 and 4. </p><p>James Nelson - Programming, Designed level 3. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d6/7d6e3cd717dd9049ad20b5f6565b1f3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kristiandixon"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
