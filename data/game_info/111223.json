The Dark Lord Ludum Dare is now walking the Earth. It corrupts everything it walks on. And it wants to conquer the world!</p>\n<p>Controls is WASD or Arrow Keys.<br/></p>\n<p>Hope you guys enjoy this simple game! The objective of this game is to corrupt all the land tiles by walking on it. However, you will encounter some enemies that can one-hit kill you! But they are slow and takes time before they can move and attack. To defeat an enemy, all you gotta do is corrupt all the land tiles around an enemy (four directions), so that they can no longer move (hence, they RUN OUT OF SPACE!).\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Had a blast with LD42. Not really a fan of the theme but hey, it's the theme! Spent almost 12 hours thinking of a game and I had only about 4 or 5 hours available each day to code, test, and do the artwork. Was initially planning to send this for the Compo but that will remain as just a dream.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/800/8006d903351f52227ddfefee3eaca3cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MartinTristan"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
