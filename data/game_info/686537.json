You live in peaceful house in the middle of a cornfield. On the night of Halloween you heard strange noises outside so you go to investigate. You get out of the house trying to find the source of those mysterious sounds, but you find nothing, until you arrive near the scarecrow, the same scarecrow you put there a few months ago to protect your harvest, and suddenly it starts to move. It tries to hit you with it's scythe, but you were quick and dodged in time. You must find 8 pumpkins hidden in the cornfield so you can start a ritual to banish the scarecrow from this world forever.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>W - move up</p>\n<p>A - move left</p>\n<p>S - move down</p>\n<p>D - move right</p>\n<p>E - interact with the door</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T11:34:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/428/428031b7bfc769159ec18a4b4205c6e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Reign Studios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
