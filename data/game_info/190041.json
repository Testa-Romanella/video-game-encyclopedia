The beginning level utilizes basic puzzle mechanics in the forms of doors and keys, an area where timing is important and tokens that when collected allow progression to the next stage. In later levels these mechanics will be expanded upon. The art style and side scrolling gameplay was inspired by ancient Greek and Egyptian wall frescos. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f45/f459c33dd322e4c824c0f247e138ad9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kotorigaro"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
