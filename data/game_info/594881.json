Beware of hostile creatures. Some of them might damage your ship. As soon as they cause a breach, try to repair it with a \"Welding\" Card.</p>\n<p>After each turn all cards on your hand will vanish, so try to make the most of each round. At the beginning of each turn you will regain only 1 energy, so try to manage your energy between turns.\u00a0You can also regain energy by playing certain cards and selecting your ship.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T11:23:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6b/a6b9057891e05cbc69f417181f16ea91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["RAC-Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
