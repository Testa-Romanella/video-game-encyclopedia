But in reality, the appellation 'singularity' seems more appropriate. Since the great war, also called the Flash, having sold by an unprecedented nuclear disaster, many sentient singularities were born, forcing survivors of the Flash to coexist with these new lifeforms. From then on, religious and esoteric small groups took it into their heads to study these singularities, considering them as antichristic manifestations. It was thus, using pre-war technology, that one of these sects got their hands on Birdy, an ethereal manifestation of the Flash. Birdy is a popular neologism given to this singularity, due to its shape, unmistakably reminding the shape of a bird.</p>\n<p>Axel\u00a0 \"Axelinho\" Tondeur</p>\n<p>Kevin \"Cayn\" Nauzes</p>\n<p>Lucien \"Batman\" Gogly</p>\n<p>David \"Terrarc\" Taramarcaz</p>\n<p>Jean-Baptiste \"Jibus\" Louis</p>\n<p>sound and music :\u00a0Olyvine Bernardin<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T07:08:09", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jibus_gd"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
