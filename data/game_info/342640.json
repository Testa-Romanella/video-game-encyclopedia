{"id": 342640, "slug": "crabby-coast", "name": "Crabby Coast", "name_original": "Crabby Coast", "description": "Welcome to Crabby Coast, a turn-based strategy game featuring hermit crabs. Each crab has a weapon shell--rock, paper or scissors. Your goal is to defeat the enemy crabs or capture their flag.<br/><br/>The rules are simple. Each turn, you move one of your crabs one space (up, down, left or right). When you defeat a crab you can choose to take over its weapon shell. This gives you strategic options. No stat charts or skill trees or complicated rule sets to memorize. It's simple-to-learn yet difficult-to-master.<br/><br/>Includes local multiplayer (2 to 4 players). The next time your friends challenge you to a game of rock-paper-scissors, play a game of Crabby Coast instead.<br/><br/>This is a premium, pay-once-and-play game. No ads or in-app purchases. Relax to the sound of the ocean knowing you won't be bothered by ads or timers. I appreciate your purchase and won't waste your time or annoy you by asking for more money.<br/><br/>Thank you so much for supporting an indie developer!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-22T02:21:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32c/32cc5f0bbc043a9e53117f3d31de12ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Jeffrey Eschler"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Jeffrey Eschler"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
