The main characters were cursed by a mysterious mage, they will die in 30 days\u00a0unless they track down and kill 13 all-powerful\u00a0creatures known as The Keepers. In this short\u00a0demo, the party arrives at the advance and futuristic city, New Eden.</p>\n<p>You control <strong>Zack</strong>, a blacksmith from a small town. Other main characters include <strong>Authelia</strong>, Zack's childhood friend and a master swordsman. <strong>Robin</strong>, who is a bandit but very good with magic. <strong>Eva</strong>, a cyborg who lost most of her body in an accident when she was little. She also used to live in New Eden.</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>Personal words:</strong></p>\n<p>Hi, I made this in University as one of my project. My friend recommend me to upload it here. At first my project is to just create some cool pixel art and write some back story as a game concept. But later I decided to use the arts to create some sort of demo and a promo video to show off my pixel arts and this is the product. Also feel free to check out the video on Youtube. The combat animation you see in the promo is not in the game because I don't actually know how to program.</p>\n<p>I actually lost the RPG Maker MV project files, so there are no ways for me to make any changes to this anymore. So if there are any bugs, I apologies in advance:p\u00a0There are also no combat in this because I didn't have enough time back then to set it up. I made this a while ago, so you might see reference to certain Marvel film that had already came out.</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing! Hope you have a fun time!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f0/2f0702643a5d19a3126d235ab2ecb7e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["oldfish"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
