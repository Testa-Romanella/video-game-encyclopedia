This game has a satirical background, not making fun of violent war games but how the media portrays violent games and how they influence crime, so I made this game along with help from my colleague 'Rachael Nieuwenhuis' (who created the artwork) to make a statement about mediated violence in games and even thought this game portrays violence and even congratulates it there is no way this game will brainwash our youths to become more violent.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15b/15bff52ce2b15cf52041fdf14e6632b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["murrayfh"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
