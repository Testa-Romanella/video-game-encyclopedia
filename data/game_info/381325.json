Instead of using twine, this time I used an engine called Bitsy, which allows for creation of pixel art games. It is a medium that allows for the creation of rather simple games with ease. However, as a result of this ease, there are a lot of limitations present. I could not replicate any form of combat, so in turn certain things had to be removed from the first version of the game in the transition of the second. In addition to that, since it is not text based, I had to find a new means to tell the story, thus I had to make more drawn out environments, so player interaction with the available items and people is key. I still held to the idea of multiple endings, and player choice having an impact on things, but it had to be carried out differently. Hopefully, you all enjoy this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T05:42:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f1/7f1365fb7d3f84a195d3c53d84cd4128.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JNolen"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
