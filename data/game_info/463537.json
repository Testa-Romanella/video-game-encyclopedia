I created 2 levels for it.</p>\n<p>2nd build was kinda polish round, tweaked some code, less visible stuff. I added stretch and squash for player and quickly created simple walk animation for player and enemies. I added only one level on top.</p>\n<p>3rd build was for sounds and music for which I used some of my sound stash + made some quick sounds. For music I just put slow melody to cover longer time and added drum loop. Integrated those sounds in the game and created 3 levels.</p>\n<p>I didn't have time for GUI but thankfully this game doesn't really need one.</p>\n<p>I aimed at 2/3 themes:</p>\n<p>\u00a0\"Novel Twist on Classic Game\" - Game is made as - if Bomberman was platformer but I made player sprite look reference characteristics of a Mario.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\"Chain Reaction\" - Didn't have time to make an explosion like traditional Bomberman bombs, but they can trigger each other.</p>\n<p>Because of content+ when looping back to the 1st level, the player brings all the upgrades and if the player keeps taking the strength upgrade explosion gets bigger. As we know big explosions are fun but make it easier to blow yourself up - meaning I touched the third theme - \"Negative Feedback Loop\"</p>\n<p>source:\u00a0https://github.com/nezvers/BomberPlatformer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-10T05:24:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de4/de4e8283be1d8d0aa72573440f0a7190.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["nezvers"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
