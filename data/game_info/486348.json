It's not really a game,\u00a0 rather than 3d art concept of a game: <strong>at the moment</strong>\u00a0<strong>there is nothing to do in the game</strong>. I'd have liked to develop it more, but life struck hard for me in this moment... Maybe in the future i'll develop it from the ground up again, but in this moment... I just can't... Sorry...\u00a0\ud83d\ude05 (basically what i want to say is, don't be surprised if a some point you'll se this project disappear out of nowhere)</p>\n<p>Basically the game was supposed to be a waiting game, where you had to\u00a0<strong>Take Care</strong> of a e-plant that runs in real time, and where you was able to interact with the enviroment. You can still try to interact with the enviroment, but the interaction process is very buggy... \ud83d\ude17</p>\n<p>If you see that the game runs kinda slow, there's no post processing, no water droplets on the watercan, and that the \"game\"\u00a0looks overall bad... <strong>I know</strong>!! Unity WebGL don't support most of the thing that i used, and i don't know how to solve it... Still, i'm sorry for the inconvenience!! \ud83d\ude47\u200d\u2642\ufe0f</p>\n<p>(All the assets is taken form the internet, with <strong>permission to use it</strong>)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T06:47:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d51/d51b6921006aca85044add1a6261a042.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Marxy 37"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
