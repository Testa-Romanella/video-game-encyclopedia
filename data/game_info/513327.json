The objective is simple - dodge evil obstacles coming your way and keep yourself alive for as long as you can. You only have 3 lives (I sometimes allow you to have 4). If you use up all 3 lives (or 4), it will be GAME OVER!<br/><br/>Want to customise your character? You can earn money by getting a high score, and spend it in the shop to buy new skins to make your new character!<br/><br/>Want to have the best gamer graphics? If you have a powerful device, you can enable Post Processing (good graphics) in the Options menu. If this causes your device to lag, you can always change this setting back.<br/><br/>If you would like to buy money, you can go to the 'In-App Purchases' shop and buys some there. NOTE: It cost real money.<br/><br/>If you enjoy our game, make sure you leave a review!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T03:14:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15c/15c5e13ee0d6254b20f62df941af2ad8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joda Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
