The journey may not be as intense as the one your brethren are on, but it is an important one...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sit back and enjoy the journey.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Listen to the calming beats of a lo-fi soundtrack as you run, jump, and collect through 15 different levels. You have the option to speed through and go for your best record time or to just relax and take your time, taking in the sights .\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can play using\u00a0a keyboard and mouse or a game pad (input specifically designed for an Xbox One controller).\u00a0The main menu &amp; pause menu must be navigated with a mouse but the rest of the game can be enjoyed however you please.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*Controls can be found in the Options menu*</p>\n\n<p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- Can I use other game pads/controllers\u00a0besides an Xbox One controller?</p>\n<p>Possibly... This game was specifically designed around an Xbox One controller.\u00a0 That doesn't necessarily mean other game pads/controllers won't work, but I haven't been able to test any other options.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Can I reset the Best Time?</p>\n<p>Yes! Just mouse over it on the Main Menu and it will give you the option to reset it.</p>\n<p>- Is this game finished?</p>\n<p>For now, the answer is yes. If there is enough demand to expand upon this project then there is a possibility\u00a0for future updates. Never say never.</p>\n<p>- I have some ideas that I think can improve your\u00a0 game, where can I make suggestions?</p>\n<p>I'd love to hear from the players.
