You are a robot that was built to fulfill the restoration of great landmarks. You are activated and ready to save some history! But you find that you are the only one awake. take your trusty Flashback gun and your Flashback Charges to platform your way to the surface to find out what's going on. (The story is still tentative and you likely will not see most of it in the game as of yet.)</p><p>P.S. I fixed the problem with level 2 at 11 AM after the Jam since I went to sleep after I submitted. It worked fine in the editor, but not in the builds which I didn't test. it turns out that I had to force the dialogueManager script and possibly the GameManager script to run earlier than default in Edit &gt; Project Settings &gt; Script Execution Order. Hope this helps anyone who reads this~</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T07:14:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c34/c34f9ca101d323b308899ed5a62778d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Krayne"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
