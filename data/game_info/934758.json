Found everything?\u00a0Press R to reload.</strong></p>\n<p>Inspired by pioneering titles like \u00a0<em>Maze War </em>(1973) and <em>Rogue\u00a0</em>(1980),<em> Dark Mode</em> is an art-game that stages an\u00a0enigmatic celebration of these early instances, whose economy of expression is their chief characteristic - and, today, is a continuing source of appeal.</p>\n<p>Playthrough time will be a few minutes, at most. Find the encounters, and, if seemingly all are found, press \"R\" to regenerate the maze.
