{"id": 261086, "slug": "warehouse-madness-chinobistar", "name": "Warehouse Madness (chinobistar)", "name_original": "Warehouse Madness (chinobistar)", "description": "<p>Warehouse Madness is a first-person co-op physics puzzle. The game is being developed as a final college project. It features a cooperative gameplay in which players must help each other to surpass the challenges and complete levels. The game is an EXCLUSIVELY multiplayer game, and can be played from  2 up to 4 players. Right now, you can play this game on LAN or in split screen (in the latter case, you'll need an Xbox controller for each extra player). You can also play using a VPN software,\u00a0 like Hamachi.<br/></p>\n<p>Warehouse Madness' story happens on a futuristic industrial environment. The players take control of robots trying to run away from a factory. To do that, they will face many challenges, such as turrets, force fields, explosive objects, and more. The game also allows players to pick up and move certain objects in the levels, which can be used to help them surpass challenges.</p>\n<p>Right now, the game still has some work to be done. It doesn't have every needed texture or sound, it needs more polishing and feedback to the players, and currently contains one of the three planned levels. Some assets are also placeholders. The illumination also has problems, with some parts of the level being too bright and others too dark (you can minimize this problem by changing the gamma in the pause menu).<br/></p>\n<p>If you have interest in playing the game, I ask you to please fill this form after playing, which will help me to improve the game (and will also help me in my graduation): https://goo.gl/forms/U50JYqoYVXRXZa0k1</p>\n<p>Please be welcome to record gameplay videos of Warehouse Madness, showing your impressions of the game.
