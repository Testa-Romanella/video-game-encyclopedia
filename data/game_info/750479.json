But for the last couple of days, the whole place turns upside down right after that time. In regards to the things told, it is not a simple drunken brawl. Because the woman who starts the fight every night asks a question before all the quarrel:<br/><br/>\"Do you know a monster that dwells around here?\"<br/><br/>Getting curious on this question, Aras tries to find ways to learn more about this woman. As his mundane and repetitive days are left behind, will Aras be able to preserve his tenuous psyche from the chaos ahead?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Text-based story rich gaming experience<br/>Interaction with hand drawn comic book assets<br/>Anime style characters<br/>Original ambient soundtrack<br/><br/><br/><br/>Aras held most characteristic of the capital in which he lived with 5 millions other inhabitants in the center of Anatolia.

They both had a vision of sorts at one time, but they seemed to abandon it. Even the unfavorable aspects of cities, and of humans, can express a great deal, however this was not one of those cases. Being exposed to their bleak aura wasn't like choking in a depressive spiritual trench, but evoked the feeling of drowning in a muddy puddle along the sidewalk. They were not tedious, but also not lively.
