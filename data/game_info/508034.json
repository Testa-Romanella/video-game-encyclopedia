You've been hearing strange noises in the middle of the night. You've been finding things out of place, not where you left them. Your normally adorable gallery wall has been emanating an intangibly threatening aura.\u00a0Fearing that some sort of spook has entered your home, you arm yourself with a vial of holy water and set to work rooting it out. Be careful, however: if you are unable to find it, it may retaliate.</p>\n<p>Controls: Click on the various objects on the wall to focus on them. When focused, press F to splash the object with holy water, or Backspace to return to the main wall. When you find the demon, mash Spacebar repeatedly to exorcise it!</p>\n<p>This game was made over the week of 10/11/2020, the fifth in my deck of many games, where I try to make a game a week, every week, for a year.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T05:59:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8d/a8d54ccc1e11850704f9aa93412ef8ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["jeefjerfy"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
