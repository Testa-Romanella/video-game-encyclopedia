{"id": 463700, "slug": "party-to-catlympus", "name": "Party to Catlympus", "name_original": "Party to Catlympus", "description": "<p><strong><em>Party to Catlympus</em></strong> is a <em>four-player </em>party game inspired by games such as Mario Party! Boasting over 7 unique cards, strategy is key when competing in the race to the <em>legendary </em><strong><em>Catlympus</em></strong>. <em>Will you be able to make it?</em></p>\n<p>Dev Note: Howdy! This is technically the second game I've ever finished, which is pretty cool. It was made over the course of one semester of school for my final in Latin! As such, the game is still lacking certain things such as sound and more minigames (though it does have quite a few) due to time and scope constraints but I hope to build on the game a bit more in the future. That being said, this is still quite a fun game, at least for a few playthroughs, so I recommend you check it out. Quick word of warning, though, it requires four xBox controllers to play, so, sorry, but I hope that the visual style makes up for it lol.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-10T06:04:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe1/fe134885179098071f950d0130dbbd50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ccooldean"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
