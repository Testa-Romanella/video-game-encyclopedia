When an item is selected (Blue) it will be used with any object you interact with (when pressing A)<br/><br/>2. To combine items, selected the first highlight item with X, then press Lb or Rb to change highlights and press X again for the 2nd item. Not all combinations work of course!<br/>3. Some items can be \"used\" or \"looked\" at, once highlighted press X twice to check.\u00a0</strong><br/><br/><br/>*Known issue with the Switch puzzle, sometimes it \"solves\" itself. You got lucky this time....I'll fix/update after the jam judging as I'm at of time atm.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-11T04:08:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31f/31fe8498769f4b607302f6862bfb9fc9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["From Chris"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
