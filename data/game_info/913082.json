I was thinking about Club Penguin as inspiration here. I had to rush a lot of the things but I think the idea is still well represented. Although the Art is largely incomplete the blockout is there and I guess it ended up having a little bit of a retro feel.<br/></p>\n<p>I strongly recommend using a controller as the game was designed with this.<br/></p>\n<p>The gameplay is very short but I hope that you enjoy what there is. Let me know what you think; if you'd like me to continue the project or some bugs to fix. I can also upload executables for windows and mac if the web browser lags\u2026<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T18:16:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58c/58c575c96534d1da5eb1c349137b66ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ganthefan"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
