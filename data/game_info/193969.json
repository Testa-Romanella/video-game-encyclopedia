This is not some crazy guerilla marketing campaign this game is just bad. Well it's not strictly bad there just isn't a whole lot to do in it, I mean there's a boat ride and you can stack a few boxes but that is pretty much it.</p><p>I made this in an evening to take a break from a proper game I'm working on and decided to upload it for a laugh and to test out itch.io. If you buy this and are disappointed or angered by what you got then don't come crying to me. You were warned, the clue is in the name.</p><p>Alternatively if you really enjoyed this game then please feel free to leave a donation as I am a very poor student who has a crippling Pepsi addiction. If you give me money you are not an enabler you are a saviour :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c88/c88c541e34e4d1f7666fc71d604df142.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tormeynator"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
