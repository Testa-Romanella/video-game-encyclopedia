It only uses 1 analogue stick and 2 buttons, it is also playable on keyboard and mouse if you don't have a controller. I didn't really have time to make a map so its a modified starter map. There is a simple wave system, the robots will spawn after the countdown has ended. If the timer doesn't start that means that there is still a robot on the map and it may be stuck so restarting the game will fix it. Unfortunately it doesn't save your high score\u00a0 when the game is restarted but its something i wanted to implement eventually. The player has 4 abilities 2 movement and 2 attack which is done by having two abilities on one button. Hope you enjoy.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T05:39:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41f/41fe04888fe3e5145bdb5b14a5511384.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SilentStudios482"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
