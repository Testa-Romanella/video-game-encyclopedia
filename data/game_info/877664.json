But wait... the aliens are... frogs?!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fly </strong>a UFO around the map;<strong><br/>Build\u00a0</strong>a froggy empire by placing tiles;<br/><strong>Expand</strong> your territory and crush your opponent!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The game works by placing tiles onto a grid. Each tile has a corresponding use:<br/><strong>Farms: </strong>Used to create food for your army.<br/><strong>Roads:</strong> Used to expand and connect your villages.<br/><strong>Villages:</strong> Complete villages to score points.</p>\n<p>Each piece that has a road must be connected to another piece that also has a road. The roads must connect together; so you can't connect a road to an empty piece of land, for example. The same goes for village tiles; a village has to connect to another village.</p>\n\n\n<p>Each turn, the player has 10 seconds to complete the turn. If the player takes longer, they lose the point.</p><p>You score points for every completed city you have. If you have more points than your opponent at the end, you win.</p>\n<p>Now get out there, amass your froggy army, and defeat your opponent!</p>\n<p>Platform: Windows<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Made by:</strong></p>\n<p>Nathan Kingston: Programming, Audio, SFX<br/>Thomas Woodthorpe: Programming, SFX<br/>Liberty Jones: Character Art, Animation, UI<br/>Jess Hodgkiss: 3D\u00a0Environment Art<br/>Daniel Dixon: 3D Environment Art<br/>Ethan Corbett: 3D Environment Art</p>\n<p><strong>Controls (Mouse + Keyboard / Controller) :</strong></p>\n<p>Move UFO: Mouse / Joystick<br/>Place tile: Mouse click\u00a0/ A button<br/>Skip turn: Mouse click /\u00a0Y button<br/>Change card: Up +\u00a0Down arrow keys / Right + left Bumper</p>\n<p><strong>Install Instructions (Windows):</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Download and extract the .ZIP file somewhere onto your computer, then double click \"CC22-FroggyHat.exe\".</p><p><strong>Important note:</strong><br/></p><p>When the game begins, click \"Next Turn\" to begin playing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T16:13:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/241/2410d617105c543226cfa150c80283a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Liberty Jones"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
