While this version may not be bug free (I wasn't able to break it but I also didn't test thoroughly), nor perfect the game is finally playable and hopefully enjoyable. I don't want to drag on about the technical details and such so I decided to create a more in-depth post to by published on my websitelater during the upcoming week. (the game's code can be found here).<br/></p>\n<p><strong>V 2.0 Credits:\r\n</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Andres Mrad (Q-ro) : Game design, Game Concept, Story., Programming and Unity Stuff, Interface Design.</li><li>Catia Carvalho: Sounds, Interface Design, Game Design.</li><li>Diana Gomes: 2D Art and Animations.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>V 1.0 Credits:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Andres Mrad (Q-ro) : Game design, Game concept, Story.</li><li>Catia Carvalho: Sounds, Interface design, Video, game design.</li><li>Diana Gomes: Art and Animations.</li><li>Pedro Almeida: Programming and unity stuff</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Contacts:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Andres Mrad(Q-ro)<br/></strong></li><li><strong>Catia Carvalho<br/></strong></li><li><strong>Diana Gomes<br/></strong></li><li><strong>Pedro Almeida</strong></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/406/4060112fa34c32d0c1e307fdae75c0c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Q-ro"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
