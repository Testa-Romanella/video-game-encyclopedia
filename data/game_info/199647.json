Each enemy can only be defeated by a certain color bullet, indicated by the color of the enemy. The player can switch colors of the bullet with the down arrow key. The enemies will move left and right and will increase in speed as the game progresses. If the enemies reach the ship, the player looses.\u00a0<em>Currently, the red enemies can be killed by any colored bullet, and we only have one wave of enemies. Once the enemies reach the end, they will only disappear and the player will have to restart the game ('r' key).</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/657/65720be7a1bffa0ab6a353b5a7232990.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["oshawatt"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
