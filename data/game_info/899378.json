He is credited with the creation of humanity from clay, and of defying the gods by stealing fire and giving it to mankind. For this transgression, Zeus sentenced him to eternal torment. Prometheus was bound to a rock, and an eagle devoured his liver in an ongoing cycle finally ended when he was freed by Heracles.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Quoted from here</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, before Prometheus was found to be giving fire away to mankind, he decided to place the fire in a specific place and let mankind arrive there\u00a0\r\n\r\nYou (as Zeus) discovered the plan, and decided to stop mankind from reaching fire before punishing Prometheus. But Prometheus was a trickster, and he modified the area so that for mankind only 9 areas can damage them (Instead of striking directly on them). Good Luck!\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Play?\r\n\r\n9 letters will be generated randomly, representing the 9 areas' key code. Press the respective button on your keyboard to damage mankind standing on that area.<br/>\r\nFor example, if\r\n<br/>\r\na b c\r\nd e f\r\ng h i\r\n\r\n<br/>appeared on the screen, press the key 'a' to deal damage to human standing on the top left square. Press the key 'b' to deal damage to human standing on the top middle square and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Check this out maybe</p>\n<p>Links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>itch.io</li>\n<li>Discord Server</li>\r\nUsed Packages:\r\n<li>Free 2D Mega Pack</li>\n<li>5 Free Electronic Game Songs</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T13:30:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/419/419cba4b2fe9c8251aeb377861c6e6a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Revolution Game"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
