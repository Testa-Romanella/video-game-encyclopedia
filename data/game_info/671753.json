Become a squishy tofu ninja and battle your way through the broken Number Line.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Walk, run, skip, dodge, jump, flip, and dive head first into this isometric 3D (+2.5D?) world filled with weapons - and a bunch of squishy Pythagoreans that want to stop you!.. from stopping them. Its umm, ok let's back up.<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So, the Pythagoreans want to reconnect the Number Line, but they're sorta interpreting information they stole - so you know - kinda sketchy - its a whole thing, you'll see. Talk to some of the characters, it'll make sense. No math pop quizes, but you will need to think! There's some different worlds and different permutations depending on how you break stuff, then reconnect it, then brake it again if you need to.<br/></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Find the rare missing Alogon pages from the Sacred Book of Math - err, not the count-y add-y stuff - the fun stuff! Traditional 2D pencil-test animations that help you interpret the story... depending on the interpretation of course!<br/></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In addition to the Story Mode you can also just battle your fellow humans in Battle Mode, or have them pop in to help you fight - maybe even as a squishy tofu shield! There's also a Classic Mode where you battle waves of increasingly difficult enemies - stop talking and ship the game? OK, got it!<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, hope you enjoy it! Good luck fixing the broken Number Line Pythagoras broke. May your booleans always be true!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T06:55:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cd/9cd5ec0b1f1d961af5627f173571c1ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["iamrece"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
