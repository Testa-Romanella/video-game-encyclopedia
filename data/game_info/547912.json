You explore the office and try to open up new areas to find ways to escape\u00a0 but there is one twist - the game keeps resetting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Every 110 seconds a day is over and the player gets reset to the beginning of the game, though he keeps any objects he found along the way. During specific times of the loops certain events (for example a lunchbreak) happen which the player will need to learn to use in his favour. Craft your perfect escape plan and break out of the loop!</p>\n<p>The game currently features 3 different endings depending on how you try to escape the office. There is also a bunch of secrets hidden along the way, have fun finding them ;)</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Laura - Art and Animation</p>\n<p>Julian - Programming</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T10:36:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06d/06d225a0d37e3d46d2745bf34a7e154f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Dragonstar", "Laourino"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
