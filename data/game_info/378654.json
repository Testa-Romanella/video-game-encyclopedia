Battles can be fought anywhere at any time.<br/><br/>We've redesigned the usual fps touch screen controls providing an intuitive, non-intrusive, buttonless control system which does not rely upon clunky crosshair placement or trying to quickly hit small buttons. This frees up screen space for smaller devices, and allows the stunning Unreal Engine visuals to shine through.<br/><br/>Choose one of many classic weapons, all with their own attributes; from the AK-47, M4, M16 and more. Find the gun that suits your play style. Although make the most of your ammunition, as when it's gone, it's just you and your pistol!<br/><br/>Keep track of your own stats to compare accuracy and k/d against your friends. Ultimately unlocking the maxed out M16a2!<br/><br/>Includes two maps; Trenches, and Bazaar.<br/><br/>Battle Screens is not about about leveling up. it is not about story, or about collecting loot... It is a 1v1 deathmatch. It is about about map knowledge, and knowing your guns strengths. It is about who is the best, the fastest, the most accurate, and who wants to win the most.<br/><br/>Developers:<br/>Richard Steele<br/>Tristan Barlow<br/>Jonathon Hemmens", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-04T02:29:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b04/b04f604ed2273341395407674d241621.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Richard Steele"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Richard Steele"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
