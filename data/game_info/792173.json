Fly into space as an astronaut in a space ship. We can't quite fulfill this dream for you, but we can at least bring it closer to you with our game \"Travel to the Space\" on the PC.<br/></p>\n<p>In Travel to the space you take control of a spaceship and maneuver it through the endless universe. As a help you have the possibility to improve your ship with upgrades and thus to meet the constantly increasing difficulties. Each of your decisions affects how far into space you will make it.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note that the current version is an Early Access title, which will be gradually adapted and improved. All future updates are of course available free of charge for all owners of the game.</strong></p>\n<p>Travel to the space was programmed by myself with a specially developed Java game engine. I got the graphics that can be found in the game from various asset stores, I only made adjustments to the graphics themselves.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Fly Left - \"<strong>A</strong>\"<br/>Fly Right - \"<strong>D</strong>\"<br/>Use Laser - \"<strong>Space</strong>\"<br/>Open Shop - \"<strong>B</strong>\"</p>\r\nPlaned features\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Multiple Enemy Ships (currently 6)</li><li>Bosses</li><li>Player Profile with Savegame</li><li>Multiple player ships with diffrent stats (currently 1)</li><li>Online Highscore</li><li>Player Ranks</li><li>Coop</li><li>Player versus Player</li></ul>\r\nSpecial Thanks to\r\n<p><strong>Blender Foundation</strong> for:\u00a0Positive Item Pickup (Yo Frankie!) | OpenGameArt.org\u00a0&amp;\u00a0Big Explosion | OpenGameArt.org<br/><strong>dklon</strong>\u00a0for\u00a0Laser Fire | OpenGameArt.org<br/><strong>QQSimba2 </strong>for some of\u00a0the Spaceship Graphics<br/><strong>Vtrix </strong>for some of the Spaceship Graphics<br/><strong>Acasas </strong>for the UI graphics<br/><strong>Torchis </strong>for some of the space assets</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T11:21:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/977/9778db39c1e8d8ef0855e8f42a23ba72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["676-Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
