Even though you would like to disagree with that, being content with the lack of chaos in the world, your co-worker sends you on a mission to find and collect coffee beans so he can make more coffee since the coffee machine is still broken. You wouldn't have minded if he didn't knock you out and take you to a strange place that defies the rules of the reality you used to reside in. Once you get the coffee beans, you can leave and finish your work, so find them quickly!</p>\n<p>Made with Clickteam Fusion:</p>\n<p>https://www.clickteam.com/<br/></p>\n<p>Keyboard typing sfx:</p>\n<p>https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/type/<br/></p>\n\n<p>Cutscene music:<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0Fluffing a Duck Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</p>\n<p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p>Music promoted by https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/</p>\n\n<p>Coffee bean collected sfx:</p>\n<p>https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/coin/</p>\n\n<p>Platforming music:<br/></p>\n<p>https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-music/downloads-c/8-bit-music/6<br/></p>\n<p>20 browser plays for part 2<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T11:17:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/616/616bc853d8cfaabb59f920bac401a079.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ChocolateCookieBro"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
