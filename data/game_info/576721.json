The extra time allowed for me to properly implement it the way I wanted to, and I'm pretty happy with the result. I hope you enjoy the game!</p>\n\n<p>Character art and animations by @FestiveForLife and music by @Guff!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T06:04:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/741/741d3c259c84153db8a586588adfe315.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Lychees", "FestiveForLife", "Guff"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
