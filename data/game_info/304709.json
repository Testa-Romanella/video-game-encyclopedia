The theme of the jam was \"Time\", so I decided to go with the simplest implementation possible and make a time based game where the goal is to survive as long as possible. Drawing lines to protect yourself added a lot more\u00a0for the player to focus on, so I opted to trim down the bullet hell mechanics to their purest form\u00a0 by getting rid of the shooting aspect and spawning projectiles offscreen. There's no ending, just high scores and sweaty arrow keys. I would definitely be open to working more on this game in the future as I think there's a lot more I could do with it and having a larger version with several game modes available would be cool. <strong>The spacebar can also be used instead of clicking to make drawing lines easier for touchpad users.\u00a0\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Thanks to SkyanSam for hosting a great jam and Unity Coder for the helpful article on getting the drawing system up and running. Oh, and special thanks to you for, you know,\u00a0playing the game. Feel free to let me know what you think of the game or just show off your high scores in the comments, they're probably better than I can do.</p>\n<p>Font: Mostly Mono by Kevin Richey<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-29T04:38:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46e/46e7a72a384ed2d776c61e10658d8c83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bungus Productions"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
