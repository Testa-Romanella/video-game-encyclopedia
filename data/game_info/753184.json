It is more of a tool that can be used in conjunction with Unity. Each cell it creates is a individual tile, with it's own sprite. You can then segment the tile into smaller grids and run the algorithm again..etc. <br/>Population (represented by the brown squares) are built upon the same formula with\u00a0 few variations to look for more dense groups to have more babies at. It can be used for other things as well, such as resource nodes, added lakes, whatever your little heart desires.</p>\n<p>What am I going to do with it? Well I have plans.
