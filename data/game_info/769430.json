You play as Annie, a girl who's finally got a ticket to the new art exhibit. When she gets there, however, she's dragged into a bizarre conflict that takes her through the museum's haunted basement. Help Annie solve puzzles, figure out who to trust, and find out the truth of what happened there years before.<h3>Some random and possibly cool features:</h3><ul><li>Unique hand-drawn art style.<br/></li><li>Save at any time.<br/></li><li>Ghost girl(s).<br/></li><li>Animated cutscenes.<br/></li><li>Traps, sudden deaths, and chase sequences.<br/></li><li>Multiple difficulty options.<br/></li><li>A non-silent protagonist in an RPGMaker horror game.<br/></li><li>Maybe a plot twist.</li></ul><br/><h3>Note from the developer:</h3>Thank you for playing my game! I am a solo developer based in the New England region, and it really means a lot that you've read this far! <strong>Annie and the Art Gallery</strong> is a love letter to classic RPGMaker horror hits such as Witch\u2019s House and Ib. Inspiration was also drawn from more contemporary RPGMaker hits such as Oneshot and Omori.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T04:14:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/630/630855185daea2aa82bf148b30ab0d38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 14, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jswessler"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["jswessler"], "esrb_rating": null}
