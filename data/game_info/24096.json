Don\u2019t be fooled by this game&#39;s simple<br />\npremise or cute exterior, though\u2013underneath these you\u2019ll find a<br />\nsurprisingly challenging game with strategy to spare. After mastering<br />\nthe easy-to-learn controls, you still have to get a grip on the game&#39;s<br />\nimpressively realistic physics. And if that&#39;s not enough, there are<br />\nstill the ever-increasing enemies and environmental hazards like<br />\nlightning and water. Or try the game&#39;s second mode, Balloon Trip, if you<br />\nfeel like taking a break from the action and just want to see how long<br />\nyou can stay aloft. And, hey, who doesn\u2019t like popping balloons<br />\nsometimes?<br />\nThis game is only playable in 2D.This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
