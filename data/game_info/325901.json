There is no save option, you should play in one sitting.<br/><br/>Two versions are availables : <br/>- The \"Game Jam version\" is the game as uploaded at the end of the game jam.<br/>- the \"1.1 version\" contain a few simple but important change made after some playtest. See the devlog for more details.<br/><br/>Unless you are interested in the jam, I highly reccomend using the 1.1 version.
