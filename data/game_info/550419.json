Casarillior where The great Wizard Zaz Farble, equipped with\u00a0his mighty and magic blade, Perrygren the Found, combated an ancient evil entity once again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>How\u00a0many times would this be? How many magic weapons had he lost? And at what cost? Personal or\u00a0otherwise.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He dodged and dashed, slashed and slid, zapped and zipped...all of it too no avail. And once\u00a0again Zaz Farble fell to the Shadow of the Deep, and Perrygren the Found was taken from his grasp.\u00a0Perrygren fell through darkness, losing himself to the deep.\u00a0They landed in a grassy patch of a mysterious forest. Eager, and yet cautious to discover what awaits.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T05:39:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fb/5fb4701730ffcae9a60e9ead91d9bb17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["From the end Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
