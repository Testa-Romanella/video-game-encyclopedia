The Clown-o-matic has produced hundreds of faulty, idiot clowns, and it's your job to filter out the clowns, so only the best ones can make it to showtime!</p>\n<p>This is a short puzzle game inspired by Lemmings, and made for a second year project in Games Design. The game is fairly simple and asset-light, but designed as more of an experiment and practice in games design than a fully completed product. Nonetheless, I hope you enjoy, and let me know what you think!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T12:05:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6db/6db0e0fd0ab70b4754cbc0c4c2843a51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HerbivoreTheGoat"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
