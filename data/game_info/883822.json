Protect the golfers at all costs from the hostiles, or die trying!</p>\n<p><strong>Blood Drive Golf is a casual roguelite top-down shooter, with elements of tower defense and auto-battle.</strong>\u00a0Most roguelite/roguelike games are full of wonderful ideas, but they almost all suffer from nightmare difficulty levels that are just too much for the average gamer (myself included). So I\u00a0set off to make one that's a bit more relaxed, but with all the other good stuff included - procedural generation, permadeath, biomes, upgrades, unlocks, etc. It's all here... just a bit easier to beat than most of them! (Harder modes can be unlocked).</p>\n<p><strong>The HTML version is just a demo</strong>, mainly because the engine I'm using (TIC-80) doesn't support saving your progress in HTML mode, and there are a ton of unlocks (see below). Also the performance in HTML mode can stutter occasionally, especially in late game with tons of enemies and projectiles on screen at once. It is fine\u00a099% of the time\u00a0on my 3-year old gaming laptop, but it's really meant to be a gateway to the full version.</p>\r\nDownload the full executable version for the optimal experience, and access to all content\r\n<p>Every hero has a unique weapon or augmentation that is exclusive to them.\u00a0Beat the game with that hero to add their exclusive weapon/augmentation to the pool that all heroes can choose from.\u00a0For example, the auto-battle augmentation is exclusive to the Cyborg. Once you beat the game with that hero, then all heroes can use auto-battle.</p>\n<p><strong>Full list of unlockable content:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>6 unlockable heroes (9 total)</li><li>6 unlockable augmentations (31 total)</li><li>3 unlockable weapons (9 total)</li><li>2 unlockable difficulty modes (3 total)</li><li>3 additional biomes (9 total)</li></ul>\r\nHow to play\r\n\n<p>Like many roguelites, you fight enemies and get upgrades (mods/augmentations) after each wave, but you also have a team of mercenaries\u00a0to help you.\u00a0If you're low on health or teammates, you can heal or recruit instead of picking a mod.\u00a0Or you can reroll your options if you don't like them by sacrificing one of your teammates, because the currency in Blood Drive Golf is <strong>BLOOD</strong>!\u00a0One of them\u00a0will immediately die and\u00a0have their head on a pike for you to ponder for the remainder of the map\u00a0(see screenshot below). You can reroll as many times as you have teammates, but each time it costs you one, and you only get more when you recruit them.<br/></p>\n<p>Most upgrades are shared with all friendly NPCs (including golfers), but a few are only for the player.\r\n</p>\n<p>Golfers reset each map (2 per hole),\u00a0and they will fight back when attacked, but otherwise are docile and just want to play some golf!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Controls change dynamically as inputs occur.</p>\n<ul><li>Any mouse movement or left-clicks will swap to mouse controls.\r\n</li><li>Pressing any arrow key will swap to keyboard controls.\r\n</li><li>Pressing the d-pad on a connected gamepad controller will swap to gamepad controls.\r\n</li></ul>\r\nMouse + keyboard (default)\r\n<ul><li>WASD - move up/left/down/right<br/>\n</li><li>Mouse - aim\r\n<ul><li>When auto-battle is on, the cursor will hide after 1 second of inactivity, and targeting/shooting will happen automatically.
