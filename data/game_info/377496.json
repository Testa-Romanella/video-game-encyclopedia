I had a lot of fun with the project overall and it represents a great deal of my interests in terms of video games and academia. Above, you can access the project itself via the run button, or\u00a0download it via the prompt\u00a0below. What follows is the abstract for the project:\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Current studies of game narrative and design, particularly with regard to morality, have focused mainly on direct player engagement. However, this otherwise reasonable perspective omits the other ways in which people experience and engage with games. This project examines the discourse around the game\u00a0</em>Undertale<em>\u00a0and how its community engages with the game, as well as the complications that are posed to the player-centric experience by Let's Players and Speedrunners, who transform games into grounds for spectacles on their own terms.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-27T05:51:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6e/b6e05d483d9f309ca40c32ec1322404d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["i love the work on it can do"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
