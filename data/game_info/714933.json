{"id": 714933, "slug": "jezzball-deluxe", "name": "Jezzball Deluxe", "name_original": "Jezzball Deluxe", "description": "<p>Jezzball Deluxe\u00a0 is base on the old classic Jezzball from windows 3.1 .</p>\n<p>Improvements are real game physics.</p>\n<p>The game starts with two atoms (red-and-white balls), bouncing about a room (the rectangular field of play). The player points at a position within the room and clicks to start building either vertical or horizontal lines, also called walls, from the pointer position, either up and down or left and right.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If the walls reach the edge of the area without a ball colliding into them then the area bound by the line and not containing a ball is 'captured' and filled black. If a ball collides with a wall while it is building then the wall stops at that point and the player loses a life.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The player has a time limit within which to capture at least 70% of the room's surface area. When that percentage is exceeded the level is complete and the player progresses to a fresh room with one more atom bouncing in it than in the previous level. The game is controlled by a standard pointing device such as a mouse. Right click alternates between horizontal and vertical orientation for wall creation and left click starts the walls building.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T05:25:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7c/f7ce867f355ab9a366b50a482afd76fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["meapps"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
