Where you collect a certain amount of objects and evade entities hunting you down. It's a very short game and can be beaten in under 5 minutes... in the correct attempt that is. There is lore that you could find within the game if you're interested in that. Oh yeah, last warning <strong>the jump scares are loud.</strong><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T11:27:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e9/6e9ae041178e78b1beeffe1aa8891a7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kiyopawn"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
