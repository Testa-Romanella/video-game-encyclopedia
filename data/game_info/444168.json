{"id": 444168, "slug": "shield-control", "name": "Shield Control", "name_original": "Shield Control", "description": "<p>Shield Control is a very simple infinite 2D Space shooter with a particlar mechanic: you have a Shield and you need to match its color to the enemy projectiles.\u00a0If you do so, your shield will be recharged. If you allow a different-colore projectile\u00a0/ enemy to hit the shields, the shields will be severely damaged.\u00a0<br/>If the shields go down, they will take a lot of time to recharge, so you will be in peril! The game features 3 different enemies, and 25 wave of increasingly difficult enemies. After the 25th, you'll be hit with a random \"nightmare\" wave each time, until the end of time\u00a0(or until you die!). While the first 25 waves are pre-determined, the actual movement patterns will be random, which means each game session will be different from the last!<br/></p>\n<p>The game has been made as a small learning project.<br/></p>\n<p>Most of the art assets come from\u00a0Kenney Assets, some have been created by me with Krita.<br/></p>\n<p>Audio sounds have been created by myself with sfxia.</p>\n<p>The music has been created by</p>\n<p>Dark Walk by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3612-dark-walk<br/>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p>Have fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T07:11:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d2/1d23fcf579027f51f9c0477f9ee0486a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Artanis"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
