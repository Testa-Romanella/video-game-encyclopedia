But you can only flip hexes that touch the last one you flipped. Matching\u00a0four or more touching colours will EXPLODE! them, freeing those hexes for new colours. Just don\u2019t block yourself in.</p>\n<p>It sounds easy, but with limited board space, Baddies that will mess with your hexes, various board arrangements, and up to six\u00a0colours to balance, you\u2019ll find yourself making difficult strategic decisions and weighing risks.</p>\n<p>\r\nPowers!\r\n</p>\n<p>Every match gives you energy that can be used to activate exciting abilities to increase your options (and your odds of beating those high scores):</p>\n<p> - Swap: Switch the current and next colours</p>\n<p> - Foresight: See which colour will appear in 3 turns</p>\n<p> - Jump: Place your next hex on any colourless space</p>\n<p> - Bomb: Remove all hexes in an area</p>\n<p> - Multi: Place a hex that will match with any colours it touches</p>\n<p>\r\nThree Game Modes\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Classic</em></p>\n<p>Powers are limited to swapping between your current and next colours, and seeing which colour will appear in 3 turns. Know when to save and when to use your energy.</p>\n<p><em>Super</em></p>\n<p>All powers are available providing you have the energy.\u00a0 More complexity, more\u00a0strategic options. Dominate the board.</p>\n<p><em>Challenge</em></p>\n<p>You can always see which colour will appear in 3 turns, but you don\u2019t have any other powers.
