They both share a great friendship despite the (necessary) absence of physical contact! One day, Mr. Flower's so-called friends, the <strong>Water Meanies</strong>, turned against him for sharing a friendship with someone that was not like them (not constantly burning)! Naturally, Mr. Flower thought this was <strong>unacceptable</strong>! How can they judge someone that they never even met or talked to? Help our heroes stand for each other and show the Water Meanies how important it is to\u00a0<strong>work together despite our differences</strong>!</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>A, D\u00a0</strong>- Move Left and Right<br/><strong>Left Mouse Button </strong>- Shoot Sparks (Miss Flame)<br/><strong>Right Mouse Button </strong>- Block Attacks (Mr. Flower)</p>\n<p><strong>Rely </strong>was done for the 2020 edition of the Extra Credits Game Jam (#ExtraJam2020) in 72 hours, under the theme <strong>Take Care. </strong>It is an arcade score-chasing Shooter in which you control two characters that must take care of each other in order to survive the incoming enemy waves. One of them can only shoot, while the other can only block incoming bullets, providing an asymmetrical control experience. Survive against the incoming waves of enemies and try to reach for an high score!</p>\n<p>Besides being packed with hand-eye coordination testing, the game also currently features <strong>6 different Water Meanies</strong>, including a <strong>Boss Meanie</strong>, ready to knock your socks off!
