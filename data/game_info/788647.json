I plan to make the story both character and plot driven. I\u2019ve always written stories since I was little but this is my first time writing interactive fiction and I\u2019m trying to figure it out as I go \ud83d\ude0a.<br/></p>\r\nPREMISE\r\n<p><em>This is the longest period the whole realm has been at peace with each other. Up north we have the </em><strong><em>Kingdom of Morovia</em></strong><em>. The ancient home of Healers. Although they occupy the most minimal land on the great continent, they have held their ground for centuries now. The only other people to rival them in strength and resilience are the Artorians. The </em><strong><em>Artorian Kingdom</em></strong><em>, a string of islands located in the middle of the vast ocean in the east. The birthplace of elemental magic, dragon riding, and serpent taming. The only other kingdom that has dealt with more creatures is </em><strong><em>Adelia</em></strong><em>. They occupy the southern half of the great continent. Filled with many fantastical creatures, it's the place that holds the most mystique. To the left, across the sea, we've got the </em><strong><em>Esebet Empire</em></strong><em>. The land that has been growing in power. Last, but not least, we have </em><strong><em>Norteal</em></strong><em>. The kingdom that has grown tremendously over time. From a small country up north to ruling across the great continent. It also happens to be the place our story starts...</em></p>\n<p><strong>The power to heal is an extraordinary gift. Passed on only by blood. Or so one thinks.</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Rudrom, Norteal</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>You are a 22 year old healer working as a bookshop assistant. You've been living here for about a year now and the quest to earn a good living has been troublesome. Not to mention, life has fallen into a routine of cleaning and organizing books. The good side: it makes for a great excuse to sit and talk with Josh and Alethea. The twins have no family apart from each other and you are far away from your own. They've been your closest companions in the big city for the past year.\r\n</p>\n<p>One day, while you guys are cleaning out the shop, you stumble upon a journal that most likely belonged to a relative of Josh and Alethea. A journal that reveals its secrets upon a certain touch. Not only that, but the maps drawn in it seem to be hinting at the rumored treasure in the east. Just one problem, it is written in Artorian. Artoria's language is rich but, unfortunately, not really spoken by anyone in Rudrom. That is, except for the notorious Artorian mage, Lucinda.\r\n</p>\n<p>Your friends are basically penniless, and you aren\u2019t better off yourself. Will you try your luck and get Lucinda on your side? Even if she does agree to help, could you actually find a way to board the next ship sailing to Artoria? Will you be able to navigate through an entire kingdom without drawing attention to yourself? Are the clues truly leading you to riches or is this all one wild goose chase?\r\n</p>\r\nFEATURES\r\n<ul><li>Customize your character: Name, gender, pronouns, appearance and more.\r\n</li><li>Make choices that matter.\r\n</li><li>Explore and find out more about the realm.\r\n</li><li>Hone your healer powers.\r\n</li><li>Build friendships: Get to spend time and bond with the characters.\r\n</li><li>Romantic rendezvous: Romance any of 8 love interests, 3 female, 4 male, and 1 non-binary.\r\n</li><li>Go on a treacherous sea journey, hang out with the crewmates.\r\n</li><li>Navigate your way through the land of Artoria whilst trying not to get caught.\r\n</li><li>Unravel the secrets hiding in the shadows.\r\n</li></ul>\r\nLOVE INTERESTS\r\n<p>\ud83d\udc3e <strong>Alethea Bower (she/her)</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Alethea is a 22 year old cook/waitress who works at \u201cPete\u2019s Diner\u201d.
