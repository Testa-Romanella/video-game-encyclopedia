{"id": 458842, "slug": "dragon-warrior-64", "name": "Dragon Warrior 64", "name_original": "Dragon Warrior 64", "description": "<p>One of my favorite games growing up, Dragon Warrior.\u00a0 With a few tweaks of my own.\u00a0</p>\n<p>No longer are the stats based off of your player name! So use what ever, 8 character, name you want with out being penalized with poor starting stats.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Support for keyboard control or Joypad controls.</p>\n<p>Adjustable volume controls.</p>\n<p>Not a strict clone as I added a few features but has a fairly good 'original' feel to the game play.</p>\n<p>The MFI file is the assets file and is needed to run the game. Make sure both the EXE and MFI are in the same folder.</p>\n<p>While the game should run on Windows, Linux, and Mac OSs due to the constantly changing nature of OSs I can only confirm that it does run on Windows up to 7. but it should run on anything from XP on.\u00a0 I do not have a machine running Linux or Macintosh OSs but the base language, QB64( https://www.qb64.org/portal/), does its best to remain compatible with those two OSs as well.</p>\n<p>If you have issues or find a bug that causes game play issues leave a comment below and I will look into it when time permits. Cosmetic bugs are not going to be a very high priority issue, and there are a few. I have played the game from start to finish so I believe I have quashed the main functional bugs but, I am just one person so somebody else may find something I missed and those bugs will be addressed as they appear.</p>\n<p>Do let me know what you think, if you enjoyed, or even hated the game. All feedback is appreciated and will help me grow as a hobbyist programmer.</p>\n<p>UniKorn ProDucKions was something I made up back in the early 1990s as I was introduced to programming, and from that time I've always wanted to recreate some of my favorite video games I played growing up. And as long as long as certain people don't object I will be attempting to get more of my clones out into the world.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T06:53:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70a/70abe0e3dedd0bfe266a9662f1e9cfe3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 211, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["UniKorn ProDuckions"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
