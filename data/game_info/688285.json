I realize this game is pretty barebones even for a match-3 clone, and while I may decide to build upon it with more features and objectives in the future, at least for now I'm happy with it being a short, fun little Halloween minigame. So I really hope you enjoy, and Happy Halloween to all!</strong></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p><strong>This game, its visuals, and audio\u00a0was made entirely by myself.
