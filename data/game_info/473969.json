Your job, as a rover of Mars, is to find out why this army is being built and to stop it from being used to wage a war against Earth.</p>\n<p>To do this, you will of course need to find the five purple keys and ascend to the top of an ancient Martian pyramid of mysterious origin.</p>\n<p>\"The Mars Rover\" was created (mostly) live on stream as part of a series known as \"The Joy of ZZT\". Its goal was to demonstrate how someone with no experience with ZZT could still create a game with it. The game is fairly simple and mostly takes inspiration from classic early ZZT worlds by Tim Sweeney and Alexis Janson.</p>\n<p>https://museumofzzt.com<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Standalone Version:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The standalone download includes the game's ZZT file and documentation. To run locally, extract the zip into a directory which contains a copy of ZZT v3.2 and the latest version of Zeta to run on a modern computer.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T04:14:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41f/41fd686d369b82fcc4f95a257854918e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dr. Dos"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
