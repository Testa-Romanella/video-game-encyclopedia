Make morally grey decisions and witness how they impact the world at multiple levels, shape the transformation of the City, and ultimately decide its fate.</p>", "metacritic": 77, "released": "2022-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-14T07:38:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/73d/73db43df633477d4604c7248292f34b2.jpg", "website": "https://dyinglightgame.com/", "rating": 3.67, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 259, "owned": 1444, "beaten": 258, "toplay": 739, "dropped": 121, "playing": 66}, "playtime": 23, "achievements_count": 224, "ratings_count": 342, "suggestions_count": 1164, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 353, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox One", "Xbox Series S/X", "PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 5"], "developers": ["Techland"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Techland Publishing"], "esrb_rating": null}
