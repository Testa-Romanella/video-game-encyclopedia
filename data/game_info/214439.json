{"id": 214439, "slug": "go-to-the-light-2", "name": "Go to the Light?", "name_original": "Go to the Light?", "description": "<p>Go to the Light? is a 2D Pixel Platformer with a mind boggling twist. When you come in contact with the floor, the entire floor flips so that you are now standing on the ceiling. The goal is to enter the door at the end of the level. Move with \"A\" and \"D\", jump with \"Space\"\u00a0and restart with \"R\". Jump fast before you fall through the ground? Or was it the ceiling?This game is only a prototype and there will be more levels in a future update\u00a0with different colored tiles for each level as well as more unique floors and exits. The mechanics will be made more fluid in the next update. This game concept has lots of potential, but it just needs more time for development and experimentation on new game mechanics.\u00a0At one point the light floor would turn dark and the dark floor would turn light, but my code got messed up, so that feature should be coming out soon since it worked before. Thanks again for playing my game. Please donate to help the game along if you can :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05c/05c2a7f289f25adacbc95ef0a71daa71.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HansenDJ"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
