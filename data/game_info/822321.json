Please don't rate this game for the game jam unless you play it with somebody else :D<br/> <br/>It's REALLY fun in multiplayer. Just saying, because it is actually true. REALLY fun.]\r\n<p>The goal of the game is to <strong>be the last dino left alive</strong>, by using explosive dice to blow up everybody else. Some say that's how the <em>dinosaurs</em> actually went extinct.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>Blue: Arrow Keys + Space</li><li>Red: WASD + E</li><li>Yellow: TFGH + Y</li><li>Green: IJKL + O</li></ul>\r\nDice Bombs\r\n<p>Use <strong>Space, E, Y or O</strong> to drop a dice bomb at your feet. After a few seconds, it will explode, sending fire in all directions. Please do not try this at home.</p>\n<p><strong>Bombs can destroy bushes, but not rocks.</strong> Make sure you're never in a bomb's way or things could go horribly wrong for you. (And wonderfully right for everybody against you.)</p>\r\nPower Ups\r\n<p>Sometimes a power up is hidden in a <strong>bush</strong> that you just happen to blow up.</p>\n<ul><li>Dice with <strong>plus symbols</strong> on them give you <strong>one extra bomb</strong>. This means you can place multiple explosives at once! (Again, please don't try this at home, and especially not with real dinosaurs.)</li><li>Dice with <strong>up arrows</strong> on them <strong>upgrade your bomb</strong> power. By collecting this, your bomb explosions will travel further distances (up to a maximum of\u00a06).</li></ul>\n\n<p>Now go play, because that's it.</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Music: Kevin MacLeod (\"Happy Alley\" and \"Who Likes to Party\")</li><li>Sound Effects: Made on\u00a0sfxr.me</li><li>Artwork: Spruce Studios, arks.itch.io and allenski.itch.io</li><li>Scripting: Spruce Studios</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T15:18:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78d/78d450b4c5ce1e0141170a7230c384a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Spruce Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
