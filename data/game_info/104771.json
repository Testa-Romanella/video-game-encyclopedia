You must wade through crowds of the walking dead with your partner. Zombies are very fast here, and you will struggle to get away from them, so you must rely only on your reflexes and accuracy. Also, from out of nowhere, a huge monster-mutant may appear at any time. An arsenal from a variety of weapons - from a baseball bat to a grenade launcher, will be at your disposal. You have two characters, a man or a woman, to choose from. No matter who you choose, you will also be helped by another character. And remember, you must not let him die!<br/></p><p><strong>Watch the trailer<br/></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b84/b84fcdd362e431fc9204f20e13f0a325.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 238, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["seaalight"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
