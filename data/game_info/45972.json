{"id": 45972, "slug": "undermine", "name": "UnderMine", "name_original": "UnderMine", "description": "<p>Action-Adventure. Rogue-like. RPG.How many genres can one game belong to? We would have prefered all of them, but you\u2019ll just have to settle for most of them. UnderMine stirs a delicious pot of genre soup, taking only the highest quality ingredients from each. We took the procedurally generated madness of the craziest rogue-likes (Binding of Isaac, Dead Cells, etc.), combined that with the exploration and discovery of classic action-adventures (The Legend of Zelda, Hyper Light Drifter, etc.), and topped it off with some light RPG progression and story (Rogue Legacy.)</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<p>Dungeon Crawling: Forge that perfect run where you find all the right items, all the right secrets, and get all the right rolls to become a peasant god of destruction.</p>\n<p>Discovery and Exploration: Bomb walls, blow up rocks, light torches, and discover secret passages, hidden characters, loot, upgrades, and more.</p>\n<p>Character Progression: The peasants keep dying, but your upgrades pass on. Unlock new abilities that will help in combat and open up new areas to explore.</p>\n<p>Bosses That Don\u2019t Mess Around: Challenge enormous bosses that take a combination of upgrades and skill to take down.Darkly LightheartedExperience the plight of the poor peasant sent into the goldmine. His job is to labor away for a boss that doesn\u2019t care about him, in an environment that is openly hostile, and amongst creatures that want to tear his flesh off his bones. A pretty funny situation when you think about it.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2020-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-23T19:55:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/1b5/1b5d958d5a1956319211822a0f2792e4.jpg", "website": "https://undermine.game/", "rating": 3.82, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 25, "owned": 593, "beaten": 33, "toplay": 43, "dropped": 53, "playing": 15}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 228, "ratings_count": 99, "suggestions_count": 375, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 100, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "Nintendo Switch", "PC", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Adam McLellan", "Ricardo Chirino", "Thorium Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Adam McLellan", "Thorium Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
