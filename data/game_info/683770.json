Out of Order is a top-down survival shooter which incorporates all three themes of this game jam (Reset, Minimal interaction &amp; two views). The game takes place in a unit where the opposite color balls attract the player and damage them. To avoid dying grab the same color ball and reset their movement to attack the following balls. Use a dash to move quickly and avoid close balls. The unit changes its color randomly as the place is out of order. The player can only move, dash, and reset balls to attack. Let's see how long you can survive and let us know your feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T05:58:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f45/f450db11c20ad025822f3f3d890c8b9c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["yellowflash"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
