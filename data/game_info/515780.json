Don't try to play the game in mobile devices.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Goals:</p>\n<p>1st stage =&gt; Survive waves of enemies for 3 minutes.</p>\n<p>2nd stage =&gt; Survive waves of enemies for 2 minutes and then defeat the 'boss' (most powerful enemy ship).</p>\n<p>Gameplay:</p>\n<p>* The player can move around the screen using the W A S D or directional keys on the keyboard.<br/>* The space bar is used to fire and the X or M keys to fire a special attack when loaded.<br/>* The Esc key is used to access the 'pause menu'.<br/>* As the player destroys enemy units, the chances of dropping an item that helps or strengthens it increases. Chances are reset when an item falls.<br/>=&gt; The items are: 'Extra Life'; 'Shield'; 'Special Attack'; 'Increase Shot Level';</p>\n<p>* The game ends when the player completes all objectives (victory) or loses all lives (defeat). At the end, it returns to the menu.<br/>* The game has a simple scoring and record system. The score always appears during the game and increases as the player destroys enemy units and always restarts from a new game. The record is recorded (via the PlayerPrefs class) at the end of the game if it is higher than the previous record.</p>\n<p>The project was based in this tutorial on YouTube.</p>\n<p>Some sprites was made by me, using Gravit Designer, other sprites,\u00a0 songs\u00a0 and audio FX\u00a0come from tutorial above and third party free content.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Special thanks to:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gabriel Barbosa - owner of 'High Level',\u00a0 YouTube\u00a0 channel.<br/></p>\n<p>Luis Zuno (@ansimuz),\u00a0 by some sprites used in\u00a0game.\u00a0\u00a0https://ansimuz.itch.io/spaceship-shooter-environment</p><p>GameSupplyGuy,\u00a0\u00a0by some sprites used in\u00a0game.\u00a0\u00a0https://gamesupply.itch.io/samson-battlecruiser-dragonfly</p>\n<p>Paul Giblock, by the song 'AngryLlama' (used in game's intro), avaible in LMMS software as demo song.<br/></p>\n<p>*This game was made as non-profit.</p>\n<p>Give me some feedback and put your best score on comments\u00a0\ud83d\udc31\u200d\ud83c\udfcd</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T05:01:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06e/06e2d85e9007d1ffa1b62ca47dc5a903.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["VinnyTells"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
