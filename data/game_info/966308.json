Your task will be to recycle the trash into useful resources as it keeps coming down, and build automated deadly defences. Why defenses? Well other drones are not so lucky as you, and they will come to steal your precious garbage... But of course we trust you to kick them out before any makes it out with your trash! But do take caution that your garbage doesn't pile up too high either...<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is a unique and nervous take on the match-3 genre, inspired by the likes of Wario's woods, with a tower defense twist. Play solo or in local coop to defend your trash pile, or battle it out with a friend in versus mode!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-15T04:37:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f9/7f9c9b7f9cf55abd123896c5046541a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PUNKCAKE Delicieux"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PUNKCAKE Delicieux"], "esrb_rating": null}
