So she left her home with only a map, her small amount of savings and some stories to guide her on the journey. Wilder Village was her destination, often told of as an idyllic village that borders the dangerous and awe inspiring 'Great Wilderness'.  After months of travel the protagonist has finally arrived...<h3>Wilder Village &amp; The Great Wilderness</h3><br/>The village houses a selection of locations you can visit and people you can meet and work with whilst exploring the wilderness that borders the village.  You can also build relationships with them, help them out with a few things and even have a romance, or maybe just have some casual dates if you prefer. <br/><br/>Just outside the village is the entryway to the Wilderness an area considered wild and mostly unexplored, filled with creatures of legend, beasts and most importantly reagents. The items you find will allow you to craft new potions to sell and increase your wealth and experience to become a new Hedge Witch.<h3>Features</h3><ul><li>Explore the Great Wilderness<br/></li><li>Encounter random events and people<br/></li><li>Battle Creatures, Monsters and Bandits<br/></li><li>Gather ingredients and craft potions and items<br/></li><li>Test unknown potions with your clients<br/></li><li>Improve your fighting skills via a leveling system<br/></li><li>Increase your Alchemy knowledge<br/></li><li>Get to know your fellow villagers<br/></li><li>Upgrade your armor and weapons<br/></li><li>Build relationships with different people<br/></li><li>Relax and spend time fishing</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74a/74a729323d8f2532cd1535fb4234d624.jpg", "website": "http://dharker.studio", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 286, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Dharker Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dharker Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
