But\u00a0\u00a0tarry not, for it is easy to forget what you were searching for. Alas, many have lost themselves amongst the dust motes, unable to remember their original purpose and unable to find the way out.\u00a0Search thus with haste and purpose, and go whence you came.</p>\n<p>As fickle and feeble as the flame of your heart may be, may you find that which you seek, and may the dust fall softly on you.</p><p>p.s. This is my first time using Mosi to create a game :) It is a very cute world-building tool that allows you to make tiles, sprites and even music! Even though I encountered some bugs with the \"if\" statements, it was still pretty fun and nifty to use. So, I recommend that you give Mosi a try if you ever want to build tiny worlds for your game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-16T04:30:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcf/fcffe404616a011b366fdd9cc01b95d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kaelynmauve"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
