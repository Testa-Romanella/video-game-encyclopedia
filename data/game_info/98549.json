We only have so long before we pass, as our time here is temporary. Magical relics allow us to extend our time to absorb our memories. The experience is inspired by the transition between life and death; by taking you to an ethereal world where our memories are suspended in time. The transition speaks to how long we can dwell on these memories before they distort. <br/></p><p>***Fragment is being updated. The game is temporarily available without background music.***<br/></p><p><strong>Game by </strong>Nicholas Caserta, Faryal Hussain, and Elizabeth Peralta</p><p><strong>Visit our </strong><strong>blog here</strong></p><p><strong>Contact </strong>ExperienceFragment@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4dd/4ddfd2f61d621b6bacfcf9b6be3b4497.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Fragment"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
