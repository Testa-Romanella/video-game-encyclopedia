{"id": 19467, "slug": "altitude", "name": "Altitude", "name_original": "Altitude", "description": "<p>Altitude is a multiplayer combat game developed by Erik Measure and Karl Sabo in 2009. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>This is a classic 2-D arcade with simple gameplay and old-school design. The player aims to win in aerial battles performing in one-person battles, where computer bots can be used instead of other players or as a team player.<br />\nThe pace of each battle is fast so that this game may change the player\u2019s skills. As the player gains experience in battles, new planes and customizations are unlocked. A significant part of controlling is concentrated on the mouse. The usual amount of players per battle is something between 2 to 16 persons. Each plane and each level has its design: there is a football ground theme, a space theme, and a city theme. </p>\n<h3>Game modes</h3>\n<p>There are seven game modes which differ in the number of players, combat techniques and demands needed to complete the level. There is the classic deathmatch called the Free For All mode, where the player\u2019s goal is to destroy as many planes as possible. There is a level that follows the rules similar to football: the team\u2019s goal is to make a goal with a single persistent ball. The winner should reach six goals or gain more points until the time is expired. There is also a One Life Deathmatch which is a lot like the classic FFA mode, but with the exception that no player can respawn after each round \u2013 the winner is the last plane left alive.</p>", "metacritic": 79, "released": "2009-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-08T01:59:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/766/766bf376eb4c3ecd0edd1e55369e3154.jpg", "website": "http://altitudegame.com/", "rating": 2.4, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 30, "owned": 893, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 24}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 52, "ratings_count": 53, "suggestions_count": 378, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 53, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Nimbly Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Nimbly Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
