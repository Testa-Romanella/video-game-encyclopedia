{"id": 463220, "slug": "purple-puzzles", "name": "Purple Puzzles", "name_original": "Purple Puzzles", "description": "<p>A little 2D puzzle game centered around tile-flipping and my favorite color purple.</p>\n<p>The game contains 20 levels in total, each containing a mix of several puzzle elements. You may only traverse each level on the gray tiles, and moving off of a tile flips it to be purple. Other puzzle elements include pushable diamonds, receptors, portals, and boosters, which provide other ways to make tiles purple. Complete each level by flipping every tile in the map to be purple and reaching the exit.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Movement/UI Control</strong>: WASD</p>\n<p>Feel free to let me know if you come across any bugs or have any general feedback. Hope you have fun solving the puzzles :-)<br/></p>\n<p>Programming, Art, Design, SFX by vsie.
