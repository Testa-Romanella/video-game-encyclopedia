There are 4 different kinds of weapons with \n      different firing ranges that are at the player's disposal: standard \n      handguns, shotguns, and machine guns to name a few. Other guns can be \n      obtained by shooting the chickens that carry them across the screen. \n      Climb behind the trigger and help our distressed farmer friend \n      obliterate hordes of no good c1uckers! Great comic sound effects, and \n      catchy original songs to fashion a world where hunting fowl is a blast! \n      Brilliant animation takes you through forests and villages, through \n      deserts and mountains, winging winged adversaries and piling up points.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2002-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1d/a1d382ab3b0f20e9b19d2550d593e862.jpg", "website": "http://www.chickenshoot.com/eng/html/cs1/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS", "Wii", "PC"], "developers": ["Toontraxx", "Frontline"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": ["Destination Software", "Zuxxez Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
