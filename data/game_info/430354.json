The catch is, your dad showed up this time! You're so emotional that you could cry! But, your dad always told you, \"There's no crying in baseball, son.\" Maintain your composure as you play this home-run derby! But beware, it gets harder as you go, and the other team doesn't play fair.<h3>Controls</h3>    This marker is where balls will land. Aim for this spot, then click to swing.      This is your emotion meter. Keep the green bar touching the yellow spot, and you'll keep your cool.
