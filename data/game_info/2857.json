{"id": 2857, "slug": "not-a-hero", "name": "Not A Hero", "name_original": "Not A Hero", "description": "<p>Not A Hero is an indie cover-based 2D shooter game developed by Roll7.</p>\n<p>A purple rabbit named BunnyLord uses time travel to become a mayor and save the world from the alien invasion. In order to prove to the people that he has to be elected, he hires freelance anti-heroes to get rid of the crime in the city.</p>\n<p>Not A Hero features a unique pixelated style. At the beginning of each level, the player chooses one out of nine characters. Each character has their own traits and a set of unique gameplay changes. The players have a primary weapon that they can upgrade either temporarily or until the level is completed. Special weapons are also available, such as automatic turrets or exploding cats.</p>\n<p>There is no jumping in the game, yet the player can slide. Sliding can be used to get into cover against the in-game objects or tackle enemies which makes them easier to kill. The characters can withstand several hits and the health is restored pretty fast.</p>\n<p>The game features different objectives for each level, but every one of them is issued by BunnyLord.</p>", "metacritic": 75, "released": "2015-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-10T15:36:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37f/37f58feca84811904d56a0ebfdc3531e.jpg", "website": "http://www.notahe.ro", "rating": 3.25, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 111, "owned": 1580, "beaten": 72, "toplay": 27, "dropped": 143, "playing": 10}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 47, "ratings_count": 240, "suggestions_count": 265, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 240, "platforms": ["Linux", "Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4", "PC", "macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Devolver Digital", "Roll7", "Roll 7"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Devolver Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
