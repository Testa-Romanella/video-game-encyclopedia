(Controls detailed below.)</p>\n<p>Frantic Pharmacy is currently under development.<br/>Please play in Fullscreen Mode.<br/>Please play with sound on as this is an important part of the game's feel.<br/>Please fill out the\u00a0Beta Feedback Form when you are done playing.</p>\n<p><em>If running the game on low-end hardware such as basic laptops/Chromebooks then sometimes you will not be able to interact with the patients for some strange reason. If you refresh the page and reload the game a couple of times, this seems to fix the issue, although sometimes the patients animations will not play fully leaving them in a position where you cannot interact with them. The game is not originally designed for web browser, but this provides a more accessible\u00a0platform for feedback.</em></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>WASD / Arrows - Move<br/>Left Shift - Dash<br/>Space / Left Mouse Click - Interact</p>\n<p>Game concept, design and development\u00a0by Rhydian\u00a0Carter.</p>\n<p><em>Produced for Leeds Beckett University as part of BSc (Hons) Games Design, Level 6, \"Production Project\" Module.</em></p>\r\nMusic<p>\n</p><p><strong><em>\"Neon Laser Horizon\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License<br/></em></strong><strong><em>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</em></strong></p><p><em>\"Pleasant Porridge\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License<br/></em><em>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</em><br/></p>\r\nSFX\r\n<p><em>mixkit.co</em><em>\u00a0(+ some recorded by yours truly, lol)</em></p>\r\n3D Assets\r\n<p><em>https://poly.pizza/</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T14:14:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/840/8401574002af65f29c32833089d0ed49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rhydian Carter"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
