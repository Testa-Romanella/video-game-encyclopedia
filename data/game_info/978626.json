A classic RPG experience, with modern game design and deep battle strategy.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn the mysterious Kingdom of Alterra, a young princess defies her father and makes her own path in the world.  She makes invaluable companions along the way, and learns the truth about the Kingdom she is destined to inherit.  The rich story includes several overlapping narratives, character growth, and twists.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game features a dynamic timeline system that determines the order of actions in battle. Character and enemy icons move along a timeline at the top of the screen, showing when each combatant will act. This timeline system adds an element of strategy, as you can delay or interrupt enemies by well-timed actions.  The system also allows for deep character customization, including a job system (with primary classes and subclasses), skill point system (acquire and spend points to learn class-specific skills), and a deep magic system.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nConcoct useful items from ingredients you come across during your journey.  Customize your characters with unique items, equipment, classes and traits!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nZelda-like puzzle solving allows you to manipulate your surroundings and progress through the many dungeons scattered across the world.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-18T06:49:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eca/eca79e63ddd4e75c5269b970f74c604e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 358, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["New Moon Studio"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["New Moon Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
