It only covers the first mission but it uses the quest structure and battle system that I plan on using. The goal is to create an Retro RPG that:</p>\n<ul><li>Has a mature, branching storyline in which decisions matter;</li><li>Has a engaging battle system that allows players to spare their enemies (and live with the consequences); and</li><li>Encourages multiple playthroughs by changing combat parameters and also changing the story based on player decisions.</li></ul><p>I'm just one guy so if there is interest, I'll move forward with the project. Any constructive feedback is also welcome\u00a0:)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T05:42:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c9/4c972ae13d187d765ea733300409633d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BrokenEsper"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
