It's hard - you have no clue what type of teas they would like - and there is quite a lot combinations!</p>\n<p>And they talk to you about their problems and you feel the unholy urge to mingle with their lives.</p>\n<p>The game is aimed at mobile, but at this point it can be tried out on Windows, too, because we are not at THAT point yet.</p>\n<p>You can start it, read the help (that's the setting for now), then play through one customers dialogues, then you will reach one ending.</p>\n<p>Then you should kill the app, because there is NO EXIT.\u00a0</p>\n<p>...<br/></p>\n<p>And the app is everywhere. Sorry, joking. Just on your screen. <br/><br/>BTW, the theme is that if you interact with the humans, your presence will linger with them, and soon you will \u00a0be everywhere. Or something liket that.</p>\n<p>Created with Ink, Unity and a splash of LOVE, some lime and strawberries.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T13:31:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ff/2ffc03f4e017dbfb585e44a9b3286a1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["gillz", "schattensong", "SachiTheRaven", "Sodalitea"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
