Yea, it's still canon and yea it's still part of the series, but the art style's kinda all over the place, and the controls are a bit wonky at times and stuff. Still, looking back and feeling eh about what I made means I know how to make bigger and better things, and I guess that's just something to take with us as we make the next DURAG games... besides OOT was glitchy and wonky af but that was the best they had back then, so... I guess DURAG is just OUR OOT \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\udc80\r\nWarning: Contains Teenage Humor\r\n\n<p>Call of DURAG uses DURAG's \"engine\" to create a whole new experience! Though the game isn't canon in the DURAG timeline, it's endless waves of enemies inspired by Call of Duty: Zombies are sure to get you sweating and raging in seconds!</p>\n\n<p>Call of DURAG features four different difficulty arenas, ranging from those just starting out, to the sadistic players looking for a full on brawl-fest! Unlike many other games of ours in the past, the public version of Call of DURAG is the ENTIRE GAME! Play the whole thing from beginning to end on your Windows, Linux, or Mac computer!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T07:38:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/887/887a2d02317f89838819eb9ff1da442f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 282, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Shaggy39"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
