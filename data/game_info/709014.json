The ball descends from top to bottom along the rising platforms. Your task is to move the ball left and right in order to manage to go down the platforms and not be squeezed at the top. The game features three difficulty modes. On the hardest, all your finger dexterity and reaction speed will be required as the platforms will rise quickly enough. With the passage of each platform, you are awarded record points. Collect as many as possible and good luck with the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T03:07:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03c/03cacca5fe77314bb825f15b58a8449a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["QuickBobber"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["QuickBobber"], "esrb_rating": null}
