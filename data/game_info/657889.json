Features loads of customization, exclusively local multiplayer because I was too lazy to add online or AI support and had already been working on this for way too long, and a ton of wild and wacky game modifiers, plus a completely original soundtrack of THREE WHOLE TUNES!</p>\n<p>Controls are listed in-game - Just hit the Options button to view and change keybinds.<br/>Other than that, the only unlisted keybind is pause - just hit the ENTER key to pause the game at any time! I'd recommend using multiple keyboards to avoid ghosting.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T05:35:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c3/7c386db8bd138683de4741fdb7286b37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TechHead"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
