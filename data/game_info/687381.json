Each sacrifice requires one bone, one plant, and one cat. The king will write his request down on the scroll at the top of the screen. Explore the castle and grounds in order to find these resources. Press 'e' near one to pick it up. Go to the top of the altar to deliver your items (e). If you pick\u00a0up the wrong item,\u00a0you may dispose of\u00a0it in the trash can in the throne room (e). Once you have completed the king's request, return to the throne room to receive\u00a0a new task. Make sure to wash off the altar with the water bucket (e). You can return the bucket to where you got it from after.</p>\n<p>(P.S. Our highscore was 14.
