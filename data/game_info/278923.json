Press-and-Hold the Left Mouse Button to shoot.</strong><br/></em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Hello Employee!<br/></strong><br/>Our rivals have been out-performing us during the super-critical Super Saturday sale period!<br/>But fret not, for you have been chosen to operate the very latest in Present Delivery Mechanisms - the <strong>Present-O-Tron</strong>. We have determined that the best way to spread Holiday Cheer is to help as many customers purchase our ridiculously discounted products as possible. And what better way to help them make those purchases than to fling the products at their faces!<br/>Seat yourself behind the launcher and make this sale a great success!<br/><br/>Remember! If you let too many customers crowd near the shelves a fight may break out. If customers have to pick their presents from the shelves themselves it might leave them a bit miffed, especially since we have promised a quick, painless experience. Do your best and you may find yourself with the coveted title of <strong>Employee of the Month</strong>.</p>\n\r\nA game for the Extra Credits Holiday 2018 Game Jam by-<br/>Abhishek Agarwal<br/>Abhishek Khade<br/>Achintya Bisht<br/>Ganesh Sharma<br/>Ujwal Kumar\r\n<p><em>PS: Added Mac and PC executables in case web version is wonky for you.
