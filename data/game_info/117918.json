Based on the xkcd comic #1433.</p>\n<p>How do you actually use a light saber that doesn't\u00a0 end?\u00a0 Can you traverse the level, while also keeping it intact?<br/></p>\n<p>I really liked the ridiculous nature of the comic found here:</p>\n<p>https://xkcd.com/1433/<br/></p>\n<p>...and was hoping to capture that in this gamejam challenge. At the moment, it's a bit more of an interactive humor comic. :P But I Iiked the idea of balancing when to turn on your saber to attack/defend and traversing the level.</p>\n<p>Update 1.0.2:</p>\n<p>Various bug fixes. Title screen UI works with controller now.</p><p>(Added mac and linux versions. Both untested at the moment).</p>\n<p>Update 1.0.1:</p>\n<p>Added more final anims and other tweaks.</p>\n<p>CTRLS:</p>\n<p>Can be played with mouse/keyboard or controller.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Keyboard Controls-</p>\n<p>WASD to move.\u00a0Space or W to jump. Left-mouse-click uses your saber, right-mouse deploys it. Press W or space to double-jump.</p>\n<p>Controller-</p>\n<p>Left analog stick moves. A for jump. Press A again to double-jump. X for attack.
