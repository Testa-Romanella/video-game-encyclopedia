There are 4 different views set up looking into one room - the casino floor.  People will be freely moving around the room and as such you'll need to look at all the cameras to see where they might have gone.  You can click on any of the camera feeds to zoom in on that view in the room, which will help you pick out the correct person.  The score is based on how quickly you are able to find each person, with no points given after a certain amount of time.  There is no gameover, feel free to play as long as you like!</p><p>Thank you for taking a look and I hope you enjoy it!</p><p>Ludum Dare link: http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-37/?action=preview&amp;uid=109750</p><p>Video timelapse for the making:</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBnXjVvFaOc<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d6/9d643521e1e211001315fd540b07d1a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Doublesquare"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
