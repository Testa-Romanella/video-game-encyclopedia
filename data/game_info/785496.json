With little more to their name than a broken boat and some fishing gear, they must interact with a small variety of strange, magical individuals in order to fix their craft and eventually escape! Or not. They could also just walk around and enjoy the scenery if that's your preference.</p>\n\n<p>This game was created for the April 2022 Bitsy Jam, where the theme was Shipwreck! Unlike most of the projects I've worked on, this one was made pretty much off the cuff with the actual plot and writing not being started until after most of the game world was constructed. As such, this one has a much more 'game-y' feel than other projects I've worked on. Please let me know what you think in the comments below, and as always thanks for playing! <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T18:40:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a8/9a8444cdc6d7ce440733a52ae115b374.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Phil Johnson"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
