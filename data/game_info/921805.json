Theme: Roots <br/>My personal goal was to just create a small base game for adding mini games to it. <br/>In my main project I will need mini games, so I want to test them in a separate project which will be this one. <br/><br/>The game contains 3 different puzzle games with 4 difficulty-levels. <br/>For each game and for each difficulty can you get a score. The sum of all scores can be one of the global plasterboard's scores. <br/><br/><br/></p><p>Sound is from a sound-asset-bundle. <br/>The pictures in the game that are not vector-art are from https://openai.com/api/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T01:34:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/642/6420f41f0d6d41ef1e899910c27a1438.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IsaVII"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
