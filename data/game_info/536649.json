{"id": 536649, "slug": "fallswitch", "name": "FallSwitch", "name_original": "FallSwitch", "description": "<p><strong>FallSwitch is about infinite verticality. You play as a defective labor droid, designated LN-DR, who must traverse a never-ending asteroid field by sprinting, leaping, and thrusting through space.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Armed with a limited-recharge shield and a self-propulsion mechanism, you must navigate between asteroids gracefully and efficiently in order to survive the harsh vacuum.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The world of FallSwitch is infinitely, procedurally generated. No two asteroids are the same, and you will never find a world border, no matter how far you travel.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The answer?\u00a0Depends. Each asteroid has its own gravitational\u00a0pull, and in order to avoid an untimely\u00a0reunion with the ground, you must adapt and\u00a0re-orient yourself on the fly.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Asteroids vary in shape and size - some are no bigger than a few dozen meters, while others would take you an hour to walk around. In addition, their surfaces exhibit unique and varied terrain,\u00a0</strong><strong>with mountains, valleys, plains, and everything in between.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>While you might be tempted to swiftly land on an asteroid, don't get too hasty - your body can only take so much impact force before it shuts down!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Below are zipped folders containing executables for Windows, Mac, and Linux.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>If you download and play the game, I would really appreciate it if you could fill out the survey\u00a0below afterward. Keep in mind that answers are kept anonymous, so say whatever you want to say!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T07:58:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/958/958b8cd74858231de413df3325b44975.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["GGSEvan"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
