Realize. Emancipate. Reborn.<br/></p>\n<p>Emancipate. From our past. From our blood. From our formal education. From our genre definition. From our love conceptions. From our perceptions about the others. From our work illusions. From our social class ideology. From our concept of Nature. \u00a0From our vision of what are the World. From our own conscience. Born and \u00a0reborn. Reborn. Born. So many big things, so many little things to give birth from within.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Born for the first time, an inevitable act. But to be born as a person - to shed light on what remains dark in us, to excavate hidden senses and understandings, to bring all this issues to the surface, to bring them to the luminous healing of consciousness, to give them birth - how hard it is to emancipate yourself. Despite of this, is there someone who dare to born only once?\r\n  </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>We born, we reborn. We reborn, we born. We give birth at ourselves. But not just us. In us, we give birth to others. And by the others, we also gain birth. We give birth to each other. In the way we eat, wear, talk, group, argue, laugh. We all, together, dare to reborn and born. We share. We inspire.\u00a0We act.\u00a0\u00a0We, politically, act. \u00a0Because to act belongs to our public political sphere.\u00a0 It's our human condition.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong></p>\n<p>Needs a Google Cardboard and a compatible Smartphone.</p>\n<p>Install the apk file.
