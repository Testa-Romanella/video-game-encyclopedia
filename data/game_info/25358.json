Join them as they jump \u201cfists first\u201d \n      into the grim Kowloon district. Play as Hawk or Tony and fight through \n      all five stages in the deadly Kowloon district. Smash down the Dragon \n      Zone goons in areas like the Harbor, Abandoned Warehouse, and the \n      Ghetto. Both characters have unique skills and attacks. Hawk is a master \n      of karate, while Tony is a hard-hitter. That being said, both guys are \n      massive and possess killer techniques.
