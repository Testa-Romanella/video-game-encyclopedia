Strategy is key - a large block cannot go on top of a small block. Take turns stacking until your opponent can no longer move. You win!</p><p>To play, click on one of your blocks and click on an adjacent square. Your block can only move up or down one tier at a time. Towers of blocks must have the largest blocks at the bottom and smallest blocks at the top. You can click and drag to rotate the display.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T03:42:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/146/146ad3eb07fa647416b89a64c283db0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Isaac Thompson"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
