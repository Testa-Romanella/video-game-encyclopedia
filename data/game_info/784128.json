The C++ library was written by our professor and given to us to implement in a new Unity project. Additional functionality was written in both the C++ library and in C# script. The goal was to hook up the DLL in order to use stored functions to help create a Snake game.\u00a0<br/><br/>Snake Game<br/>- Player starts in bottom left, waiting for movement input from the player. Once moving, the player can change the snake's movement direction by using the WASD keys or Arrow keys.\u00a0<br/>- When the snake collects an apple, the snake's body will grow and it's movement speed increases.\u00a0<br/>- When the snake collides with the game border, it will come through the opposite border.\u00a0<br/>- When the snake hits it's max body size of 10, apples will stop spawning.\u00a0 The player wins!<br/>- The player can use Spacebar to reset the game and continue playing,<br/>- If the snake crashes into it's body, it's movement freezes and the game is over!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T09:15:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa2/fa211deee23e95ba44b36dbbd4f0c0c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WilsonWorldGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
