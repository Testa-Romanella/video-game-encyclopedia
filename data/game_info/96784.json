Hopefully those are fixed now.</p><p><strong>Update v1c:</strong> A little cleanup. Removed the example textures that came with dsoft20's shaders, and fixed the credits screen (I previously forgot a couple of names and included a couple of incorrect ones, not to mention there were also some typos).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94f/94f24410f6c4394ee77105a4021dd75a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NatSpectrum"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
