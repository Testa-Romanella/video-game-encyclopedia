Due to the rules, all the materials except the background-image are our original work (music made with GarageBand). According to the topic, we build a straightforward game which helps the player get to know how a spacecraft could accelerate or slow down in order to orbit around a planet. Our levels render a steady progress for those who are not familiar with physics. At the very end, our\u00a0spacecraft\u00a0passes\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0Voyager\u00a01. Hope we could travel to outer solar system some day, and enjoy our simple game :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T08:11:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f9/3f996be77f1c9add47ccc16a0c3a1c49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["BugooStudio"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
