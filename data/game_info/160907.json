With each step you begin to fade away. With each fight a part of you disappears. You are Abberate to this land and it will try to swallow you whole.<br/><br/>Abberate was an art project. All character, object and environment art were created and designed by me. I also did full development for the animations included within the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/036/036be133b829d3ebb123f69edd96cc5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ErikM615"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
