Unity makes things a whole lot more easy.\u00a0</p>\r\nThe Idea Behind Asteroids\r\n<p>Well, I didn't really create the game, so I wouldn't know. And the other features I've added (Coop mode, Versus Mode and dashing) just popped in my mind as ways to make the game more robust.</p>\r\nImplementation\r\n<p>It was relatively easy to implement. I mean, I always have to check again how to deal with Quaternions, but the rest was alright. I had some issues with spawning cooldowns and such (a lot of scripts have Coroutines in it, so sometimes infinite loops happened).</p>\r\nFuture Ideas\r\n<p>Here are some ideas I had if I ever came back to this project:</p>\n<p>1 - Add more Custom Rules.</p>\n<p>2 - Add more ships, projectiles, powerups.</p>\n<p>3 - Add more types of enemies and asteroids.</p>\r\nFeedback\r\n<p>This section is dedicated to feedback.</p>\n<p>(None yet.)</p>\r\nCredits &amp; Links\r\n<p>Programmer, Designer, Integrator, Sound Effects: Me\u00a0https://dans1997.itch.io/\u00a0</p>\n<p>Art: Herocrife</p>\n<p>Main Theme: Kevin Kobori</p>\n<p>Github of the project:\u00a0https://github.com/Dans1997/Asteroids</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T05:30:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bfe/bfef2ee167e9a4c34015663f9e885433.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Danillo Neves"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
