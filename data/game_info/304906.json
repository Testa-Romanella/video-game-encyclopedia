Explore the world of Arch today! <strong>This entire game was created by me, and I hope you all love it!</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>ArchMMO 2 is being upgraded and developed every day, and now, it's on Steam. Steam is <strong>the best</strong> platform for an indie game to gather attention. Thank you for playing ArchMMO 2, and I can't wait to see what's going to happen in the future!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Currently, Weapons are a big thing I want to keep adding to. Every update will include new weapons, up to level 50! This will increase a large amount of gameplay!<br/><br/>GOALS<br/>Quests, quests, quests! A needed addition to all MMO's. I am working extra hard on creating meaningful quests for the Human class in the game. Currently, the human class is the only fully supported class. The Undead will be after at-least 50+ quests are made for the human race. More quests = more enemies, more items, more weapons, and more people.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Magic and Skills are also a hugely important part of the game. I want to have some creative buffs, debuffs, and castings. This is all being implemented in a later update. Quests and items are the priority right now.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:11:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/142/14240097798fe708e7a8865512d4613b.jpg", "website": "http://archmmo.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CG Creations"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CG Creations"], "esrb_rating": null}
