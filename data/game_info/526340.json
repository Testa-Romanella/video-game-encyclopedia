Complete with 6 bosses (and there may be more!) and 2 difficulty levels. Challenge powerful enemies and come out on top in this simple, yet hard game!</p>\n\n<p>disclaimer:\u00a0 this game was made in 4 evenings, it may have some instabilities (or things that I missed in development). It's not the longest of games, depending on your skill it might take anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours but your first playthrough will be mostly focused on grinding bosses, so if you are not into that then this game might not be for you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T06:32:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64b/64b8328c038c63f098a2d700584f70bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Icealy"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
