Highly recommended, buy it now...\"<br/>___________________________________________________________<br/><br/>And now\u2026 Lock\u2019n\u2019Roll 2!<br/><br/>Lock\u2019n\u2019Roll 2 is an intriguing puzzle game requiring a combination of luck and skill. Roll four dice at a time and arrange them on a new, larger 5x5 grid.  When you tap ROLL again, the dice on the grid are LOCK\u2019ed in place. <br/><br/>If the dice on the grid make a combination (based on dice numbers and colors), you earn points. Make a high value combination and the dice in the combination are cleared from the grid. Earn enough points and you are rewarded with a joker (or a joker bonus if you have a joker and haven\u2019t used it).<br/><br/>Strategy, strategy, strategy:  The more you play, the more strategy will be revealed. The game keeps going until there are no more spaces available for dice. <br/><br/>How high can you score? That's entirely up to you!<br/><br/>__________________________________________________________<br/><br/>New features in Lock\u2019n\u2019Roll 2:<br/><br/>5x5 grid \u2013 It requires a very different strategy than the 4x4 grid.<br/><br/>Special 5 die combos with bigger bonuses.<br/><br/>Joker Bonuses are now progressive 2k, 4k, 8k, 16k, 32k, 64k.<br/><br/>_______________________________________________________________<br/><br/>Our first update will include an option for \"Show legal move\"<br/>a.k.a white boxes<br/>_______________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;INVISIBLE DICE PROBLEM&lt;<br/><br/> IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING THIS PROBLEM IT CAN BE FIXED BY UPGRADING YOUR iPhone or iPod to OS VERSION 3.1 OR HIGHER._______________________________________________________________<br/>INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEO:<br/><br/>Click on the Lock \u2019n\u2019 Roll 2 Application link below.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:22:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d0/5d051376aaaa44123ade94774a4eb4e0.jpg", "website": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfmZo_RiIdc", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Canned Bananas"], "genres": ["Card"], "publishers": ["Canned Bananas"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
