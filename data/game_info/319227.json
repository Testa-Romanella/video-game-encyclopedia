A free-to-roam, what-if art project made by Ahlman Institute Game Technology and Visual Game Design students , that is set in a time when humanity is scarce. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game tells a story about a world where humans are a dying breed as they have lost a war to machines roughly two decades ago. Hence the humans are hated by most, persecuted and seen as living blights. The player is to assume the role of Alice, a woman in her twenties, who has been living her life as a fugitive slum-rat. Alice has to deal with racism and fight for her survival and ultimately for the whole human race.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:45:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9d/c9d3e8eb9aff4ca91b85ba6b0ddab8fc.jpg", "website": "https://ahlmangames.com/peliprojektit", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team League"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ahlman Game Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
