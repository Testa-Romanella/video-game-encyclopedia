It is a thresher with many aspects. We plan to gradually add many things to the game. Fight to the death. Only one team will win.<br/>\r\nSwords, axes, and other weapons of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game brings a lot of fun from the medieval times when fighting with swords, crossbows, catapults and magic. Everyone can find their own style of play in the game. The game offers many game modes and most importantly you can challenge your friends to a fight. Dive together into the times when a well-sharpened sword had its last word.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFrom small to large maps. A battle that lasts at least 15 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n The basis is to fight for Team A or B. This team must collect a large score in a certain time to defeat and conquer the opponents.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMultiplayer is being worked on. So the game will also be for multiple players.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlease follow the description of the updates to see what has been fixed, added and what is not functional or has bugs. This is an early access game. Thank you<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can also send your ideas and comments to: email or write to me on my Steam Profile.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T04:07:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b0/8b02ccf08960a4237cc334abcde99ddf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 461, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FussyCraft"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["FussyCraft"], "esrb_rating": null}
