{"id": 306069, "slug": "drunken-fist", "name": "Drunken Fist", "name_original": "Drunken Fist", "description": "Drunken fist! - This is funny game about fighting, in a drunken style. Busty knockouts, drunken physics, and secret tricks. Lawlessness, live camera and more fun!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou play as a drunk man who needs to get home. Along the way, you fight with various enemies - hooligans, cops, punks, etc. All enemies have their own tricks.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPhysics and control absolutely accurately convey the feeling of a drunken brawl - the blows fly past, you constantly fall and behave ridiculously. There are many punches and tricks available. You can even urinate so your opponent slips!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe camera in the game simulates live shooting, so it looks like a video about fighting drunks on YouTube.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T04:14:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/726/726b81c6df8ec6972a2804326d11d2bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 9, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 65, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["Dudarev Alexandr Vladimirovich"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Fighting", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Deklazon"], "esrb_rating": null}
