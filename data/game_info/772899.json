This also applies to this game. <br/>Information is radio signals propagating at the speed of light. These radio signals transmit your commands and the events you receive. <br/>Spaceships move at a fraction of the speed of light. So it takes years for a command or a spaceship to reach its destination. When a battle takes place, you won't know about it until years later.<br/><br/>Apart from this, it is a classic 4X game. <br/>In the beginning you rule a single star system and you are exploring and colonizing the surrounding systems. <br/>Later on you will meet your opponents and you will have to defend and conquer colonies.<br/><br/>To win the game, you must conquer 2/3 of all stars.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T10:11:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2f/c2fcc446b73ef14714adf5e77b203a2a_LiGT5oI.jpg", "website": "https://sublight-empire.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Enrico Unger"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Enrico Unger"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
