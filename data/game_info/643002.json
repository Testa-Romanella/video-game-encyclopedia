The technical theme was \"remix\" and the creative theme was \"unreliable narrator\". The foundational inspiration came from a favorite childhood book. A playthrough can be completed in roughly 10-15 minutes.\u00a0I hope you enjoy!<br/></p>\n<p>Content Warning:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Occasional Swearing</li></ul>\n<p>Player Input:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Keyboard input only</li></ul>\n<p>Credits:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Created solo by:\u00a0 \u00a0Pete Vellucci Jr\r\n</li><li>All audio comes from\u00a0freepd.com\u00a0and\u00a0freesound.org\u00a0and is used freely under a Creative Commons 0 license.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Technical Note:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>This was my first time programming a non-downloadable, web-based game; and I discovered there can be issues with audio passthrough wherein Chrome (and potentially other browsers) will allow the game to begin but not play audio until direct user input has been captured. I learned of this complication late in the jam process and so quickly opted to include an introductory screen with a user prompted\u00a0\"audio test\" before the game can begin. This\u00a0does also afford the player an\u00a0opportunity to ensure their volume is at a comfortable level. I've also noticed that sometimes the embedded game has trouble recognizing initial input -- spacebar is used to start but will sometimes act on the web browser and not the game -- in such instances, refreshing the page and mouse-clicking in the game window may fix the issue.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T09:51:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cda/cda0b6826fb290d5e6b730ba8070e771.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rohifi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
