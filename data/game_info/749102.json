But watch out for the poisoned skulls: if you accidentally eat one, you'll die instantly!</p>\n<p>You can use the arrow keys to move the snake or you can press on the gameboard directly above, below, to the left or to the right of the snake in order to move the slippery serpentine creature in that direction.</p>\n<p>Some foods are rarer than others, and these are worth more points. The elusive cherry is the most valuable item of all. Other factors, such as how long it takes the snake to reach each item of food, are also taken into account when calculating the score.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T06:38:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e68/e685cae9dad2b5bf3a09752a6031a2a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["coastalerosion"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
