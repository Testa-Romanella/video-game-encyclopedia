{"id": 967491, "slug": "le-corps-glitch-multitudes", "name": "Le corps-glitch (multitudes)", "name_original": "Le corps-glitch (multitudes)", "description": "A virtual reality experience that highlights potential bodies to merge, change skin, slowly morphing into a hybrid being that connects with plant, animal and technological species. Somewhere in the environment is a reflective surface, giving a glimpse of this new body that is incarnated for an unfixed duration. Le corps-glitch (multitudes) is a VR experience developed during a creative residency at the Sporobole artist center in Sherbrooke, in 2022.<br/><br/><br/>Marie-\u00c8ve Levasseur is an interdisciplinary artist currently based in Tiohti\u00e0:ke/Montr\u00e9al. Their work is expressed through a variety of media, including video, installation, sculpture, digital printing, 3D animation and virtual and augmented reality. They are interested in the notions of process, hybridization, metamorphosis and the potential for collaboration with the non-human. Their research draws on feminist posthumanism and attempts to define the place of the material and emotional body in our screen-based communications. Their projects are intended to be propositional, drawing on feminist science fiction and often appealing to speculative fabulation by evoking contexts in which fictional devices are deployed.<br/><br/><br/>Levasseur holds an MA and a Meistersch\u00fcler from the Academy of Visual Arts in Leipzig, Germany, and has participated in various residency programs, including Schloss Solitude (2020) in Germany, and at Sporobole and La Chambre Blanche (2022) in Canada. Her installations have been exhibited internationally, including in Berlin, Paris, Zurich, Hong Kong and London.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-09T03:08:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d09/d095bf8370ea34fc59ddcf5faf851cfa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sporobole"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Sporobole"], "esrb_rating": null}
