In Hearts, two players sit one next to each other. The first player needs to hold hands with the second one and try to listen to their heartbeat while pressing a key to slowly heal a virtual heart. At the end of the game and when the virtual heart has been healed, both players need to discuss their feelings. Finally, the players swap roles and they restart the game.</p>\n<p>At the end of each round, It is extremely important to discuss your feelings with the other person in order to understand better yourself and all the people who care and look after you. Appreciate them as they deserve! &lt;3</p>\n<p>Because in the end, what heals a broken heart is not a replacement, but the love which is surrounding us every day!<br/></p>\n<p>More information about it at the Global Game Jam 2020 Hearts' site: https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/hearts-4<br/></p>\r\nRepository\r\n<p>GitHub:\u00a0 https://github.com/AdrianNP57/Hearts</p>\n\r\nSpecial thanks\r\n\n<p>To all the collaborative authors who helped to shape this game with their assets:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>pedrofmra and Walk cycle (inc): https://pedrofmra.itch.io/walkcycle</li><li>FMOfficial and Toothy (font): https://fmofficial.itch.io/toothy</li><li>pngimage.net Dialogue image: https://pngimage.net/globo-de-comic-png/</li><li>Crysknife007 and the heart beat: https://cheesynirvosa.bandcamp.com/track/slow-heartbeat-sound-sleep-and-... - License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/</li><li>Breaking Copyright \u2014 Music for youtube videos and their Ambient Music (No Copyright) \u26fa: https://youtu.be/er--pnwFDgU</li></ul>\r\nLicense\r\n<p>As any other Global Game Jam, this game is under the Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 version of the Creative Commons License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-03T04:38:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ade/ade1ee31a5a2d72a40338342cd98b729.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adri\u00e1n Navarro P\u00e9rez"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
