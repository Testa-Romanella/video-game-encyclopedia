Bent on revenge, they unleash nuclear weapons powerful enough to destroy human civilization... and nearly succeed. The only survivors of the Cylon assault are a ragtag fleet of civilian ships and the last remaining Colonial Battlestar: Galactica.<br/><br/>As Commander of Galactica, you must lead the civilian fleet through uncharted space in search of a new home, while defending it from relentless Cylon attacks. These machines never sleep; letting your guard down for even a moment will cause not only your downfall, but also that of the entire human race.<br/> <br/>In Battlestar Galactica: Squadrons\u2122, you will:<br/><br/>- BATTLE waves of Cylons intent on your destruction.<br/>- CONSTRUCT a wide variety of Colonial combat ships from blueprints found on Galactica.<br/>- TRANSFORM your ships into high-performance fighting machines with scavenged technology.<br/>- ESCAPE an overwhelming Cylon onslaught by executing a faster-than-light JUMP!<br/>- DEFEND the civilian population that depends on you for protection.<br/>- And above all, SURVIVE long enough to continue the search for planet Earth, humanity's new home.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Battlestar Galactica: Squadrons\u2122, collects non-personal user data (including aggregated data) and connects with 3rd party social media applications. <br/><br/>Please note, Battlestar Galactica: Squadrons\u2122 is completely free to play but offers some game items for purchase with real money.
