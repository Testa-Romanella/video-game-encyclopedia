It's difficult to imagine something more absurd and crazy, but we will try. So, let's get started! Have you already forgotten about Pakhom? We will recall, and refresh in memory with a dozen other good memes in the period from the beginning of the 00's to the present day. Only in our gaming universe you can meet several celebrities from different eras and genres: Navalny, Trump or even Shurygina! Such selection of actors won't exactly bore you, like your arsenal to fight them: a stick with nails, a nail with nails, a slingshot, a dildo, a shotgun.<br/>Pretty familiarization! Ready for action? Then immerse yourself in exciting adventure on the homeless shelter, store number 5 with evil guards, the pyramid of reptilians, the guardhouse with brothers, the legendary cabinet with the watchmen, the sewers with bad guy and the space rocket with robots-cocks. Non-stop shooting, violence, blood and trivial humor (all as you like) are waiting for you for the next turn, you just have to start the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa9/fa993098de176389eeb60845f7b8f421.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 295, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dagestan Technology"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dagestan Technology"], "esrb_rating": null}
