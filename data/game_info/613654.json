The maniacal Major Strauss plans to open the gates of Hell itself. The Mad Devils are deployed to thwart this unhinged plan, but sometimes, heroism isn\u2019t enough. Defeated and damned, the Mad Devils regroup in the underworld for one final mission.</p>\r\nSIX DEMONIC GI's, SIX SETS OF POWERS, SIX PATHS TO VICTORY\r\n<p>Cast into the abyss, the revenant Sergeant Jack Asher explores hell to reassemble his fallen squad. Each team member has been warped here, twisted and gifted demonic powers. Your expert crew are now armed with elemental and ethereal magics. Master them all and finish your fight.</p>\r\nFIGHT FIRE WITH HELLFIRE\r\n<p>It\u2019ll take more than guns to smash the Nazi\u2019s demonic ambitions. You\u2019ll need the most chthonic weapons you can get your hands on and enough magic to light up the stygian void. Collect demonic crystals to empower weapons, develop your powers, and earn experience through violence.</p>\r\nHELL ITSELF: MORE THAN FIRE AND BRIMSTONE\r\n<p>The netherworld is a strange and varied place. Large parts are a perpetually-burning wasteland, others are twisted reflections of the mortal world, dense with choking overgrowth, frozen by sombre winds or fortified by damned Nazi legions.</p>\r\nNAZIS: WORTH KILLING TWICE JUST TO MAKE SURE\r\n<p>Hell was bad enough before WWII. Now it\u2019s a warzone, populated with undead, ravenous demons and a legion of internal Nazis.
