Now he's started to sneeze bubbles... but wait, maybe he can use the bubbles in order to escape the wretched pollution and find a new home &lt;3<br/><br/>A short yet challenging little puzzle-platformer that seems like a platformer but plays a bit more like a puzzler. Time\u00a0 your bubbles correctly and figure out how to get past all the obstacles in the way of your victory.<br/><br/>From the playtesters and the jurors judging the game projects, apparently this game is quite difficult to complete without a couple of play throughs but we did have like two people that could clear it so I have utmost fate in you guys! Arcade games are supposed to be a bit difficult! ^^/<br/><br/>This game was made by five students at game development school Futuregames in Sweden, as part of a two-week game project which started just two months into their education.
