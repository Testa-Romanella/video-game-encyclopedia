After joining forces with two friendly alien mercenaries, Ammut and Tatenen, Bik escapes from his abductors and tries to find his way home. Along the way, Bik and his newfound friends outsmart hijackers, (eat some brownies), accept a perilous mission to find a missing alien, (make some sandwiches), foil a dastardly plot by an evil corporate empire, (argue with disgruntled robots), and save a planet on the brink of destruction.Things to Do In Bik<ul><li>Point and click (or touch) your way through deeply atmospheric environments.<br/></li><li>Become absorbed in the world through an enthralling original soundtrack.<br/></li><li>Control multiple characters and see the story from different perspectives.<br/></li><li>Enjoy story-driven, thoughtfully crafted puzzles.<br/></li><li>Get abducted by aliens!<br/></li><li>Fire a laser gun!<br/></li><li>Befriend alien races and join them on adventures in space!<br/></li><li>Join a mercenary crew aboard a space freighter!<br/></li><li>And much more!</li></ul><br/><br/><strong>More Reviews:</strong><br/><br/>\u201cThe dialogue is just superb in Bik, which always helps you invest in characters, and the standard is up there with Lucasarts or Sierra\u2019s early efforts. This is not something I say lightly, having been initiated into the genre through Day of the Tentacle.\u201d<br/><strong>-4.5/5 Super Game Droid</strong> http://www.supergamedroid.com/2014/08/15/bik-a-space-adventure-review/<br/><br/>\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to make a game that looks retro, but it\u2019s another to make a game that\u2019s good and just happens to follow a classic aesthetic. Lucky for me, Bik is just such a game.\u201d<br/><strong>-4/5 RPGFan</strong> http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/Bik/index.html<br/><br/>\u201cI opened up my inventory, clicked on a bottle of booze, and then clicked on a dog in the scene. \u2018Clearly Bik is in good hands for this adventure.\u2019 was the message displayed.
