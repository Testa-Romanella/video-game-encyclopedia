My family is of the tradition that the Biographs should be as consistent and factually accurate at possible. I am the primary matchmaker along side one of my mothers. My other mother's eye sight has gotten too poor and my sister rejects the practice. She feels it is cruel and pushes out wild-type stories from the eccosystem. I agree with my sister but I also know my connection to the beetles to be real. By suggesting them mates that might make their children's patterns tell new tales that living in the world around us we are participating in nature and in a partnership as old as us.\u00a0<br/>My name is Ethel Rauser. I was born in forests. My favorite color is Teal. I hope this beetle finds you well.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-26T05:11:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29d/29d1ee42e4d45273ff0f882d4bcf2752.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Maxx Y"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
