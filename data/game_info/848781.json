Play the MS-DOS version in DOSBOX, or use the version I've pre-bundled with dosbox for your convenience.<br/></p>\n<p>It's your first day at your new job as a DISKSWEEPER - repairing damaged disks through everyone's favourite deductive puzzle game. Clear the disks for three customers and enjoy the visual-novel style interface.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls are explained ingame, but as a reference for the DISKSWEEPING minigame:</p>\n<p>Left/Right: spin disk. (A and D also work if you prefer)<br/></p>\n<p>Left mouse: reveal a disk sector. If it's a mine you lose. If there are any mines adjacent to the cell you click, a number will appear - that's how many mines are in the neighbouring sectors! Use this to figure out where the mines must be. Or guess!<br/></p>\n<p>Right mouse:  designate a suspected mine sector.</p>\n<p>To quit: press the ingame QUIT button, then press ESCAPE from the titlescreen.</p><p>Update (08-Sep-22): Sweeper minigame was only rotatable with A/D, fixed left/right cursor keys to also rotate as per ingame instructions</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-10T00:17:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45a/45a85243b637bdfde79acd7e66ffe4d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["voxel"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
