Only one will appear at a time.\u00a0Follow the arrow to know where to go. Once you have succeeded you will then control a new taxi doing a new route. However all past taxi you controlled will be driving the routes you chose. There should be about 12 levels (i.e you need to get all 12 taxis to their destinations without crashing). Crashing into a previous taxi or a wall will cause you to lose a life. Lose 3 lives and you're done.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately we had a 6-7 hour blackout during this jam, but we are happy with what we made! If you notice anything broken (And we know theres a lot!) then lets us know and we can release further builds if you'd like.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing our Game.</p>\n<p>Made by Ronan Constantine and Aimee Handley (@AimzJ)</p><p><strong>Known Errors:</strong></p><ul><li>Scoring not working as expected</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T07:28:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d16/d162e28522338a1abfc4c937f114db6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ronan Constantine", "Aimzj"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
