You are free to govern the city as you like, which is pretty simple here. You just need to click a button to roll the dice and that's it. Other than this, you can also build new buildings, upgrade existing ones, or issue new policies that could affect the whole city. But most important thing,  you need to keep your job as the mayor.<br/>If for some reason you got removed from the position, don't worry! Don't be afraid to start from scratch. We will keep your bonus for your successors. Buy new stuff from the store to make ruling easier in the future, and start a new term!<br/>Good luck~<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-03T03:23:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84e/84ea6ddcdc343674e8d705c972e9f46c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ShanShi"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ShanShi"], "esrb_rating": null}
