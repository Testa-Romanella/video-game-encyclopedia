I\u00a0chose to \"revamp\" Adventure 2600, something that was relatively simple because this was also my first Unity + VR project and I didn't want to overwhelm myself. Even though I\u00a0say simple, because of my lack of knowledge, I wasn't even able to implement the dragon enemies /sad sigh</p>\n<p>Anyhow I learned a lot and this was a good start for dipping my toes into vr before doing a more ambitious game project.</p>\n<p>Made for Quest 2 in mind.
