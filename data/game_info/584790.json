It features around a dozen small levels where you bounce around, break the environment,\u00a0and try to get to the goal.</p>\n<p>NOTES: resizing window will probably distort the pixel art a little. I don't recommend it if you want the game to look as nice as possible. For the web version, the sound effects are delayed. This is a problem with Godot's web exports. Download the game for not-delayed sfx.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T05:55:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b4/9b48089d746c7d51f73556eaefc5eb7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Clamshell64"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
