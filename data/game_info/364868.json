Since the king has fallen under a dark curse, his great Paladins have retreated from the lands where they once kept order to seek a cure. With the guardians away trouble is slowly finding its way back into the realm and you're not the only new adventurer trying to stop it.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nExplore a large, densely populated open world alone or with up to 3 friends in a splitscreen local coop experience.  Swords 'n Magic is built around a simple, easy to manage inventory system that lets you equip and use any weapon or item you come across in order to mix and match your loadout in conjunction with magical buffs to completely change the way you play. Feel like lugging around a heavy shield today so your spellcasting friends can be safe while nuking down your enemies? Maybe you'd rather sneak into the battle with an invisibility spell and a dagger at your side. Or maybe you'd like to have both at your disposal, just in case.  Collect hundreds of items and play any way you like to fill a role or just min/max your loadout until nothing can stand in your way.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe world of Swords 'n Magic is casual and fun. Being friendly to younger or inexperienced audiences, anyone can pick up a controller and join in on the fun no matter how long each player has been playing.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c9/9c9974055f97cc1dd102e31fc8318c6a.jpg", "website": "http://www.swordsnmagicgame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 85, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kindred Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Kindred Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
