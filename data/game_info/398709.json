With the holidays soon upon you, the other adventurers are off relaxing. It has left the dungeons open for the looting.</p>\n<p>But something strange is afoot with outside getting colder, the local beggars have moved in to keep warm.</p>\n<p>I am sure a few coins here and there will help them in this season of giving.</p>\n\n<p>Story intro done... A dungeon explorer game, with emphasize on helping those around you. You kill enemies get gold, either spend, gamble or give the gold to beggars to accumulate karma points. I wanted a system where you could spend karma to get upgrades, but time was short and the base of the mechanics are in.</p>\n<p>I had hoped to make this entire game with only assets I made, but I am terrible at fires in unity, well in game development as a whole. So everything is made by me except the fire which I got off for free off the unity asset store.</p>\n<p>I apologize for my terrible voice acting within the game. But I do hope you enjoy what I have made here. Might need to improve on this concept at some point in the future.</p>\n<p>The modifiers I was going for were the High roller modifier which is the gambler/dungeon master hidden in a room who you can play dice with, only a simple variation of dice again time. Also the Foleyship modifier, all sound effects were made by me and various objects on my desk.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-16T02:58:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/476/47620e73c576aa76439703ae5e3cfc67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fortstudios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
