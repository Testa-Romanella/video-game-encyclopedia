You will control a guardian robot eliminating viruses invading the server. However, the robot's combat system has been infected by viruses. As a result, all the available actions are locked in a dead loop.</p>\n<p>In other words, during the combat, you cannot execute whatever commands you like. Instead, all the available commands must be executed in a fixed sequence, over and over again. Use <strong>Mouse </strong>to aim. Use <strong>Left Click</strong> and <strong>Right Click</strong> to execute the first and the second available commands.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credit</strong></p>\n<p>Engine</p>\n<p>- Godot 3.2.3</p>\n<p>Visual</p>\n<p>- Blender 2.90<br/>- Clip Studio Paint<br/>- JSplacement</p>\n<p>Audio</p>\n<p>- Cakewalk<br/>- SFXR<br/>- Synth1<br/>- XenFont</p>\n<p>Font</p>\n<p>- VT323</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T03:25:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ec/2ecb5b2be147ffc1a9b09d81b5c8a005.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Chaosinism"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
