The largest hurdle I ran into was making extra links of the hydra to spawn properly, and even now they are quite buggy and most of my code would need to be rewritten to get them to work properly, which would require a bit more time from me than the jam provided. So I retooled the game to be a simple high score based thing, where you cut the hydra heads to get as high as you can, all the while its aggressive little noggin's shoot projectiles at you. Overall, I learned a lot from this jam, and will probably do more in the future (after I get my brain to rest a while.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T16:05:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae2/ae2815a65f795a71d4147d3f714ed179.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ShipwreckDan"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
