The objective is to guide all characters to the end of the left side of the battleground. Avoid the soldiers! Once you finish your placement, left-click on the tile where you want to move your character. Your characters have a special ability that can be activated by right-clicking and can only be used once per battle. Note that no characters can be placed on rows with obstacles. Some soldiers move, while others stand still. If you shoot a stationary soldier, their surrounding defenses will fall. Use this to your advantage to finish the battle, but most importantly, coordinate your characters to solve the challenges.\r\n</p>\n<p>Press spacebar to skip text in cutscenes.</p>\n<p>Attacks:\r\n</p>\n<p>Girl: Throws a stone downwards in a vertical line.<br/>Hunter: Shoots a blowdart straight.<br/>Warrior: Shoots an arrow straight and can hit multiple soldiers.<br/>Diablo Huma: Uses magic in a diagonal line.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T05:56:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34b/34bf810dceafcc31635fd3d07b08304f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["joegas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
