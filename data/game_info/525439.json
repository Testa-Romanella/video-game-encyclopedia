This game is heavily inspired by both phantasmagoria Touhou games, but the catch is that we are using a neural network for our AI with genetic algorithm unlike conventional means.</p>\n<p>The player plays as the shrine maiden Megu or witch Kiara against another player or an AI, hereafter referred as \u201crival\u201d, with the objective of shooting down enemies while dodging bullets, the player gets points as they defeat enemies which they can exchange to use their ultimate ability to make the game harder for their rival by spawning bullets and other enemies on their screen.</p>\n<p>There are 6 general objectives of the game:</p>\n<ol><li>Shoot down enemies on your screen to prevent them from attacking you and gain points.</li><li>Dodge the bullets flying towards you.</li><li>Undermine your rival by using your ultimate ability which will clear your screen and get more bullets on your rival\u2019s screen.</li><li>Graze the bullets to get extra points.</li><li>Get to a higher altitude when your enemy loses a life. Enemies will get harder, but you will get closer to the goal</li><li>Reach the stratosphere to escape the virus and claim victory.</li></ol>\n\n<p><strong>Mechanics:</strong></p>\n<p>Own Play Area</p>\n<p>The player\u2019s area will be a basic rectangle that is higher than it is wide and will be the limit on where the player can go. This area will have enemies that only the player may interact with. These enemies will shoot bullets towards the player, and if the player is hit by one of the bullets, the player will lose a life. The player can shoot at the enemies to destroy them and remove them from the play area. This area would only take up roughly half of the screen on the left side.</p>\n<p>Rival\u2019s Play Area\u00a0</p>\n<p>The rival\u2019s area is the same as the player\u2019s play area, but placed on the right side. This area will have enemies that only the rival could interact with. The general mechanics are the same as the player\u2019s play area.</p>\n<p>Player Character</p>\n<p>Can be controlled by the player. On story mode, the player character will be the one the player chose at the beginning of the mode. On versus mode, the player character will be the one each player chooses for themselves before starting versus.</p>\n<p>Enemies</p>\n<p>There will be multiple types of enemies in the game, each with special bullets and patterns. As a player progresses to a higher altitude the difficulty of the enemies will get harder by shooting more bullets, having faster bullets and shooting cycles, having more intricate patterns, and having more health.</p>\n<p>Rival</p>\n<p>Characters that will act as player two for the story mode, each level will have their own rival with their own special ability and backstory. There will be three rivals. For stage one, the rival will be the other main character that the player did not choose, between Megu and Kiara. For stage two it will be a character named Noa. And for stage three it will be a character named Angers. Rivals will be further explained in the story section.</p>\n<p>Points and Ultimate Abilities</p>\n<p>Every time the player or their rival kills an enemy, they will gain points. Both can spend this point to activate their ultimate ability. Using an ultimate ability may spawn bullets and/or enemies on the other player\u2019s play area that can make it easier for them to lose a life. The player and their rival may utilize this to undermine each other. Both will get extra points when their hitbox is very close to one or more bullets, they may use this to gain an advantage over each other.</p>\n<p>Altitudes and Stratosphere</p>\n<p>Once a player loses one life, their rival will advance to the next altitude. The main objective of the game is to get to the stratosphere, which is located at the max altitude 1000, and escape the virus. A higher altitude will have harder enemies than lower altitudes.</p>\n<p>Winning and Losing</p>\n<p>Once a player gets to the highest altitude (stratosphere), they will win the game and their rival will lose the game. However if the rival gets to the highest altitude first before the player, then the player will lose the game and their rival will win the game.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Characters:</strong></p>\n<ol><li>Megu (\u5922\u7a7a)<br/>Megu is a shrine maiden that lives in her family shrine. Due to the effects of the virus, little to no people pay a visit to her shrine. Having heard about the new breakthrough in floating island technology, she set out to make one in order to restore her family shrine back to its former glory a hundred years ago.<br/><br/>She is a straightforward and zealous character. Having been born in such a grim period, she has adopted a somewhat realistic point of view that the world has turned into a lawless land. As such she sets out a goal to put everyone back on the right path through faith and other means, even if it involves other unlawful behaviors. She has the ability to channel gods and uses this ability and her trusted ceremonial stick to fight others.\r\n</li><li>Kiara (\u8f1d\u5929\u7a7a)<br/>Kiara is a self proclaimed witch, living at a self established magic shop near Megu\u2019s shrine. Kiara\u2019s shop offers mundane magical services that her family has developed following the pandemic, but doesn\u2019t get enough customers because most of it are things that people can do themselves. When she hears that Megu is planning to build a floating island, she steals the idea and prepares to make one herself.<br/><br/>Kiara is a laid-back happy-go-lucky character. She has a rather positive outlook that one day, all of this will come to pass as another page in the history book. Though she would rather practice her magic, she has come to realize that she may get more freedom to develop spells on the sky to her own benefit. Her family has developed magical powers from harsh conditions in the past, she uses this and her trusted magical wand to fight others.\r\n</li><li>Noa (\u97f3\u5929)<br/>A deranged genius that has lost their mind due to the effects of the virus. Noa was once a scientist that worked to develop the current technology of the floating islands. But an accident happened that took a lot from her and she gave in to the virus. However, the virus didn\u2019t kill her, but instead twisted her mind so that she works to stop any human from leaving the ground.\u00a0</li><li>Angers (\u5929\u4f7f)<br/> An ascended human that is part of the group that has left the earth a hundred years ago. Angers is one of the many humans that has developed new power and abilities from living so long in the sky. Fearing that the introduction of new humans into the sky may lead into an uncontrollable number of people having powers and may bring the virus to their home, she sets out to stop humans from building floating islands.\r\n</li></ol>\n\n<p>This game is submitted in developed as part of the group project for\u00a0CSCE604121 - University of Indonesia's Game Development Course 2020/2021.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Player 1 can move around on the screen using W A S D</li><li>Player 2 can move around on the screen using arrow keys</li><li>Player 1 can shoot using J</li><li>Player 2 can shoot using num 2</li><li>Player 1 can use their ability using K</li><li>Player 2 can use their ability using num 3</li><li>Player 1 can focus (slow down movement) using shift</li><li>Player 2 can focus (slow down movement) using right control</li><li>You may navigate the menu and dialogues using left mouse button</li><li>You may pause using escape key</li></ul>\n\n<p>You can access the\u00a0<strong>source code</strong>\u00a0of this game by clicking\u00a0here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T05:35:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e2/4e208fb9e6164b1655c752dadfb894c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eagles"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
