You pick up speed faster on slopes while a ball.\r\n </p>\n<p>Mach Speed- If you go fast enough you can smash certain blocks.\r\n </p>\n<p>Mach Turn- If you press the trick button and the opposite direction  to your movement, while at mach speed, you will enter a slide that  redirects your speed in a different direction.\r\n </p>\n<p>Drill Dive (Debs &amp; Nacht only)- Press Down and Trick while airborne. You will  dive directly downward at high speed. If you are on a slope this can be  redirected into horizontal speed. <br/></p>\n<p>Mach Climb (Metal &amp; Nacht only)- If you hit a\u00a0 vertical wall while airborne and at mach speed, you will run straight up the wall.<br/><br/>Homing Attack (Nacht only)- If you are in the air and close enough to an enemy (in this version there's only balloons) press the trick button to be launched directly at them at high speed.<br/></p>\n<p>PLAYABLE CHARACTERS:</p>\n<p>Harvey N. Debs - A young \"direct-action\" environmentalist Armadillo with attitude.<br/></p>\n<p>OT-HAAArV \"Metal\" - This robotic rival was definitely not built specifically by the villain to stop Harvey. \u00a0 Metal is fast and accelerates linearly, but can be a bit slippery. The in-game description says that he has a boost, but this is a lie. I disabled it because Metal is already fast enough.<br/></p>\n<p>EK-n Naomi \"Nacht\" - Nacht is bigger* and slower than Harvey, but has a speed-boosting homing attack. He also has a higher jump. Nacht is also trans-masc btw.<br/></p>\n\n<p>LEVEL PARS: (comment if you can beat these times)</p>\n<p>Tutorial - 50 seconds<br/></p>\n<p>Iguanopolis - 40 seconds<br/></p>\n<p>Sunset Showroom - 30 seconds<br/></p>\n<p>Notes</p>\n<p>- * Nacht's collider is not actually bigger than Harvey's. I will implement this at some point.</p>\n<p>- Nacht's homing attack can be spammed, but I'll also fix that later.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T17:02:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aaa/aaa0890146e906ba5ab958287d0acbeb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Woodhouse3D"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
