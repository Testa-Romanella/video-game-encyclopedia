This tour was a winner.<br/><br/>I travel alone, with the pleasant night breeze blowing against me. I\u2019ve met some friendly passengers, a cute conductor\u2026 and a girl with cat ears?<br/><br/>What will this journey leave within her? And what will it bestow unto me?<br/><br/><br/>\u2026Let us have<br/>a fun journey together.<br/><br/>Noir (the correct would be Noire though\u2026)<br/>CV. Ohno Yuuko<br/><br/>The protagonist meets her by chance on the train, the Milky Way. Though she has cat ears and a tail growing from her, she doesn\u2019t seem to pay them any heed. She has no memories and is always in a daze. Although it\u2019s unclear who Noire is, she has a soft spot for Akatsuki.<br/><br/>I\u2019m the conductor of this train, and will be the guide for this tour.<br/>My name is Karuha Ramuneko, but you can call me Karuha-chan.<br/><br/>Karuha<br/>CV. Hoshitani Mio<br/><br/>She introduces herself as the guide of the Stellar Railway, the Milky Way. Though she calls herself a conductor, she has no knowledge on trains and quickly panics when something goes wrong. Karuha is the type who can\u2019t do anything unless the protagonist gives her a little push on the back.<br/><br/>Uu... But the kitty was afraid.<br/><br/>Neri<br/>CV. Serizawa Yuu<br/><br/>A mysterious girl, but Akatsuki feels like he\u2019s met her before\u2026<br/><br/><br/>I\u2019ll go smoke in another car then.<br/>Could you say sorry to her for me?<br/><br/>Hanae<br/>CV. Kohara Riko<br/><br/>A beautiful lady who happens to be sharing the ride. Being a chain smoker, she can\u2019t get very close to Noire who doesn\u2019t like smoke.<br/><br/> <br/>Fuhh, nghhh\u2026 I can\u2019t eat any more\u2026<br/><br/>Gibier<br/>CV. Oomori Nichika<br/><br/>A cheerful girl and fellow passenger, she hails from Sweden. Gibier is of course a nickname \u2013 her real name is Jennifer Manyorder.<br/><br/><br/>Personally, I\u2019m satisfied with just getting to taste this.<br/><br/>Takase<br/>CV. Kawanishi Kengo<br/><br/>Seated at the very back of the train, he always looks up at the stars in the sky. Rather aloof and detached.<br/><br/><br/>Kaneshiro Akatsuki<br/><br/>A fairly dull animator, he dreams to become a director one day and create his own anime but is still quite a ways away. He manages to win a slot on a rail tour that he happened to apply for, and so goes on a strange journey.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong><h3>Gameplay</h3></strong><br/>This is a visual novel.
