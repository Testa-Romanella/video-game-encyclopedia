Biocell combines logic, strategy, and experimentation at a microscopic level. Move your cells and capture spots to take the board and triumph over your opponents. <br/><br/>Win cells by dividing and multiplying; jump from spot to spot to gain territory; close in on your opponents and blow them apart. Just make sure the good guys don\u2019t get caught in friendly fire! <br/><br/>Battles take place in three locations - leaves, mold, and water. Each battleground has its own features: teleporters, bombs, or yeast which threatens to take over the whole board as it grows and grows. <br/><br/>There are six types of cell. Regular cells divide, move, and change the color of other cells. Yeast scatters seeds and takes up random spots. Temporary and permanent blocks make the game more difficult. Bombs blow up everything in their path: the good guys and bad. Teleporters move cells around the board.<br/><br/>You don\u2019t need any expert knowledge, just dive in! Every completed level opens up new challenges. There are even extra levels for the real tactical masterminds out there!<br/><br/>GAME FEATURES<br/><br/>\u2022 82 levels. Objectives constantly change even within a single location so you won\u2019t get bored by the same challenges over and over.<br/>\u2022 Three game modes: transform cells to safe colors, spread more cells than your opponent across the board, or eliminate your opponent entirely.<br/>\u2022 Three unique locations: leaves, mold, and water. New cells and inventories in each location. <br/>\u2022 Objectives and difficulty levels change in each location. <br/>\u2022 6 types of cell: regular cells, temporary and permanent blocks, yeast, teleporters and bombs.<br/>\u2022 No expert knowledge required to play, just basic logic skills!<br/>\u2022 Use your inventory: set up blocks to frustrate your opponent or blow them up with bombs.<br/>\u2022 Stylish graphics with different soundtracks in each location.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:33:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbf/dbf9034d708ba2960532cb559ccf8ad0_wScuJ1p.jpg", "website": "http://biocell.xyz", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Georgii Krasin"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Georgii Krasin"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
