It was a really fun experience and we learned a lot from this! If you ever ever thought about joining a game jam, I say go for it! You'll meet a lot of people and get a lot of new ideas! <br/></p>\n<p>We didn't have enough time to finish and implement all of our idea's but we got a playable game out after these 2 days. <br/></p>\n<p>The music is from this YouTube video!<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game!
