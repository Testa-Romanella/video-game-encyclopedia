If you've already tried the game, please try it again (and of course, if you've voted, please consider changing your votes accordingly now that there is music in the game). Thanks!</em></strong><br/></p><p>Eager is a game I created for LD34 with the themes <em>growing </em>and two button controls. While Eager does not necessarily have two button controls, it's close!</p><p>Eager separates itself from Agar.IO due to the fact that you have to shoot enemies with your mass instead of eating them!  <br/></p><p>Controls:</p><ul><li>Left mouse button - create a projectile that will eat enemies</li><li>Mouse movement - move your bubble!</li></ul><p>Enemies vary in size, and speed. They <em><strong>will </strong></em>damage your player, however projectiles will eat them and gain their mass (provided the projectile is big enough). Coins can, however, be eaten by <strong>both</strong> your player <em><strong>and</strong></em> your projectiles.</p><p>Source: http://github.com/Bobrocket/Eager<br/></p><p>LD page: http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-34/?action=p...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4a/f4a3ab6ccf29443115ec5012d2decc1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Bobrocket"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
