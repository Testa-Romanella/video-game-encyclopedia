The glue that holds this little family together. Unfortunately winter has come and you have no way of weathering it. Instead of hunkering down and riding it out. You must now go out into the woods and find what survival you can. You play as a fox, Mr. Fox. You are a predator and as such you hunt smaller animals and inside your burrow you need to keep your family warm. Hunt for food and gather wood for the fire. Keep an eye on the time of day and weather. The forest is full of opportunity. Your family is counting on you. Good luck.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is my first finished project. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I loved building it. I am working on a update for this \"Short Story\" of a game.
