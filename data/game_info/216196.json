If the basic game is too easy, you can try to beat the game without any radar sensor getting any inkling of your position (0% max radar lock) or simply try to beat your previous scores.</p>\n<p>Made for GMTKJam 2018<br/></p>\n<p>Game Engine is Unity.</p>\n<p>Ship, radar dish, robot character, chirp sound and crosshairs from KenneyNL. \u00a0(License: CC0 1.0 Universal, URL: https://www.kenney.nl/assets/)</p>\n\n<p>\"The Lift\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b86/b869842fa1c8accd1452462ce4564e1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kyace"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
