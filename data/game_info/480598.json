A 3-D first person puzzle/murder mystery /heist game reminiscent stylistically of early 3-D-ish games like The Elder Scrolls: Arena and Doom. A short adventure ensues, with multiple endings (that don't exist yet) where you try to solve the murder, and get out with the money!</p>\n<p>(DISCLAIMER: This project is largely unfinished in terms of content, but it was still quite fun to make! Plus the shadow mode is super creepy.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T06:12:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c5/0c590fc6e2a49ca33df03bc3444be748.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Jeremy Stepp"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
