I tried to create a really unique representation of our assumptions of the Ancient Greek atmosphere by putting my own twist to it. The aim is to eventually create a non-dialogue based narrative/puzzle game in order to ensure the game is accessible across multiple languages.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Right now there's no real major puzzles, just some environmental things that can occur. You can wander around, and it's pretty, but there's still a lot to add. Gotta do some shader stuff, too.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Controls:</strong></em></p>\n<ul><li><em>'R' to reset</em></li></ul>\n<ul><li><em>'Esc' to leave</em></li></ul>\n<ul><li><em>'Shift' to run</em></li></ul>\n<ul><li><em>'W,A,S,D' for the whole walking thing</em></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T16:00:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f0/5f05efcccab025cf7b291e3984b52b6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["T-Dog eXtreme"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
