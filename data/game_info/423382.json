In this <strong>Survival Racing Party Game</strong>, the challenge is to stay in sight on chaotic miniature tracks. You want to be leading the race to be the camera target. Especially because everyone that leaves the camera dies!</p>\n<ul><li>Race with mini RC cars on tracks that your parents never allowed you to set at home;\r\n</li><li>Beat frenetic angry bots to unlock new tracks. Continue the good work and you may be allowed to mess up with other rooms;\r\n</li><li>Damage your car as minimum as possible to increase your score. Remember how careful you were with your toys (errhh\u2026 you were, right?);\r\n</li><li>Team up to get even higher scores playing it multiplayer. Be it your parents, siblings or friends, join forces with them to prove that you have the best teamwork out there! Just be aware: no one should be left behind!\r\n</li><li>Don't care about scores, but love to compete and troll your friends? Race Free For All matches against your mates in a truly sociable way! </li></ul>\n<p><strong>WARNING: DO NOT TRY TO SET ANY OF THIS TRACKS AT HOME! RISK OF FIRE AND SEVERE DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY!</strong></p>\n<p>This game is a tribute from two <strong>Codemasters MicroMachines</strong> fans. Thank you for the inspiration!</p>\n\n<p><strong>#April 1st we will have our first update with the night tracks. The price will be $3 after that. Enjoy the $1 price at launch ;) #</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T04:01:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/695/6951d4494ce718d81f63cf5bd1c7e38f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rumbora"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
