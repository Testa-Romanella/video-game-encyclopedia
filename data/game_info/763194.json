{"id": 763194, "slug": "tilper", "name": "Tilper", "name_original": "Tilper", "description": "#\r\n<p>XXXXX</p>\n\n\n<p>Tilper is a text based 2d platformer, featuring short levels, hidden collectibles, and environmental puzzles. Everything is 100% text - there are no images! Each level can be beaten in quick succession, but you'll be rewarded for slowing down and exploring. Collectibles add to your score, and also change how the game plays! Who knows, maybe you'll go somewhere new?<br/><br/>-------</p>\n\n\n<p>I created the first version of Tilper in 2014, as I was learning how to write code. Strings of text stored the level data, which were displayed on the screen. I designed some puzzles, and added traps, turning it into a small game. When I shared it with family and friends, it became an instant favorite - they even designed their own levels! I felt exhilarated. I became convinced that, if finished, Tilper would be successful.</p>\n<p>Life happened, and I began my working career. Bills had to be paid, game development had to wait. Years began to melt past, forming a growing haze of half-remembered weeks. I suffered repeatedly from depression and burnout.</p>\n<p>In January, 2022, I found Tilper on my hard drive. It had waited years for me to return. The game wasn't as good as I remembered - much worse, actually - but I could still see my original vision.</p>\n<p>To my younger self: I'm making your dream come true.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T21:05:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52b/52b1974395b0e305bc9e80961091b8f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lucid Pixel Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
