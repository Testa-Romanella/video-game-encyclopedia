There are left, right, and rotation cards. The cards will highlight green if they are acceptable to play, and red if they are not.</p>\n<p>You can also choose to sacrifice a card to freeze the piece for a limited time (3 seconds). The card slot that is discarded will be out of play for awhile. It can be helpful to get the freeze time, but hurtful because you will less cards for that time. The longer the game goes, the more penalty time the discard takes to freeze the falling piece.</p>\n<p>Known issues: HTML version- Audio play overlaps when the track speeds up (level 2, 4, 6, 8). It only lasts a couple seconds, but it can be jarring on the audio. If you plan on playing with audio, I recommend the desktop version, doesn't have that issue.</p>\n<p>2 and 3 simultaneous line clears only cause the pieces above the highest cleared line to fall down 1 space- working on a fix, but not in time for the contest version.</p><p>Ludum Dare\u00a0:\u00a0https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/41/$76641</p><p>GM48 :\u00a0https://gm48.net/game/853/cardramino</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c0/1c01de12bdf2d94fdf46b5f484febf9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Doublesquare"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
