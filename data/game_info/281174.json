Fleets are constructed from 10 different ship hulls, which can be equipped with various specialized weapons, sensors, fighters, and other systems.</p>\n<p>The player has intricate control over various ship systems, power management, repairing, etc. But the most important aspect of the game is managing the momentum and positions of the units to gain a situational advantage. The units do not have any maximum speed, and there is no fixed frame of reference.</p>\n<p>Computer opponents and networked mulitplayer are supported.<br/></p>\n<p>Aether is open source.
