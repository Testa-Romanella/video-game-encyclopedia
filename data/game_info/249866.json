The\u00a0 cycle of obtaining money, spending money, and working harder to get more money and then spending more money\u00a0is passed on from generation to generation and has become such an ingrained habit that nobody realizes that they are stuck in the Rat Race both figuratively and literally*. In terms of the theme... kids naturally will model their lives after that of their parents. If the parents\u00a0exhibit poor financial habits, naturally the kids will follow no matter how well-intentioned the parents are.
