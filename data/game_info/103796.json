And there are some bird sounds to enjoy - played on the cornet!</p>\n<p>When I work with sound I often make things that are very harsh and difficult to listen too. When I work with visuals and short bits of text I often end up making things that are more like lullabies. In this case the game is a lullaby and the sound that goes with it is the honking of birds in flight .. a strange type of pixel-goose perhaps?<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/644/6442316070ed12272b597f7b89a9c8de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["noiseart"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
