After choosing among more than 70 unique dogs, you can design your home from a variety of furniture, decoration, and layouts. Then, you can invite or visit your friends to socialize with other puppies at home.  <br/><br/>Instead of describing the main features, we want to share with you the story behind the development of this game. This story came from the creator of My Dog:<br/><br/>\u201cAlthough I have participated in the development of several games, I have not been as excited with a new game as with My Dog because this game brings back a lot of good memories. <br/><br/>When I was little, my parents adopted a puppy that lived with us for longer than fifteen years. I still remember our first interaction; he could fit in my palm. As a child, I became his owner and did my best to take care of him. From an early age, I gained this sense of responsibility because of him but also developed a strong feeling of sympathy towards the dog community. I decided not to have another puppy after him because I knew it would be difficult to experience this absence again in the future. <br/><br/>At university, I kept thinking of ways to bring my puppy back to me by using technology. However, it was not until recently that I formed a dedicated team of engineers and artists to develop My Dog. I hope that players can raise their favorite puppy while bringing him everywhere with them, creating good memories.<br/><br/>If you find this story interesting, want to share your own story, or enjoy playing our game, please send us an email games@boltrend.com. We hope that My Dog help reunites dog owners with his beloved friends and help our puppies find a loving family.
