How is it possible, to make a game by an accident? Well, i wrote the Brick breaker game, but it wasn't so good, because the ball moved in 45 deegre angle, and it wasn't possible to break all bricks. So i changed a bit the code .... and there we go! A new type of game created by an accident But, to make this look and work as it does now, took me about a month.</p>\n<p>Thanks to all who played, or donated this game. It is a big motivation for me, to make new updates, and other games. It is my first game ever made that actually works.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c25/c25935d73d54ba03b1950ecf7e459a6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["whispereq"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
