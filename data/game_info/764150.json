But one day he lost it all in a tragic scrapbooking accident. Billy went blind!</p>\n<p>It is your job to help him on his quest for cheap eye surgery.</p>\n<p>The game is designed for smart phones so I recommend playing it on one (don't forget to turn on the sound). It is however playable on a computer, but the experience is worse.</p>\n<p>Place items in Billy's path, by tapping on the screen (or clicking a mouse), to help him avoid the obstacles.</p>\n<p>The story mode has custom built levels and is the main part of the game. When you finish or give up the story mode, feel free to try the challange mode with procedurally generated levels of increasing difficulty.</p>\n<p>The game is made entirely on a phone using the Phaser 3 game engine. The coding is done in the app Play.js, music and sound effects are made in GarageBand and graphics are made in an app called Assembly.</p>\n<p>Everything (including the level editor used) is made from scratch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Billy Pancakes and his quest for affordable eye surgery was made for the GDFG Monthly Game Jam #14 and took roughly 60 hours to make.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-05T04:15:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5dc/5dc7d829caba1354e77f26489376dc67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bastisbastis"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
