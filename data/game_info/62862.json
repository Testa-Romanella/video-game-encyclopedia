{"id": 62862, "slug": "climb", "name": "Climb", "name_original": "Climb", "description": "In Climb, you take control of a semi aware ball whose sole purpose is to reach the glowing objective at the end of each level. The idea is simple, but the physics present unforeseen challenges. After the learning curve, you'll take on increasingly challenging levels across multiple stages. Each stage is unique in theme and contains multiple levels. Start with the tutorial to learn the controls, and then you\u2019re off! Replay the levels to beat your high score. Take on one challenge after another and try not to get frustrated in the process. The first stage is \u201cThe Basics\u201d. There are ten levels to challenge you and many ways to reach the end. Then comes the next stage, \u201cLight Out\u201d, which will challenge your ability to navigate the environment when light becomes a more valuable resource. As my first ever game I\u2019m not sure how to represent it other than to say that I enjoy it and my friends say it\u2019s great. You might enjoy it or you might not, but I think that\u2019s true for everything. I will say that I had fun making it and think it\u2019s worth your time. I plan to continue updating the game and adding more environments to play through.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T03:49:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/506/506cbeee576b194a385dde79880ec24c.jpg", "website": "https://sites.google.com/view/climbgame/home", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["A Sweet Studio", "Travis Biancardi"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["A Sweet Studio", "Travis Biancardi"], "esrb_rating": null}
