For this release however, I am\u00a0looking for feedback for the 3 different tutorials in the game,\u00a0you will be given a random one at the start.\u00a0\u00a0So, I need your help to test the game out and gather anonymous data\u00a0in Unity Analytics for my final year report.</p>\n<p>The game currently features an endless generation of crafted levels and a boss fight. You play as a spaceship avoiding obstacles and defeating enemies by shooting and using power ups. The aim is to stay alive as long as possible and pick up green score crystals. I would also appreciate it if you filled out the quick 3 question survey that pops up after 4 runs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks and hope you have fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fba/fba9a944cc98c2d0d82344bed8180b92.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["davidkelly"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
