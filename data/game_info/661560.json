Patrons will enter the tavern and order food, and the player must run to the different ingredient and food preparation stations to create the orders. If the player is too slow, the patrons will get rowdy and start a bar fight, so the player has to beat them up quickly to maintain order in the tavern.</p>\n<p>Link to the Controls and Food Menu: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16lh5ysEAn-QRySdODWtEQ9_Jpw1sD0t7Zh0mLj1cock/...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T23:41:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48c/48c107c3e77408cbe5b397e258d64583.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hollowed_Bats"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
