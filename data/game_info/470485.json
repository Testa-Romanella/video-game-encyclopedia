The stability of Adrian's debugging state decreases over time, every time you miss your target and hit a working processing unit or are hit yourself.<br/>When the debugging state becomes too unstable Adrian will wake up. Try to cure as many wild running routines before this happens.</p><p>Use the Arrow Keys, WASD, ZQSD or IJKL to move.</p>\n<p>User your mouse to aim and left click to shoot.<br/>When you shoot, you enter Bullet Time mode.<br/>In this mode the game slows down and your bullet<br/>follows your mouse.</p>\n<p>Enemies spawn around the arena and move towards<br/>your position.<br/>They get faster, when they can see so so try to<br/>use Bullet Time to defeat them while they are<br/>behind walls.</p>\n<p>If you are hit or hit a wall with your bullet Adrian's<br/>stability will decrease, the game ends when it becomes<br/>too unstable.<br/>Defeating Enemies increases the stability.</p>\n<p>Enemies will swarm you, if you stand still.<br/>So be on the move.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-20T03:17:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/372/372fa03e3897d6981a742072ad718c43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Charlie Gray"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
