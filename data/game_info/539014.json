Once both pages fill, you can flip the page.</strong> The orientation may be a bit confusing but refer to the compass given on each stage and in the help section for more info.</p>\n<p>All of the levels are possible, but some require some clever tricks.</p>\n<p>This is my first jam. I\u00a0tried to come up with at least a semi-new concept and create all the assets myself, which may or may not have been the right decision\u00a0(probably not).</p>\n<p>WebGL can be a bit weird with graphics, but hopefully it works.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T07:05:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c0/9c02f751ab0640f127dbfbc8081a077a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PhysBoom"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
