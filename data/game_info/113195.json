{"id": 113195, "slug": "lost-in-the-jungle", "name": "Lost in the Jungle", "name_original": "Lost in the Jungle", "description": "<p><em>Lost in the Jungle</em> is a silly little adventure game for the ZX Spectrum, made with the\u00a0BASin development environment\u00a0and\u00a0inspired by one of my old type-in books (<em>40 de jocuri logice \u00een Basic</em>, by Ion Diamandi and Gheorghe P\u0103un). The gameplay is significantly different, though, and the implementation is all my own.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong> get a move on every time you have the chance, but don't neglect rest, or your health. The game hints at how close you are to safety -- watch for the jungle growing less dense -- and tells you when you're starting to get tired. That happens more easily when you're hurt. Persist, there <em>is</em> an end to the journey.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made specifically for\u00a0the\u00a0ZX Spectrum BASIC Game Jam, though it builds on gameplay concepts I've been pondering for a while now.</p>\n<p>You can play the game online courtesy of the\u00a0JSSpeccy emulator. BASIC source code is included in the snapshot; just end the game when prompted to, and list it. Use as you wish, and enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27e/27ebd4891062177181c2f0d4e4775b2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["No Time To Play"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
