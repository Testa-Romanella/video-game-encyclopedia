A voice guides you through the process, and a message from your (former) self encourages your ambition. But there\u2019s a hitch: the knowledge from your myriad lives is too much to contain in your finite brain, and with every clone generation, it just gets worse. Review the report of your previous life &amp; choose which of your many memories you wish to take with you before embarking on a new one; the memories you pick will help determine the kind of person you become, leading to new adventures, and thus, new memories.</p>\n<p>And then... you do it all again.
