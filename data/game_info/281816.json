Lite: the lite, free version of the iOS \u201cclassic\u201d fast-paced anagrams/word game is now back, remastered &amp; powered by DEFOLD engine<br/><br/>With its two dictionaries (English&amp;Italian), two ways of playing (Letters Only / Letters and Pictures) you\u2019ll be able to have fun for hours while you\u2019ll be checking your brain speed and your word knowledge.<br/><br/>The aim of the game<br/><br/>In Chalk Up! you simply have to write as many words as you can in the given time, using on-screen letters or pictures (that stand for the first letter of the picture main element name). Every word you write will give you points and a bonus in seconds to extend the length of the game. So remember: longer words can be harder to find, but they mean more points and extra time! Be aware that once a letter is used to write a word, it disappears and it will be replaced with a new one. So a bit of strategy is needed because you have to take care even of the letters you don\u2019t use to write a valid word. Too many equal letters (or \u201crare\u201d ones) left, or few vowels can really lower your chances to keep on playing. Anyway, if during the game you cannot find any word to enter, and you\u2019ve got reached enough points, you can ask for a suggestion. A suggested word won\u2019t let you earn points or seconds, but it can be essential if things become too odd, and time too short, to clean up your board.<br/><br/>*Lite version comparison with the full one<br/><br/>- Lite version will let you play just with generic image set and with normal mode (but you'll be able to choose between Letters Only / Letters and Pictures)<br/>- Lite version has GameCenter leaderboard support (but not achievements)<br/>- Lite version shows interstitial banners after each game", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:32:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2bd/2bd66bf6b2ed83d9df47eb77357c8ea7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Marco Giorgini"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Marco Giorgini"], "esrb_rating": null}
