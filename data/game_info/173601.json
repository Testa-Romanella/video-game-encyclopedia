Are you a fan of witty satirical commentary? Do you like it when jokes tickle your little cunt in a way that makes your hypothetical tail wag? Do you not know what the actual fuck I'm talking about? Good! Come right in and download the white van of video games, Pedicabo (Translating litterally to \"Fucktard\" in latin)! This is a free demo of a game in development in some 14-year-old's basement/sex torture chamber (It's alright, my five year olds have given me written consent, and spoiler alert, they aren't five years old) by just some dude on the internet. This game, reminder here, might be hilarious, so if you are either boring, or are from tumblr, do feel free to get the fuck out while you still can before you go and write a blog post about me. Also some things you need to know:</p><p>-There are 36 fairly dank playable characters, with individual sprites coming soon.</p><p>-They are all ordinary MLG Quikscopr just like you, except they get more pussy than you, and they make more money, and oh yeah, some have psychic powers. So I guess they're nothing like you. </p><p>-You think my humor is cheap? I had to sell my soul for these jokes, you know.</p><p>-This game IS still in development. Report bugs and crashes! I enjoy your rating too, and your donations. I'll take anything. Even gold fillings. Give me your drug money too. I need it more than you.</p><p>-Any people who actually exist who appear in this non-fiction work of fiction is completely intentional. You heard me. Fuck. You. Bitches.</p><p>That's all you need to know~! Go ahead and have a field day! Thanks for at least reading this! Seriously... like... play the game. Like. Now. Liek. Wat r u waiting for.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f8/5f8c1e0649ac6a0286983b60f37f4448.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ZewdVaerun"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
