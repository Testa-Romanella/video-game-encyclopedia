Time to get out of here. Wait, what\u2019s that grinding noise?<br/><br/><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong></p>\n<p>Pick up the watch with E to gain the ability to slow time! Use RMB to slow time. This starts the level immediately however, and you need to start moving.</p>\n<p>The starting room and ending room is predetermined, but most of the tiles are generated using an algorithm. The amount of tiles generated depends on the difficulty chosen at the menu.</p>\n<p>Escape before you get killed! Dodge traps and jump gaps. The level generation has been designed to not give you room to stop. Boulders come immediately after any series of pits or walls that could block a previous boulder. Generation is also prevented from placing two peaceful rooms in a row.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Stone Moving Sound: \u201cStone grind\u201d sound from Dissonant Introspections by Katarrhaktes is part of the Xperimental Sound Lab, a free sound collection curated by Thalamus Lab.</li><li>Boulder Collision Sound: \u201cstone dragging on stone\u201d by thanvannispen</li><li>Crush Sound: Snap-a-neck03 by CGEffex</li><li>Menu Sound: Boom Band by bareform</li><li>Firebrand Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\u00a0http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</li><li>Prelude and Action Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\u00a0http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</li></ul>\n<p>Source code found here:\u00a0https://github.com/AshnakAGQ/Escape-Time</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T05:05:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b1/5b15c034bd099288cb3089bb74612a30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Justin Kephart"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
