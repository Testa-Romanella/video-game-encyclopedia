Are you up to the challenge?\r\nControls\r\nMouse - Click to pick a place to charge to.\r\nCredits\r\nEverything made from scratch by me.\r\nThanks to Matt and Evan, my best friends IRL who put up with my near-constant Discord group call.\r\nNotes\r\nAs per the rules of LD, the source code for the game can be found as a download on the itch page.
