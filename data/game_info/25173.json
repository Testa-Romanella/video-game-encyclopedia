Amazingly, the next day, Mario, Luigi, Toad, and the Princess stumble upon a cave, which leads to the world that was in Mario&#39;s dream.</p>\n<p>Subcon, the land of dreams, is under an evil spell thanks to Wart, so Mario and the gang must save the day. New creatures to defeat and plenty of nasty surprises await.</p>\n<p>Choose from the four characters, each differing in speed and jumping ability, and head on through 7 levels each filled with puzzles, bosses, bonus coins, the always helpful mushroom, and invincible star, plus bombs and magic potions. After each level, depending on the coins you collect, you can use them in the bonus game to collect extra lives.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1988-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-05T07:46:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9c/c9ce3a67180418f8ef10d04a48d794e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.94, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 41, "owned": 136, "beaten": 235, "toplay": 38, "dropped": 135, "playing": 10}, "playtime": 10, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 261, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 17, "reviews_count": 262, "platforms": ["Nintendo 3DS", "Wii", "Nintendo Switch", "NES", "SNES", "Wii U"], "developers": ["Nintendo"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
