It was an experiment in making an adventure game in Unity and I had a limited amount of time, so it is very, very short, broken, and utterly lacking any polish, missing both animation and sound. More of a test project than anything, but I am happy to have people take a look.</p><p>The game is set on the Miramichi River of New Brunswick. A very rural area, it is easy to get away from people and find yourself in the deep forests that surround the area.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/347/347ce68e94c9c094e982c5b282dd2579.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["PicoFoundry"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
