Through the use of motion controllers, players can grab and rotate the wheels to go forwards, backwards, or turn, just as they would be able to in reality.</p>\n<p>\"Wake\" takes place in a cabin on an unknown shore, minutes before an asteroid is set to collide with the ocean and spawn tidal waves that will end life as we know it. It is up to the player to decide how to spend their last moments. Through exploring and interacting with objects in the room, players can discover memories that hint at how their avatar came to be in this situation. A radio broadcasts gives glimpses at what is occurring in the wider world.\r\n  </p>\n<p>This project was created as part of a second year university brief at the\u00a0University of South Wales, in association with\u00a0Tiny Rebel Games. The module brief was \"We're Sorry to Inform You That It's The End of The World\". Teams had to make games that were 10 minutes long, took place in one room, and ended with an apocalypse.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Development Team\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Lead Developer/Designer : Oliver Jackson<br/>Lead Artist : Kristyna Duharova<br/>Developer/Designer : Jobie Rofle<br/>Developer/Designer : Reece Cobb<br/>Artist : Soma Wheelhouse<br/>Artist : Michael Horler<br/>Written By : Rebecca Betton<br/>Music By : Elora Smith and Josh Hopkins<br/>Addition Sound Effects By : Jack Morgan<br/>Addition Voice Work By : Steve Johnson<br/>Additional Voice Work By : Tom Bruce</p>\n<p>With special thanks to Susan Cummings &amp;\u00a0Lee Cummings at\u00a0Tiny Rebel Games.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Find out more about the University of South Wales Games' courses at\u00a0http://southwales.ac.uk/games\u00a0and\u00a0http://www.twitter.com/uswgames</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b74/b74fec2b1cb4917f72d2da512a6b0566.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["USW Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
