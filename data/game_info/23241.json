The Reds have infiltrated the city, and you need to stop them before it's too late. <br/>During your stake out you will be observing your neighbours' every move to find out who of them is the communist spy.<br/><br/>From within your apartment you'll be receiving information via your phone and fax machine, finding clues in case files, and taking pictures that you can fax to your handler - proving that your suspicions are right.<br/><br/>It's all about observation and deduction. You\u2019ll have to use a number of different ways to identify people varying from appearances, items that can be found in their rooms, and rules only specific members of the communist ranks follow.<br/><br/>Good luck, agent!
