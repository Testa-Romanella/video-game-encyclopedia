Up until now I've been honing my programming skills by writing various simple clones.  The game was meant to be fairly simple so that I would be able to finish it in a reasonable amount of time.</p>\n<p>Since I started to learn programming, I've been excited to try and create a game that looked, played, and sounded like the first video games that I ever laid eyes on, NES games.  I'm still fascinated by them. I think I was pretty successful in that as I stuck pretty close to the NES technical limitations, using them as a soft restriction rather than obsessing over them. </p>\n<p>I learned a ton while making this game and I hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b2/1b256b111d9a3197d9a1dd86d8a25958.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Archendrus"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
