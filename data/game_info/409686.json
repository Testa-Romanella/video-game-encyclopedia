Set in Aethra, the floating islands in the sky, this game combines the joy and beauty of flight, with the challenge of competition. The player will unlock a wide variety of races, and depth of lore, as this game lays the foundation for future games.</p>\n<p>\"Aethra, the islands in the sky, are at peace, and have\u00a0been for a few years. The enemy\u00a0was defeated and driven below by a group of heroes known as The Voyagers, led by King Eiolin. Since then, the Voyagers have been more focused on defeating beasts, gathering lost animals, and organizing supply and rescue missions than combat. But King Eiolin insists that they not grow complacent. \"The day will come when evil will rise again, and we must be ready to play our part to defeat it, however small that role might be.\" Until that day comes, they continue to serve the King by traveling around bringing beauty where evil besmirched it, order where chaos reigned, and plenty where there was lack.</p>\n<p>And so,\u00a0Commander Vileth, a veteran of The Voyagers, keeps hard at work, maintaining the caliber of The Voyagers by only recruiting those he considers uniquely qualified for the task. As King Eiolin has charged him, he doesn't just look at performance, but at the heart. For he knows well that a hero is more than just a weapon.</p>\n<p>This game takes place during the time of peace. But it will not remain so for much longer.\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T02:24:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f27/f27a45a025e06a01c669d63400d85444.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SoltorchGames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
