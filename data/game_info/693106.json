{"id": 693106, "slug": "prototype-pachinkoball", "name": "Prototype - Pachinkoball", "name_original": "Prototype - Pachinkoball", "description": "<p><strong>Intro</strong></p>\n<p><em>Pachinkoball </em>was a small prototype made during my path of learning Unity and C#. I'm publishing this to show my approach, thought processes, and decision making during development. I try to keep these short and concise, if you have any further questions or feedback, I'd love to hear from you! Reach me on Twitter at\u00a0@PhilipDrobar.</p>\n<p><strong>My goals going into this:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Creating a new prototype from scratch based on the \"counting prototype\" as part of the Unity Programming Simple Functionality mission.</li><li>Writing a simple design doc and then executing on it within a couple of hours using no external assets.</li><li>Time to complete: 4 hours.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Simple Game Design doc for Pachinkoball:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Make a simple pachinko style flipper.</li><li>Several \u201cbumpers\u201d increase the score when hit.</li><li>Two pinball handles that move when space is pressed.</li><li>They can be used to kick balls back up to hit more score bumpers.</li><li><strong>Fail state:</strong>\u00a0when all balls fall through the bottom.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>My approach on...</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Bumpers</strong>: I knew I needed to find the right kind\u00a0of physics-based calculation to make the bumpers work. I had to do quite a bit of research and experimentation to get it to behave as I wanted. Using the inverted normal on the collision point seemed to do the trick, then I just needed to adjust the \"bumpiness\" level.</p>\n<p><strong>Flipper arms:</strong> After trying and failing to come to do it with regular rotation, I\u00a0did some research and discovered the hinge joint component, which was actually pretty intuitive to set up in the end. In order to mirror the left and right arms, I\u00a0had to invert the limits and motor velocity.</p>\n<p><strong>What I would do next to improve this prototype:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Improve the pinball board design, more variation with Bumpers and other obstacles. Maybe even randomize it.</li><li>Improve ball spawn, maybe make it adjustable based on a difficulty level.</li><li>Polish graphics, add sound and particle effects.</li><li>Add a powerup that randomly appears on the pinball board. If a ball hits it, it spawns a bonus ball. Maybe tie it in with the score (every 10 points, a powerup spawns).</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T06:44:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f1/4f1d87e4d7da4bf12a40ce7a9d392e62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Philip Drobar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
