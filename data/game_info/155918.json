Unfortunately, it doesn't feel much like building a network of cities. In fact, I think the best strategy is just to make a big clump of buildings in the center. I\u00a0could probably tweak things to actually force things to evolve in the way I\u00a0want by using different terrain, making roads more effective, making all buildings require food, adding a research tree etc. But I'm not sure whether this model can actually work for making a good building game. Even with massive simplifications, it's still a little complicated, and many of the nuances of networks and city growth are lost because of the simplifications.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d16/d1696a6d870ec175b594b348c4004979.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["my2iu"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
