{"id": 650900, "slug": "barnards-star", "name": "Barnard's Star", "name_original": "Barnard's Star", "description": "In the 25th century, humanity began to travel the stars. Barnard's Star, a mere 6 light-years away and home to the closest habitable exoplanet, was first to be colonized. However, even with the blindingly fast velocity of half the speed of light, the trip takes 12 Earth years. So when the colonists ran into trouble, they were on their own.<br/><br/>The trouble they faced took two main forms. First, their robot companions who served as butlers and guardians staged a rebellion and broke free of their human masters. It got ugly quickly -- blood and bolts covered many a space station floor. The second was the Critters: weird, otherworldly brutes from the other side of the galaxy who arrived on the scene shortly after the colonists from a nearby wormhole. The colonists were able to estalish contact them and even tried to enlist their help against the mechanical threat, but negotiations were cut short when the Critter ambassadors ate all the humans they were supposed to be talking to.<br/><br/>These three factions -- Humans, Robots, and Critters -- are locked in a vicious struggle for control of the galaxy. Now is the time to rise up, lead your faction, and fight for your life. The fate of the universe is in your hands.<h3>Features</h3><ul><li> 3 factions (Humans, Robots, and Critters) with 7 character classes per faction<br/></li><li> Each character has unique attacks and abilities<br/></li><li> 2 maps, each with unique tactical opportunities such as teleporters and destructible cover<br/></li><li> 3 layouts for each map, for a total of 6 different playable fields<br/></li><li> Play offline vs. AI or a friend (or even pit two AI's against each other, if you just want to watch)<br/></li><li> Challenge friends and strangers with online multiplayer</li></ul><br/>For a comprehensive list of all the fighters in the game and their abilities, see the wiki.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T12:16:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afb/afbaf04f1885360092382e3411817432.jpg", "website": "https://pollywog.games/bstar", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Pollywog Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Pollywog Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
