The main idea was to use different elemental powers to get through obstacles. Although it was submitted for IndieCade Festival 2014, it did not make into the finalist list. Well, enjoy!</p><p>NOTE:</p><p>You should play this game in a resolution with a 16:9 or 16:10 aspect ratio. It was designed this way. Although you can just use a keyboard, I recommend you use an Xbox 360 controller for convenience.</p><p>Credits:</p><p>Daniel - Programming, Sound and Game Design</p><p>Kevin MacLeod - Music</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d2/3d2e543aaf9ee8c5c2e62090424ebef8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Daniel Jung"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
