{"id": 934402, "slug": "unsentenced", "name": "unSentenced", "name_original": "unSentenced", "description": "<p>A journey through an enigmatic monologue. Take on the role of a centipede, slinking through a dark and ominous landscape of words from an unsentenced man, in search of full-stops as if its very existence depends on it. But as you grow with each dot you devour, danger lurks between the lines.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Enter a terrifying world where every end is a new beginning.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>To avoid hazardous dots and text, you must use your quick reflexes, while also reading the text and predicting where danger may arise. Will you prevail and devour the dots, or will you succumb to the ominous abyss of words\u00a0that surrounds you?\u00a0<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p>The theme of the Game Jam was \u201cAn end is a new Beginning\u201d. In our approach we brainstormed around the idea of the theme, while eliminating from the beginning the obvious rebirth concepts with different abilities and/or controls. In the matter of video gaming \u201cAn end is a new Beginning\u201d theme, represents mainly Dungeon Crawlers types of games as well as the iconic Baba is You (if the theme is read appropriately). In our approach, we concluded upon the full-stops which define an end in a sentence and the beginning of a new one. As the game evolved during this one-week development journey, we included as mechanics for all three options for punctuating the end of a sentence; a period \u201c.\u201d, an exclamation mark \u201c!\u201d and a question mark \u201c?\u201d . Each punctuation mark devoured by our protagonist, the centipede, acts as a new body - a new life, a dangerous obstacle or something different that we don\u2019t want to spoil it for you yet. Reading the monologue the player has to decide upon eating the punctuations.\u00a0 The UI implements the idea of the theme as continuous Experience, with smooth transitions between the Main Menu, the Game and back.</p>\n\n<p>Minas -\u00a0Game Development<br/></p>\n<p>Yannis -\u00a0Game Design</p>\n<p>Andreas -\u00a0VFX</p>\n<p>Mike -\u00a0Game-breaker | Swiss Army Knife</p>\n<p>Konstantina -\u00a0Sound Design</p>\n<p>Mihalis -\u00a0Gameplay Develepoment</p>\n<p>Anna -\u00a0Gameplay Mechanics</p>\n<p>Yorgos - Best Boy | QA</p>\n<p>Birbilo the cat - Couch heater | Cuddling<br/><br/>From all of us, thanks for stopping by!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n<p>Created for Brackeys 2023.1 Game Jam<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T17:24:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/604/604094c9849418b01d2625d66401b41a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["yinnyann", "Mikenik98", "PiriPirii", "Michalis Oik", "AnnaMhna", "Nasmi"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
