{"id": 822106, "slug": "diles", "name": "Diles", "name_original": "Diles", "description": "<p>Diles is a simple game where you need to match the top of the dice with the tile indicated. You can move by using the WASD or by using the Arrow Keys.</p>\n<p>The game requires you to use your mental abilities and skills to flip and turn the dice around while navigating with  the tiles and match the designated tiles and finally move to the white tile next to it when all the tiles are matched up ( in some cases there is only one tile to match up)</p>\n<p>Made a mistake? We got that covered! Press the backspace or escape key and you can redo each move you made.</p>\n<p>The game was made for the GMTK Game Jam 2022 by a small group for the theme \"Roll Of The Dice\". We hope you have fun playing and don't forget to write comments! Hopefully good ones.\u00a0We would love to get your feedback and hopefully improve constructively from your feedback!</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Programmer and Artist - Skejeton https://github.com/skejeton</p><p>Testing and Support -  Rusheel www.rusheel.tk</p><p>Music and SFX - Chiptami https://soundcloud.com/chiptami/\u00a0https://chiptami.itch.io/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T13:44:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b2/6b296e45b15854b192b4f30252af3dbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["skejeton", "chiptami"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
