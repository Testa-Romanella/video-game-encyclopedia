The Evil Dr. Terrible has used his Terribly Evil Machine to steal your voices and swap your keyboard around! You must find a new way to communicate to\u00a0traverse his castle and get your voices back!</p>\n<p>Player 1 moves left and right with the left and right arrow keys, and can press the up arrow to let Player 2 jump. Player 2 moves left and right with the 'A' and 'D' keys, and can press 'W' to let Player 1 jump. The game is intended to be played in-person and without talking, and instead holding hands with your free hands and squeezing to communicate.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was created based on my experiences with struggling to communicate and connect to people due to sensory processing issues. I feel extraordinarily uncomfortable after any form of physical contact, even with just a simple handshake and even with friends and family, and have always avoided doing so.\u00a0As a result, my friends and family have often felt hurt, as if I\u00a0don't love them enough to hug them or something, but in reality I'm just avoiding making myself uncomfortable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Overcoming this communication barrier was difficult, and I\u00a0still work on it to this day. This game was meant to simulate that barrier I\u00a0have, by making the otherwise ordinary interaction of holding hands\u00a0into something unfamiliar, and forcing you to find a way to break through that barrier and learn to\u00a0communicate and cooperate despite it.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T04:23:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae1/ae1d547c6d3015332e1a40a57aa1b89f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Wizard"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
