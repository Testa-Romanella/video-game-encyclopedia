Nix quest is incomplete, I want to add more gameplay to the game and I want to change almost all textures, because I was using RPG maker default textures. Yet you can consider trying my game for free if you want. I would be happy if you'll do so :)))</p>\n<p>-Tomas Becvar</p><p>If you will need something, contact me\u00a0 here: tomasbecvar@5@gmail.com</p><p>Or discord:\u00a0Arcast#7704</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-15T04:28:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d1/1d1997000acaccf253a6f2d8daa1f461.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["EliteGraphics"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
