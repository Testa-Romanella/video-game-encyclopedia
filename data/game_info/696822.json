Now it's up to Josh to traverse throughout the land to rescue her.</p>\n<p>You take control of Josh in a Ninja Gaiden-inspired style of gameplay where you get to platform your way through the stages, hack and slash enemies, collect power ups, fight bosses, etc. All that is necessary to reach the end in order to rescue Marlene from the evil Shinju.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game consists of 6 stages in total, therefore since it's short, there is no save feature. This is just something I wanted to make as a side project while working on Knight's Quest RPG.\r\n</p>\n<p>Some of you might also find this game\u00a0hard, therefore all I have to say is this game is not for casual players.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Arrow Keys - Move<br/>Shift - Jump<br/>Z - Katana Slash<br/>X - Power Up<br/>P - Pause Game<br/>ESC - Exit Game\r\n</p>\n<p>*WARNING*: If your computer detects the game as a virus, please do the following.
