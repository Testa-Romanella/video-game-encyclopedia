Cheaters Blackjack is a program I created because I LOVE Blackjack. Its a reboot of a PC/Pocket PC app I created years ago. I made the game to play on multiple platforms (so I could enjoy it everywhere!!). All versions compete using the same scoreboards since no platform has an advantage. It can be played on PC (MAC, Linux coming soon), Mobile, Tablets and TV against the top scores of people on the other platforms. I tried to create a GUI that works equally well on all devices and think that CB21 has basically achieved the goal.  <br/><br/>Programmed by BlackOpzFX Labs.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:10:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bf/6bf1a91ae58d6ba665225d779517a69e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 41}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 16, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["BlackOpzFX"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["BlackOpzFX Labs"], "esrb_rating": null}
