But there is a twist: all blocks get moved in unison, and there are many special blocks such as portals, lasers, switches and buttons, colour changers, pushable blocks along the way to test your imagination. For those who are looking for a bigger challenge, there are much harder challenge versions of normal levels that you can only unlock after beating the level with the minimal amount of steps. Features over 150 carefully handcrafted levels, 50 additional challenge and specials, interesting achievements, smooth animations, a relaxing atmosphere, mind-bending and creative puzzles fully utilizing the mechanics of the game, and much more to come!<br/><br/>For more information, Visit our official guide here : https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1465808203", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bc/0bcf15008b411e9064f6600467551e7d.jpg", "website": "https://slashmaper.wixsite.com/website", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SLASH"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SLASH"], "esrb_rating": null}
