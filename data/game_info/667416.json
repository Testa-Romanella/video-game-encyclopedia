Maybe is the file conversion problem, the bouncing ball just not going to the right place as I set, the path it moves is slightly different from the path I can see in the Game view window. As a result, the project cannot be run in the way it should be...\u00a0 I tried many times to fix this but I didn't make it, so I tried changing the export format and it worked. So I will probably submit two formats in Gradescope for grading, WebGl and\u00a0PC, Mac&amp;Linus Standalone. You can check for the proper animation by downloading the file below</p>\n<p>I am really sorry for the inconvenience I created, but professor, please understand my situation, it is so far the only way I can do to make sure the project can work properly. Hope I won't get any point deducted for this...</p>\n<p>Bowen Gong</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T06:40:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b6/8b6f249749d3ce6d3846739c5b699302.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BowenG"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
