We hope Quarantine will earn the same. Our games are made by a team of hardworking people, and it\u2019s encouraging that the Steam community consistently shows respect for this passion and effort.<br/><br/><strong>Do I need to have played Subsurface Circular or other Bithell games to enjoy this one?</strong><br/><br/>No. Quarantine Circular tells its own self contained story.<br/><br/><strong>Plague? Adult? Is this game going to ruin my lunch?</strong><br/><br/>Nope. Quarantine Circular is about on a par with the average network TV science fiction episode in its depiction of mature themes and gore. We like to think of it as \u2018adult\u2019 in the sense that it focuses on themes of humanity and philosophy, not because of any grossness or sexiness.<br/><br/>Of course, there\u2019s nothing sexier than a good sci-fi short ;)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-29T19:17:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3c/c3c28a16cbe8ef3ceb5ed88d518d806e.jpg", "website": "http://www.bithellgames.com", "rating": 4.05, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 10, "owned": 108, "beaten": 18, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 1, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 18, "ratings_count": 22, "suggestions_count": 369, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 22, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Bithell Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bithell Games", "Ant Workshop"], "esrb_rating": null}
