Now you are in charge of transporting a dangerous chemical and locking it in a safe. It is in an unstable state so be careful, as soon as you stop moving a powerful reaction starts. It may help you remove obstacles on your way, but also leads to an explosion in case you stay still for too long. Do we trust you with this because of your skill or because you are replaceable? Well, it's time to put on your hazmat suit and prove yourself!</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Controls: WASD / arrow keys + space</p>\n\n<p>This game was created by Alberto Guidice and Eszter V\u00e1rhidi\u00a0in about one day for Ludum Dare 49 with the theme <em>Unstable</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Additional credits:</p>\n<p>Messeah by\u00a0RoccoW\u00a0licensed under a\u00a0\u00a0Creative Commons License</p>\n<p>8bit Jump\u00a0by\u00a0Daleonfire\u00a0licensed under a\u00a0\u00a0Creative Commons License</p>\n<p>8-bit Game Over\u00a0by\u00a0Euphrosyyn\u00a0licensed under the Attribution License</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T10:09:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/376/376bf35dc170b0eee28af4b89124e073.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Sparkolo", "Eszter"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
