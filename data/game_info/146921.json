{"id": 146921, "slug": "color-tanks", "name": "Color Tanks", "name_original": "Color Tanks", "description": "<p>Color Tanks is a proof-of-concept Metroidvania style game for the Minimalistic Jam 2.</p>\n<p>Your ammunition is also your health bar! Look around for upgrades to your tank's color tanks to help get through more challenging locations. Your goal is to defeat the evil [totally not Mother Brain] who is doing [totally evil stuff probably] and get out before the place blows.</p>\n<p>I haven't tested if the game is beatable, but there's no reason it shouldn't be. I also haven't completed the Blue area, so I've just provided some upgrades there instead. Also the collision is a bit lazy/wonky and I can't compose music to save my life.<br/></p>\n<p>This is a TIC-80 game, so the controls are like any other TIC-80 game. For the web version, the arrow keys move, Z shoots red, X shoots yellow, A shoots blue and S shoots green. It's the same layout as the colors on a Super Famicom controller, so if you have one of those that'll work great.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05c/05cb622432a16232253439ba46e3d9d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["InvisibleUp"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
