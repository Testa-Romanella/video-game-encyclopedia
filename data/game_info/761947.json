Chef Linguini had prepared a special cake for the grumpy man ! As the waitress, all you had to do was serve the masterpiece...\u00a0But as luck would have it, something terrible happened...</p>\n\n<p>You slipped on a banana peel. And then all you could do was delay the inevitable...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Wait For It</strong> is a  wacky and weird Wario Ware inspired game, where you try to go through as many quick challenges as possible to save and serve your beloved cake. As time goes on, the pace increases.</p>\n\n<p>This is my <strong>Ludum Dare 50 Compo</strong> submission. The theme is : <strong>Delay the Inevitable</strong> !<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls </strong>: SPACEBAR and W/A/S/D or ARROW KEYS.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong> : you will go through a series of mini games and try to go as far as possible while their difficulty slowly increases. The mechanics differ for every level, so you have to pay attention to the instruction for each mini game !  You start with 5 lives, so you can fail 5 mini games in total, then it's game over. Good luck !<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T12:10:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23c/23c5b4203dd46c95d22e2647a713d664.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Forgin' Bits"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
