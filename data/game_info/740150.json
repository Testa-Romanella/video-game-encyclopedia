{"id": 740150, "slug": "vwordle", "name": "VWordle", "name_original": "VWordle", "description": "<p>Wordle is a word guessing game, originally invented by Josh Wardle, a Welsh-born software engineer. The mechanics are nearly identical to the 1955 pen-and-paper game Jotto and the US television game show Lingo.</p>\n<p>Players have six attempts to guess a word. Feedback is given for each guess, in the form of colored tiles, indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position.\u00a0Tile types:</p>\n<ul><li>green - a letter is in the word and in the correct spot,\r\n</li><li>yellow - a letter is in the word but in the wrong spot,\r\n</li><li>gray - a letter is not in the word in any spot.</li></ul>\n<p>VWordle is an implementation of Wordle for retro handheld devices by vamastah. List of supported devices:</p>\n<ul><li>MiyooCFW-based: Bittboy, PocketGo, Powkiddy V90, Powkiddy Q90, etc.</li><li>RetroFW-based: LDK, LDK Landscape, RS-97, RG-300, etc.</li></ul>\n<p>There are plans to port the game to other platforms as well. Please leave a comment if you want to see it on your favourite console :)</p>\n<p>What do you pay for? Well, it is quite obvious it is not the only Wordle clone available in the internet. Your support will motivate me to develop the game further - more platforms, word dictionaries in languages different than English, better graphics, animations, etc. I will also be more confident to create content for niche handhelds - as you probably know, most of them are used to play emulated games. I want to change that.</p>\n<p>After collecting $100 I plan to release the source code of the game. Till that time you can take a look at my other creations at https://github.com/szymor.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T06:17:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/015/015b13c8ca598246efa38a714e7e79be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vamastah"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
