Will you escape the wrath of the volcanic eruption, or will you succumb to the heat and go up in flames?</em></strong></p>\n<p>You can\u00a0only jump if you have been energized from the molten ground or if you have recently passed by a magical flower. As the game progresses, a fiery wall of flames closes in on you, forcing you to advance. You can be saved from the inferno once they reach the rare teleportation gem. By collecting it, you will be transported to the next level with the blaze still following close behind. There are 3 levels in total.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Use the arrow keys or \"a\" and \"d\" to move, and use space to jump.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T07:07:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/526/5267ff746caebfae77f4d8692fdc64ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["source1012"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
