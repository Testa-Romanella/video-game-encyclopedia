It was made with a wish to simply produce a neat-looking retro-styled game, but also to create something that bears a certain message: that of the dangers of workplace toxicity and office bullying.</p>\n<p>All episodes are <strong>playable free of charge\u00a0</strong>on the game's main site (you can play them in your browser with no download required):</p>\n<p>https://work-game.alvrineom.com/</p>\n<p>Currently published episodes:</p>\n<ul><li>Episode 1</li><li>Episode 2</li><li>Episode 3</li></ul>\n<p>You can view the list on\u00a0episodes page which includes the progression stats for each episode.<br/></p>\n<p>If you want to contribute to the cause, you can do so via\u00a0LINK. The game, as well as the game site, is run by a single person and it would help their further development.</p>\n<p>ASSET CREDITS:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Graphics:<ul><li>https://0x72.itch.io/\r\n</li><li>https://analogstudios.itch.io/\r\n</li><li>https://ansimuz.itch.io/\r\n</li><li>https://elthen.itch.io/\r\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>Music &amp; sound:<ul><li>https://danzmacabre.itch.io/\r\n</li><li>https://kronbits.itch.io/freesfx</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T11:42:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/126/126cbe8aa364a4c5fa3459d5fa7b8024.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["alvrineom"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
