It's a bullet hell game where your stats are randomised each wave. However, the score you accumulate can be spent on influencing how high the stats are for the next wave.</p>\n<p>Be warned, though: the more points you spend, the more enemies will spawn on the next wave. So, it's a <strong>roll of the dice</strong> if you get to keep those stats against overwhelming enemies <em>and </em>odds.<br/></p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p><strong>WASD</strong> to move. Hold<strong> Left click </strong>to shoot.</p>\r\nThis game is unfinished!\r\n<p>That's right, I never actually got to finish the game. I'm a solo student dev with little jam experience, the game is horribly unbalanced. But hey, <strong>I made something</strong>! So there's that. <br/></p>\n<p>I may come back to finish this later this month, as I actually want to develop this idea!<br/></p>\r\nAsset Credits\r\n<p>Font by\u00a0Pix3M, licenced under CC BY 3.0 </p>\n<p>Orb projectiles by AwesomePenguin, licenced under CC BY 3.0 </p>\n<p>Various sprites by Ansimuz, licenced under CC0<br/></p>\n<p>Ship designs by Scrittl, licenced under CC0</p>\n<p>Sound effects by dklon, licenced under CC BY 3.0</p>\n<p>Music by pmiller, licenced under CC0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T19:50:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37a/37a72ac9eddebb97d3198a8b8ed29983.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rilic"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
