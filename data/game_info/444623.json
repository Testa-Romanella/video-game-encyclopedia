For our entry, we decided to make a game about ancient Mesopotamia, where a young boy's dead spirit must figure out where he once lived. Inspired by GeoGuessr, the player teleports around a large open-world looking to collect special pottery that provides hints to the geographic location of the home. These hints are in another language, and must be translated using the provided language key sheet. The player must move fast, as they only have a limited time to complete the task!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Right Click - Land at location<br/>Left Click - Return to sky<br/>Escape - Reset Game<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-18T03:03:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e9/8e95a8ae6876d924e2fb4dc62d45e385.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 259, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chris Schickler"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
