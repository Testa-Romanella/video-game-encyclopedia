Built in Unreal Engine 5, the film follows one night in the life of Neve: a young woman who dreams of becoming the first ever, female anti-gravity racing champion.</p>\n<p>Designed to take advantage of the real-time nature of UE5, the project allows users to change aspects of the film on the fly, from weather and time of day, to ship skins and team colours.</p>\n<p>This early build is a WIP tech demo meant to showcase this customisable setup on a small scene, as well as a single track demo for players to race on.</p><p>Currently the soundtrack is disabled, and no doubt there will be several bugs that have been missed. Feedback is very welcome.<br/></p>\n<p>Future updates will include a full campaign mode, multiple ship designs and much more.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T07:04:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61a/61afd8ab95e231b1759501121d1f2fa9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SakuraBuddha"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
