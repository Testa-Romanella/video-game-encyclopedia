The player can drop some of their light on the ground to mark parts of the maze, but lose some of their own light when they do.</p>\n<p>This was a learning project to get accustomed to working in Unreal Engine, particularly as a first experiment using node-based programming. I decided to put together a maze generation algorithm in Blueprints to make things challenging and see how far I could push it. I took the light mechanics from a bigger game idea I had been thinking about, so the project doubles as a partial proof of concept.</p>\n<p>Anyone curious to take a look at the project files can check them out on my GitHub portfolio at\u00a0https://github.com/AlexiaSoucy/portfolio!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T06:23:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b3/0b303932c342f46e63a07b44d555330d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alexia Soucy"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
