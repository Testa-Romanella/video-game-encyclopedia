Now, a thousand years later, the demon lord returns after the seal gets broken by some fools who think they could control him for their world domination plans. Of course <strong>Dark</strong> is pissed as hell and ready to rock and so they had to learn the hard way that a demon isn't that easy to control. Driven by the desire for revenge <strong>Dark</strong> wants to conquer the world once again to ensure his place as sole ruler over humanity. But things aren't that easy this time: Back then he had an army of thousands of demons, undead and orcs under his command, now he is alone. Soon <strong>Dark</strong> realizes that the world he once brought death and destruction has drastically changed. The big empires he fought against are gone, new lands were discovered and new wars threatening the world. And so it seems that our demon is just one of many threats which could plunge the world into chaos...</p>\n<p>If you are tired of mimicking the shiny sparkling hero and would rather rule the world than saving it, if you want a humorous challenging, storydriven game experience, if you love retro RPGs, then this game is for you!</p>\n<p>Download via Mega.nz:\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Please consider supporting me on Patreon to make this game a reality!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/062/06254dbd13c2645c41d61bb01ab2a0bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 295, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DerKIAS"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
