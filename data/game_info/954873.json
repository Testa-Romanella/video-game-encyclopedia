{"id": 954873, "slug": "neonnose", "name": "NEONnose", "name_original": "NEONnose", "description": "<p>Welcome to NEONnose: the canine detective adventure game that will take you on a thrilling and humorous journey through a cyberpunk city. You play as Daisy, a lovable and determined dog who wakes up one day to find her owner, Blake Steel, has gone missing. With no one else to turn to, Daisy takes it upon herself to become a detective and track down her beloved human.</p>\n<p>While NEONnose is a self-parody of my earlier game NEONnoir, it is a standalone game and does not require you to have played it to enjoy this one. If you like it, or it puts a smile on your face, please let me know by leaving me a comment. Thank you!</p>\r\nThe Theme: Duality\r\n<p>As the story of NEONnose unfolds, you play from both Daisy and Blake's perspectives, each with its own gameplay elements. Daisy is a good girl and puzzles out her problems with her nose. Blake... well, he's Blake, and he's going to use his fists.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>I may have gone overboard with the control scheme.</p>\r\nKeyboardGamepadMove Forward<br/>W, Up Arrow, Num 8<br/>Left stick, D-pad Up<br/>Move Back<br/>S, Down Arrow, Num 2<br/>Left stick, D-pad Down<br/>Strafe Left<br/>A, Shift-Left Arrow, Num 4<br/>Left stick, D-pad Left<br/>Strafe Right<br/>D.

There is still a delay when walking.</p>\r\nCombat\r\n<p>NEONnose is completely turn-based. The enemies won't move until you do; if they don't like the cut of your jib, they might just come to fight you. Combat is Rock, Paper, Scissors with a different skin: Punch, Kick, Block.</p>\n<ul><li>Punch beat Kick: It's hard to kick someone punching you in the face.</li><li>Kick beats Block: It's too powerful and breaks through the block</li><li>Block beats Punch: The punch can't get through the block</li></ul>\n<p>Collect coffees outside of combat to heal Blake. Once per combat, if you run out of health, Blake goes into a berserker rage.</p>\n<p>Also... I never removed the cheat button from the game. Happy hunting!<br/></p>\r\nGame Jam Version\r\n<p>There needed to be a lot of compromises to get the game done in a week, and it still needs a lot of polish, especially in the audio department. Once the jam-judging period is over, I'll update it with a hopefully improved version.<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>I\u00a0did the story, programming,\u00a0game design,\u00a0and environmental\u00a0art.\u00a0My\u00a0lovely wife helped with story and game ideas as well as some NPC assets. You can find samples of her work here). The other NPC assets came from an asset pack I purchased.</p>\n<p>The title music was from another purchased asset, and the club music was from Mathias Sosa, which he composed for NEONnoir.</p>\n<p>Sound effects were from Soundly.</p><p>Anime speed lines modified from original image by Freepik<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T11:00:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dee/deeefa11b0d3ca40cf11595e650a735f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["steamknight"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
