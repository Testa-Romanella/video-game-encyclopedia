The game was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy consoles. Both versions were first released simultaneously in Japan on December 14, 1991, and released in all other regions the following year.</p>\n<p>In Yoshi, the player is tasked with clearing monsters from the on-screen playing field. The monsters fall in from the top of the screen to build vertical stacks; the player must prevent a stack from growing too high such that it exits the play field. In order to so, the player swaps and moves the stacks about such that falling monsters collide with identical monsters stationed atop the stacks, causing them to be removed from play. Yoshi offers both a scoring-focused single-player mode and a competitive two-player mode.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1991-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-08T11:37:09", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Nintendo 3DS", "Game Boy", "NES"], "developers": ["Game Freak"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
