Tap while crawling to change directions, tap on flowers and signs to climb them, and tap to the left or right of the snail when climbing to jump off in that direction. The faster you move, the higher your bonus will be.</p><p>My brother and I had the game made, for the most part, within the 48-hour time limit, but it had many bugs in it, and had a graphical issue that made it run really slowly. After spending a few days to work out the bugs, as well as optimize it so it runs at the proper speed, we've released it anyway, not adding anything that wasn't already made before the gamejam ended. There's not a lot to see, but hopefully it's interesting enough to take a look at.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc4/fc4af38d81c56e54b3626ae5440b7e02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SuperSpaceHero"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
