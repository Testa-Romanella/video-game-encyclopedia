{"id": 180253, "slug": "besieged-2", "name": "Besieged!", "name_original": "Besieged!", "description": "<p>Hello and welcome to the very, very small world of Besieged! A game where you destroy castles and unlock more projectiles to rip things to shreds even better. At the moment we are in 0.0.0.0.0.01. Yes. That is how early we are so please excuse horrible death sounds, background music and physics but feel free to add comments on the discussion on how to make it much better! Or to criticize it on what is wrong. Both help! CONTROLS: When you first load in you can use arrow keys to look around. Futuristic, eh?\u00a0 Well then you can press the 'R' key to reload your cannon. Use 'W' and 'S' to rotate the cannon. Use 'A' and 'D' to decrease and increase the power. Press SPACE BAR to shoot and then you can use the arrow keys to move again. You have limited shots, so please think about weak spots! Once you progress to the next level you will notice that '2' will give you the stone ball, but weight to the projectile isn't everything. It will fall faster, so use each for a different job!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/872/87233a5b2dd58228d24a4383d525f1fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 235, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JLion Team"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
