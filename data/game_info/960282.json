This air combat game was independently developed by an aviation and military enthusiast. At first, it was just a simple plane simulator for simulating aircraft acceleration and maneuvering. Expanded to become a complete independent mini-game. Players can drive various jet fighters and attack aircraft from the early days of the Cold War to modern times, and use cannons, rockets, bombs, various types of air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles to complete various types of combat missions. The game style is simple, with basic simulation of the physical and aerodynamic characteristics of aircraft and missiles, allowing players to experience the unique charm of air combat in the two-dimensional world. You can customize combat missions, choose aircraft type and initial state, and freely conduct air combat or ground support. You can also join four different camps including the United States, China, Russia and Europe, and complete a total of 32 alternate historical missions with Cold War and modern backgrounds.<h3>More than 100 types of aircrafts</h3>From the first generation jet fighter F-86 Saber and MiG-15 Bis to the most advanced fourth generation fighter F-35 Lightning II and J-20 Mighty Dragon<br/><br/><h3>Simple aerodynamic and physical simulation</h3>Players can experience the speed loss during aircraft maneuvering and climbing, as well as the range advantage of launching air-to-air missiles at high altitude and high speed, and formulate reasonable tactics based on aircraft performance<br/><br/><h3>varies airborne weapons</h3>Experience a variety of air combat and ground attack tactics, from infrared and radar-guided air-to-air missiles to laser-guided bombs and anti-radiation missiles<br/><br/><h3>Campaign Missions</h3>A total of 32 overhead historical missions for the four camps, covering the background of the Cold War to the modern war, driving the F-86 bravely through the MiG Alley, or flying the Su-27 over the English Channel<br/><br/><h3>Graphic tutorial and equipment database</h3>Detailed graphic tutorial and a database of aircraft and missile performance can be consulted to guide players to quickly get started with the game<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-05T02:46:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b1/8b16ca9c7f88c241b3096f6922506b65.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tetrahydrofuran", "gaijinfeima"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["tetrahydrofuran", "gaijinfeima"], "esrb_rating": null}
