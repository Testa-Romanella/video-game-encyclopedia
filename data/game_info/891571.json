You have just\u00a0met an untimely death. Unfortunately for you, your favorite music concert you\u2019ve been waiting for years to go was only a couple days away before you left the realms of Earth. You must return. You must defy your own death and return from the hell you are stuck in. There are many paths ahead but you must beat all of them to get out of here. Thankfully, the god of rhythm was touched by your determination and turned all the creatures in hell to live in rhythms. Your greatest passion, will now be your greatest weapon.\r\n<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to Install:</strong></p>\n<p>- Unzip the zip files and run the \"game\" executable.
