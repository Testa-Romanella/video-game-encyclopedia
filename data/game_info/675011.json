Using top of the line technology, the Slimes shaped a way to regulate the Earth ecosystem. For centuries the Slimes lived happily and prosperously under the warm protection of their machine, but it has recently GONE WRONG.<br/>\r\nThe chosen one, a particularly brave Slime, is sent in an infinite quest to solve the issue.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>A vertical platformer with a \u2018slight\u2019 twist (Match3) where you\u2019ll have to balance between scoring, risk taking and surviving.\r\n</p>\n<p>As you start climbing the tower, the game will automatically start to scroll toward the top. With your ability to move, jump and stomp, you will have to climb the tower through unstable blocks.\r\n</p>\n<p>The blocks you step on might crumble, so you will want to not stay idle for too long. If you fall too far below the death line, you (the Slime) will lose control of itself and die.\r\n</p>\n<p>As the blocks crumble, a Gem, that was supposed to maintain the Earth\u2019s ecosystem, will fall down. By making many gems fall, if you align 3 or more of them, it will make them explode. Exploding the gems have a chance to start catastrophic events, but this is the only way to, hopefully, fix the machine. (Also, this is how you earn score points)\r\n</p>\n<p>Climb as much as you can while puzzling through the gem blocks !</p>\r\nKeyboard Controls\r\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Movement</strong> : \u2191\u2190\u2193\u2192 | WASD</li>\n<li><strong>Jump</strong> : SPACE</li>\n<li><strong>Stomp</strong> : SPACE + \u2193 on air</li>\n<li><strong>Pause the game</strong> : ESCAPE</li>\n<li><strong>Navigation In Menu</strong> : Use <strong>\u2191\u2190\u2193\u2192 | WASD</strong> to navigate and <strong>SPACE</strong> to confirm</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The mouse is disabled, use the keyboard to navigate through menus.</strong></p>\r\nXbox Controller Controls\r\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Movement</strong> : \u2191\u2190\u2193\u2192</li>\n<li><strong>Jump</strong> : A</li>\n<li><strong>Stomp</strong>: A + \u2193 on air</li>\n<li><strong>Pause the game</strong> : ESCAPE</li>\n<li><strong>Navigation In Menu</strong> : Use <strong>\u2191\u2190\u2193\u2192</strong> to navigate and <strong>A</strong> to confirm</li>\n</ul>\r\nTeam\r\n<ul>\n<li>Garywiss - Developper &amp; Music Composer</li>\n<li>Harusame - Developper</li>\n<li>GCake - Developper</li>\n<li>Kafuka-Palazzo - Level Designer &amp; Voice Actor</li>\n<li>Dragongaze13- Artist2D</li>\n<li>Icehunter - Artist2D</li>\n</ul>\r\nHigh Scores\r\n<p>You can view High Scores leaderboard right here !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T07:12:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/408/408ef8d9b40f89286f90d01924db0a2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 207, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["harusame17", "GCake", "Garywiss", "Dragongaze13"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
