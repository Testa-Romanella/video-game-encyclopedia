Face over 100 hand-crafted levels where your skill and patience will be tested as you explore the world of Agra.<br/><br/><h3>Game Mechanics</h3>Our main game mechanic will be the plunge bow. It will have two primary uses.<br/><br/><ul><li>    Once attached to a surface it will work as a propelling object for our heroine Telmari. This will allow her to jump faster and higher than usual.<br/></li><li>    It can be used to avoid enemies by assisting Telmari to jump/fly over the enemies she encounters on her journey. After all, Telmari wouldn't damage a fly.</li></ul><br/>While the mechanic is simple and easy to understand, it gives the player multiple ways to approach a level.  <br/><br/>Levels are designed to make it harder for Telmari to take shortcuts. So bouncing on arrows will often propel you into more dangerous areas\u2014this way we cater to two different groups of players.<br/><br/> The more skilled players can attempt to beat the level as fast as possible using the varied and complicated combos (The more arrows you bounce onto the faster you will go). In contrast, casual players can enjoy a safer play style taking the longer but easier paths.<br/><br/>Some enemies in the game move much faster than Telmari or obstruct the path. For such encounters, it will be vital to master the arrow to outmaneuver them.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>I hope you enjoyed out little game. Keep a look out for our future endeavors.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-19T05:14:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f86/f86e2e31413fb41d4b87d760bc165327.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["phoenixblasters", "Phoenix Blasters"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Phoenix Blasters"], "esrb_rating": null}
