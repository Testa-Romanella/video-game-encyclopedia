I liked the idea of creating an interactive anthology\u00a0where stories are different yet set in the same universe (mad props to you if you spot the connections!).</p>\n<p>For the story content, I drew from my feelings, traits\u00a0and fixations: always being punctual, blaming myself for caring too much and - the next minute - reminding myself it can be a gift, being too harsh on some people without considering other aspects of their personalities, being snappy\u00a0and fear of being misunderstood.</p>\n<p><em>\"My project is finished and perfect!\"</em> said no creator ever.
