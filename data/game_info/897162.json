Made it for the sole purpose of finishing my school project about game programming. After approximately a year later, I've decided to put this up for others to play.\u00a0 Most of the game's assets are not made originally by me, and if you find some familiar things in this game, please note that I make no profits by publishing this game.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to play the game:<br/></strong>Collect all 6 pieces that are scattered across the map to summon the enemy and defeat them to proceed to the next level. Game will be finished either by defeating all the levels or by death. For the movement and such the tutorial guy's explanation should be enough.</p>\n<p><strong>Bugs:</strong><br/>There's only one bug that I'm aware of, which is clipping through the terrain. A button is provided on the top right corner of the screen and when pressed, will reset the whole level. To show the cursor, you can hold the F key to do so.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T09:25:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/907/907b2f958f95589f012dc629dcc25c12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Visnyth"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
