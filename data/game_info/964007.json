Experience the fate of a kingdom through the lives of the characters tied together by desire, destiny and demise.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The kingdom of Wendalle is in dire straits! It is divided by differing ideals and flooded with mistrust. A siege leads to a civil war, and the civil war threatens the stability of the entire kingdom as each dukedom competes in a race for Wendalle\u2019s throne.<br/><br/>One of these dukedoms, Swozalta, is ruled by Duke Arsenio Duran, a cruel and cunning man with a sinister plot to acquire higher power and a higher standing within the kingdom. He crushes all those who stand in his way but one opponent seems elusive - a small group of rebels that are persistent in their quest to expose and defeat him. However, the duke\u2019s powerful military is slowly but surely routing this rebellion, and it is slowly becoming obvious that its days are numbered.<br/><br/>You find yourself here. What will you choose? What decisions will you make? Will you value the lives of your comrades, or use them as you see fit? Will you choose to help those in need, or help yourself because your ideals seem clearer?
