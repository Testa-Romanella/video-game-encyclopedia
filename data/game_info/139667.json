But it isn't long before she and her sisters find themselves plunged deep within a conspiracy that is bigger than all of them. The Sun Soon would set on this mortal world.</p>\n<p>A compelling onslaught of tricky twists, trifling turns and charming tirades. This is Project Fantasia.</p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<p>- Fast-paced action combat, sorta like if Touhou had a baby with Binding of Isaac, and then that baby went and got really grounded and moody.<br/>- Relatable well thought out characters with a lot of dynamic appeal and charm.<br/>-Intense conspiracy-based story that grounds the game from the first moment and keeps you there to the last.<br/>-Explore several planets and recruit heroes to join in the Final Battle of Freedom, some places and heroes you may recognize, some.. not so much!<br/>-Alike most games, we intend Fantasia to be easy to grasp even if you've never played one of the others in our line-up.<br/>-Well thought out cutscenes that have push my abilities (and Vegas Pro's stability) to their limits.<br/>-A Brilliant Musical Score by a Composer who is incredibly talented.</p>\n<p><strong>Trivia:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Contrarily to most prior projects, this game has been focused on intentfully by a very closed group of individuals, the team developing the games main assets are the Crazy Chimp Collective's Elite.</p>\n<p>Bizarre Monkey: Systems, Gameplay, Writing, Cutscene Creation, Character Design, Storywriter, Project Management.<br/>Pjcr: Portraits<br/>Xiie: Maps, Sprites and Interface Art / Logos<br/>Max M.
