The game helps come up with tricks and keep track of current players letters and order. It has the ability to ban certain tricks and it auto generates tricks.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>After a bit of testing i realized the randomness generated a bit too hard tasks sometimes and therefor implemented the skip which also serves as a learning tool for the app to ban that particular combination. </p>\n<p>The game is entirely made in UI elements and was created in about 2-3 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>TRASH PILER</strong></p>\n<p>During the winter semester we were assigned to create a simple mobile game.....\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 so I created another one.</p>\n<p>This time I were sitting in the car thinking what would be the perfect toiletbreak game.</p>\n<p>From nowhere the game popped up. I wanted to create a shittier tetris-ish game that were all about piling trash the most efficient you could.\u00a0The game drops 5 random items in a random rotation and your goal is to place it using swipes to rotate the can and move the item side to side.The game took about 3 hours to make.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-01T04:17:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/797/79784fe71fd4d13653c5e9d121d48906.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["peg0ne"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
