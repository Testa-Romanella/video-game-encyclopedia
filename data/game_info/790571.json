Sorry :(</p>\n<p>Click here for a demo playlist</p>\n<p>Short credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Absolutely amazing sounds/music from\u00a0PMSFX\u00a0and\u00a0Freesound:<ul><li>https://freesound.org/people/Nox_Sound/sounds/612664/</li></ul></li><li>Some code based on Gonkee's Godot tutorials and source</li><li>I\u00a0learned a lot about 3D modelling from\u00a0the classic donut tutorial and\u00a0Imphenzia's low-poly modelling videos</li></ul>\r\nGAME INFO:\r\n<p>This is a 3D parkour/platforming/grappling/uhhh... just general movement... fun game. If you like any of the following, this game may be for you:</p>\n<ul><li>Interesting movement mechanics (the\u00a0<em>gravity whip</em> in this game is quite unique)</li><li>Goin' fast</li><li>Fun games</li><li>Sliding, grappling hooks, and/or flying</li><li>Speedrunning</li></ul>\n<p>Most of the levels are\u00a0underground, so it totally fits the theme. :D</p>\n<p><strong>Anyways, for those who want more detail before playing:</strong></p>\n<p>This game is about getting to the goal as fast (or with as much style) as possible. You have several tools at your disposal:</p>\n<ul><li>Walking: BORING, next</li><li>Jumping:\u00a0ok, well, pretty normal</li><li>Sliding: build speed when going downhill (and maintain it for a while\u00a0on flat surfaces), with responsive steering. Just don't go too fast and fly off a curve into the void ;)</li><li>Grappling hook: a medium-range grappling hook that lets you swing around on anything you want (yep, literally everything is grapple-able). The reel-in and reel-out are powerful enough to launch you pretty far if you use them right.</li><li><strong>Gravity Whip</strong>: the unique element of this game. The gravity whip has two modes of operation:<ul><li>Attractor (middle mouse button): if aimed at a static object, you'll get a big burst of speed in the direction you're facing; if aimed at a moving object, it'll be pulled towards you</li><li>Dragger (right mouse button): if aimed at a static object, you'll be pushed\u00a0<em>opposite</em> the direction you look (so, look down to launch upwards); if aimed at an object, it'll be dragged around to wherever you look</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>If you master these mechanics, you'll be able to move very freely in all 3 dimensions.\u00a0To help get you there, or just to play around,\u00a0I\u00a0built a \"skatepark\"\u00a0level for experimentation. :)</p>\r\nBASIC INSTRUCTIONS:\r\n<ul><li>Move with WASD</li><li>Aim with mouse</li><li>Jump with space</li><li>Slide with ctrl</li><li>Fire grapple with left mouse button (LMB)<ul><li>Reel in with Q and out with E</li></ul></li><li>Activate gravity whip with RMB/MMB<ul><li>RMB: attach to surface (or object) and pull in the direction you look</li><li>MMB: pull object towards you, or you towards surface</li></ul></li><li>Misc keybinds:<ul><li>R to respawn at last checkpoint</li><li>F to toggle flashlight</li><li>H to toggle HUD</li><li>`~ to reset level</li><li>F11 to toggle fullscreen</li></ul></li></ul>\r\nTODO:\r\n<ol><li>More levels<ol><li>Expand the tutorials to include more practice with each tool before the next one is introduced</li></ol></li><li>High score (best time)\u00a0tracker with three modes, each tracking scores separately:<ol><li>Checkpoints required (in any order)</li><li>Checkpoints required (in level's order)</li><li>Checkpoints not required</li></ol></li><li>OOB killbox</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T11:06:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d73/d730e29ef661abf04614d9fc6aee4f0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["GabrielRStella"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
