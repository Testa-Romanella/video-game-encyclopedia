The game highlights the personal and emotional experience of a first-generation immigrant person leaving behind all they've ever known in search of a new life in the so-called \"promised land\". This land **offers life-changing opportunities and comfort\u2014 but at the cost of what?<br/></p>\n<p>In Zhang's three-dimensional world, the player is riding a rollercoaster of emotions as they advance further into the game. As the game progresses, a better life emerges while losing their identity along the way. With each advancement, the player loses a part of themselves that can never be retrieved. In this world, the player is faced with a bitter part of reality that isn\u2019t talked about enough in the real world.\r\n </p>\n<p>Through this game, Zhang hopes to help immigrant children understand the sacrifice their parents had to make to provide them with the life they\u2019re living. Oftentimes, immigrant children are bitter and sometimes resent their parents for putting so much pressure on them to succeed but through this experience, Zhang hopes to shed some light on the real and raw experiences of their immigrant parents.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T10:30:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acc/acc87b916d7be5f93070200234be40ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Amy Zhang"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
