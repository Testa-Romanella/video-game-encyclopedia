I added trails to each planet\u00a0and\u00a0a particle system on the sun to improve the visuals of the game. I also dug into the camera code to allow zooming in and out with the scroll wheel.\u00a0 Finally, I smoothed the transition between looking at different targets so that the perspective shift isn't so sudden. This code change came with a couple bugs but I quickly dealt with them\u00a0before uploading the final build.</p>\n<p>Created by Henry Shotwell using Brian Winn's tutorial</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T06:31:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a7/4a786008fb3172c851da68dfa61e815f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["hshotwell"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
