To do this, you will learn how to use the famous suite of tools called Aircrack-ng!<br />\nA lot of research has been done to bring you some of the most realistic hacking methods such as bruteforce, exploits or even phishing!<br />\nYou will learn a lot during your adventure, but you will also learn that hacking is not without risk. The networks you will explore will be secured and the wifi connections will be monitored, requiring a high level of attention. If you get caught, you lose everything.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-05T20:20:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bd/6bdf716fd5deba137e76957593c0f810.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.5, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 39, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 5, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Save All Studio"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Save All Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
