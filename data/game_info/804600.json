The game will take heavy inspiration from given pantheon theme (Inuit), although with some edits/ exaggeration to creatures and ideas from folklore. It will have RPG elements, as well as Metroidvania elements with plenty of different progression options for longevity.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T23:44:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4bc/4bc8e7b8d06f5931032fca9eb3dc8e54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Doctor_Hale"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
