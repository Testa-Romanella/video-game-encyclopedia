The theme was \"Matriochka\" and we decided to abstract the\u00a0subject using the \"boxing\" axis.\u00a0We got the 5 following modifiers/constraints\u00a0:\u00a0<br/>-\u00a0The game must feature<strong>\u00a0one core system\u00a0</strong>with\u00a0<strong>physics components</strong>.<br/>- The game\u00a0<strong>cannot\u00a0</strong>use a<strong>\u00a0linear progression structure</strong>\u00a0in its\u00a0<strong>level design</strong>.<br/>- The game must be compatible for all\u00a0<strong>colorblind players</strong>.<br/>- The entire game must\u00a0<strong>not have text of any kind</strong>\u00a0(including main menu &amp; credits).<br/>- The game must use an\u00a0<strong>accelerometer\u00a0</strong>as\u00a0<strong>input</strong>.<br/>I was Game Designer on this project,\u00a0in charge of balancing, managing and communication.<br/><br/>One of our developers is actually working on a controller version. It does not fit the constraint but not everyone has a switch, right ?</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/>Roland De Tomasi\u00a0- Graphist (https://rolanddetomasi.wixsite.com/po...)<br/>Luke Devillard\u00a0- Graphist<br/>Nicolas Zelvelder\u00a0-\u00a0Graphist (https://www.behance.net/nicolaszelc90a)<br/>Fabien Salvalaggio\u00a0- Graphist (https://www.artstation.com/fabien-s)<br/>Ludovic Bonnet\u00a0- Graphist<br/>Augustin Courcoux\u00a0- Sound Designer (https://courcouxaugustin.wixsite.com/...)<br/>L\u00e9a Guerin\u00a0- Game Designer<br/>Ludovic Lucenet\u00a0- Game Designer (https://malaso.itch.io/)<br/>Jeremy Ossola\u00a0- Game Designer (https://jeremyossolagd.itch.io/)<br/>Elias Bennour\u00a0- Developer (https://eliasbenur.itch.io/)<br/>Gr\u00e9goire Calonne\u00a0- Developer<br/>Romain Delbecq\u00a0- Developer<br/>Alexandre Magisson\u00a0- Developer<br/>Pierre Bailly\u00a0- Developer (https://gogol25.itch.io/)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T09:17:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d3/1d3fbc3cbf70a6fc457f5a07fe2d6ae1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JeremyOssolaGD"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
