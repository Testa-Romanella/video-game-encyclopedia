This is my second game in Unity, but for this one I did all the scripting by myself so this is my first real unity Game. Please feedback on this so I can improve and redevelop this, as I like the concept. Thank you &lt;3 - Trollbae</p>\n<p>This was developed in around 4 hours, but I do plan to update this as I sharpen my C# Skills. ( Sorry :/ ). Please give me feedback in the comments as I cant efficently playtest as a developer, \u00a0but thank you!</p>\n<p>Also, if you enjoyed this, then im sure you will enjoy TV189. My first game published to steam that releases November 30th 2018. Here is a link to it.<br/></p>\n<p>https://store.steampowered.com/app/976230/</p>\n<p>It is an adventure-action-horror game in which you must battle mutants and hostiles in a post apocalyptic world that has been plauged by the TV189 virus. Before I released this I did preview some of the chapters on my itch.io page, so be sure to follow me to keep updated. <br/>Thank you!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f16/f1647ee66f940ac008a3b7319211bf2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Trollbae Studios"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
