Synthesize them into molecules by conducting reactions!<br/><h3>Molecules</h3>Choose one out of 150 molecules, view how its bonds are shaped and positioned. Conduct reactions at any scale!<br/><h3>Sandbox Mode</h3>No limits, no grind. Immerse yourself with the elegancy of chemistry.<br/><h3>Quest Mode</h3>With the goal of synthesizing every molecule, complete challenging quests to test your chemistry skills to the end.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T12:40:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d01/d013d843b2daec55427032c77b1b18c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 7, "owned": 53, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 13, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ata T\u00fcrko\u011flu", "Canberk Demir"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Ata T\u00fcrko\u011flu", "Canberk Demir"], "esrb_rating": null}
