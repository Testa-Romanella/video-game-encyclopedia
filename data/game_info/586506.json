It was inspired by superhot and other similar games, but the mechanics and their uses are references to <strong>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Use <strong>WASD</strong> for movement, <strong>Q</strong> to stop time,<strong> E</strong> to throw projectiles, and <strong>T</strong> to quit to menu. All input is single thread, so be gentle. you can recollect thrown projectiles by walking over them.</p>\n<p>The player has <strong>2 stats</strong>, an<strong> energy bar</strong> at the bottom of the screen\u00a0and a<strong> projectile indicator</strong> next to the player. The player only has 3 projectiles, which return to them when they are out of view. When you stop time, throw a projectile, or are hit by the enemy projectiles, you<strong> lose energy</strong>. You use up\u00a0more\u00a0energy the more you move in stopped time.\u00a0The player<strong> passively regenerates</strong>\u00a0energy when time is not frozen, and the enemy projectiles <strong>don't hurt you</strong> when time is frozen.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0When the player<strong> throws a projectile</strong>, the enemy has a high\u00a0chance to<strong> turn orange</strong>, in this state they cannot <strong>take damage</strong>. This state naturally deactivates with time.\u00a0The chance of going defensive diminishes as their health lowers. This\u00a0does not happen in stopped time, as the <strong>enemy cannot react</strong> to events that occur within the stopped time.</p>\n<p>You can<strong> change the difficulty</strong> on the title screen, and there are<strong> 3 levels of difficulty.</strong> Difficulty changes aspects like the enemies bullet speed, player regeneration, player's afflicted damage, player's received damage, starting health, and other things I probably forgot.</p>\n<p><strong>MUSIC IS BY AMAL RAJ\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 E</strong>verything else was made by me solely\u00a0for this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T05:38:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e03/e03604577fcbd4195609d6ab7585f6ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Calmest Games"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
