Unfortunately these dreams never came about, so I stopped dreaming. I\u2019ve already applied for a job as notary, I should make more money than anyone else could, that was the plan. But a new local problem changed it a bit. The problem is a new type of virus. Oh no, not a virus that makes you ill, no it changes you into a monster, half alive, half dead, a ZOMBIE!

Because I\u2019m the last normal human in here except the soldiers of the enemy army who started occupying the city before the virus broke out.<br/><br/>However, it made my life a lot more exciting, interesting. It looks like my child dreams finally came true, but not in the way I've always imagined. For now I've got one thing to do, survive.<br/><br/>Oh, and why I\u2019m still alive?
