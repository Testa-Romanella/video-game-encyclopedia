No? Anyways, Bouldering Brawl is a mountain climbing racing game for couch and online play. There are exploding goats, inflatable rocks and numerous other items to help you beat your friends in a race to the peak. Play unique and humorous characters and win on the various mountains of the world.Unique Aesthetics, Strange Characters, Items &amp; Obstacles Play with an unique low poly graphic style: Battle oddly humorously designed characters (you played many devils on vacation in your gaming career yet?), throw Clown-Sound grenades at your opponents, dodge swinging alphorns, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.Play Against Your Friends On The Couch &amp; OnlineWe all know it - what would Mario Kart be without that moment when you get hit by a blue shell fired by some last placed idiot? And all the cursing and taunting after that? In Bouldering Brawl, you can do exactly that (even though we can't pay for any damage you do to your furniture or your friends). <br/><br/>Did you ever wanted to play some cool indie game you found on Steam, but your friends weren't in the house and it had no online multiplayer?
