When playing, there will be a pattern to the right of the screen. The goal of the game is to get as high of a score as possible without having the tiles touch the bottom of the screen. The way to destroy tiles is by creating the pattern shown to the right of the screen. To switch tiles, the player only needs to tap one tile then the other. There are also two power up tiles (the green and pink) that either destroy all tiles of the chosen tile color, or delete that one tile chosen, respectively.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fdb/fdbba906ee15f3f179de042ce6da9745.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ginagr"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
