It is originally based of the game of the same name that is made during the Udacity 406 course, I tweaked/re-coloured most of the sprites and added a bunch of features on top of the prototype I made when going through the udacity course.</p>\n<p>Github: https://github.com/6money/GigaGal<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T05:52:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/043/04304d81a4baa4cc773e4c45fc07c6c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["6money"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
