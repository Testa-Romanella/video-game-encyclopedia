Be careful, however! If you get to close to a sheep you will eat it. After eating a sheep or getting it to safety, all the others will get scared and run faster; your movement speed also increases.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Rant: I usually spend too much time coding mechanics for my games. This time I thought I'd try to make something playable as fast as I can... This is the result. I know it's sloppy. Also, due to lack of time, the sprites were rushed and there is no music... I'm sorry about that.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T14:14:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a98/a988f11e3b1313054ebdabd69ca8e6e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AudricGreenwood"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
