{"id": 506934, "slug": "ecs-b3rz3rk", "name": "ECS b3rz3rk", "name_original": "ECS b3rz3rk", "description": "<p>This is a partial remake of the Classic arcade game B3RZ3RK which is meant to showcase a new ECS library for Godot called gs-ecs. This library provides a very small and lightweight framework that a developer can use to implement a Entity Component System methodology into their game.</p>\n<p>The purpose of the library is NOT to provide any type of interface that will dramatically improve the performance of your game or use the memory of your game as other ECS frameworks do on other Game Engines. Instead this framework gives you the ability to add an ECS structure to your game, while still giving you the freedom to let the Godot engine do what it does best.</p>\n<p>For more information on this framework, click on the link below.</p>\n<p>https://gs-ecs-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#<br/></p>\n<p><em>Note: For some reason the game fails to start sometimes. Just refresh the page and try again. Also, Mozilla sound is slightly delayed. Very annoying.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T08:00:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/106/1065f8c0e1ecb105bcf9f282b496d4d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sP0CkEr2"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
