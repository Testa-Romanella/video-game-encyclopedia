Will you live to tell the tale?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Unit it's Undone\u00a0</strong>is a little experimental game I made while learning Godot. The goal for this game was to make an opposite of a point-and-click game, but keeping the eerie atmosphere and humor of some of the games in this genre.</p>\n<p>The result is some sort of visual novel/ interactive fiction with weird puzzle minigames where everything is controlled by typing. This game also freatures atmosphere-based horror ( no gore or jumpscares ),\u00a0 dark comedy and \u00a0hidden optional events.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T03:39:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc1/fc1bb1b5157553f588637dd8e8b9b4c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["ApeHardware"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
