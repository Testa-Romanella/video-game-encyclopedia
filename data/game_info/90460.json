Five days of dancing, festivals, and drinking, culminating in a grand masquerade ball. It just so happens that Rivian Varrison, the introverted son of a famous nobleman, is forced to attend this giant event by his father. By chance, or maybe something more deliberate, he runs into a host of colorful and shady characters, all with their own stories to tell.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>But when a sudden and mysterious crime happens on the second day of the celebration, Rivian finds himself thrown into the middle of it, and has to discover the truth behind what really happened -- and who the people around him really are.</em><br/></p>\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Genres: Mystery, BL/yaoi, comedy, fantasy</li><li>~125,000 words (12+ hours gameplay)</li><li>3 BxB romance options (+1 side romance!)</li><li>9 endings</li><li>30+ CGs</li><li>Full English Voice Acting</li><li>1080p HD resolution</li><li>PG-13 and R-18 versions</li></ul>\n\n\r\n\r\nFAQ\r\n<p><em>What's a visual novel?</em></p>\n<p>A visual novel is a game with little traditional \"gameplay.\" The player reads text on the screen, accompanied by visuals and audio, and follows through a set story. However, they can make choices to determine the story's route and the ending. Think of it as a choose-your-own-adventure book, except in a game (and with art and sound!).</p>\n<p><em>What's a BL game?</em></p>\n<p>A BL game is a boy's love game - a game that focuses on a gay relationship between two males. </p>\n<p><em>What will this game be rated/how do the ratings work?</em></p>\n<p>We are releasing both PG-13 and R-18 versions.
