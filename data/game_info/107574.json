Inevitability is a<em> choice based</em> sidescroller... or is it?</p>\n<p>Experience the life of young Jane, a 17 year old girl struggling to support her father as he battles a serious illness. Featuring parallax mapping, original art (including drawn maps, sprites, and more), and an original soundtrack, this game is essentially a painting that you can live in and interact with.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>Hi there! I'm Hannah DeWitt, the creator of this game. Right now, Inevitability is still in its early stages of development. What you're about to play is NOT the finished game. I call it a demo, but it's more like an early access first build. While I'm making the full game, you can experience a small taste of what the final game will be, in a sort of prologue to the story. In this early access demo, you play as Jane at the age of six. Gameplay is about 10 minutes, and it features a musical theme produced and arranged by Jaxcheese (you can check him out on bandcamp) based on an original song written by me.</p>\n<p>The release date of the final game is unknown, but I'm hoping to finish it in a year. Any delay in time can be chalked up to the fact that: 1. This is an extremely indie game... so indie, in fact, that I'm making the entire thing by myself 2. This is actually my first ever game! and 3. I am a broke art student trying to make it through college at the same time.</p>\n<p>You can follow the development of this game at inevitabilitygamedev.tumblr.com, and if you're interested in my other work you can find me on instagram @hannah_thebird</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>If you find a bug, please report it to me! I will start a discussion page for that. Also, I'm not 100% sure if this game will work on Mac or Linux, considering I've only tested it on pc's before... so if you're a Mac or Linux user, you might want to make use of that option to download it for free, just in case it doesn't work on your computer.</p>\n<p>Donations are appreciated but not expected! Thank you for supporting your local sad artist!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7c/c7cb8c316cfafd4954ae65a494530fd9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Hannah"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
