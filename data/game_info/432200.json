Just keep moving, rack in those points, and make sure you don't get caught in your own crossfire. The more fruit you explode, the closer to that high score you become!</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Is the game finished?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, this wasn't meant to be a large scale project by any means, it was more of something I decided to develop just for the fun of it. Of course, I'd still love to hear any suggestions to improve the game. See the social section below for where to find me and get in touch!</p>\n<p><strong>Are scores tracked/saved?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes! In the downloadable build your high score is saved and displayed on the main menu!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Can\u00a0 I reset the high score?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes,\u00a0 just check the Options menu!</p>\n<p><strong>If I donate, where does that money go?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Any donations will go into to helping me fund future projects!\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Where to find me.</strong></p>\n<p>For more about myself, development updates, and game announcements follow me on\u00a0Twitter.
