I'm starting a new job tomorrow so I'm going to take a break from the project for a few days, and fix the gross ol' bugs and stuff you'll probably experience in this current build.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Next on my list are:<br/>- ACTUALLY switching the characters<br/>- Switching the physics to addforce (Good god I'm sorry about these collisions)<br/>- Sound &amp; Ambience!!<br/>- Accommodate any feedback folks would like to add in the comments below<br/><br/>This is my first released project that I can call complete (to some extent lol), and I\u00a0plan to add things like more maps, advanced and accurate drifting, and full racing functionality. For now, let me know what you think!</p>\n<p>Thanks for having a look!
