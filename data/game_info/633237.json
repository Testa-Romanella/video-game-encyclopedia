{"id": 633237, "slug": "identify-and-shoot", "name": "Identify and Shoot", "name_original": "Identify and Shoot", "description": "<p>The game \"Identify and Shoot\" supplements the existing pedagogy of kids learning to identify objects based on their image and classifying\u00a0them in relevant groups. Similar to other educational gaming tools, the game keeps the kids engaged in the particular learning activity\u00a0with a sense of fun. It can be used at home or schools to keep the kids engaged in this particular learning activity after a little initial\u00a0supervision by parents or teachers. It can also be used to test the learning of kids obtained via other traditional mediums. Grown-ups can\u00a0play the game for pastime and a short bite of relaxation.</p>\n<p>The game is priced at $1.\u00a0However, if one wants to first get a taste of the game before deciding to buy the game, he/she can\u00a0play the free trial version of the game wherein the player can only identify one object type out of the six object types\u00a0available in the\u00a0game. Good luck playing the game!!!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Created by Prateek Kumar Singh</p>\n<p>Thankful to -</p>\n<p>1. \"Game Design and Development 1: 2D Shooter\" course by Michigan State University on www.coursera.org for the learning imparted and also\u00a0for the codebase of the 2D Shooter project provided in the course.
