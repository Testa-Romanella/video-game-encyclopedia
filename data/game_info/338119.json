I have struggled with my ED for over a decade and simply being at treatment was very hard at first. As part of groups we received many tools and hand outs and I found myself struggling to make sense of it all in the moment. I began working on All Foods Fit as a way to process that information. I tried to write in the voice of my recovery self speaking to my hurting self. As I added more content I realized this tool might benefit\u00a0others.</p>\n<p>All Foods Fit is a JRPG style game with a house and garden to explore.\u00a0 There are exercises, poems, and moments of empathy for players struggling with an eating disorder to find. There are some optional JRPG style battles designed to help you feel empowered by using representations of real world skills like group therapy and mindful breathing on representations of real world symptoms like the eating disorder voice that can torture us or the symptom urges that seem to hijack our lives. Just like in recovery, you can't lose in All Foods Fit. If you are unsuccessful at a challenge you can always try again later.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ultimately this game is about recovery and knowing that you are worthy of space, and happiness, and a loving relationship with your body. You can do it! and I would be honored if this game helps you in any way.</p>\n<p>Thank you for checking out All Foods Fit.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Penny</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-01T05:02:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d66/d66dd9dd9bb0f5b9417bc3035917d0e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["autistmouse"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
