The theme was Passage, and my take on it was the passage of time, as well as the physical passage (tunnel) that your followers have to dig to reach you.</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: There are two versions of the game, one with scripted events and one with randomized events. I feel the one with scripted\u00a0events is more polished and flows better, but the other version is longer and\u00a0has more replayability (the latter is also a bit easier).\u00a0Please pick the one you think is better suited for you!</p>\n<p>---- CONTROLS----</p>\n<p>Mouse or arrows to select</p>\n<p>Enter or left click to confirm</p>\n<p>R to restart</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-30T05:00:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d7/8d7bbb516ecd65c38e0f061c8ea87407.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ShenTzu Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
