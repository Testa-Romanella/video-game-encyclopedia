Who knows?</p>\n<p>Featuring:<br/>- graphics stolen everywhere - awesomely poor animations<br/>- sound effects googled with care<br/>- the soundtrack of absolute silence<br/>- particles effects from outer space<br/>- way too much sarcasm<br/>- LOOPS<br/>- LOOPS<br/>- LOOPS<br/>- LO... yeah you got this</p>\n<p>Made during Ludum Dare #47. It is my first time participating in a jam, and the first time I used godot engine as well. I was not expecting to have something playable and knew I did not have a lot of time as it was overlapping with a lot of other life stuff, so I kept it simple. But I really enjoyed the process and I'm happy to have something that's playable, with even some menuing, animations and particle effects. I really enjoyed doing this and learnt a lot in a really short time, I already look forward to the next.<br/>My only regret is I did not have time to do some soundtrack for it, but I'll have it next time.<br/>Anyway, hope you'll like it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T07:06:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f55/f55a5c511f6cb5ca2411320c111b49bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["macmist"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
