See it here for the first time before its official cartridge release! Try this rad game out and have the 411 on it before all of your friends.</p>\r\nStory:\r\n<p>The year is 198X, it\u2019s been two years since the evil Dr. Mojo Badly tried to take over your neighborhood. He thought he would just take over the place, but sike! That space cadet didn\u2019t expect your trusty robot pal Sparky to bail you out. Sparky told him to get bent all the way back to Grief Mountain. Totally Righteous!</p>\n<p>Now you\u2019re just hanging in your pad and you see some zombies walking by, and you\u2019re like \u201cdag spanky! That\u2019s totally bogus right there! I bet Mojo Badly\u2019s up to his old tricks again.\u201d</p>\n<p>So you go to the garage and patch up Sparky to go make road pizza of these goons. But oh dang, Sparky\u2019s internal battery is acting all whack. But he ain\u2019t no scrub, he\u2019s going to go tell that nerd to cram it back to Grief Mountain again.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile you can sit back, order in a pizza and open a \u201ccold one.\u201d</p>\r\ncontrols\r\n<ul><li>XBox controller support</li><li>keyboard support with additional mouse controls</li></ul>\r\nKeyboard\r\n<ul><li>W/S Up/Down - Move Sparky forwards and backwards</li><li>A/D Left/Right - turn Sparky left and right</li><li>L-CTRL - Shoot Sparky\u2019s Electro-Blaster (careful this uses your power!)</li><li>L-ALT - Use Sparky\u2019s Vibro-Saw to hack those zombies apart (this should work if you fullscreen the game)</li></ul>\r\nX-Box Controller\r\n<ul><li>D-Pad Up/Down - Move Sparky forwards and backwards</li><li>D-Pad Left Right - turn Sparky left and right</li><li>A - Shoot Sparky\u2019s Electro-Blaster (careful this uses your power!)</li><li>B - Use Sparky\u2019s Vibro-Saw to hack those zombies apart</li></ul>\r\nMouse\r\n<ul><li>Left Click - Shoot Sparky\u2019s Electro-Blaster (careful this uses your power!)</li><li>Right Click - Use Sparky\u2019s Vibro-Saw to hack those zombies apart</li></ul>\n<p>Apologies in advance for people who a non-English keyboard configuration</p>\r\nCredit\r\nFont\r\n<p>Arcade Classic Font by: Pizzadude -\u00a0http://www.1001freefonts.com/arcade_classic.font\u00a0Free for personal use</p>\r\nMusic\r\n<p>\u201cCyborg Ninja\u201d Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\u00a0http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p>\u201cMega Hyper Ultrastorm\u201d Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\u00a0http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p>\u201cVoltaic\u201d Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 Licensehttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\r\nSounds\r\n<p>bxfr</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/380/3800c58bf52ef5485a34c7689c4e4056.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mmason"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
