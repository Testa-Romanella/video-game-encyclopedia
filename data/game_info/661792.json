This project is utilizing assets that were made in house. In this game you are a lone star ship traveling through the reaches of out space, on a heart bound journey seeing if you can ever reach the edge of space. All while only having one life. You move using the WASD. We put a fun little twist on the endless runner aspect taking inspiration from Subway Surfer and Temple Run, where instead of jumping over and sliding under obstacles you just fly around them allowing to stay in a 3x3 section of play space dodging different obstacles. We still plan on updating and making changes adding\u00a0 more obstacles and different mechanics.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-09T00:48:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea1/ea19a88b8da8148f245b02ca310f5ddb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kota_harrison"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
