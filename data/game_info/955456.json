But it is no ordinary maze, as the rooms of the labyrinth move and rotate to make sure the rat stays right where it belongs. However, this change is not only a threat but also an opportunity for our little rodent, as it will allow him to reach the keys he needs to get out of this concrete hell. In Kubik, get lost over and over again before you can find the exit.\u00a0\r\nKubik is still in development and this is only a demo build used to gather feedback. Please be aware that anything you see is subject to change.\u00a0\r\nKubik is supports keyboard and controller.\r\n\r\nControls\r\n\n<strong>Move: WASD/Left Stick</strong>\n<strong>Jump: Spacebar/Bottom Face Button\u00a0</strong>\n<strong>Interact: F/Left Face\u00a0Button</strong>\n\r\nCredits\r\n\r\nLevel\u00a0Design:\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Paul Sevin\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Eva Moretti\r\n\r\n3D Art:\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luca Geraci\r\n\r\nProgramming:\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ashley Monpeurt", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T15:18:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e9/6e9c50a658d0362ac968bed44d73aa37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FroggyAsh"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
