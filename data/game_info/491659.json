Journey across a once-peaceful land, allying (or making enemies) with a cast of strange, fully-voiced characters. Boldly forge your own path with a focus on player choice, all while trying to solve the mystery behind the chaos invading your home.<h3>Explore the Isle of Flungo in a side-scrolling, point-n-click perspective</h3><br/>The Isle of Flungo is open to explore, whether it be on foot, or by (extremely run-down) vehicle. Either way, you\u2019ll take control of Bluke in a side-scrolling, point-n-click perspective, able to click on any object or character of interest to engage with it.<h3>Make unpredictable choices and be met with equally-unexpected consequences</h3><br/>Want to take on the role of a pacifist? Achieve your goals through violence? Maybe you just want to keep everyone alive... with a heavy emphasis on player choice, it's up to you to decide how to navigate Bluke's chaotic journey.<h3>Engage in genre-shifting minigames and hone your skills</h3><br/>Saving the Isle isn\u2019t all work! Genre-shifting minigames are sprinkled throughout Bluke\u2019s journey to spice things up. Try for a high-score in the Arcade, and compete with your friends on the leaderboards.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T05:10:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f75/f750e695959615a723eed141da540824.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brainloaf Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Brainloaf Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
