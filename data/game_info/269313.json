I've been working on this on and off for several months but I thought it was finally time to put something playable out into the world. The main gameplay loop is working.\u00a0The obstacles are procedurally generated as you fall and the game gets both faster and more difficult. You can collect pickups to gain gold which you can use to purchase upgrades in \"The Lab\". Data is persistent so your high score and gold will be saved as long as you don't reinstall the game.</p>\n<p>There are <strong>cheats enabled</strong> in the current build to allow easy testing of the upgrade system. Buttons in the lab will allow you to give yourself gold easily to buy upgrades.</p>\n<p>The lab is still early stages visually and needs a lot of polish. There's also a skins area where I intend to allow the player to change how their character looks. These are still works in progress and will be updated as time goes on.</p>\n<p>Music is something I desperately need but can't make myself. If you're interested in working with me on the music for this game get in touch with me. You can find my e-mail and twitter on my profile.</p>\n<p><strong>Upgrade Descriptions</strong></p>\n<p>Rock Research - Leveling this lets you find new pickups which are worth more points and gold. (Currently there are 4)</p>\n<p>No. Max Attacks - Increases the maximum number of attacks the player has in reserve.</p>\n<p>Attack Recharge Speed - Allows the player to recover spent attacks faster.</p>\n<p><strong>Let me know your high score!</strong></p>\n<p>The game is totally free just select 'No thanks just take me to downloads!'.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a8/7a887f45b8655da7e9654362dc8b2b42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ztuu"], "genres": ["Action", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
