You then simply give half of the revenue to the winner and keep half for your club funds.<br/><br/>Fundraising Scratch Cards features 100 different football teams from all over the World which are selected at random, giving many billions of scratchcard options.<br/><br/>Traditionally football scratch cards are produced on card with a latex scratch panel, which is not terribly environmentally friendly as they are only used once.  <br/><br/>You can now save environmental resources and raise money for your team at the same time.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:22:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/298/298752830ecfd62181eaaf868866356f.jpg", "website": "http://www.fundraisingscratchcards.co.uk/index.aspx", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["App Developers"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["App Developers"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
