Many others were not so lucky.</p>\n<p>Two scientists each conduct their own experiment to revive all dinos (sort of like the Jurassic of Parks movie).\u00a0One of them strives to further scientific knowledge and study dinos in a respectful manner, while the other strives to use dinos to conduct disrespectful experiments for whatever reason. Being the only sort-of-sane and physically healthy dino, you take your sawed-off shotgun and begin your dangerous adventure to fight some dude with crazy hair and eyebrows.</p>\n\n<p>(By the way, there are easter eggs that you will not be able to find. Have fun!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T15:37:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/414/4148971f22b138146d17c4f07393574e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Champlain Game Academy 22"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
