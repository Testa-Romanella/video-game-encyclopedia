The Raiders&#39; objective is to kill aliens, kill the alien queen, and capture alien eggs. The Raiders have a set escape window, with their shuttle landing on turn 15 and taking off on 26. At that point, the game ends and victory points compared. The left half of the map is an outdoor environment, with bushes, trees, rivers and marshes. The alien queen herself can fire a short-ranged but deadly acidic spit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1988-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-17T14:49:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ed/4eda46f159296320f9bb9619f11a5f0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": [], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Silverbird Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
