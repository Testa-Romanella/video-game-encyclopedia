They are in love with you back. These are snippets of your lives together.\u00a0</p>\r\nHui\r\nThe Romance Option\r\n<p>Your friend of many years, Hui has a gentle and calm personality along with infinite patience (at least, as far as you're concerned). For a martial arts master with a rather mysterious past, they fluster rather easily - something you make sure to exploit to your heart's content. Not that they'd ever mind.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\r\nMore Info\r\n<ul><li>10k words for about half an hour (30 minutes) of gameplay</li><li>Nameable MC</li><li>Different scenes to experience - replayability\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Warnings: Hints of suggestive themes (flirting as well), minor blood/injury, minor bullying, minor cursing</strong></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Engine used: Ren'Py by Tom Rothamel</p>\n<p>Writing,\u00a0GUI, Coding, BG Art: Dom (\"The Cottage Workshop\")</p>\n<p>Character Sprite Art:\u00a0PDRRook</p>\n<p>Beta\u00a0Player:\u00a0PDRRook</p>\n<p>Music:</p>\n<p>By Bensound</p>\n<p><em>Cold Funk </em>by Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3522-cold-funk</p>\n<p>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>\n<p>Fonts -\u00a0Free for Personal and Commercial Use: Philosopher</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T09:11:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/652/6520fb87d0d5c9b0c86b397c8d3f646c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["The Cottage Workshop"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
