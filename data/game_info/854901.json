Players can push and pull eachothers. If you push a player against a wall they can be knocked out for a bit, but pushing or pulling right before impact can allow you to tech the impact and avoid that entirely, but precision is required !</p>\n<p>The only and most-valuable item in the game is the crown ! Getting it will give your powers a boost ! However players will try to steal it from you by pushing you into the various surfaces available in the arena !</p>\n<p>Take the crown and become the most wanted player around !</p>\n<p>The arena is made of surfaces, you can use them to jump, wall-jump, and navigate around but it's also surfaces that could be used to knock you out !</p>\n<p>The game was made in a semester by a team of 5 people at ICAN :<br/><br/><strong>S\u00e9bastien PAUTOT</strong><br/>(Programming)<br/><br/><strong>Victor FANTON</strong><br/>(Project Lead, Game Design)<br/><br/><strong>Simon DUCOS</strong><br/>(Game Art, Sound Design and Composition)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T10:20:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ec/7ec8aa55040aca2a069d5de5442f1ee8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Simon Ducos", "Victor Fanton", "G0LEM"], "genres": ["Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
