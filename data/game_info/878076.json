This is no ordinary board or school, Cause at this time the skater boy has gotten himself a\u00a0<strong>brand new hoverboard!!!!</strong> Which has just hit the market, and is now very excited to test it out in the school corridors.<br/>Back at school, Chaos had suddenly struck at the same time as you were getting you're brand new hoverboard. The corridors have been filled with\u00a0lockers, clothes, trashcans, and many more objects thrown all over the place. That you can now use as obstacles to max out you're hoverboard skills, <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Do you have what it takes to achieve the highest score in school?</strong></p>\r\nHow to play?\r\n<p>You can use either keyboard or a controller.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Keyboard Binds:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>A/Left Arrow\u00a0- Move Left<br/></strong><strong>D/Right Arrow - Move Right<br/>Spacebar - Pause\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Controller Binds</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Left D-PAD - Move Left:<br/>Right D-PAD - Move Right<br/>A - Confirm<br/>B - Pause</strong></p>\r\nCredits :\r\n<p>Hovermania was made for our first game project at Futuregames. This is what came out with 2 weeks of work on a solid concept we had, Some features we would like to have is not added in the game so for that reason, it may give the feeling that something is missing from it. We did the best we could with some ups and downs but that was to be expected from our first project with new people and no prior experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Nicholas Thiangphadung -\u00a0Product Owner, Map/UI Design<br/>Mark Victor Laguitan -\u00a0Sound/Map Design<br/>Sebastian Zetterberg - Programmer<br/>Adam Vall Kvick - Programmer<br/>Malte Linde Neveling - Programmer<br/>Gautham Satheesh -\u00a0Lead Artist<br/>Moa Jerneholt -\u00a0Artist<br/><strong>Albin\u00a0R\u00fcemenapp -\u00a0Quality Assurance<br/></strong>Johannes Sernbo - Quality Assurance</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T05:49:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b4/5b48005f167760768d3ee01d2e40f310.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Futuregames"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
