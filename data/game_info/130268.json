Especially if you are a solo dev. And that you can't rely on scaling pixel art just because it still looks okay. Because it doesn't look okay when you put it next to other pixel art with different scales. :) And also that I cannot draw spaceships. There is a bug that I tried to fix and broke everything where the ship will throw the ball again if it bounces back on itself. I do not think I will be fixing it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ee/0ee9659d79f5e25cca16d5a40807b7cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["emik"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
