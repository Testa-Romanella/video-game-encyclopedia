But weeds take a lot of clicks to remove.</p><p>Suggested Screen Resolution: 800 x 600 or 1400 x 1050</p>\n<p>This game was created for the Serious Game Train jam. The idea is that\u00a0Your environment is your mental state. You should take\u00a0good care of yours and those of people close to you. However it is not easy to do just that. Toxic people stick close and drain you of your happiness.<br/></p>\n<p>The game idea expanded onto having bridges that linked to other people's mental states that you would spend time labouring; only to end up neglecting your own if not managed at the PERFECT pace.</p>\n<p>The current version is a very basic prototype. Thank you for your time.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was developed in a team: Saili Chola, Siya and Dhannya Mathew</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-22T02:34:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1bc/1bc0457091783446ab090a57627e37b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RedTheDemonCat"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
