The game and all of its assets were made by me, except for some of the sound effects which were taken from the YouTube channel \"All Sounds\".</p>\n<p>The game is controlled entirely with the mouse, although the minigame to enter the password can alternatively be controlled with WASD or the arrow keys. Furthermore ESC opens the Pause Menu.</p><p><em>Playing in Fullscreen mode is\u00a0<strong>heavily</strong> recommended.</em><br/></p>\n<p>Since I was also preparing for exams in the meantime, the game lacks substance in some areas aswell as scene transitions.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it anyway!<br/>Fenny<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T05:05:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6e/f6e488b5c6bb907af2320e3cf32ac6c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fenny"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
