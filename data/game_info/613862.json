This portal will be \"powered\" with energy being absorbed from the last star in the universe, a white dwarf called ESPER-4-NZA. For the long journey from their local planet to the star, the humans have been preserved in their own capsules on cryogenic freezing. The maintenance and safety of the ship and its contents is ensured by a crew of automatons, whose purpose is to make sure that everything would run flawlessly. However the automatons' program has been corrupted with a malign virus, which has made them machines of destruction. The player is a human who is awakened from his cryopod by the ship's captain. The player's goal is to save humanity from the perpetual darkness of the universe by surviving the automatons, now with homicidal intentions, and activate the portal that will allow humanity to survive.</p>\n\n<p>This game is still in development.
