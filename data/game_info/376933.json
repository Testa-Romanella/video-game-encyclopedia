My closet was filled with various parts, motors, and more. I really enjoyed soldering. Once, during another soldering, a drop of hot tin almost hit my eye! A centimeter and I would go blind! Since then, I have ceased to get involved in mechanisms and freed up my closet.<br/><br/>Our simulator can give an idea of \u200b\u200bthe simplest mechanisms and help to avoid dangerous situations in real life.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-27T02:33:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbd/dbdd2d658b52b83e89f9c8febece6157.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IDALGAME"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["IDALGAME"], "esrb_rating": null}
