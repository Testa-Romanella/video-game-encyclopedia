Jimmy! The little protagonist. (the guy up there)</p>\n<p>There is no plot. He is locked down in his room and you need to help him to entertain himself.\r\nHow can I do that? Well... the controls are simple.</p>\n<ul><li>Move him around with the WASD keys</li><li>If you see a popup appear, you can close it with the cross button or by pressing the \"Sounds cool!\" button</li><li>You interact with objects by pressing SPACE. Each object has a different behavior and response. In order to interact with these objects, you have to make sure there's a highlight around them.</li></ul>\n<p>You may find secrets, you may not.</p>\n<p>Github repo: https://github.com/webguy88/jimmybored/tree/master<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T05:19:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ac/1aca86e5a22120a20ab7953e518700e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["webguy88"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
