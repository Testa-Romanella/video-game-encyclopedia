We had to create the movement for the cars and logs in code and all UI information displayed in game. We were given some vague instructions on how to build the game properly but had to program all elements of the code from scratch (except for the UI which was explained to us explicitly). This is used as an example for tile based movement and proper level design in games. There are some glitches in the game that were not resolved before the submission of the game.</p>\n<p>Bugs/Glitches</p>\n<ul><li>When not moving the frog player for the entirety of the game until the game over state is initialized an error will occur because the game cannot find the player's original position because it was never changed and therefore unrecorded. (I believe this is the reason, further testing is required).</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T03:54:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc9/fc9f1ec24d86a7cda7041cced961a498.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Omar Menafee"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
