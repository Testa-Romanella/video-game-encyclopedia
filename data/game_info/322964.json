Whether good or bad, there could be literally anything waiting for you in the darkness of space, not to mention the numerous known natural hazards that will kill you faster than you can react. <br/></em></p>\n<p><em>You have limited fuel, no shields and most importantly, no backup. Your slim but only chance of survival is to venture out into the mystery of the unknown and discover something truly spectacular in the deepest depths of space.
