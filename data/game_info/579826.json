It's totally not* a FANGAME OR ANYTHING.\u00a0<br/><em>(*Umm... Huh?\u00a0Maybe it is a fangame... What a mystery...)</em></p>\n<p>Check out all the sort of things you're missing out on, you sluggish IMBECILE....</p>\n\r\nTHRILLING TURN <strong><em>BASED </em></strong>BATTLES\r\n\n<p>Bullet hell mechanics are tried and tired, aren't they? We got rid of those in favour of a cool TURN BASED BATTLE THING with TEAMBUILDING and PARTY MEMBER SYNERGIES and stuff. Huh? Ah. Yep. <em>THERE'S LIKE 7 PARTY MEMBERS.\u00a0</em>And they all work in weird unique ways.<br/>Also included is some sort of TALK MECHANIC... Talking to enemies?\u00a0What the FUCK?</p>\n\n\n<p>Talking to enemies influences the course of battle in FUNNY and UNPREDICTABLE ways. Maybe* it's even necessary in certain situations...? Just play the damn game.</p>\n<p><em>(widespread videogame critic consensus describe the game as \"the dark souls of indie games\"\u00a0if you never use the talk mechanic. I wouldn't trust those guys, though.)</em></p>\n\n\r\nSERIOUSLY FUNNY WORDS\r\n\n\n<p>Oh my god, did that guy really say that!? Ahahaha... (I haven't chosen the screenshot yet as i write this caption) Oh my GOD I would never expect to see THAT GUY in an UNDERTALE SEQUEL THING\u00a0of all things....</p>\n\r\nSERIOUSLY FUNNY WORLDS\r\n\n<p>Oh? OHOHOH? What's going on in here? A library on FIRE?\u00a0A bunch of walking buckets of LAVA? A sign forbidding CONGA LINES?\u00a0 There's so many new areas not seen before...\u00a0Yet.... I had to render this gif three times before it stayed under the 3MB upload limit.....</p>\n\r\nENDINGS? CONTENT? SECRETS? GOTCHA BRO\r\n\n<p>PACIFIST, GENOCIDE? Pfft. Hah. *Burp sound effect*\u00a0Nah dude. You're gonna have to go for MEGABLOOD or something..? Huh?? Oh, there's also SECRETS. And FUN stuff. And a TON OF OTHER STUFF???? CONTENT??????\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>A FRIGGEN FISHING MINIGAME?????? AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH????????</p>\n\r\nCRITICS LOVE IT????\r\n\n\r\nTra la la. Coming out very very soon.\r\n<p>(...You might want to play the prequel first, although it's not strictly necessary.)</p>\n<p><em>(Actually, legally I think I\u00a0may have to specify that it is a fangame. IT'S NOT OFFICIAL.\u00a0IT'S A FANGAME. Undertale belongs to Toby Fox, all other respective brands and stuff belong to their respective owners. Parody law and fair use and all that, I\u00a0think. All talk of \"official\" is done for fun. As a joke. Funny. Jokes. Funny....\u00a0Sorry Toby. Please come to my house and we can play Undertale 2 together.
