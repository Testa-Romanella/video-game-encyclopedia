Plans were drafted to allow individual levels and updates to the game to be posted on the company Web site as an effective way of generating traffic there, and an end sequence suggesting a possible third installation was available for viewing. Before a third title in the series was developed, the promotion came to an end and both the original Chex Quest and Chex Quest 2 became effectively unavailable until they were posted for download on Internet fan pages several years later.</p>\n<p>In this sequel&#39;s plot, the Chex Warrior returns to his home planet and lands in Chex City only to discover that the Flemoid threat has reached his homeworld. There, the player battles through a terrestrial spaceport, a cinema (showing three videos each endlessly looping), a museum, and the eponymous city (Chextropolis), until reaching the sewers to confront an end boss named &quot;The Maximus&quot;.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1997-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T08:10:59", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Digital Cafe"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Ralston Foods"], "esrb_rating": null}
