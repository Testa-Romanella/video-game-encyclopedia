Your goal is to prevent The Man from waking up, as Tieface will die if he does. The game is made up of 15 levels, each representing a different dream.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs you navigate through the dream world, you must avoid being seen by The Man and manipulate objects and creatures around you to keep the dream looking normal and mundane. However, be prepared for the unexpected, as strange and surreal monsters may appear at any moment.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game is made with hand-painted watercolor artwork by solo game developer Alex Klexber. It is a top-down roguelite game with special abilities, objects and creatures collection, and vibrant, psychedelic art. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nDon't Wake God is a unique and challenging game that will keep you on your toes as you try to keep The Man asleep and Tieface alive.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T04:29:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c88/c881c741105b2eba1467a511419a55b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Alex Klexber"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Alex Klexber"], "esrb_rating": null}
