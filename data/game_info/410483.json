{"id": 410483, "slug": "tomb-keeper", "name": "Tomb Keeper", "name_original": "Tomb Keeper", "description": "<p>You're the tomb keeper in the city's graveyard. During night, weird things happen and a lot of damage is done to the tombstones! You must repair them before the gates open in the next morning, when the visitors arrive. For how long can you keep the graveyard in good conditions?<br/>Developed for the Global Game Jam 2020, with \"Repair\" as theme.<br/>https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/tomb-keeper-5<strong><strong>How to Play:<br/></strong></strong>Pay attention to the event that caused damage to the tomb. Each event has a specific tool that fixes it and\u00a0causes a different level of damage, ranging from 1 to 3. The higher the level, more time it takes to be fixed.<br/>As soon as the event is complete, click on the correct tool\u00a0at the bottom, and then, on the damaged tomb to fix it. If it's the correct tool, you'll see a timer next to the tomb, displaying the remaining time until it's fixed. At the end of the day, for each tomb left in Damage 3 level, you lose a life; if by the end of the day, all tombs are still being repaired, it's game over.</p><p><strong><strong>Art<br/></strong></strong>D\u00e9bora Tavares (debdebwen) - 2D artist and animator</p>\n<p><strong>Game Design</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Daniela Reigas (danikiedis) - gd/production<br/>Vitor Vieira - script assistant</p>\n<p><strong>Music</strong><br/>Willians Rodrigues</p>\n<p><strong>Programming</strong><br/>Gustavo Andrade (gustaandrade)<br/>Paulo Borges\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Sound FX</strong><br/>all SFX under CC license downloaded from freesound.org<br/>edited by danikiedis</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T05:42:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6cf/6cf2b0d8fa9d4e5d7e25d5c7c84f50de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["danikiedis"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
