Sadly, a last minute mistake in some UI settings made it unplayable. We introduced this bug 40s before deadline with no backups (keep back ups on itch.io people, we didn't know we could\u00a0!) so we couldn't roll back.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This project is there so we can still share it, and hopefully have some feedback. Thank you for playing.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Welcome to the city, where neons burn bright and crime never sleeps.</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>As the owner of an underground gambling parlour, your goal is to get as much money as you can from the passerby.</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>At the beginning of each turn, clients will roll one numeric dice and one relational dice.</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>When every client has played, it'll be your turn, as a the bank, to roll. You will then have to assign every dice to a client to beat their numeric / relational result.</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>But this a scam join right\u00a0? Before rolling your dice, you'll have to chose between several crooked dice. Choose well !\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>But beware... some clients have good eyes and your trickeries might raise suspicion.</em>\n</p>\n<p><strong>How to play :</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>SPACE to start the round and roll your dice.\r\n</li><li>A/Q : to assign a dice to the first client\r\n</li><li>Z/W : to assign a dice to the second client\r\n</li><li>E : to assign a dice to the third client.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><em>(Partially works with a controller. A to start and roll and X, Y, B to assign dice to clients).</em>\n</p>\n<p>There are 4 different faces on relational dice. Lower than, Greater Than, Equal and Different.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>If a client rolls 1 and Different (symbolized by &lt;&gt;) it means you need to roll some different than a 1. If you want to win against this hand, it would be a good idea to pick a crooked dice that only lands on even numbers !\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T20:17:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/911/911683861f9d6540b241123324172640.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LaFrite"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
