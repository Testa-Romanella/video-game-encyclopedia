But... first you have to get there. The thing is,\u00a0cars don't have steering wheels here in the\u00a0Future, and you're way off the grid. You'll have to build enough signal towers to tell your autonomous\u00a0Future car where to go!</p>\n<p>For GMTK Jam 2018 (theme: \"[genre] without [mechanic]\"), we started with driving without steering, which quickly evolved into a sort of tower defense without enemies.\u00a0It's a puzzle game where you have to guide a car (or two!)\u00a0to the goal using towers that tell it to turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/></strong>Nathan Hill - Art, Level Design, Sound<br/>Dallon Feldner - Programming, Level Design</p>\n<p>Daily Beetle Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\u00a0<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p>Jellyfish in Space Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\u00a0<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/787/78746996f0550e8a6b045a62931548c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Meanwhile Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
