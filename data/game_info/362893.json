Alley gangs more than alley-oops. And in your most honest moments, you gotta admit that football is just a little boring.<br />\nWake up and smell the blood. Spectrum HoloByte proudly throws the first punch in the Brutal Sports Series, a new line of futuristic sports simulations created by Millenium. Introducing Beastball, a rowdy ride through the football of tomorrow. Eight teams of man-made mutants, each with their own skills, duke it out for the league title and the Beastball Championship. Pit your favorite team against a human or computer opponent in the arena. And when the door slams shut, heads are gonna roll. Literally.<br />\nIt&#39;s 2089, and a strip of dirt in a pit is home to the game, a fast sport guaranteed to churn the blood. Superb animations and sounds capture all the hits of slambang comedy. And they&#39;re really slambang. Stomp the other guy? You catch a cannonball. Try to run out of bounds? You suck wall. Leap high for a kick and you get skewered. The object: put the ball in the goal. How you do it is up to you.<br />\nBeastball. Football with a new set of rules. No rules.<br />\n<em> One or two players.<br />\n</em> League or Championship play.<br />\n<em> Special weapons and skills for each team.<br />\n</em> Combatant regenerator after each match.<br />\n* Laughs. Blood.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-24T12:26:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc4/bc4c82552adcf7822c658d1a01fb8548.jpg", "website": "http://pikointeractive.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 420, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Jaguar"], "developers": ["Teque London", "Teque"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Piko Interactive", "Millenium Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
