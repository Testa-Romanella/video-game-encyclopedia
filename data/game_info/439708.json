There's time to look around for the right path while jumping up and up...but don't wait too long, especially when you're getting closer to the top cause the constantly following missile gains speed and goes faster and faster. \u00a0 <br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 Power ups will help our little friend, discover and use all of them as you jump up but beware of traps and enemies too, evade cannonballs and bullets...</p>\n<p>Zoom or Boom : Jumping Pirate, features:<br/></p>\n<p>........15 Levels....... wonderful worlds to explore. Jungles and waterfalls, under the ocean, lava land, Roman amphitheather, icy land or space, deserts with gigantic flowers...<br/>........Platforms, path to the top........ sometimes it feels like a puzzle or a labyrinth, our pirate will have to stop for a second and look for the fastest way up.<br/>........Power ups........ on each level something new to discover and use, fly with wings, on a rocket, use helicopter helmet, double jump, or jump into cannon and get shot up, fly as a cannonball...and much more.<br/>........Traps........ and enemies, don't get to close to guards with laser spears, or aliens with futuristic weapons walking back and forth, be faster than fire and flamethrowers...and more.<br/>........Missile........ it always follows our little red, jumping pirate, there is no escape from the missile, unless... he's faster in a race to the top.
