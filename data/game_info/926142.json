{"id": 926142, "slug": "nanas-adventure", "name": "Nana's Adventure", "name_original": "Nana's Adventure", "description": "<p>Nana's Adventure is a single-cart game for the PICO-8, playable by downloading the P8.PNG file below, downloading it off the PICO-8 BBS, or playing it in your web browser! As with most PICO-8 games, the keybinds are the arrow keys, Z, and X.<br/></p>\n<p>I made this game over the course of a month or so, it's a simple action-rpg type game with a variety of enemies and items. It was my first time making music in any context, so I hope it's not too bad lol.</p>\n<p>If you're downloading the P8.PNG file and you're interested in the code, I highly recommend downloading the spreadsheet \"stuff.xlsx\" as the code is much harder to understand without it due to having to strip comments.<br/><br/>Originally I had intended for a few more features such as  rare enemies with unique drops and such, but I was unable to fit it in due to the PICO-8's constraints. I pushed the limits as far as I could, anyway.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this little project I made! I had a lot of fun making it. Thanks to the PICO-8 devs and community for your extensive API documentation, tutorials, and example code.<br/></p>\n<p>-Bananacup<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T11:25:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/708/70858264762f2748ce7d160a9c281a7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bananacup"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
