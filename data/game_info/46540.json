It requires your full concentration and abstract thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game requires abstract thinking and imagination! Each full sphere is consisted of 4 parts - the middle part that doesn't move anywhere and 3 rings, each bigger than the other, that go on the middle part. Once you have matched any pattern in a single row, the rings of the same color get deleted and you can reuse their previous spaces.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour goal is to build spheres with rings and match the line of the same color. It is harder than it sounds. As you progress your levels get harder and harder and new colors come into play. Collect points, build spheres and complete the wonderful puzzle that is RINGO\u04d8\u0376I\u042f 2.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/544/544439f99f73a70f3f8eb0fa9f7cf573.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Netfork Studios"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Silicon Echo"], "esrb_rating": null}
