One day she gains consciousness outside a curious shop, with no memory of how she arrived there. She learns from the proprietor of the shop that she decided to sell her life experiences, that is, her memories. Now she can\u2019t remember what happened in the last three days. At all.</p>\n<p>With her newfound credits, Maeko could choose to buy back her memories -- to learn what really happened to her -- or maybe just spend it all on a top-of-the-line audio system. It\u2019s up to the player to decide what Maeko remembers \u2026 and what she forgets.</p>\n<p><em>All writing, art, and audio, created in 72 hours. Visual novel engine also created from scratch.<br/></em></p>\n<p><strong>This is the original submission build. You\u00a0can find\u00a0a\u00a0bugfix version of the game, playable online here:\u00a0</strong>https://daring-owl-studios.itch.io/maekos-memories-bugfix</p>\n<p><strong>Note: </strong>The first day of the game is playable (and you can also access Maeko\u2019s lost memories, if you manage your currency). We will return to update the game with more days, as we originally envisioned.
