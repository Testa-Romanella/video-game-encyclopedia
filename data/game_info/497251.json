It was created within a week and the prompt for this week was to create a game using only one button<br/><br/>To play the game all you need is the space bar! You press down to try to intimidate your homie ( and to stop the line on the top bar from moving) and you let go of the space bar to try and go in for a smooch!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>All the art and code I did myself, but the music were samples I mixed together and the audio files are from freesound.org and NYU Game Center's giant audio resource folder for students. Will properly credit everything within a day or two.</p>\n<p>Last little note I want to add is that the screen looks the way it does because I was mainly testing this out as a mobile game to better understanding how building a game for an android device works, so my apologies if the screen feels a tad weird.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T05:10:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/885/88550d90aa85ee0c4ae1d88f1153d252.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gensuta"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
