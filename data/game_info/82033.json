{"id": 82033, "slug": "mahdrop", "name": "MahDrop", "name_original": "MahDrop", "description": "Random shapes made up of four Mahjong tiles each will drop from the top of the screen. The objective of the game is to move and rotate these shapes (with the provided buttons) to arrange them in horizontal lines of ten blocks without gaps. When such a line is created, it disappears, and any block above the deleted line will fall to the newly freed up space. If the line contains tiles that form groups of three of the same title or a sequence of tiles, each of the groups will score additional points.  The game will continue until you stop the game, or when the block are filled to the top of the screen and you have no more moves. At which point you may decide to publish your score to the Game Center Leaderboard by tapping on the score to bring up the submission menu.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T08:42:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a65/a65c4df6887beaca8a03260f9f8c864d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["POK"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Pok Wong"], "esrb_rating": null}
