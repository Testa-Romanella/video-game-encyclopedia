As a spy, penetrate the labyrinth of lies and sinister secrets of the scheming merchants of Metriciens. As a sorcerer, barter in mysteries, spells and ancient lore with the immortal wizard Estragon. <br/>Amass wealth, honours and power that will take you on voyages to uncharted lands. <br/>This game is set in the prosperous kingdom of Golnir, a land made wealthy by its rich agriculture. There are many quests, including slaying a dragon for the Baroness Ravayne, searching for magical artefacts for the wizard Estragon, bringing to justice a murderer on behalf of his victim&amp;#39;s ghost, finding the Key of Stars to gain access to a treasure-filled tomb in the Forest of the Forsaken, and making a map of the treacherous northern mountains. <br/><br/>--- A note on this game, from the original authors --- <br/><br/>&amp;quot;We are delighted to see the release of a new instalment in the FABLED LANDS iOS <br/>app series by Megara Entertainment. Now players can adventure in a whole new kingdom with its own folklore, characters, history, politics and places of danger and mystery&amp;quot;. <br/><br/>--- Dave Morris &amp;amp; Jamie Thomson --- <br/><br/>Reviews: <br/><br/>\u00ab This looks a blast from the past! \u00bb <br/>\u00ab The series is incredible, and probably will be the closest thing to a real pen and paper RPG experience that ever makes it to an iOS device \u00bb <br/>\u00ab The app itself is brilliant. Graphics are glorious, and the quality is top notch. Obviously, the writing is amazing, and is probably the best 2D RPG available on iOS \u00bb. <br/>\u00ab Great! This game is a must-have in my book. I played for about 3 hours straight, and I can&amp;#39;t really put this game into solid words without giving things way, but let me put it this way... The game is open world. You can do whatever you want \u00bb. <br/>\u00ab This game feels more immersive and fun than the others games in the genre \u00bb. <br/><br/>More screenshots of the game are available at www.megara-entertainment.com", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:28:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/208/20812ddea8885cdccecf6390efd96264.jpeg", "website": "http://megara-entertainment.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Megara Entertainment"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Megara Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
