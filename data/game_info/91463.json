No restrictions. No giant omni-directional Treadmill!</li>\n<li>Pure Physics based object control.</li>\n<li>Stable, and intelligent logic makes directional control always feel right.</li>\n<li>So many possible applicable game types.</li>\n<li>So much scope for expansion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<br/>\r\n\tI'm constantly looking for ways to better this system so I will try to expand and implement any suggestions from the comments!\r\n\r\n<p>\n<strong>Try it and see how it feels!</strong>\n</p>\n<br/>\r\nLike what you've seen?
