{"id": 787612, "slug": "world-seed-2", "name": "World Seed", "name_original": "World Seed", "description": "World Seed is a procedurally generated sandbox MMORPG with roguelike features. The main focus of the game is build-diversity &amp; character progression.<br/><br/>\"The six gods of the universe battle for singularity and you must fight back to preserve balance.\"<br/><br/>In this game you'll become stronger by crafting &amp; upgrading your equipment or simply roll the dice and hope for some epic loot to drop as you slay enemies.<br/><br/>It's a harsh world to survive in, so make sure to bring some friends along when in need of help.<h3>Freedom of Choice</h3><br/><strong>Your strategy is valid</strong><br/>World Seed won't push you in linear line of progression. We believe great games are the ones that offer the player to choose their own path, guided by the rules of the game.<br/><br/><strong>Build diversity</strong><br/>There are few restrictions on how you build your characters. We're actively working towards keeping most builds and strategies viable.<br/><br/><strong>Distance from center</strong><br/>There is no traditional leveling system in World Seed. The further from the center you travel, the harder the game gets.<br/><br/>Defeating high-level creatures will reward you with equipment of the same gearscore.<br/><br/><strong>Tier progression</strong><br/>The rarity and quality of your <strong>items</strong> are based on item tier. There are 10 tiers in the game represented by roman numerals.<br/><br/>Every tier of an <strong>equipment</strong> unlocks new tier perks for you to choose from.<h3>Infinite World</h3>World Seed features an infinite world which is procedurally generated. Its content is renewed every hour.<h3>Crafting</h3>World Seed offers two methods of crafting: your typical \u201cx materials to craft y,\u201d but also upgrading. Upgrading items in World Seed is done by combining three equal items to a better one, yielding +1 in tier level.<br/><br/>Most items in World Seed can be upgraded this way. This offers a unique feature which prevents items from becoming obsolete as you progress further into the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T05:45:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbb/fbb81a968b02fb37be1dfdae1521cbfd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 145}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kortes"], "genres": ["RPG", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ape Egg"], "esrb_rating": null}
