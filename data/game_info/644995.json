You can compete with friends, create and join rooms, and become terrified as you hide-slap-block your way to victory.<h3>Key Feature</h3><br/>FPS: SlapBR is like that of an FPS where your weapons are your hands. The only two options you have are to slap and block. <br/><br/>3D Audio &amp; JumpScares: Audio in SlapBR is immersive and will scare you. This includes flashlight clicks, punches, death effects, block effects, and canons each time someone is killed, not to mention the jumpscares when in proximity of another player. <br/><br/>Battle Royale Quickness: The game operates as a fast paced BR. Each round lasts only 300 seconds until the large borders close in on the forest. Once the game is other, hop right back in for another round.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T02:43:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f7/7f713c93b3b544f806d62831de03e7e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Kircher", "John Kircher"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["John Kircher"], "esrb_rating": null}
