With that in mind, it's not particularly unique, the story hinges on something that couldn't happen, and the writing could probably be improved, but it is some kind of a game that I can publish. <br/>Total development time comes to about 10.5 hours.</p>\n<p>The game unfortunately only supports Windows.<br/></p>\n<p>This game is provided for free. Donations are not required, but are appreciated.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-01T05:01:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c50/c50639beeff36022015766ca95d5142e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DuphusDigital"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
