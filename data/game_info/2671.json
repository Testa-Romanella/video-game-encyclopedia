Engaging, thought-provoking gameplay that&amp;#39;s different every time, but fast enough to take in bite-sized chunks.<br/><br/>Tap or hold to move; move into enemies to engage them in melee, or tap spells to cast them.  Tap your character&amp;#39;s portrait to view your current stats, and even though character death is permanent, it&amp;#39;s also half the fun!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:28:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83d/83dd046953d4e6bea59833bb1d8bf3d8.jpeg", "website": "http://cardinalquest.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["tametick"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Ido Yehieli"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
