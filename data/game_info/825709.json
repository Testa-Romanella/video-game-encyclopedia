I have created another small, fun game in Unity so you guys can enjoy life!! The game is totally FREE to download for everyone!!\u00a0I worked really long hours debugging and writing my own scripts, some with Unity, but overall was a really good experience for me!! I learned a lot of new things like passing on music from one scene to another and more stuff like that!! I can't wait for what you guys think about my game so please do leave a rating after trying my game!! Thank you everyone for all the support for the last few months and I will be creating more games in the near future!!!
