You must keep those thoughts and nightmarish figments of her imagination away from you, since once they get too close, Susan will wake up, and she\u2019ll have the same dream again.<br/><br/>You must think, and try out different ideas if you are to survive all of Susan\u2019s nightmares. You'll have to crawl through claustrophobic vents, complete puzzles, and survive in a nightmarish, hand-painted world of Susan's imagination.<h3>Crawl through claustrophobic vents</h3>Luckily this is still just a dream... however this means that sections of this cold dark, maze changes over time.<br/><br/><h3>Stay alert constantly!</h3>Monsters will creep up this hallway if you are not concentrating.<br/><br/><h3>Keep all of those nasty thoughts and memories away from you!</h3>Use 'cameras' to look into Susan's memories to keep track of where all the monsters are lurking. With only a small battery for your torch, a creature that moves towards you whenever you look behind yourself, and with the ability to only close off one vent at a time, you must carefully watch these unwanted memories to avoid wasting your resources... or getting jump scared!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-07T11:11:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/430/4305199dfa0a4c91485d4dbfa7396ff9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 378, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Ethan Harris-Austin"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ethan Harris-Austin"], "esrb_rating": null}
