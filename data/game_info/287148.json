All we need is\u2026</p>\n<p>\tDemon Lord: IS WHAT?</p>\n<p>\tWizard: Uhh, w-we\u2019ll need quite a few things actually before we can t-take over the world.</p>\n<p>\tDemon Lord: THEN GO GET THEM.</p>\n<p>\tWizard: T-these things are scattered across the mortal realm. I can\u2019t exactly go there, you know?</p>\n<p>\tDemon Lord: THEN GET ONE OF YOUR MINIONS TO GO GET THEM FOR YOU.</p>\n<p>\tWizard: Maybe a skeleton\u2026 No, that\u2019s too big.... Oh, then maybe a goblin\u2026 No they\u2019ll stand out.</p>\n<p>\tDemon Lord: SUMMON ME A CAT. THOSE ARE SMALL, APPROACHABLE, AND CUDDLEABLE, RIGHT? THAT\u2019S WHAT WE NEED.</p>\n<p>\tWizard: E-excuse me? A cat?

Now we can begin the mission.</p>\n<p>\tDemon Lord: WHAT DO WE NEED TO GET?</p>\n<p>\tWizard: Well, to create your staff we\u2019ll need several enchanted gems, a large quantity of gold, and quite a few items to assist in the manufacturing process because creating the highest quality equipment requires the highest quality of tools. Therefore, as the weapon gains more and more unique enchantments, the more tools we\u2019ll need to perform the experimental procedure required to obtain demon-tier enchantments. While we already have the stones and most of the gold\u2026 We don\u2019t have any tools.</p>\n<p>\tCat: meow</p>\n<p>\tDemon Lord: YOU\u201dRE BORING THE CAT. JUST TELL IT WHAT TO GET ALREADY.</p>\n<p>\tWizard: Oh, right! I need your cat to go confront Gardenia, the goddess of the fields to\u2026</p>\n<p>\tCat: *whimper*</p>\n<p>\tDemon Lord: CATS CAN\u2019T KILL GODS, WIZ.</p>\n<p>\tWizard: I really just need the shovel she gardens with, it\u2019s durable enough for me to scoop the cursed coals and put them under the furnace. It also has the enchantments necessary to touch cursed objects without getting affected\u2026</p>\n<p>\tCat: meow</p>\n<p>\tDemon Lord: THE CAT\u2019S TIRED OF WAITING.
