The city is based on 1:1 real life Tokyo City surrounded by\u00a0Yamanote-sen, though none of the iconic architecture has been added to the game yet.\u00a0Have some fun driving, hopefully.</p>\n<p>The full game expects to feature:</p>\n<ul><li>A story that can be finished within about 2 hours for the introduction of Tokyo City geography.</li><li>Probably a track list of 20 songs for you to chill drive in Tokyo City without any goal.</li><li>Daily racing challenge for endless suffering.</li></ul>\n<p>Don't expect the end result\u00a0to be something like AAA driving game where there's amazing destruction and stuff. But feel free to tell me what you'd like to see in it.<br/></p><p>Control Scheme:</p><ul><li>Throttle - W/\u2191/RT/R2</li><li>Brake - S/\u2193/LT/L2</li><li>Steer - AD/\u2190\u2192/Left Stick</li><li>Handbrake - Space/B/O</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T06:09:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e2/2e20195707c39e8853e5703a51f039bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dklassic"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
