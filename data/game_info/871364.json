New pickup - Acid Shield/Shield - I think I would like to create a new power up that will allow the player to be shielded from damage from acid for a certain amount of time. This will involve coding the functionality and probably an aesthetic component, as I will likely create a new icon for it.\u00a0 This will allow me to create new challenges and obstacles for the player - like hiding a door key in the acid that they must find to complete the level!</p>\n<p>2. New player character - I had ap lot of fun with the visuals last time so I think I will probably reskin the player character again (drawn by me) to give it\u00a0 a new feel and backstory! I also thought it would be fun to introduce player select functionality - allowing players to choose if they would like to play as the default character, or my new one.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3. Completely new level - I will be creating at least one (but probably multiple) levels with new challenges and scenery. One will definitely incorporate my new pickup, requiring the player to swim through acid (or traverse some other dangerous terrain) to get to the door key. I also thought that incorporating multiple doors and keys to reach the finish would be a fun challenge.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Created By: Erin Sawyer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T06:04:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01f/01f50790821453e676ffedde7e5bf465.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Erinsa"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
