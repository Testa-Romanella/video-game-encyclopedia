The WASM-4 gamejam is a perfect opportunity to try things out, I think.</p>\n<p>I learned a bunch in this jam, and there's a lot I would do differently (technically) in the next game I make. Both the biggest feat and the biggest issue was the meta-scripting language I wrote all the fights and dialogue in. Each enemy on screen carries their own script context, with it's own stack and everything.</p>\n<p>It was impossible to add all the features I\u00a0 wanted, and it isn't nearly as polished in some places as I'd like it to be...\u00a0but overall, I am very happy with what I made during these 10 days.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All art, music, and gameplay was created during the jam.</p>\r\nNotable tools used:\r\n<ul><li>Aseprite</li><li>FL Studio (for composition)</li><li>w4on for getting music in the game</li></ul>\n\n<p>The game is released as\u00a0CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T07:12:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6f/a6f636c59e7a67d930bc1aecd7fab73f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JerwuQu"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
