In this prototype pre-alpha release, you're dropped into a Cathedral that has a few tricks up its sleeve.....Make your way to the statue of the holy angel and see how your points stack up!</p>\n<p><strong>ESTIMATED SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Desktop PC</li><li>Windows 7 64-bit or later</li><li>Quad-core Intel or AMD processor, 2.5 GHz or faster</li><li>NVIDIA GeForce 470 GTX or AMD Radeon 6870 HD series card or higher</li><li>8 GB RAM</li></ul>\n<p>-----</p><p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p><p>W - <em>Move forward</em></p><p>A - <em>Move left</em></p><p>S -<em> Move backward</em></p><p>D - <em>Move right</em></p><p>Left-Click - <em>Fire weapon</em></p><p>Spacebar - <em>Jump</em></p><p>Mouse - <em>Control viewport/viewing angle</em></p><p>F - <em>Open doors (when prompted)<br/></em></p><p>Escape - <em>Open Pause Menu (to Resume Game or Quit Game)</em></p><p><strong><em>NOTE: Limited\u00a0controller support enabled.\u00a0Currently no\u00a0button for\u00a0opening doors</em></strong></p><p><em><strong>NOTE: Escape will open the pause menu, but currently will not close the menu. This is a known bug and will be fixed by next alpha build.</strong></em></p><p>-------<br/></p>\n<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> This game is in pre-alpha state and has had no passes for optimzation. The final game should run on less powerful systems than the estimated system requirements dictate at the moment.</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>Target Shooter will be my very first game using the Unreal Engine 4, and is my first experience making a game with the C++/Blueprints system. There will be 3 levels in the finalized game, each of which may be distrubuted separately here on itch.io, unless I find a great way to optimize all three levels at under 1 GB!</p>\n<p>Have fun, and please let me know what you think! There's no estimated time of release for the full game, but items on the \"must do\" list for beta and release include:</p>\n<ul><li>Engine optimization</li><li>UI/UX upgrades (A start screen, level select, and better font/positioning)</li><li>Logic re-evaluation (timer glitches, score glitches, formulas, etc)</li><li>Blueprint behavior (finalized door automation, separate target behavior,\u00a0etc)</li><li>Controller support</li><li>Windows, Mac, and Linux support</li></ul>\n\n<p>Game on! We'll see you in the next level prototype!</p>\n<p>- Wes \"KamiDaHobo\" Gardner</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e37/e3720af8ec6bfeebda3c20eb9e280f47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 210, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wesley Gardner"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
