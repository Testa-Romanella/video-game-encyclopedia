Each wall has a gap cut out in a different body shape.\n    </p><p>\n      Hold a Joy-Con\u2122 in each hand and move your arms to match the shape and \n      slip through the gap! Sounds easy? It is at first, but the gaps get \n      smaller and the walls get faster. How long can you survive before you're \n      plunged into the slime? Practice alone or play together for some serious \n      fun!\n    </p><p>\n</p><p>\n      4 types of games!\n    </p><p>\n      Classic, High Speed, Memory and Reverse will keep you on your toes.\n    </p><p>\n</p><p>\n      Three game modes!\n    </p><p>\n      Challenge\n    </p><p>\n      Practice and aim for the highest score.\n    </p><p>\n</p><p>\n      Versus\n    </p><p>\n      Split screen head-to-head action! The pressure mounts as the walls keep \n      coming!\n    </p><p>\n</p><p>\n      Arms &amp; Legs\n    </p><p>\n      Control the movement of the left or right arm, or the left or right leg \n      with a single Joy-Con. Each time the round finishes the limb you control \n      changes (but you're not told to which one). Quickly find your arm/leg \n      and move it to fit through the gap as the wall approaches. The winner is \n      the person who lasts the longest.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "https://www.rainyfrog.com/en/game/puzzle_wall", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Rainy Frog"], "esrb_rating": null}
