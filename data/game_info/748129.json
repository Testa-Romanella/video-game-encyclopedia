I may add to this in the future.<br/><br/>It has an industrial theme and you play as a robot called Steve, travelling across overhead catwalks that would be in a large factory warehouse. There are lots of obstacles in the way along the catwalks which Steve must avoid. Also, don't fall off!<br/><br/>You can collide with obstacles 3 times as your health reduces until it reaches 0. Falling off is an instant failure. Try to get a high score!<br/><br/>I cannot guarantee compatibility with all devices. I apologise if it does not work correctly on your device. <br/>Not compatible with IOS.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T15:11:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a1/1a18c2fa3f88bf98ef0ce3226a7c2dd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Web"], "developers": ["BrandonN"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
