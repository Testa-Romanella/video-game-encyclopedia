Complete as many minigames as you can before the 120 second time limit runs out.</p>\n<p><strong>How do I get him out of my house?</strong></p>\n<p>Dr. Frizzly's game engine license has time limit of a few minutes - so rounds of <em>Dr. Frizzly's Mega Minigame</em> Collection is limited to 120 seconds. To compensate, Dr. Frizzly speeds up the\u00a0 minigames for the short rounds.</p>\n<p><strong>How do I control his game?</strong></p>\n<p>The game can be played with only a mouse, a touchscreen may be supported but I didn't test it on mobile.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>What do I win?<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Nothing! You win nothing! Just kidding, there's a leaderboard of the top 25 players. If you win a high score, you can also put your own name. You can view the leaderboard on the main menu.</p>\n<p><em>Note: If the leaderboard server is down, the button is disabled.</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits &amp; Licenses<br/></strong></p>\n<p>The cutscenes, the logo, the music, the 3D models, and the sprites are done by me.</p>\n<p>The game engine used is Godot, \u00a9 2007-2023 Juan Linietsky, Ariel Manzur and contributors.</p>\n<p>The font used in the logo is Secular One, designed\u00a0by\u00a0Michal Sahar and\u00a0licensed under the\u00a0Open Font License. <br/></p>\n<p>Blobby is made by WeightedCreepy.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T09:06:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a0/8a05de9fc5c46b74f6b83ed5e15847a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["redstrate"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
