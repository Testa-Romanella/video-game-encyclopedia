While developing the game across multiple platforms the following were the absolute minimum specs where the game ran smoothly. It may be possible that\u00a0<em><strong>Fortress\u00a0Tapper</strong></em> will run on hardware below these specifications but they reflect the least powerful hardware available to the developer.</p><p>1.4 GHZ Dual Core (x86/ x64 or similar or ARM V7 for Mobile Devices)<br/>Windows 7 SP1, Windows 10 or Android 4.1\u00a0<br/>256MB RAM<br/>100MB Disk Space</p>\n\n<p><em>Wait Why Are You Charging\u00a0</em><em>For</em><em>\u00a0a Simple Game Like This?</em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Simply put, I view the release of\u00a0Fortress\u00a0Tapper (and its planned future patches) as my first serious game development effort. Up until this point all of my additions to Itch and other prototypes have been learning exercises but the time &amp; effort that have gone into Fortress Tapper should be worth something. Players interested in trying the game for free can also grab the ad supported version on Google Play.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25f/25f5ac3ae4144d7a5ec14013f24841dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Kitsune86"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
