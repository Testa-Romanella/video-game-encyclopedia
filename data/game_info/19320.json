Recette Lemongrass finds herself in charge of an item shop built into her house, in order to pay back a loan her father took and then skipped out on - and Tear, her newfound fairy \"companion\", won't take no for an answer! As Recette, you have to decide how you'll get your stock - either through playing the markets in town or going out into the wild with an adventuring friend and thrashing beasts until they give up the goodies - how much to sell things for, what the shop should look like, and how to best go about getting the money Tear needs to pay off the loan. If you can't come up with the money... well, hope you like living in a cardboard box.</p>\n<p>Key features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Manage all aspects of an item shop \u2013 from stock to interior design!</li>\n<li>Explore randomized dungeons \u2013 never quite the same twice!</li>\n<li>Multiple adventurers to choose from when dungeon-diving \u2013 no two play the same!</li>\n<li>Plenty to do after beating the game \u2013 challenge yourself with Survival Mode or play to your heart's delight in Endless Mode!</li>\n<li>Engaging story, localized by Carpe Fulgur \u2013 get to know the people of Pensee!</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": 82, "released": "2010-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-17T22:44:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98d/98d2b72cd2bbbe1ca19a29b9707758a1.jpg", "website": "http://www.carpefulgur.com/recettear/", "rating": 3.85, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 48, "owned": 913, "beaten": 48, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 54, "playing": 8}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 80, "suggestions_count": 352, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 80, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EasyGameStation"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Carpe Fulgur"], "esrb_rating": null}
