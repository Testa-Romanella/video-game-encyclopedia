Here there is an opportunity to collect cards and, with a click of the mouse, achieve the necessary and only correct result. There are many girls in the game with whom you will be glad to make acquaintance. Immerse yourself in the game world with dialogues and beautiful animations.<br />\nHaving chosen a girl, you yourself choose what to do. The game allows communication in the form of dialogue or actions so closely related to the hentai genre. Love is the logical conclusion of many clicks, and introductory communication will give an opportunity to get the girl&#39;s sympathy, because it is important to know who she is and what she does. Each girl is unique not only in appearance, she has her own hobbies, work and character traits. Not everyone likes cats, some like a great fight in the ring from the TV or just a quiet rest. Everything is in your hand, namely the mouse and a few clicks!<br />\nAt Vanilla Click, girls don&#39;t like boring and lazy, they challenge you!<br />\n-A big update is coming with tons of content, voice acting, gameplay and more!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-10T10:54:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a66/a66f75c7224f5e06081ef2bddb846f63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Baal Games"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Baal Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
