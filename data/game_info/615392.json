Your eyes shine bright. But do your eyes see the light? Do your eyes know what\u2019s right?\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>The voice echoes with an eerie, nightmarish whisper all about. The darkness it comes from and the darkness it retreats to envelops you utterly and completely. There is no release from this place. All you can do is stay and listen. Stay and listen and hope things go your way. And although you dread it and wish for nothing more than it to leave, the voice continues, its disturbing, distressing tone not wavering for even a second:   </p>\n<p><em>\u201cYou wished it. So here you are. Your second chance.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>The voice pauses again and you can\u2019t help but wonder if it expects an answer. Try all you might, however, you can\u2019t seem to get any words out. You are just sitting there, waiting. Alone. Vulnerable. <strong>Afraid</strong>. Your only option is to wait in dread-filled apprehension for your disembodied tormentor to continue its sick and twisted game. The pause is uncomfortable. It\u2019s upsetting. When will it speak again? Will it speak again? Is this your punishment? No. That can\u2019t be right. Why would you be punished? What for?   </p>\n<p>In an attempt to return yourself to calm, rational thought, you consider what <em>has</em> already been said. But when did you ask for a second chance? You\u2019ve never needed one before. And what about your eyes? You can\u2019t feel them there; let alone knowing how and why they shine. And how can they know what\u2019s right? What is right when there\u2019s nothing? Besides, you\u2019ve always known what\u2019s right\u2026 right?\r\n  </p>\n<p>Right?\r\n  </p>\n<p>Logically, you couldn\u2019t have a second chance without already messing up the first chance. Then what is it you\u2019ve done? You haven\u2019t a clue. Not an inkling of information can even trickle its way through your mind. If you even have a mind, that is. Surely you must do if you continue to think. But, then, if you cannot feel anything anywhere, is it there? Perhaps your entire body is numb. That way, you wouldn\u2019t feel the parts that are still there. Yet, try as you might, you cannot touch nor see any other part of your body. And a simple numb feeling won\u2019t explain that away.   </p>\n<p>Your loss in your thoughts lowers your guard somewhat, despite your slowly-rising anxiety, and the voice seemingly takes advantage of this. <em>\u201cYou aren\u2019t alive,\u201d</em> it begins. You start at hearing something so impactful on your very being so suddenly. <em>\u201cNor are you dead,\u201d</em> it continues, wrapping you in more shrouded mysteries and boundless blackness. <em>\u201cNo, you\u2019re somewhere in between,\u201d</em> it says more hastily, almost as if to hide the true, original tone it had used. Was it unsure? Was it attempting to intimidate you in a place it doesn\u2019t even know itself?\r\n  </p>\n<p><em>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to understand,\u201d</em> it whispers once more, reverting to the lashing, omnipresent echo that you feel you already know all too well. <em>\u201cNot that you need to,\u201d</em> it adds with what almost sounds like spite. With so much confusion and fretful unease, your brain cowers to a place you can\u2019t reach. Your fear mentally freezes you. Waiting. Waiting. Waiting.   </p>\n<p>Only waiting for what\u2019s to come.\r\n  </p>\n<p><em>\u201cThere\u2019s someone waiting for you. So go. And show me you know what\u2019s right.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>Without any warning save for the voice\u2019s last words, a brilliant white flash surrounds you, whipping at your every sense. They are overloading, yet they are still. They hurt, yet you are numb. Your head whirls faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster\u2026 If you weren\u2019t numb, you\u2019d be feeling the most nauseous you have ever been. The light blinds your eyes and nose, deafens you, dulls your touch, scorches your tongue. It rises and rises and rises in your head, whipping and burning and screaming and lurching and writhing over and over and over and over and-\r\n  </p>\n<p>Nothing.\r\n  </p>\n<p>You awaken. You open your eyes. Your real eyes. You can feel them. You can feel you. You look down and see your body at long last. You glance about. A sparse, peaceful fog drifts slightly above the ground. Before you are six houses of some description. All brick-built. All doors wooden. In fact, all the buildings appear identical. You wonder why. But your heart drops at the next realisation you make: you are walled in. All the windows face inwards. The surrounding walls are far too tall and smooth to clamber up.   </p>\n<p>Now what? How do you escape? What about what that voice said? What\u2019s right in an empty place like this? What\u2019s wrong? Why did you feel so much agony when you came here? So many questions race around your head with ever-growing speed. That is, until you look ahead. There it is. A floating body. No legs. One arm. Ominous, red, glowing eyes. It beckons you with its arm. And then it waits. It just\u2026 floats there.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>So, what do you do?</p>\n<p>----END OF STORY----</p>\n\n\n<p>---Credits---</p>\n<p>Mixamo - animations for the ghost and player</p>\n<p>Dafont - font style for the UI (menus)</p>\n<p>textures.com - textures on all models (except player eyes and eyebrows)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T05:55:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5a/e5a4f8fcf7944b852afe4abb951a5cef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["J M K"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
