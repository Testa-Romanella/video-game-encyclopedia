As individuals... as a species... what awaits us at the end of this road? Is there an end? Was there an beginning? Does this road symbolize real life in the sense that there&#39;s no turning back? And how does pineapple juice fit into all this? Maybe I should just shut up, Buck Up And Drive!</p>\n<p>Features:<br />\n- Endless driving game inspired by arcade classics, with simple yet intense gameplay featuring a total slap in the face of realism. And a kick in the spleen, too!<br />\n- Procedurally generated track with multiple environments to visit, ranging from the somewhat realistic to the completely absurd. GO TO HELL!... literally!<br />\n- PINK. BACKFLIPPING. TRUCKS. ON THE FUCKING MOON.<br />\n- Go 1v1 against another player (or a CPU) in a fighting mode. With cars. I dunno either, I came up with it while in the shower.<br />\n- Customizable car decals through external image files. Put &quot;eggplants&quot; all over the cars, for all I care!<br />\n- Controls for both game modes are 8 directions and one button. Play one-handed, if you want! Keep your other hand for... holding orange juice! Yes!<br />\n- Available for both Windows and Ubuntu (other Linux distros may work).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-09T17:39:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5f/f5fb00799bee2ab28c4a7c0a93d567b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 49, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 26, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["F\u00e1bio Fontes"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["F\u00e1bio Fontes"], "esrb_rating": null}
