Nut people! \r\nPlay <em>Ococo Island</em> today!\r\n<p>This is my submission to the 5-Years-O-Bitsy jam. Category: <strong>tides</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some hints if you have difficulty with any of the puzzles:\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>WEST PATH (youngest brother/baiting the beast)</strong>:\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>You  will want to get the sandwich from Don Dat. Pay close attention to all  the dialogue you are given in this area, it will be useful in another  nearby area.\r\n</li><li>You will want to bait out the beast by the cave. Inspect all areas of this room for some hints on what to do.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>NORTH PATH (bean clan/sprout man's bar)</strong>:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>If you are having trouble finding all ten jacks, pay close attention in the area with a bridge over water.\r\n</li><li>If you can not defeat the Drunken Master, try to ask around the bar for help.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>EAST PATH (maze/ziggurat):\r\n</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>To  navigate the maze, you will need to take the correct route on all four  screens. Pay attention to which path is the \"odd one out.\"\r\n</li><li>To  solve the puzzle of the ziggurat, read closely all hints in the main  chamber. Observe that the crank in the west room changes the  configuration of the orrery next to it.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>\"HELL TO PAY\" ENDING (not recommended for first playthrough)</strong>:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>There is a more difficult alternate path to take that will reveal the secret of the island. Here is one hint to get you started: there is a secret in the poko-poko field at the game's very beginning.\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T12:28:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e53/e53acde35b67b4198af8c6a12f062df8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["douerbat"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
