Once the chest is attached to the hook, you will hear a bell. Then it's time to reel the treasure back up to the ship!</p>\n<p>The orange meter on the top left represents the Captains oxygen. If it is depleted, your game is Over!!!.\u00a0<br/>You can refill his oxygen tank by picking up the H20 cans on the screen</p>\n<p>The level is won when the Treasure reaches the surface.</p>\n<p>Fish get faster as time progresses, they wull spawn more frequently, and the speed of the hook itself will also slow down.</p>\n<p>//////////////////////Other/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////<br/>//Empty atm</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db4/db4a9ccb6f7125314fe0fdd1bece44e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MatLezama"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
