This game will be personalised to each player by using back end data to keep a log of the players information as well as how they interact with the game world around them. This information will then change certain aspects of the game, making the experience more personalised and hopefully helping each person to realise aspects about their own personality. Data will be shown as a personality log at the end of the game for each person to see how the game judged them.</p>\n<p>This is the result of a third year Computer Game Arts game, showcasing a bigger idea of using games and back-end data, including social media, to create an immersive and thrilling game.
