I mainly worked on it in the last two days and\u00a0I didn't have enough time to implement all my plans\u00a0nor polish it, and I intend on doing so after the jam.<br/></p>\n<p>The game also\u00a0\u00a0references the book \"Animal Farm\" by George Orwell heavily so if you haven't read it (Read It! It's a good book) some of the story might not be clear to you.</p>\n\n<p>Controles:</p>\n<p>'m' - mute music</p>\n<p>Left arrow/'a' - move left</p>\n<p>Right arrow/'d' - move right</p>\n<p>Up arrow/'w'/space - jump (hold for long jump)</p>\n<p>Left mouse button\u00a0- throw a bone in the direction of the mouse.</p>\n\n<p>Story: (Also integrated in the game)</p>\n<p>Some jerk read \"Animal Farm\" to his pigs and they decided to start a revolution. They conquered the world and pushed humans into the dark. You were sent by the humans, in a costume of some kind of animal, in order to get close to the ruling pig and kill him.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Programming - Nitai99</p>\n<p>Graphics - Dog by sararoom(Depositphotos), wheat inspired by Minecraft, character inspired by pixelatedcowboy and PixelArtMaker, pig by 0justTuggi0, bone by pixelcrafts, Stalin inspired by PixelArtMaker.\u00a0All other art is\u00a0by Nitai99.</p>\n<p>Audio - Landing sound by Mental Sanity Off. \u00a0All other audio is by Nitai99.</p>\n\n<p>Programs Used:</p>\n<p>Processing, GIMP, Audacity, Bfxr, Bosca Ceoil.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d1/3d1349547aa814efbf09fe153cc7f222.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Nitai99"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
