The goal of this was to use Nav mesh components to have our player and enemies that chase the player avoid obstacles in their path, finding the shortest distance to the desired point.\u00a0 In addition, are key pickups that can be acquired to open doors with animations, as well as doors that teleport you to the next level.\u00a0 Overall this was a fun project to see the built-in AI tools and I am excited to see what comes next\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T10:14:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a4/5a4554b2a7dc9afe33b9d7a5ab5e4363.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Shugo16"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
