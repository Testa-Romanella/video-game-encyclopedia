{"id": 236761, "slug": "the-final-frontier", "name": "The Final Frontier", "name_original": "The Final Frontier", "description": "In this twin-stick shooter roguelike, you will constantly be attacked by waves of enemies becoming more powerful the longer you survive. Upon starting the game for the first time, you will have access to the Fighter ship that shoots short bursts of energy. Destroying enemies rewards you with points that level you up after reaching a threshold at the end of combat. When starting the first round, you will feel as near equals to the most basic of enemies, and other than strategy, you are. After a few level-ups, you will start to feel that fighters are not much of a threat anymore, but by that time more powerful foes would have shown themselves. With a constant loop of fighting until death, you should eventually become accustomed to the gameplay and ready to take on the first major boss at round 50. This feat is not for the faint-hearted and will be a triumph in itself.<br/><br/>UNLOCKABLES<br/>After defeating the first boss, you unlock both the next player character, the bomber, which uses rockets as its weapon, and Ascension level 1 for the fighter that makes enemies more difficult and spawn more. Ascension levels can rise with each successful run on that ascension level up to 10 and would be extremely impressive only for the best of the best.<br/><br/>WEAK SPOTS<br/>When encountering some more powerful enemies and the final boss, you will notice some dark red circles on them; Those are reactors and need to be destroyed for the enemy to fall. These reactors are within the borders of the enemy; Bullets, missiles, and lasers all leave holes in their target and will be necessary to reach the reactors of these enemies.<br/><br/>LEVEL UP<br/>After reaching the point to level up, you will be given three options to choose from to upgrade your ship. Some upgrades require others to be offered but are randomized with the pool available. This choice requires consideration because while upgrades will not deplete (excl. Shield), health does. A few important upgrades to success are dual and triple shot and speed. Some enemies shoot many blasts at once, and some use flak which both destroys your projectiles. Speed is also necessary to outrun and dodge incoming fire. Health is a rare commodity making dodging quite important.<br/>While you get to upgrade your ship, enemies have that same luxury. The further you get into the run, the more common an enemy will have upgrades that will make them more dangerous. <br/><br/>GAME FEATURES<br/>Twin-stick retro space shooter<br/>Continuous waves of enemies to fight off<br/>Ship level-up customization<br/>Scaling enemies and difficulty<br/>Enemy upgrades<br/>Steam leaderboards and stats<br/>CREDITS<br/>Thank you for the inspiration and design for a couple of the spaceship designs!
