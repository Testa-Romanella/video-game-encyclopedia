You start at the lowest level of the dungeon where it is so hard to see you need lanterns. Then you go to the cave where there are streams of water throughout and an interesting portal that changes your gravity. Once you get through that level you reach a section where you have to swim avoiding spikes and encountering fish friends along the way. Once you past that level and reach the surface you have to reach the top by making some impossible jumps. Finally once you have overcome all the obstacles you win and have beaten the game.</p>\n<p>Instructions\r\n</p>\n<p>Use the arrow keys to move on land and press the space button to jump. In water use WASD to move underwater. The portals change your gravity, the yellow one reverses it and the blue one returns it to normal. You can jump four blocks high and seven blocks long which is good to know you so know your limits. \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T15:53:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6a/f6ad00b7ffdcc6a7d64763a132af6df9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Spartan Game Labs"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
