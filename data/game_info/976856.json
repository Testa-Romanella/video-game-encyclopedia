The game will get updates, although not on a regular schedule.<h3>Description</h3>Embark on a platforming journey with Shadow Touched, a 2D platformer created from my long programming apprenticeship journey. This project, developed in almost two months, has evolved beyond its academic roots into a passion project that I am committed to expanding over time.<br/><br/><strong>Key Features:</strong><br/><ul><li> <strong>Unique Dimensional Gameplay:</strong> Take control of Twilight, the main character, and master the art of dimension-hopping. In the normal form, Twilight has a single jump, a dash, and a basic attack pattern. Switch to the shadow dimension for increased movement speed, higher jump height, an additional jump, and three powerful attack patterns with enhanced damage. Choose your form wisely to navigate the intricate levels and overcome challenges.<br/><br/></li><li> <strong>Strategic Platforming:</strong> Traverse diverse and meticulously designed levels that will test your platforming skills.<br/><br/></li><li> <strong>Formidable Foes:</strong> Encounter the formidable Knight, your primary adversary in the shadowy realms. Stay on your guard as these enemies will strike if you get too close. Use your dimensional powers to defeat them quickly!<br/><br/></li><li> <strong>Checkpoint System:</strong> Shadow Touched features a checkpoint system. If Twilight meets her end, she respawns at the last checkpoint touched and you can continue your adventure without losing progress. Do not let your lives reach zero though!<br/><br/></li><li> <strong> Power-ups:</strong> Shadow Touched features power-ups that enhance the player's gameplay.<br/><ul><li><strong>Double jump</strong>: Allows Twilight to jump an additional time.<br/></li><li><strong>Light Shard</strong>: Grants a 1-up.<br/></li><li><strong>Darkness Dispersal</strong>: Removes a percentage of darkness. The higher the current darkness, the more it removes.<br/></li><li><strong>Jump Impulse</strong>: Shoots Twilight vertically.<br/></li><li><strong>Speed Boost</strong>: Grants increased movement speed for a short duration.<br/></li><li><strong>Dashify</strong>: Allows Twilight to dash an additional time (has no effect in shadow form).</li></ul></li></ul><br/><strong>Note:</strong> Shadow Touched is an ongoing project, and I am committed to expanding and enhancing the game based on player feedback and evolving ideas. Join me on this journey as we shape the destiny of Twilight and explore the boundless possibilities of the shadow dimension.<h3>Controls</h3><ul><li>Move with WASD or Arrow keys.<br/></li><li>Jump with Space.<br/></li><li>Interrupt jumps with S or down arrow key.
