Everyone in this world has a magical power whose energy is drawn from one of the six moons that orbit the planet. Except for you. The good people of this place don't tolerate anyone who is an unmagical freak, so - quick - you better go find a power or two... or six.</p>\n\n<p>Explore a randomly generated world, with castles, dungeons, villages and cities in a roguelike adventure. Discover and use a large number of different magical powers. Some are devastating; others are pretty crap. It's up to you to make the best of the hand the Moons deal you.</p>\n<p>This is an early access game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The demo version does not contain the option to save the player's current game, but it is free!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T08:21:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b55/b559dea1cf63ef00c75e435237cadd7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AEChapman"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
