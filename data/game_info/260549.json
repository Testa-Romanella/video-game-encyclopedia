The idea of the gameplay was to create one-and-a-half hours sessions with the development of Base, in a genre that resembles strategy. The session could have been lost, and the JRPG element should not have been decisive - the player's actions on the map should be decisive. This was stimulated by the idea of creating two simultaneously decreasing timers and their replenishment should be tied to different parallel actions. All this was added with an extravagant storyline, which combined - as a basis - a fantasy on the theme of Taoist philosophy and the russian fairy-tales of Koschei and Vasilisa the Wise - as an unexpected, unpredictable move. The game was to introduce the player into a stressful state with the simultaneous choice of many gameplay goals and the constant need to follow the time. We are glad to present you what happened as a result ! During the updates, the game was repeatedly redesigned and redrawn.</p>\n\n<ul><li> 6 - 8 hours of gameplay\r\n</li><li> an abstract concept with a strange story and an uncomfortable world that makes you keep many aspects in your head\r\n</li><li> two simultaneously decreasing timers\r\n</li><li> Improving the Base, upgrade weapons, the Tower of Magic - as a classic canon </li></ul>\n<p><strong><em>\u00a0/</em></strong><strong><em> and an occasion for reflection. </em></strong></p>\n<br/><br/>Soundtrack Contains <br/><br/>\u00a0-<strong><em> 15 tracks from the game </em></strong>.
