The scientists take the first subjects through a tunnel and into the lab, inject them with the serum, and write down their reactions: \"Increased physical function, slightly increased intelligence, decreased eye sight, gradual increase in irritability, increased aggression... the first experiment\u2019s failed! The subjects are out of control!\u201d After losing their minds, the subjects break through the observation chamber, kill the scientists, and take over the ship's remote control and the keys to the tunnel.<br/>\r\nThe out-of-control subjects are hellbent on destroying the cruise liner and killing the other animals who haven't been injected with the serum.
