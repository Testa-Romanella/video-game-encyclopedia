A tourist town, <strong>Eklan Tor</strong> is one of the few places in the world of monsters where humans can be found. Your mission is to find objects that have been cleverly hidden inside buildings, behind trees, and inside containers. See if you can find em all!This virtual reality game is actually a prototype I made for a larger game called<strong> Under a Juniper Sky</strong>. I wanted to see how complex a world I could make in VR without the framerate dying. Turns out, pretty darn complex! Not only that, I wanted to create something that allowed someone to really explore a miniature world. I spent so much time on it that I wanted to give people a chance to try it out themselves. <br/></p>\n<p>If you enjoy the game, I know you'll like <strong>Juniper Sky</strong>. It's the story of a girl going to visit her family, who happen to live in a world of monsters. She ends up touring the strange lands with her cousin in a traveling teacart, selling tea to the various creatures in the world. Be sure to check out my twitter and devblog to see how it's coming along!</p>\n<p>Also if you know anyone you think might like to try this game, please tell them about it! Everyone keeps telling me that if I want to do well with my game, VR isn't that way to go since the audience is so small. But I really do love the stuff VR can do, how it can put you in a different world. \u00a0Hopefully you feel the same way.<br/></p>\n<p>And take a look at my dev blog, there's pictures!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cd/4cd7cded6f16607abcd9e4bdf04be189.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 210, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Juniper Sky"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
