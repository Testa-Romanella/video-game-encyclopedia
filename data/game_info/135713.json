Both players use the keyboard for the controller and they need to cooperate in order to control the character.</p>\n<p>The game is inspired from my parents complaints about how my games are hard to play and control. I divided the four way controller into two and make the game playable with two players and design the levels with easy to medium difficulty.</p>\n<p>Programming - Design - Graphics - Music - Sfx by Efe Ala\u00e7aml\u0131</p>\n<p>Soundtrack is available on Bandcamp.</p>\n<p>Devlogs</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f4/2f4b96eb4768561c7a43302dd0405deb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Efe Ala\u00e7aml\u0131"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
