WHAT IF THERE WERE A FLOCK OF SOCKS YOU HAD TO PAIR! Originally developed to be played with Joycons, this version uses a single Xbo 360 controller that can be shared between 2 players, for some coop sorting fun. Pair up with a friend and pair up as many different pairs of socks as you can in 20 seconds Move the hands around with the joysticks and grab a sock with the triggers. Move the socks together and collect a pair. Rinse and repeat!</p><p><strong>Credits</strong>:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Rebecca Roe - Artist</p>\n<p>Emelie Edholm - Artist</p>\n<p>Phil Smy - Artist(ish)</p>\n<p>Alan Yeats - Programmer</p>\n<p>Paul Robertson - Programmer</p>\n<p>Andrew Dodds - Sound Designer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T03:05:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ed/5ed3b6491dd9d4a6a00962b60eb28657.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jinjo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
