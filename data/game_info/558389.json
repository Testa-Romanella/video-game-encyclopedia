Unfortunately I can't remember the original author's name.</p>\n<p>## Instructions<br/>Steer your line across the screen from left to right avoiding the obstacles in your way. The aim is to reach the \"goal\" (the blank space) on the right side of the screen.</p>\n<p>Your line starts at the &gt; marker at the left side of the screen. It grows upwards and to the right. If you hold the SPACE key, it grows downwards and to the right; release the SPACE key and it grows up and right again.</p>\n<p>## Running<br/>Load the [obstacle.tzx] tape image into your emulator. If it does not automatically load the tape, in Spectrum BASIC type `LOAD \"\"` and press enter.</p>\n<p>The game exits after each play. To try again, type `RUN` and press enter.</p>\n<p>## Difficulty<br/>To make the game slower, increase the length of the `PAUSE` command on line 100. To make the game faster, remove the `PAUSE` command.</p>\n<p>Increase or decrease the number of obstacles by adjusting the value `50` in the `FOR` loop on line 50.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T05:57:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fd/8fd35d23c9915821166f2f4eedb107e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BASIC 10Liner"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
