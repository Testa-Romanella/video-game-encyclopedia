You feel like you\u2019re slowly circling towards a mental state of insanity  - almost as if you could converse with yourself?\r\n</p>\n<p>Rest assured, you\u2019re not alone.\r\n</p>\n<p>In  this game you\u2019re playing as a burnt out aspiring man, devoid of any  drive towards living a happy life. He\u2019s not very pleased as he wakes up  only to find out that he has been napping away at his desk during his  9-5 job finding himself being the last person in the department still  there.\r\n</p>\n<p>His way home turns into a spectacular exploration to the  depths of his (cold and lifeless) mind. As you\u2019re plummeting to the  bottom of his imagination you\u2019re going to find out what\u2019s left of this  once so sparkling, happy and caring young man. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T13:05:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/471/471d1af961be8443913aff5a86ece151.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ss0198"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
