An omnipotent being wakes you from your rest and claims they have no recollection of who you are or why you are there. Embark on an adventure to reclaim the colours of the world, defeating shadow creatures who have begun to invade in the absence of colour. Explore beautiful thematic 3D environments as you hack and slash, grow stronger and unlock new abilities travelling through the world to banish the darkness.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T19:45:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6db/6db8b19ad286e551687a7e019a1f7cd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tyrannical studio"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
