If it drops to 0% you ship will blow up and it's Game Over.\r\n       </p>\n<p>Everything you do uses some amount of energy.

If your ship's Energy drops to 0%  you won't be able to control it and you will crash. Your Energy will  slowly recharge if you don't perform an action that uses energy.\r\n       </p>\n<p>There is a feedback form.
