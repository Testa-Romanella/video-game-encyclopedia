{"id": 20979, "slug": "memories-of-a-vagabond", "name": "Memories of a Vagabond", "name_original": "Memories of a Vagabond", "description": "<p>Memories of a Vagabond is a turn-based RPG game developed by DarkElite Team.</p>\n<h3>Synopsis</h3>\n<p>You play as a mercenary, who travels from soul to soul to avenge the loss of his fiancee. The players will encounter many obstacles in their way, find new allies and encounter powerful enemies.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game&#39;s creators put a heavy emphasis on how the game recreates the feel of old RPGs, such as Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy. The main feature of the game is the absence of death in a usual way. Upon death, the player&#39;s soul is sent to the Soul Giver in the underworld, where they can choose a new body. All the skills that the player has learned to the point of his death will stay unaffected. This makes possible the transition of the skills of one class to another which results in countless gameplay combinations and high replay value. It has to be noted that your equipment and potions do not carry over to a new character, just like in most roguelike games.</p>\n<p>The game features a class system with four classes present: Warrior, Assassin, Mage, and Hunter. Each of the classes differs in gameplay and is chosen at the beginning of the game or upon death. A crafting system is also present in the game which allows for upgrading your hero&#39;s equipment on the go. It is possible to craft new armor and weapons, or healing potions.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-09T08:25:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/334/3341d2412c3ab1991ed6f5e0f63ccb2a.jpg", "website": "http://darkelitegames.com", "rating": 1.81, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 49, "owned": 1311, "beaten": 5, "dropped": 10}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 52, "suggestions_count": 219, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 53, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DarkElite"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["DarkElite"], "esrb_rating": null}
