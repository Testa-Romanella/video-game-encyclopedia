However, it sounds like they\u2019re not coming now. You wonder what to do, do you really want to enter a pub alone? Yet at the same time, going home after paying for a bus ride here feels like a waste. Standing outside, you double check your pockets. \u2026yep, looks like you have all that you need. Just have to walk inside once you get your bearings.</em>\n</p>\n<p>This solo developed project is an exploration of neurodiversity through an interactive medium and the result of my four years of study at Falmouth University. This was achieved by drawing from my own experiences with my neurodiversity, with abstract representations of these traits presented through the environment and characters. The setting is contained within a busy pub setting, as I felt a setting such as this is perfect to explore neurodiverse themes, especially given my experiences dealing with sensory and auditory issues in pubs. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Characters</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>THE BARTENDER </strong><em>(any pronouns)\r\n<em><br/>Unusual tri-tailed  feline, never seen anywhere but behind his bar.  Known to give wise  advice to those who need it, though no one knows much  about them at  all, not even their name.   </em></em>\n</li></ul>\n<ul><li><em><strong><em>TRINKET</em> </strong><em>(he/they)\r\n</em><br/><em><em>Excitable  collector with a love for drawing and tabletop gaming. Often found  sitting in the corner of The Wolf and Moon with his sketchbook.  Loveable, but with a tricky habit for losing things.   \r\n</em></em></em></li></ul><ul><li><em><em><strong>BEZEL </strong><em>(</em>xe/xem)\r\n<br/></em></em>\r\nNervous  little bee with a knack for timekeeping, xe can often be found reading a  book over a glass of whiskey and cola. While shy at first, xe makes a  great conversationalist, always loving to lend a hand and an ear.   </li></ul>\n<ul><li><em><em><strong><em>LUMEN</em> </strong>(she/her)\r\n</em></em>\n<br/>A passionate young bug with a fiery temperament, she can be found unwinding sporadically with her friends at The Wolf and Moon.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Here's a link to the full gameplay as a video if the download gives you trouble. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Ambience and music aquired from: <br/>https://freesound.org/people/bainmack/<br/>https://freesound.org/people/fogma/<br/></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T16:50:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/524/524570570e5e70877c9ed1326d84b975.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Onyx"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
