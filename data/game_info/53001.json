{"id": 53001, "slug": "grudge-warriors", "name": "Grudge Warriors", "name_original": "Grudge Warriors", "description": "<p>Grudge Warriors is a car combat video game released by Take-Two Interactive on April 27, 2000. The game retailed for the low price of $9.99, a response by Take-Two to the recent decision of Sony to drop PlayStation licensing fees. Similar to the earlier PlayStation title Twisted Metal, players control a powerful tank-like armored vehicle, which they used to destroy enemy vehicles, weapons, and generators, solve puzzles, and collect tokens to upgrade their weapons. There are a total of twenty-three missions, and the game allows two players to battle each other in split screen multiplayer.<br />\nUpon its release, Grudge Warriors was received unfavorably; critics bashed the game as having mediocre graphics, poor sounds, and botched gameplay. IGN and Gaming Age declared the game was not even worth the low price of ten dollars. Despite the overwhelmingly critical reception, there were a few points of the game that were praised, including the occasional puzzles during missions.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:37:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38b/38b5dc13a31d3bbe774c56d02b3792a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": ["Tempest Software"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Take Two Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
