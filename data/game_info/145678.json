Click/touch and hold to draw arrows. The arrow speed will be lower if you shoot it sooner. Use your knowledge of the seasons and the will of the Gods to summon their favor, by pressing E or touching the calendar. Each period in the calendar is favored by one God, and provides one power:<br/><ul><li>in the season of rain: thunder arrows, deal greater damage and strike through foes.</li><li>in the season of blossoms: fertility arrows, create trees that block the enemies' path.</li><li>in the season of drought: fire arrows, create fire on the ground, and set enemies on fire.</li><li>in the season of darkness: arrows that invoke punishment from the skies (aka meteors).</li></ul><br/>The two main ideas that came to us from the theme were archery and calendars. We decided to go with the main theme of an archery defense game, but used the calendar idea as a twist to allow for special powers at different moments, like crop seasons or lunar phases. <br/><br/>Many thanks to Sparklin Labs for their gorgeous asset pack (https://github.com/sparklinlabs/superpowers-asset-packs), which we ostensibly used.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kraiom"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
