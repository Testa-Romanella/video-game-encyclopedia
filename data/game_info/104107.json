The two players control their own lanes having to time their actions together. Mechanics featured simply door triggers ranging to total lane swaps. The last level is a map for the players to brawl on but this isn't fully implemented due to time constraints(the broken makes it more fun).</p><p>Controls - The game is best with two controllers but is also playable with the keyboard.</p><p>Controller - Y to jump, analogue to move, Back to restart level and start to skip.</p><p>Keyboard - Player 1: ASD, Space. Player 2: Arrows and right CTRL. R to restart level. O to skip levels.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b6/7b6d4722ff7f36c07f9685778c07cc2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JackInABox"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
