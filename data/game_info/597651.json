Each zone would have a probability of providing sun or wind. So one turn a solar farm would produce one unit of energy, next turn it won't produce any energy, etc. The goal would be creating a sustainable green energy solutions overall even if each power plant is\u00a0unstable by themselves.\u00a0 I couldn't made these on jam time, so it turn out to be a simple builder.</p>\n<p><strong>Assets:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>3d models from Synty Simple series</li><li>Icons from flaticon.com</li></ul><p><strong>Source (without 3d models):</strong></p><p>https://github.com/sapsari/GreenyLands</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T04:49:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14e/14e56e90829021a9a1b424796607deda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SARI"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
