I wanted to do this for a while now but couldn't find the motivation: it only came to me when I understood that I could try it out by copying Magical Drop - a series that I became enamored with a few months ago just seeing a screenshot of it. I don't think that I did it justice but, again, I didn't really try to.</p>\n<p>As with <em>vinizinho's battleships</em>, the local network limits it by a lot, so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I made neither the game design nor the art assets (except for the title screen, and the circles). Again, this was just a learning project. But it's a thing I made, and it deserves to be here just as much as everything else.</p>\n<p>Sorry for the lame gif on the right, I couldn't find anyone to play this with me! You can find the code\u00a0here.</p>\n<p><strong>ASSETS:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Cute Knight by goglilol</li><li>Sound Effects by\u00a0SubspaceAudio</li><li>Main song is a Spyro 3 song.
