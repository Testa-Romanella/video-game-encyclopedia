This isn't just any decrepit car \u2014 it's a roaring beast equipped with a formidable tank cannon and a high-powered jetpack, ready to defy both age and gravity.<br/>\r\nJourney through a procedurally generated world that unfurls new challenges and vistas with each play through.<br/>\r\nUnleash chaos as you obliterate obstacles in your path, transforming your once humble vehicle into a powerhouse of destruction with a plethora of upgrades awaiting to be discovered. Flex your strategic muscles as you decide whether to obliterate your enemies in a rain of cannon fire or soar to new heights to reach previously inaccessible areas.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSince Unity is now fucked up, I decided to semi cancel this game.<br/>\r\nNow it will be completely free, so they don't make any money from it.<br/>\r\nBut now the game will be only 1 level long. I might continue the project and 100% complete it if I don't have anything better to do with my life, but now I'll probably start a new game on UE5 or Godot", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-29T05:26:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bb/6bb088df459e7a271aaad1c98bbbf0b6.jpg", "website": "http://www.albertfreeman.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AlbertFreeman"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["AlbertFreeman"], "esrb_rating": null}
