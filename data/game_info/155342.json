The child will have to complete game objectives in all eight levels in order to learn facts about space.  The subjects are put in order carefully, to avoid confusion or information holes. It starts with basic concepts and builds up to more complex information about Earth, nearby space objects, solar system and eventually the galaxy.  <br/><br/>While keeping it fun and giving interesting facts about the galaxy we live in, it also teaches key concepts such as orbits, solar system, movements of planets and the consequences of those movements. The subjects include day-night, seasons, lunar and solar eclipses, solar system, planets and basic information about galaxies.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2a/c2a43b9446b07318bd236fe0c2990613.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ahmet Kamil Kele\u015f"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
