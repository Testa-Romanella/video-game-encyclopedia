I'm just happy about what I accomplished from \"scratch\" within 4 weeks.</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>i was hoping to put a little more work into this thing, but after a close call with my computer i think i need to release it as is.</p>\n<p>this is about as loudly as I can get myself to call for help. i was already struggling and barely pulling myself together before the troubles of the world came to a more visible head. now, with my conditions and the background stress of the times, i've not been able to direct my dwindling attention and energy to any kind of work, even with the most generous and understanding commissioners.</p>\n<p><strong>if you want to see what i could do with more time, more peace of mind, and a little more stability</strong>, please consider supporting me on patreon, buying this game for more than $0\u00a0(even less than $1 would help a lot), or sharing with a friend.</p>\n<p>i know this isn't much, but this \"game\" is what i have to offer for now.\u00a0i don't need a lot, and i hate to be a bother,\u00a0but i do need <em>something</em>. my spouse and I are both disabled in different ways, not on disability, and struggling to keep a home and stable enough prospects for me to be able to do the only thing i really can do these days: game dev.<br/></p>\n<p>thank you for reading this.</p>\n<p>\u00a0wash your hands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>follow or subscribe to a black person on your social media of choice.
