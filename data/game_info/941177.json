Juat in case I will duplicate it here:<br/><br/></p>\n<p>For your first Factory chain Buy Circles Factory and HexFactory.</p>\n<p>You can move Factories by dragging them by the orange button and connect them by clicking on them. Previously clicked Factory will connect to the clicked one. Make sure that factories match. For example, it is only possible to connect Factory that requires squares to the Factory that produces them.</p>\n<p>Press Play button to start.
