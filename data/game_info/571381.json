But different from the traditional brick breaker game, you can (have to) control multiple balls - slimes in this game.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n\n<p>You can also slow down the time drastically to make handling the slimes easier, but don't exploit the ability.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Try your best to ace as many waves as possible. The more waves you get through, the faster the slimes move, the quicker the enemies walk, and the stronger the enemies are.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Avoid slime loss. If you lose all of them, you fail. But the most important is: once an enemy passes through the specified location, you will lose instantly.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Controls:\r\n</p>\n<ol><li>Left Mouse Button - Launch slime\r\n</li><li>Right Mouse Button - Grap the next slime, if you have one. Click again to revert.\r\n</li><li>Keep Pressing \"R\" - Slow down the time.\r\n</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T09:17:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afb/afb937684a112c7cb508fd0ab15d795c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Samiingcreeper"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
