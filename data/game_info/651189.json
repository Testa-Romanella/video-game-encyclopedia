Brawl as the snow falls or as the sun shines, crouch to hide in the tall grass or keep to the shadows. In NeverDeath, there is more to think about than just how your character fights.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe nine distinct characters have their own distinct play styles and varied speed, health, damage, attack range, health regeneration rates, energy caps and energy regeneration rates. All these come together to make each character feel unique and powerful. Will you opt for the consistent damage and all around stats of the engineer or frustrate your enemies as an all but impossible to kill reptilian of unknown origin? Will you move in for the kill with dual knives or keep your distance with a trident? Will you subtly outmaneuver your enemies as a sword wielding female ninja or annihilate them before you die as a 15 foot monster that takes constant damage?", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T18:29:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/077/0772b79e9b9a580ae99ce586f6a39c5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 204, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Greedy Merchant"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Greedy Merchant"], "esrb_rating": null}
