I've used free assets from the Unity Store, if you want more info about a specific asset, feel free to ask!</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0Am I gonna do more?</strong></p>\n<p>I can't really tell if I'm going to have the time and resources to keep going, and make something more enjoyable. I am really getting into Game Programming so maybe a thing or two will come out after this, but can't promise anything.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Will you come back to this game?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>No, I don't think so. Maybe I'm going to try test some new stuff and experiment in general with this, but since it's not a \"official release\" on a \"official platform\" like Steam, updating and keeping the game updated is hard for both ends.</p>\n<p><strong>Am I trying to make any kind of revenue with this?</strong></p>\n<p>No. This is just for experimenting and testing. I'm not making any money from this.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Can I help with future developments?</strong></p>\n<p>If you really like this (somehow) and want to see more from me, the best thing you can do is leave a comment down below cheering me up, and subscribe if you want to. Thanks for watching and (hopefully) playing!</p>\n<p>MOSTRA MENO</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T07:22:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b99/b993548db7a7628a9aeba0fecc269d96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["CrazyHardTR"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
