If you miss an input, you will lose a heart. If you get every input in a set you will regain one heart.</p>\r\nNote\r\n<p>During the jam, and for a while after, there was an online scoreboard system. It seems to be offline now, so the game will <strong>only\u00a0display placeholder scores</strong>, and your <strong>high scores will not be saved</strong>. I was planing to make a backup score system originally with this game, but it did not make the 48 hour cut. If I get very board in the future, or this game experiences some unexpected popularity, I will consider implementing a new highscore server!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Play Note -\u00a0<strong>Arrows</strong></li></ul>\r\nCredits\u00a0\r\n<ul><li><strong>\u00a0HitchH1k3r</strong>\u00a0(@HitchH1k3r,\u00a0hitchh1k3rsguide.com)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d59/d5918e704b1e243579df96bc03cf1ddc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HitchH1k3r"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
