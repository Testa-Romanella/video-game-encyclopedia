A single living room can have so much with so little.</p>\n\n<p>Welcome! This is my entry for <strong>Mini Jam #82</strong>: Theme \"Doodle\" and Limitation \"Only One Room\". </p>\n<p>This card game is built around the idea of a kid playing in the living room. Your cards are the little games and activities they come up with, and your goal is to keep it Fun without making too big a Mess!</p>\n<p>Card-based resource management gameplay, with art created by a professional child (I've been one my whole life).</p>\n<p>The theme of Doodle comes up not only in the \"art direction\" (if you can call it that) that takes inspiration from drawing with chalk, but also on the idea of goofing around, having fun without a clear plan. Being a kid. <br/></p>\n<p>And the limitation is simple: Everything in the game happens inside the living room. Only one room.<br/></p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>-The Storeman</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T11:33:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/763/763a62394b01e62cb5decb326f0e2b0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheStoreman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
