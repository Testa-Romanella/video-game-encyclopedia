{"id": 248400, "slug": "enlisted", "name": "Enlisted", "name_original": "Enlisted", "description": "<p>Enlisted - is an MMO squad based shooter which is built around some of the most important and famous episodes from World War 2.</p>\n<p>In Enlisted, players can experience these famous battles on a massive scale through the real heroes of those encounters - the soldiers. In some modes, players won\u2019t be fighting alone on the battlefield, they will be leading their own squad of AI controlled soldiers, this will grant a unique scale to the combat. Engagements with up to hundreds of soldiers fighting simultaneously will be held on different fields of battle with maps up to hundreds of square kilometers.</p>\n<p>The latest version of the Dagor Engine is able to calculate huge detailed spaces, dynamic water and skies, while using physically based render.</p>\n<p>Teamplay, the correct evaluation of actions with consideration of the current situation on the battlefield, weapon and character capabilities - all of these will be essential parts of Enlisted. Players will gradually unlock new characters who will all have different playstyles. Additional diversity in the battles will also be granted by a wide weaponry selection. Just like in a real war, where you rarely can see two absolutely identical rifles - weapons in the Enlisted will have their own features and their own history.</p>\n<p>Popular World War II battles will be present in the Enlisted in separate campaigns. To re-create each of these battles requires not only the creation of separate content like new locations, characters, weapons and vehicles - it also requires a huge amount of work on creating the game rules and balance in them. This is why each campaign will be developed separately from each other.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-02T00:16:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/9da/9dad0e1b6406a4685f244c58854a0ea2.jpg", "website": "https://enlisted.net/", "rating": 3.15, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 13, "owned": 245, "beaten": 11, "toplay": 21, "dropped": 43, "playing": 9}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 39, "ratings_count": 66, "suggestions_count": 509, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 68, "platforms": ["PlayStation 5", "PC", "Xbox Series S/X"], "developers": ["Darkflow Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Gaijin Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
