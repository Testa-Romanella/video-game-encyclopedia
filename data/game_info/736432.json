We needed to refine the combat system, so focussed on a loop of dragon battles and discovered it was incredibly fun. When Reddit play testers called our initial Dragon Battle demo in October 2020 \"joyful\" and \"incredibly addictive\" we knew we had built something new and interesting in the JRPG format. Playtesters reported spending 6+ hours per gaming session, diving in and leveling up their character during epic encounter after epic encounter. When my brother tested the game at home, my 9 year old nephew ran from the room in fear of the terrifying dragon encounter that appeared on the screen. The game was hitting all the right triggers.<br/><br/>Another year+ was spent polishing, building out dragons, and countless hours of balancing to get the perfect level of insane difficulty. In October of 2021 we tested the built-out game with gamers at TwoBit Circus' BETA night inside of a tensegrity sphere / dragon cave, and they agreed with the Redditors. One playtester shook my hand after emerging from the dragon cave, laughing appreciatively at how much he enjoyed getting eaten by a dragon. \"You're clearly onto a winner here,\" he said.<br/><br/>A few more months have been spent debugging and polishing, testing on a flashcart on a GameBoy Pocket to make sure it works flawlessly on original hardware (so far so good). Now with builds for PC, Mac and Linux, the Dragon King is ready to challenge the world!<br/><br/>To help players and make the game more fun (and in case of accidental crashes), we ultimately added an auto-save system after each dragon victory so players can return to their last victory and pick up where they left off in case the worst comes to pass.<br/><br/>Ready to be a lucky dragon's next meal?<br/><br/>Or will <strong>YOU</strong> be the Champion of Legend who defeats the Dragon King?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T04:30:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/026/026fc5eda0736809ad79ca8bd190dca1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nick Blake"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Apartment 18 Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
