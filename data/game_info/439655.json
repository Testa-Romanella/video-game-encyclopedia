Once they finish their song, you must repeat the melody by tapping them in the correct order. If you make a mistake or run out of time the game is lost. If you get it right you gain a point and the game goes on. There is no ultimate winning condition in <strong>MiMO</strong>. There is, however, a high-score system which tracks your best performance so that you can show off\u00a0to your friends!\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are four gameplay modes available:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>CLASSIC-EASY</strong></li>\n<li><strong>CLASSIC-HARD</strong></li>\n<li><strong>RANDOM-EASY</strong></li>\n<li><strong>RANDOM-HARD</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\r\nIn both CLASSIC modes (<strong>CLASSIC-EASY</strong> &amp; <strong>CLASSIC-HARD</strong>) the melody increases by one note at each round, while its previous part remains intact. In other words, you need to memorize one extra note per round.</p>\n<p>In both RANDOM modes (<strong>RANDOM-EASY</strong> &amp; <strong>RANDOM-HARD</strong>), a new melody is generated from scratch in each round with its length increased by one. In other words, you need to memorize a whole new melody per round!<br/></p>\n<p>The <strong>EASY</strong> modes are slower - paced. The buddies are singing at a slow speed and you have more time to think before you play your melody.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nThe HARD modes, on the other hand, are less forgiving. The buddies are singing at a faster speed and you have less time to think, before you act.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T06:13:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af0/af098ac648d669fd13a63b942b2aa373.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["seedgamelab"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
