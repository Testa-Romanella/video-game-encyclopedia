The only practical exercise implemented in this game version is to Determine R /\u00a0S Configuration of a molecule, and since the game does not provide a tutorial on how to solve it,\u00a0the player must already know the steps.</em></p>\n<p>The game scene takes place in a futuristic type of factory, where several molecular structures move along the treadmills. The player, which is an employee, must analyze molecules, and put them at the ultimate container if they fulfill the requirements given by the exercise. The player must mentally do the exercise to arrive to a conclusion about certain molecular structure before placing it at the container. There are also different powers, that the player can catch, and place them at the container as well to activate them. However, not all the powers are considered good, as some of them can bring chaos to the workplace.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T10:30:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f7/1f776e987a8c7fcc50689d3357fa6921.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["maridany"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
