You've just been hired... now go make it a success!</p>\n<p>Design your museum, place your exhibits, install floors. Manage expenses. Charge admission... but be careful, charge too much and less people will come visit. Ensure your visitors are kept happy. It's all up to you.</p>\n<p>Mouse control for designing, keyboard control (WASD + QE) for camera movement.</p>\n<p>This game was written as an entry to the Miziziziz Game Jam. You're provided a mandatory graphic package to use (in this jam it was a 16 pixel by 16 pixel 1 bit graphic package - old school!) and have just over 1 week (but no more than 48 total hours during the week) to create the game. All told I was able to find about 35 hours to work on it.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T02:54:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/340/34029e7802bf2dbdfd484efd04cb8149.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HungryCatGames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
