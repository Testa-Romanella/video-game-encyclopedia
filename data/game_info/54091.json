{"id": 54091, "slug": "tecmo-super-bowl", "name": "Tecmo Super Bowl", "name_original": "Tecmo Super Bowl", "description": "<p>Tecmo Super Bowl is an American football video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) that was released on December 13, 1991. Developed by Japanese video game company Tecmo, it was the first sports video game that had licensing privileges with both the National Football League and the National Football League Players Association, thus allowing the game to use both the names and attributes of real NFL teams and real NFL players. (Prior games used the real teams or the real players, but not both simultaneously.) Although the game was released in late 1991, all team rosters and player attributes were based on the prior 1990\u201391 NFL season, which meant that no rookies taken in the 1991 NFL Draft and no player team changes executed before the start of the 1991 season were added.</p>\n<p>The original game utilized the 1991 NFL schedule only; therefore, playing multiple seasons with alternate schedules was not possible. The game was a major success and, although more than 20 years old, it has maintained an extensive cult following.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1991-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:26:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8b/f8b1aa1c1187d73719a01ccf4327908b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 8, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 221, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PlayStation", "NES", "SNES", "Genesis"], "developers": ["Tecmo"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Tecmo"], "esrb_rating": null}
