Only 3 levels.</strong><br/></p><p>This is my first run with Unity, ran into quite a few issues, but hey, I shipped it! It's a simple platformer set within a terrarium.  You can click the mouse anywhere to shoot out the frog's tongue.  The tongue can push rocks and may be useful on one or two of the levels.<br/></p><p>It's buggy and relies on basic unity physics, so some of the collisions are wonky, but I hope you enjoy the small game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a26/a260711f4ef37b4483df2030b46fa820.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["lonewookie"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
