Pesci doesn't have any poetry to perform, so they've got to look around the coffee shop for help and inspiration to create a poem for the slam.</p>\n<p>Made for the KO!! Slam-Jam on 1/15/2023 with Jacob4Shoe</p>\n<p>At this time there is a missing piece of the game right at the end that was unable to be completed by the midnight deadline. You are meant to be able to assemble a poem at the end.</p>\n<p>These assets were used in the creation of this game. Thank you to bluecarrot16, MouthlessGames, and Death's Darling for their art/music.</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/snowy-cozyness-calm-pianoguitar\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-wooden-furniture </p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-revised-the-office</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T18:31:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d2/3d2ca17672ca0952ed7cbaed437f407e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AustinWH"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
