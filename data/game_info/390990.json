With this answer, I was completely in agreement and after several months in working on the script, I again stopped working on the port to implement my own ideas.</p>\n<p>Four years later, I again got excited about this idea of creating a port and, I started it, I hope you enjoy the current concept and you support me.</p>\n<p><strong>Briefly about what innovations are expected in this adaptation:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Sounds for all dynamic objects\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Voice acting dialogs</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Rethinking original music tracks\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Animated actions and cut scenes\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Improved and comfortable combat system\u00a0</p><p>- One, or several new game endings besides the standard ones</p>\n<p><strong>Screenshots:</strong><br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Video:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Contacts:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>iwan1234554321@gmail.com</p>\n<p>It is planned to attract outsourcing to the project to implement new guises of characters, animation, music and sound, so if you have a desire to help:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Donationalerts.com</p>\n<p>I will be very happy if you like my idea and the prototype I created, if you have any questions, I will be happy to answer them in the comments, or to the indicated mail</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T03:26:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d16/d162c65b20b37978337842b7b20eaaee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["signbyrh"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
