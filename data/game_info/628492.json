We plan to do a few closed alpha tests in the near future. The core mechanics are in place and the game is fully playable, but it is missing many quality of life features. We hope you enjoy the foundation of the game and help us see it to completion.<h3>Story</h3><br/>You are Son Goku, shape-shifting Warrior King.

One day while slouching in your throne, a cunning (conniving) river-dragon approaches you with a wager. She bets that you can\u2019t win a fight against your own clones. You\u2019re a little disappointed you didn\u2019t think of it before. She\u2019s confident you\u2019ll lose and sign your titles over to her. Being arrogant and bored senseless, you accept the terms without hesitating, and summon your clones. Let\u2019s rock.<h3>Key Features</h3><br/><strong>Intense Combat -</strong> Fast paced skilled based action with up to 10 players online.
