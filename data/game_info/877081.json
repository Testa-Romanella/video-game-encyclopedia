This is a direct upload of the desktop version of my game. <br/><br/>This was my first complete project, and I wanted to focus primarily on aesthetics and immersion while developing many skills at the same time. Everything from the art to the music was created by me. This project marked the end of my formative years, illustrating a psychological experience as well as being a snapshot of my technical ability. <br/></p>\n<p>The scope of this game was highly minimal, amongst other shortcomings. With the completion of high school, I have a new project planned. Stay tuned to my Instagram, @RoadLyssTaken, for updates, and please feel free to reach out.<br/></p>\n<p>-Alyssia<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T11:58:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5a/d5aa0b86e2ba1c8d6f5b06f606cc0209.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RoadLyssTaken"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
