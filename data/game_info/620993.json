When you are combined with your other half you are invulnerable to bullets but unable to attack. Splitting lets you take the offensive but your main body is defenseless when split! Also, when you are split you must watch your energy or else you'll leave your attacking half stranded when you're out! This game was made for the Game Maker's Toolkit Game Jam 2021.
