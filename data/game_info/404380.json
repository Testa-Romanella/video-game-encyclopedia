It's an action fixed-shooter where you control food or alien troopers and defend your territory from approaching enemies!\u00a0</p>\n<p>For anyone that played the old build, this demo is an updated build where the text has been edited to fit on the screen, but it still plays normally like before. This is also not entirely representative of the final game, some things may be changed in the full release.<br/></p>\n\n<p>I hope you all enjoy playing!
