{"id": 848829, "slug": "one-poker", "name": "one-poker", "name_original": "one-poker", "description": "<p>Note: this contains some mild spoilers for the Kaiji manga.<br/><br/>9/5/2022 - 1.0 release.</p>\n<p>This is a mostly faithful recreation of the One Poker game from Kaiji. If there are any discrepancies, let me know. It's possible that in the manga, anyone was able to raise first, but for the sake of the game I gave priority to the previous round winner (or random for first turn). The AIs are pretty simple and the first one just randomly picks a card and check/calls, so it's good for testing the entire game state since you can make it go all in every game.</p>\n<p>Short summary of the rules:<br/></p>\n<p>1) Three standard poker decks with the jokers removed are randomly mixed together, and cut in half. One of the deck halves is used for the game, so it is not possible to card count.\u00a0Each player is dealt two cards. Cards 2-7 are DOWN cards, and 8-Ace are UP cards. The lights on each side of the player publicly displays how many UP and DOWN cards the player has. One life is put into the pot from each player as an ante.</p>\n<p>2) One card is picked by both sides in any order face down, after which the betting phase begins. The previous winner gets to bet first.<br/></p>\n<p>3) Players are able to bet as many lives as they have left, up to the amount of lives the other player has left. The other player can fold, call, or raise. Calling/raising requires clicking on the lives first.<br/></p>\n<p>4) The betting round ends when a player folds, calls an all in, or checks. Both players must check for the round to end, and there is no limit to the amount of times you can raise during a round. This means that unlike regular texas hold-em poker, calling does not end the round.</p>\n<p>5) When the betting round ends, both players reveal their cards regardless of the result of the betting round. If there was no fold, then the higher card wins. In the case of a tie, players take back their lives and the card dealing / betting priority is unchanged for the next round.</p>\n<p>6) The only exception to a higher card winning is that a 2 beats an Ace.</p>\n<p>7) The winner, assuming the game isn't over, will receive the next card first, and will be able to bet first.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-10T00:35:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/939/9391fe1d2d1c889f9d3687c0d502fde7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dipwood"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
