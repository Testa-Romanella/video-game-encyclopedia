If the player is on a map that is raining and teleports to a map that is not raining, the rain will continue on the new map. This is quite inconvenient when the new map is, for example, the interior of a home.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Description:\u00a0</strong>This script makes it possible to take a break from the effect of rain after teleporting to an internal map (such as the interior of a castle / house / shop / dungeon). When the player returns to the previous map, the rain effect is reactivated.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>To disable the effect of rain on a map, simply enter the <semgoteira>\u00a0 tag in the Notes field of the map settings.</semgoteira></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </p>\n\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Before:\u00a0</strong><em>\"When are you going to fix this roof?\"</em></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>After :\u00a0</strong><em>\"It stopped raining inside the house.\"</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T04:07:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39e/39e8f1ed394f2d9794912588f8520031.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TecnoAnalogica"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
