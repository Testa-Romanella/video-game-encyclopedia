There's only one short level but you're scored at the end based on speed, kills, etc. Get good enough for an S rank and I'll give you a pat on the head, promise.<br/><br/>There are two types of light dashes- yellow and purple. Hit an enemy with a dash of its color to target it, then hit it again with the opposite color to make it go boom! (Includes a satisfying sound effect) You have a limited amount of dashes but they're replenished when you reflect off of something.<br/><br/><strong>Controls:<br/></strong>WASD - Move and jump<br/>Left click - Yellow dash<br/>Right click - Purple dash<br/>Space - Recharge (when on ground)<br/>R - Restart<br/>Esc - Close the game &lt;--------- <em><strong>Pretty important!!!</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>I made this for a 72 hour Game Jam and plan to release a new version later with fewer bugs, more content, less bad music, and more polish overall- it'll be very gnarly. Oh, and you won't have to read the Itch.io page for controls... oops.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T06:13:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ac/7ac4297b011a1d61ea02c0eaf2e4bb53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sn5"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
