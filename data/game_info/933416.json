I am going to make a spaceship game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I spent too many hours just playing my own game than doing other things :) it made me happy. So i figured I post it here if flying spaceships makes anyone else happy. The controls are a bit odd on\u00a0 keyboard, I got a cheap controller that I have been using to prototype . I recommend using a controller if you have one, otherwise use the mouse or keyboard.</p>\n<p>If you have any suggestions or find any bugs, lemme know in the comments. Also please let me know if you liked this prototype, I am trying to decide what I want to make next so if you like where this was going (this was like a day or two's work that I just procrastinated on posting) then let me know in the comments!</p>\n<p>Credits for all the models is in the game. Also I added quality levels, unfortunately even the medium quality lags a bit for me :( the only real difference is the shadow quality.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T09:40:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/534/534cdc593d5c9e5aa33e0ab6f86d73f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["SentientDragon5GameDev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
