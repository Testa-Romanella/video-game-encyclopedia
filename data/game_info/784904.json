You encounter foes that want to harm you, and you yourself must fight back in self-defense. In order to find out where you are, you must explore it and figure out what this is, and eventually, what this place means. The world is certainly vast with locations of different colors, tones, and atmospheres. These locations will have one thing in common which is a white light, once touched, will give the player insight into the world they are in and clues of what this world is all about.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Developers (Alphabetical Order):</p>\n<ul><li>Agustin Gomez Arroyo - Programmer</li><li>Caitlyn Huff - Artist</li><li>Liam Ivanic - Programmer</li><li>Kendry Johnson - Designer</li><li>Jesus Franco Yescas - Programmer</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T14:26:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af1/af10af29b1ffa82d80772346aa255fd0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PepticSolid"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
