Our goal was to design a sustainable and environmentally friendly zoo by the end of our 2-week time limit. With the creative talents of Conner Rush, our game designer, this model was developed. The purpose of this model was to present to our fellow students and their families on our final day, and we decided that we should give others a chance to experience our walk-through. We hope you enjoy!  </p><p>P.S. to exit, press 'alt' + 'f4'.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57f/57f40fb8e32f2bb6fb0c70454ce4b530.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WVSU"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
