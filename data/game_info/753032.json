See last week's entry here.</p>\n<p>With this project I learned about room-based level generation and found a lot of bugs in the interplay between scripts I made for other projects. As always, I learned more about what does not work, than what actually does.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I am perfectly aware that this is far from a fun, polished experience.\u00a0But after all, I am pretty happy with how it turned out. I think I found a start towards\u00a0a promising direction, especially w.r.t. gunplay.</p>\r\nKnown Bugs:\r\n<p>- Forgot to include \"R to Reload\" on Loading Screen<br/></p>\n<p>-\u00a0Entities may jiggle around, once an external force has been applied to them (e.g. when hit by a projectile). This behaviour should stop when stepping against a wall along the affected axis.</p>\n<p>- Due to described jiggle, entities may glitch through walls.</p>\n<p>- Visuals of Level, especially w.r.t. corners may not line up or leave holes in the ground.</p>\n<p>- It is possible to block bullets by shooting them out of the air. This might even be a feature, but it was too unintended to not be a bug.</p>\n<p>- If backed against a wall\u00a0upon\u00a0death, the flying body that spawns when an enemy dies, won't move.</p>\n\r\nTransparency Declaration &amp; Credits:\r\n<p>I reused scripts I made for other projects. This especially includes an animation system for the characters and the weapon system. Almost everything else, such as the Level-Generation, Grid Based Movement, Turn Based Time Progression,\u00a0Enemy AI, Blood-System, etc. was written from scratch for the 7DRL 2022. The work took place from 05.03.2022 09:00 CET to 12.03.2022 09:00 CET.</p>\n<p>This game uses artwork from LimeZu and\u00a0Kenny, and sounds from Sidearm\u00a0Studios.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T09:46:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/052/0525da8ac74647ef703e80a034c7f9de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sedetius"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
