Please prefer the JAR file.<br/></em></p>\n<p>Controls: W,A,S,D, Mouse<br/></p>\n<p>Protect your beautiful jahpanese fe-maple plants!<br/>A horde of cops wants to take them as evidence, for evident reasons.</p>\n<p>But you don't want them to take pleasure in your jahpanese fe-maple. After all, it's yours!\r\nThough you would happily share, the cops always take all they can, leaving nothing to you. And a man should reap what he sows, you firmly believe. </p>\n<p>So, in order to save some of your fe-maple plants, you will have to sacrifice others!\r\nIgnite them with a flamethrower, and use the leafblower to blow the smoke towards the cops. For some reason, they will become hungry. Possibly, because the smell reminds them of maple syrup, but we dont't know\r\nfor sure- this is a mystery, even to our programmers. It just happens. </p>\n<p>When a jahpanese fe-maple field is fully grown, time has come for harvesting. You have good uses for the plant,\r\nand also, it sells for some good money. But wait! As you have found out, mature plants will make our cops extra super hungry. So you decide: harvest quickly for maximum profit, or save some of your ripe plants for bad times. </p>\n<p>No matter how you decide: Don't let those greedy guys reach your house. Use time and resources wisely to bring in as much harvest as you can.\r\nRemember: Sacrifices must be made!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46f/46ff9c1a6f6799f02e18f418b7af650f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["FooMar"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
