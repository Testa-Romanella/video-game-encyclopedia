We took it further and flipped the eight into infinity, because that is what you can do with our game. Let the character run in circles forever <em>(although you shouldn't!)</em></p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Play as a programmer who sorts a messy script of the rover to make it pass the complicated rooms (and not die in process)!</p>\n<p>You can program the rover to do single steps (move one block), go until it hits object, turn around, place blocks and pull levers. But be careful, because once you decide on what he should do, he will not stop until he either gets to the finish or dies a quick, yet unpleasant\u00a0death.</p>\n<p>On this game worked:</p>\n<p><strong>-Glow</strong> - <em>Our programmer, resident maniac\u00a0and head of this project and generally annoying person when it comes to waking up early</em></p>\n<p><strong>-Fjana</strong> - <em>Our graphical designer who also edited soundrack into 8bit and wrote a lot of stupid jokes that made it into the game, (also wrote this describtion, hello dear world!), also worked as a psychiatrist to prevent Glow's mental breakdown</em></p>\n<p><strong>-Diren</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0<em>Our sound engineer, joined our team 4 hours before deadline and still managed to create a perfect soundtrack</em></p>\n<p>Stay tuned for future updates including storyline, more rooms, more mechanics etc. (which we plan to do once we recover from the crippling defeat in LD47)</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>WARNING!
