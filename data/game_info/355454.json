Features two trails from the full version.  <br/><br/>Race to the bottom on your snowboard, slalom between the gates, or rack up big points with in-air spins and grabs.   Meet the bronze, silver, and gold challenges.<br/><br/>The 1.24 update gives you two ways to control your snowboard. There's the traditional tilt control with touching the screen causing you to stand up and turn faster, and new touch steering controls. If you pick the new controls from the options menu you can drag your thumb around to turn, add a second touch to stand up, or swipe up to start a jump. There's also an option to stand by default and touch to tuck if you preferred the old controls.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T11:43:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6b/a6b523b091183d8308f7811a811fdef2_0Xi6Nmp.jpg", "website": "http://goldenhammersoftware.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Golden Hammer Software"], "genres": ["Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Golden Hammer Software"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
