This game is about the journey of the infamous Dragon Ball Z character Krillin to rescue other heroes who have been trapped by the corresponding villains. I created this game at the College of Marin Game Development 1 Course, and was my first official game, that I am still proud to have made to this day. During the development of this game, I got help from others in the class which I am grateful for.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:\u00a0</strong><br/>Game designer\u00a0 - \u00a0Rohan Ayyar</p>\n<p>These people made contributions to:</p>\n<p>Game Design - Joel Guitron<br/>Level design, coding - Ryan Breyer<br/>Level and Art design - Nathaniel Grgunia<br/>Coding - \u00a0Solomon Smith<br/>Tech \u00a0Issues \u00a0- \u00a0Steve Rosas<br/>Music - \u00a0Iiro Papinniemi, Sonic Skillz,\u00a0theskybreakerv3<br/>Game Design Spring 2017 Class !!!<br/><br/><strong>Now that you know the work put in to create this project, I would like to present Battle of The Legends.<br/></strong><br/><strong>NOTE TO EVERYONE PLAYING THIS GAME!!! People were asking me questions about this, so I wanted to clear all of it up. I worked in all of the areas I credited others for. I worked on most of the code (MoveScript, EnemyScript, etc), most of the art (created the Krillin, Both Enemies, Megaman, Mario, Goku, etc) and a fair amount of the level design. I also created the splash screen and icon and created and uploaded the trailer. The people who made contributions made small ones in their area to help me out. I just wanted to clear this all up because people thought that I did not contribute much to this project and since the build is already up, I can't change the credits screen anymore. Now that I got my word out, I hope that you enjoy this game!!!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f69/f696f7fc0d60e601e868961a7722db13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Roayyar"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
