Play as the just mercenary Rome as you venture through the twisted lands of Nightdale to obtain the Three Amulets, talismans vital to enter the forbidden Dorganmire and confront the villainous False Prophet. Battle against a variety of mutant enemies, from lumbering zombies to the sorrowful mourning woods; from aerial snallygasters to leaping genusaurs; from trigger-happy robits to fell rockmen.\u00a0 Rougelike and rogue-lite peasants will seethe at the fact that the map is not randomly generated, granting players the ability to learn and master the lands of Nightdale.\u00a0 Do you dare to venture into Nightdale to defeat the false prophet? We'll see if you have what it takes to call yourself Condottierran, but only if you play now.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T06:30:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f9/7f97ae5dc00683eb0df40fddbb63f15b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NRasko"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
