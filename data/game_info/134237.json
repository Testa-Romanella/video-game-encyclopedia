The player is a Pharaoh, who tragically died during battle by a spear to the heart. The Pharaoh is buried with a replacement heart scarab in his sarcophagus as a replacement for his dead real one in the afterlife. However upon entering the afterlife, the player smashes their heart scarab. The player must find all the shattered heart scarab pieces and have their heart weighed by Anubis so that they can escape the spirit realm they are trapped in.</p><p>This was made as part of a project by students studying at Media Design School, New Zealand.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c29/c290a8e3d69406365483cbb98b5ffe33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mummy Dab"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
