Just as a warning, the topics covered in this game are kind of heavy and the main theme of this game is mental health. I cannot stress enough that I am not representing any specific mental health issue or condition in this game. I am simply just telling a story. When making this, I had no specific mental health issue in mind, and I just want to let you all know that!</p>\n<p><em>Y.A.N.A</em> is a 9 to 10 minute long\u00a0story based game about you, Jinnie, speaking to a young boy named Mateo through the Y.A.N.A Mental Health Hotline.</p>\n<p>But the truth behind Mateo and the reason why he messaged Y.A.N.A is up to you to figure out.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy!
