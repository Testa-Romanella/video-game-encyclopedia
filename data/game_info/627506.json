{"id": 627506, "slug": "fall-demo", "name": "FALL. - Demo!", "name_original": "FALL. - Demo!", "description": "<p>Hey! Thanks for checking this out.</p>\n<p>In FALL, you need to navigate your small little cube-shaped body through obstacles without being sent tumbling off of a platform. The catch is, you can't slow down, and you're only getting faster. The obstacles get more and more complex, so with quick reflexes and a little bit of luck, you just might not FALL. Not sold on it? Me neither. It's fun though, I promise.</p>\n\n<p>This is a demo/proof-of-concept of an idea I actually came up with 3 years ago, when\u00a0I started learning game development. I actually made this game back in 2017-18, as a beginner, and what came out was an awful, buggy mess.</p>\n<p>3 years later, I still like the idea, so I decided to measure how my skills had improved by re-making it and seeing how it turned out. This is a demo, so it's really, really short, but I'm putting it out there as a proof of concept. I'm going to keep working on it, but if I get some sort of positive feedback, I might try making this into a full game and releasing it.</p>\n<p>If anyone's interested in actually seeing the original game from 2017 and roasting me for it, let me know in the comments :)</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -Onion</p>\n\n<p>CURRENTLY INCLUDES:</p>\n<p>-\u00a010 levels</p>\n<p>- Not much else</p>\n\n<p>Roadmap(?):</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Post-Processing/Optimisation (Complete!)</p>\n<p>- New worlds (visual styles and environments)</p>\n<p>- 3+ new obstacle types</p>\n<p>- (Possibly) An endless mode</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T11:56:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7bf/7bf46ad44d4fbcaf8ac9b416324ebabd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Soggy Onion Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
