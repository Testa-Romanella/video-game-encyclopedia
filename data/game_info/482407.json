It is\u00a0designed to work with my brick (yes a real brick) based game controller. I hesitated uploading it because I have a rule about showing unfinished work. It is functional for now but there is some minor work to do on exits. On most screens there is only one exit tile at each end of the course, so it's not as smooth as it can be. For testing I used \"Turbo Lover\" by Judas Priest for background music, but of course I can't do that here, so I'm going to whip up something myself. In the mean time enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-21T04:09:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6da/6da18d01cdace541e01ccaddc1a2dd1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["vistamix"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
