The <strong>github project</strong> can be found here:<br/></p>\n<p>It contains an implementation of the <em>*Marching Cubes*</em> algorithm, which constructs a 3D Mesh from three-dimensional scalar fields (aka 3D Arrays containing float values from 0 to 1).</p>\n<p>The whole algorithm also runs on the GPU using compute shaders.</p>\n<p>The project is heavily inspired by Sebastian Lagues video on the algorithm. I highly recommend his videos.</p>\n<p>Since this was done to learn about <em>GPU Computing</em> and <em>procedural world generation</em>, there is very little actual game content. I may expand on this in the future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T10:30:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97c/97cb06fed8c9cfd9d07b46020211909e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crysaac"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
