A timing exemption was sought by BakaBaku Circle and approved by Jam organizers due to work obligations. <br/></p>\n<p>***CONTENT WARNING***<br/>Due to the nature of the source material, some conversations and events surrounding violent death and self-harm could be troublesome for players or viewers.

A mysterious figure crosses their path, stirring M into action-- and exposing them to secrets they may not have wanted to know. Can M survive long enough to find out an answer to the questions which plague them?</p>\n<p>Based on ZUN's Dolls in Pseudo Paradise, \"Eight Ghosts\" is a stealth horror RPG adventure inspired by games such as Yomawari and Pocket Mirror.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>This Jam build is a demo of a game which we intend to full publish and is considered in active development. The first level, \"Hour #1\" will be playable in the Jam build. Work up to \"Hour #4\" was completed in the period, but will instead be released in a post-Jam update due to unforeseen circumstances,\u00a0 with more game content and bug fixes included. <br/></p>\n<p>We ask for your patience as we build this game up to its full potential and to follow along for updates.
