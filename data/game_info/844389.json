The purpose of this game is searching and collecting totally 24 candles. Players have to search candles and try to figure out how to solve problems by items they found to obtain the candles.\r\n\r\nYou can control the protagonist like an RPG, but there are not including monsters, battles, levels, weapons, armors, and sleeping in this game. You can still obtain some items and money to solve the problems. There are also including some events can be triggered. For whom doesn\u2019t care these events or the players who are not playing the first time, who can use the function \u201cskip events\u201d to ignore these events in game.\r\n\r\nThere is a timer running in the background of the game, and it will change the time period of the day. Game time would be paused during certain statuses such as entering menu, triggering events, and playing in sub-games. Not including the pause time, there are totally 3 hours from dawn to dark. You have to finish the mission before it\u2019s dark. Furthermore, some events can only be triggered in specific time period. Thus, players can skip current time period by pressing shift button. The only time period cannot be skipped is twilight.\r\n\r\nEven if there is a \u201cpuzzle\u201d tag, there is actually no puzzle in game. However, sometimes you have to think how to solve the situation you encountered in game. When you encounter hingers, you can think what items you had seen and might be useful. Go back to investigate them, you might figure out you can take them now.\r\n\r\nEven though there are tags with exploration and investigation, it\u2019s actually no difference with an RPG. The only different is you cannot take these items anytime.  They can only be taken when the protagonist realizes it\u2019s useful.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T03:38:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/669/6695aad9bc61c6e456ecd3a85254821c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u5b54\u9686\u8a95"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u5b54\u9686\u8a95"], "esrb_rating": null}
