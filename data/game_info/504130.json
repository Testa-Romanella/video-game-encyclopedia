We ended up scrapping and simplifying stuff like the wounds, these were supposed to cost oxygen to repair,\u00a0and statistics like Vitality and Blood, which were supposed to add some more depth to the way you'd end the game.\u00a0Oh, and we all apologize for the horrific code, it is definitely not our proudest work.</p>\n<p>Plugins used;<br/>- ProBuilder package by Unity<br/>- LeanTween by Dented Pixel (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/leantween-3595)<br/>- Bezier Path Creator by Sebastian Lague (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/b-zier-path-creator-136082)</p>\n<p>Audio used;<br/>- \u201cAbyss\u201d from PlayOnLoop.com (Licensed under Creative Commons by Attribution 4.0)<br/>- Various sounds from FreeSounds.org</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T10:15:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59c/59cd1e2ddb9bbda317734f3a2bc2c000.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["RogerV", "MrWahloh", "bverhoeven", "p.klokgieters", "Espy GDS"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
