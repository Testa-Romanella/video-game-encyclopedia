This game is inspired heavily by classic games such as \"Resident Evil\" and \"Silent Hill\".</p>\n<p>You take control of an explorer who hears rumours of the existence of an abandoned research facility owned by \"Skye Chemicals\" before they mysteriously shut their doors back in 1988.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your goal is to explore this facility and uncover the secrets of the corporation before making your escape in order to expose the truth to the world outside the lab doors...</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p>This game operates on a 2D\u00a0plane, but to give it an extra feeling of depth, and to provide a flowing experience in and out of enemy encounters; I have introduced the \"Hide\" system. Any darker parts of a room can be used as hiding spots, but will also let the player squeeze through gaps such as this.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p>You will need to use all resources at your disposal to combat and/or sneak by the horrifying abominations that were birthed in this very facility...</p>\n<p>Will you be able to escape in one piece? Or will you be forced to become one of the shambling pulsing monsters that roam the halls of this abandoned building?</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>All graphics, programming, and 8-bit sound effects are by me.</p>\n<p>Some sounds such as footsteps, monster growls and gunshots were found online and are royalty free. These were edited to better fit the atmosphere of Breach.</p>\n<p>The background music is by \"ThrillShowX\"</p>\n<p>Link:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paRR1vXGgck</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>This game was made in under 3 days for the first \"Retro Game Jam\". I hope you all enjoy this small horror adventure!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-21T03:56:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/127/1273d41baa37023c4677d12696720c6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RetroDEV"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
