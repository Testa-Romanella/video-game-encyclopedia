Keeping the best sheep alive and breeding them will allow you to essentially upgrade the herd. Protect the herd and keep them fed and watered.</p>\n<p>This was kinda more of an experiment, I wanted to see how much of a game I could get an AI to make.</p>\n<p>The sheep and grass graphics come from [google quick draw]([GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)) and I ideally wanted to generate new images on the fly, but couldn't figure it out. Instead it selects images from a small sample of the dataset.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The music comes from [MuseNet](https://openai.com/blog/musenet/) and was generated and then I curated it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The logic for the sheep and wolves is created by a neural network that was trained using reinforcement learning. Unity has a really simple toolkit for this [ml-agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) and basically all I had to do was define the rewards.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T10:27:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e6/5e6c688579c85bb81991d5844fc96c5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["player2point0"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
