This Ludo currently support two players with two houses each. In this game, each player controls eight pieces. The goal of the game is to move all eight pieces home before your opponent.<br/><br/>------------MOVEMENT OF PIECE--------<br/>A player with red house starts the game (in a case of winning, the loser starts the game with red house).<br/>A piece can only come out of house when a die outcome is 6 but a piece that is already on the track can move with any dice outcome. Pieces travel through the track starting from home to the middle of the board. A track contains 56 steps.<br/>A piece can only be removed if it successfully travels through the 56 steps or if it captures opponent's piece.<br/><br/>----------------PIECE CAPTURE-------------------<br/>A player's piece can capture opponent's piece if it ends in a block that is occupied by an opponent's. The captured piece must be  returned home while the player's piece is removed from the board.<br/>The secret of the game is to capture your opponent's piece as many as possible and avoid being captured by your opponent's piece.<br/>A piece cannot capture opponent's piece if the remaining outcome cannot be used.<br/><br/>----------IMPORTANT NOTE-----------<br/>1. A player can only roll dice twice consecutively or more as far as each dice outcome is 6 (first dice outcome = 6 and second dice outcome = 6).<br/>2. Dice outcome must be played before rolling another one no matter the outcome.<br/>3.
