Adding to this is a retro soundtrack and bit crushed dialogue audio.<br/>\r\nThis stylisation can be turned off in the settings, and NPC dialogue is shown in a subtitle box at the bottom of the screen.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T04:19:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e0/5e0788a02536ab8142d7c9a5bc3b7232.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Semble Knights"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Semble Knights"], "esrb_rating": null}
