In Chapter 1, the early alpha game has you play through the prologue of the chapters to come, setting up the world for a great war. Following chapters will have you command the role of other heroes from different races as they are dragged into the fray. The story begins with you, a half-blooded human descendant of the ancient Draconic Order, exiled to an island for the rest of your days. With some skill, intelligence, and some good luck, you just might turn the world upside down and return to the mainland as a powerful warrior mage.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDiscover mysterious tomes, written in different race's native tongue. These can be transcribed at various portals around the island. Holding the items in your hand when near the portal will cause them to 'react', meaning a tome can be transcribed after a few seconds when opened. Learn various spells, and summon legendary Guardians to aide you in Battle. Seek out the epic weapons of fallen Heroes once lost to the Island. You will need Guardians to take down the 4 big bosses you learn of from the notes in the Prison cells beneath the island.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nExplore new areas to find more clues of their whereabouts and defeat the evils that hold them. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe dungeon within the island holds the key to your past and future. There you will find the great Ecirnaus. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWill you give rise to Draconic Order once more?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ac/5ac4a5bb94a3ea5561977dd31c1cb6c3.jpg", "website": "http://DraconicOrder.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 434, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Seek n Destroy Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Seek n Destroy Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
