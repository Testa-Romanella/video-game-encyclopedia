Its supposed to be a nightmare, so thats why the posters in the walls say what they say. Its not me venting while making posters in Ibis paint at 1AM when I wake up at 6AM, I swear... This is my first creation in unity, and probably one of the lasts, but I enjoyed the making!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T04:55:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1bb/1bbc19487f10525c74d10b92fdaf5534.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Locosalmando2247"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
