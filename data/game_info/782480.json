BUON DIVERTIMENTO![ENG] INTERGALACTIC\u00a0WIZARD\u00a0FORCE is\u00a0NOW\u00a0AVAILABLE\u00a0IN\u00a0ITALIAN!!!!!11!!!1!\r\nThanks to ME and ME ONLY!!!!! (Just kidding, me and way too many other people)\r\nABOUT THE GAME\r\n<p>SOOO...\u00a0 briefly, this is how I'd sum up what I've done:</p>\n<ul><li>Played the game as I translated it.</li><li>Revised the punctuation. MY style now!</li><li>Made sure onomatopoeias, other sounds, and the rhythm of the words spoken would match the translated text, or at least offer an interesting variation that wouldn't leave the reader disoriented when it wasn't possible.</li><li>Made sure the sentences had an appropriate length at virtually all times.</li><li>Localised some jokes to includes a few Southern words/tropes. You don't want to pull an Italian Simpsons (e.g.: one side character, one dialect, and heavily at that) on necessarily everything, you want a healthy dose of it. And that's depending on the project too, of course.</li></ul>\n<p>And much more. It would take me an hour to explain everything.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Mandatory \"apologies for any typos or mistakes\" disclaimer here!</strong> This is a jam submission, after all. It's the work of just three days. I hope, however, that the creativity and effort I've poured into this can fully bridge any possible gaps caused by shortcomings in the more strictly technical aspects. <strong>GRAZIE!<br/></strong></p>\n<em><strong>Addendum:</strong></em> I've had to use \"safe\" characters in some spots to make sure the translation CSV worked, as I had some problems when initially uploading and our time to troubleshoot is  limited. As a result, I took some safe bets which made me leave the English credits as they are, to not wrestle with any encoding problems and submit the game straight away.\r\nABOUT ME\r\n<p>21 years old, self-taught translator and graphic designer. Pretty much native-level when it comes to English, fluent in Spanish, bad at German and French. Learning photography and drawing. Knows how to program a bit.<br/></p>\n<p>...And that's it.
