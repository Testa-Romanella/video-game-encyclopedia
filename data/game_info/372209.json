Two players, permanently tethered to one another, must use this condition to their advantage in order to climb out of a deep abyss they have found themselves at the bottom of. Rather than simply jumping up to progress, players will develop their communication and teamwork skills, swinging relative to one-another, synchronising timing-based jumps, and coordinating their actions in order to ascend a series of layers (checkpoints). Each layer brings with it a new mechanic as well as a unique aesthetic for the pair to explore together.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T04:35:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d90/d90afaa939493b38302e5130aa931323.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Games@MQ"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
