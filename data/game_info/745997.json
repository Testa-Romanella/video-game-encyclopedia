As a storyteller, my primary goal was to convey a message through\u00a0<em>Snailblazer</em>. The game seeks to explore the relationship between player and character. Psil the Snail begs you to continue keep playing in order to perpetuate his existence. Psil is aware of his limitations as a digitized object, drawing some inspiration to Magritte's \"The Treachery of Images.\" The player's desires contrast Psil's. On one hand, Psil will only be satisfied if the maze is endless, as this will allow his existence to continue. On the other hand, players do not have limitless time; they want to feel the satisfaction of completing the maze and moving onto other activities. In such a conflict lies the narrative tension. This tension confounds as the puzzles become more complex.\u00a0By the third and final level, for example,\u00a0the puzzles have both vertical and horizontal dimensions.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T04:38:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b47/b47b8806ad5d3970bd313909c09f3fc5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Writer RK Taylor"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
