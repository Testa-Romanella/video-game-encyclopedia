It was made in 48 hours for GMTK Game Jam 2022.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nHow to play:\r\n<p>Each turn all monster dice must be defeated before you can progress to the next turn. If you run out of dice before defeating all of the monsters, the game is over.</p>\n<p>Defeat monsters by dragging a monster dice over to the \"Battle\" box, then drag one or more damage dice into the battle box and click \"Resolve Battle\". If the monster does more damage to your dice than your dice does to it, your dice will be destroyed.</p>\n<p>Upgrading any damage dice will put it into the \"Cooldown\" section. Dice in cooldown cannot be used until your next turn. To upgrade a dice, drag it to the \"Upgrade\" section.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls: Mouse only.</p>\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Myles Doupe - design, code, graphics, sound</p>\n<p>Shanna Doupe - graphics</p>\n<p>Mom &amp; Dad - design</p>\n\r\nDesign notes:\r\n<p>I had a ton more ideas for this game, but ultimately didn't have time to implement much. My initial vision was to have a Luck be a Landlord feel, where there were a ton of upgrades and each upgrade could have vastly different effects that might combo off of each other. I may come back to this someday. Also, I have not played Dicey Dungeons, so I have no idea how many of the ideas I wrote down are similar to that game. :P</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T06:36:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe0/fe002f84a753d6e7322f7c7e47dfd4cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dragon Chasing Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
