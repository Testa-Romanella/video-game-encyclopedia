It jumps, it runs around, it's great. give it a try. <br/><br/>But check this out! Moyashi's stats are randomly generated each time you start the game! Crazy right? One playthrough you could be a tiny lil bean running around collecting stuff and then another you could be a dump truck of a lad barreling through the course. Sounds pretty cool right? <br/><br/>You should give this a try, we had 2 days to make this and we're pretty tired.<br/><br/>Controls:\u00a0<br/>WASD - move<br/>Space - Jump<br/><br/>Moyashi also has controller support! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T12:03:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5cd/5cda250f5da7ec74a395b5a58ef6c0a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Matthew Schreiner"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
