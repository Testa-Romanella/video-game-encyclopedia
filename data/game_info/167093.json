Together, you'll hack into a skills database and steal as much as you can before your adversary overwhelms you.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tBut who is this mysterious counter-hacker?

This will play two sounds (one in each ear) based on the selected defender's color. If the sounds match, you're good. If they don't, that defender should be cycled.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t Cycle. This will change the color of the selected defender and then play two sounds (one in each ear) based on the new color. Keep cycling until the sounds match.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t Shield. Use this to defend against sidesweepers, which show up later in the game. You will hear a beeping sound on one side. When it is almost continuous, make a shield on that side.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t Heal. If you finish cycling your defenders and have extra time, flip down to heal.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe Quick Training mode takes about two minutes to play. When you're ready to take on the campaign, give the stereo headphones to the Professor and make sure they can't see the screen.
