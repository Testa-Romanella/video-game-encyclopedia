Collect the torches and avoid the monsters. The monsters despawn if you run far enough. There is no real end, both torches and monsters spawn every minute.</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE: monsters now spawn a bit further away from you, also added (a very simple) online leaderboard<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-21T04:30:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a84/a843000145d7fdac5d854c438e5d2dbd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Razor"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
