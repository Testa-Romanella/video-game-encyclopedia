But he\u2019s not giving up! Even being completely wrapped up in a web, our hero doesn\u2019t lose courage, and continues moving, hanging on for his dear life!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFergus isn\u2019t the only one strayed in these gloomy rooms: a couple fireflies also couldn\u2019t find an exit. Help Fergus pass all tests, save the fireflies and find a way out.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn this game you\u2019ll have a long and hard journey through the abandoned house, filled with danger. You\u2019ll have to guide the brave fly past the ingenious traps, outsmart the enemies and save those poor fireflies.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe hope that you have enough energy, nerves and savvy to get Fergus out of the scrape.
