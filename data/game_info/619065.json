(the game has a built-in screenshot feature, just press the print key on your keyboard and a screenshot will be taken and saved to the game directory)</p><p>Sandbox mode is the main mode in the game. Here you can draw constellations with configurable amounts of stars. You can still switch to \"below\" in that mode, but there is not much to be done there.</p>\n<p>I unfortunately scoped a bit too high for everything else. Story mode and \"below\" gameplay (and visuals)\u00a0still need a lot more love until they can be called finished.</p>\n<p>Here's an excerpt of\u00a0my list of TODOs for a post-jam version:</p>\n<ul><li>improve story mode / below gameplay by adding more mechanics (pickups to increase amount of star lines drawable, buttons to disable obstacles, maybe a mechanic where the below affects the above,\u00a0making some actual use of overlapping starlines mechanic\u00a0etc.) and by adding some more concrete story along with matching constellations</li><li>turn story mode gameplay into actual puzzles by removing the possibility to go \"bit by bit\" (as seen in level IV)</li><li>build a lot more story mode levels with some actually brainteasing puzzles</li><li>add gamepad support, polish below visuals / UI /\u00a0transitions etc.</li></ul>\n<p>Although far from finished, I'm actually really happy with how the game turned out and look forward to continue working on it.</p>\n<p>And I also look forward to see how other participants interpreted this really great theme!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T13:13:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84c/84c2be5635575910cc1ca6f0b24dc9e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Erkberg"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
