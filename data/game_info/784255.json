I have done all the audio, art and programming myself.</em>\n<p>Here the player is a human with infinite ammos and health. You have to choose among three companions:\u00a0</p>\n<p>1. Blooma the Fairy: A cute and fragile fairy that is extremely fast. She can grant you the ability to sprint.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. Mierko the Bird: A common bird who is averagely built. They can\u00a0 grant you the ability to jump higher.</p>\n<p>3. Kruger the Bat: A hardened bat that has seen the cruelty of\u00a0life. He can grant you the ability to glide.</p>\n<p>You have to choose one to live and let the others die.</p>\n<p>You can use Shift to use your companion's powers.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Each of the above companions have a fixed health where each bullet does 10 damage.\u00a0 They can be damaged both by the enemies and yourself too. The bullets are physics based for fun and can wobble about and kill your own companion.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are more than one way to beat each level. Best of luck on finding them all!! :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T10:07:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/744/7442ab6ebf08d54db77722a5aa00732e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["CybearTron"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
