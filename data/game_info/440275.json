{"id": 440275, "slug": "phantom-battle", "name": "Phantom Battle", "name_original": "Phantom Battle", "description": "<p>-IMPORTANT WE HAVE NOTICED THAT THE GAME DOESN'T WORK WITH MORE THAN 2 PLAYERS, WE WILL CORRECT (IF WE CAN) AFTER THE END OF THE JAM-<br/>A PvP (\u00a0Local Multiplayer Only)\u00a0Top Down shooter with minimal graphics. It would be pretty easy, exept that all the players are invisible.</p>\n<p>Try to understand where you and your enemy are to beat them all,\u00a0but be careful,\u00a0<strong>they can be behind you</strong>.<br/></p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS</p>\n<p>Press WASD/Left Analog\u00a0to move your Character<br/>Press Arrow Keys/Right Analog\u00a0to shoot<br/>Press SHIFT/Right Trigger\u00a0to become instantly visible</p>\n<p>MECHANICS</p>\n<p>All the players are invisible. If you don\u2019t shoot for too long you will become more and more visible with time. This also happen when you touch a wall or another character. You can become visible at will, using the appropriate key.</p>\n<p>The bullets are magnetic and are slightly attracted to the closest enemy.</p>\n<p>All players have 3 Hearts. Every hit reduces Hearts by 1. Loosing all of them leads to death and respawn. When you kill an enemy you gain 1 point. The first player who reaches 5 points win the game.</p>\n<p>DEVELOPMENT<br/></p>\n<p>This game has been developed in 4 days, by me (https://twitter.com/LakeSunset97) and my roommate (Fran314), for the\u00a0 Weekly Game Jam - Week 147 (https://itch.io/jam/weekly-game-jam-147) .The theme is \"invisible\". This is our first game released.</p>\n<p>If you're interested, the source code for the game is\u00a0available on\u00a0GitHub</p>\n<p>KNOWN BUGS</p>\n<ul><li>The menu is buggy and sometimes the selection slide in unpredictable ways. There is some bad collision with the walls and you can shoot through walls if you are moving towards them.</li><li>The game will look funky if you resize the window in a non-16:9 ratio. This also applies if you go fullscreen on a screen with an aspect ratio different to 16:9.</li><li>Only tested with Keyboard and Xbox controllers.</li></ul>\n<p>CREDITS</p>\n<ul><li>Main Menu Music: \"Can't Stop My Feet\" by Loyalty Freak Music, from freemusicarchive.org</li><li>Level Music: \"Divide by Zero\", from PlayOnLoop.com</li><li>This Videogames uses these sounds from freesound:<ul><li>teleport by Sergenious (\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/Sergenious/\u00a0)</li><li>laser by kafokafo\u00a0(\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/kafokafo/)</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T03:11:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfb/cfb0c03e9455e34a1d50f240a53016cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LakeSunset"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
