One evening, she loses track of time while sight-seeing and becomes lost in the woods. Just as she's about to consider camping outdoors for the night, Miranda happens upon a hauntingly beautiful castle. She decides to venture inside, but nothing could have prepared her for the bloody sight she beholds there...or for the two vampires who capture her.<br/>\n</p>\r\nCHARACTERS\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Miranda Namatgira</strong> is a Belgian history and architecture buff who is studying European history and art in college. She is bright and generally optimistic, but can also be sharp-tongued and sarcastic. Miranda likes to help people and often gets into trouble because of her unwillingness to give up. Luckily, her sensitivity and skills of perception have helped her out on multiple occasions.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Luca Faveaux</strong> is a cold man who possesses a dry wit. A third generation vampire, his duty is to serve and protect the Nachtigal family, particularly Adrian. He is not one to suffer fools lightly and often clashes with Adrian on matters of propriety. At first, he believes it would be best for Adrian and the Nachtigal family if Miranda is killed, but over time his opinion of her changes...\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Adrian van de Nachtigal</strong>, Count de Mercy-Argenteau-d'Ochain, is a very confident vampire who is in constant search of entertainment. Being the youngest of his second generation siblings, he's used to being doted on. He is intrigued by Miranda, but gets angry when she tries to pry into his secrets... Though he may not always admit it, he is very thankful for Luca's friendship and guidance.\r\n</p>\r\nEND NOTES\r\n<p>\n<strong>Nachtigal</strong> is a short otome game by Cyanide Tea about vampires.
