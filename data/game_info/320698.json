The limitation was \"no water\".</p>\n<p>Fight endless waves of bad AI disguised as pirates!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You move around your target using the arrow keys or WASD. <br/>The game has a targeting feature, which means that you will always look towards a target. To swap target, use the SPACE key.\u00a0<br/>Use your cutlass to perform a melee attack\u00a0with Z or RIGHT CTRL. <br/>You shoot your gun with X or RIGHT\u00a0SHIFT. You can only shoot if your \"gun gauge\" is full. To fill the gun gauge, you must hit a target with a melee attack.</p>\n<ul><li>Movement: arrow keys or\u00a0WASD keys.</li><li>Swap target: SPACE.</li><li>Melee attack: Z\u00a0key or RIGHT\u00a0CTRL.</li><li>Shoot gun: X\u00a0key or RIGHT\u00a0SHIFT.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Future:</strong></p>\n<p>I plan to add player vs. player after the game jam has ended.
