{"id": 58927, "slug": "wwe-2k19", "name": "WWE 2K19", "name_original": "WWE 2K19", "description": "<p>WWE 2K19 is a game based on the World Wrestling Entertainment pro wrestling staged fights. It is the twentieth installment in its series.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls a wrestler and fights another wrestler on an arena. Unlike its predecessor, WWE 2K18, WWE 2K19 abandoned all attempts to create realistic wrestling simulation. Instead, it features a more arcade, fast-paced gameplay. </p>\n<h3>Characters</h3>\n<p>There are more than 20 playable characters in the game. All of them are based on the real World Wrestling Entertainment fighters, both male and female. The roster is not based on a particular championship and instead features wrestlers from both present and various eras of the past. It includes such wrestling stars as Undertaker, The Rock, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and Triple H. The player can also create a completely new, customizable wrestler.</p>\n<h3>Modes</h3>\n<p>There are many modes in the game, aimed at both single and multiplayer experience. The main mode is MyCareer, which follows the rookie wrestler created by the player as he eventually becomes a WWE star. His coach is the fictional Barron Blade, who also appeared in earlier games. The game also features multiple \u201cTowers\u201d modes, such as MyPlayer, WWE Towers, Gauntlet Tower, and Steps Tower. Each of the \u201cTowers\u201d is a series of challenges with mode-specific rules. There&#39;s also Showcase Mode that follows the career of a specific wrestler, this time it&#39;s Daniel Bryan. WWE 2K19 also reintroduces The Road to Glory mode.</p>", "metacritic": 76, "released": "2018-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-29T12:37:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d1c/d1c1b52e9ee800c2d434d25afa3cf487.jpg", "website": "http://wwe.2k.com/", "rating": 3.58, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 8, "owned": 317, "beaten": 42, "toplay": 10, "dropped": 36, "playing": 11}, "playtime": 18, "achievements_count": 210, "ratings_count": 102, "suggestions_count": 260, "game_series_count": 9, "reviews_count": 105, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["2K", "Visual Concepts", "Yuke's Co"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": ["2K Games"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
