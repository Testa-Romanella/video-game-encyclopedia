Yin and Yang are in pairs, such as the moon and the sun, female and male, dark and bright, cold and hot, passive and active, etc. But Yin and Yang are not static or just two separated things. The nature of Yin Yang lies in interchange and interplay of the two components. The alternation of day and night is such an example.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:31:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/001/0019346bc86fa2d3248900be317ec53a_FjatGwQ.jpg", "website": "http://www.squrce.com/taijitu", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["particlemade"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["chew wen kang"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
