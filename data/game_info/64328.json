To collect coins, you need to calculate the trajectory and choose the tactics of the shot.<br/>\r\nThe game has 30 thoughtful, interesting levels.<br/>\r\nA limited number of shots are available in each level.<br/>\r\nIn Lucky Shot there are also bonuses and lives. Lives is accumulated either for a successfully passed level, or every two minutes. Lives can be exchanged for a bonus - highlighting the trajectory of the shot.
