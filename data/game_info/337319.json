Anything paranormal in this world that you can think of, Taylor has witnessed. Werewolves? A pack lives out in their yard. Vampires? One probably attempted to kidnap them last Tuesday. Spirits? A demon lives in his attic, a poltergeist in the kitchen, and a shadow person takes turns running the dishwasher with them. They don't know <em>why</em> weirdness is drawn to them, it's just all they know. As a means of coping, they\u2019ve grown rather bored by it.\r\n</p>\n<p>The library in the basement of Taylor's house is also an interesting phenomena. The contents change every few hours or so, and hold every type of media you could possibly imagine. The only shelf that never seems to change is the shelf containing the works of HP Lovecraft. Fitting, really.</p>\n<p>One day, after a somewhat peaceful morning, they go down to the basement to find that the Lovecraft bookshelf has changed, if only slightly: a purple book sits on the shelf, where it wasn't for years prior.</p>\n<p>Upon opening the book, a purple-haired girl climbs out. Making a strange declaration about Taylor's nature and an even stranger declaration about matricide, she whisks them away to another dimension. Along the way, maybe Taylor will learn about the nature of their existence, about the tension building in the lives of these new goddesses around him, maybe even find a way to stop the universe as we know it from decaying into nothingness.</p>\n<p>Or, you know, they could die. I guess there's only one way to find out.</p>\n<br/>\u00a0<br/>\n<p>If you'd like to join our discord, the link is here <br/></p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/pnZQYwn<br/></p>\n\n<p>This is just the <strong>demo</strong> for Lovecraft, but it will bring you a close experience to what the final game will be like.
