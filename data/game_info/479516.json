Also thanks to my Twitch viewers:), Okay as you see i ran out of time and game became very short. I still hope you can enjoy it and see potential of those mechanics. I just wish i could use same method that game uses and go back in time. And i hope you undertsand controls, they are not hard....</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T11:05:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5e/f5e04b9ab37d6ddf060b6bd02b3db66d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tipu"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
