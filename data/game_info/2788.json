(all permission granted in full)<br/><br/>In this unique side-scrolling shooter, you control your ship and destroy enemies, all the while catching the enemy&amp;#39;s broken pieces. Enemy pieces can be collected by your ship and used to counterattack enemies. You can earn a bonus score by keeping many pieces stuck at once. Stuck pieces are destroyed when they touch a enemy&amp;#39;s bullet. The slow/pull-in button lets you decrease the ship&amp;#39;s speed and fix its direction. Its a fun challenging game and is a must have for any shmup (shoot &amp;#39;em up) fan!<br/><br/>Note: the slow/pullin button on the right will decrease the maximum velocity of your ship and will hide any piece stuck to it for an easier navigation in a sea of bullets.<br/><br/>The game contains 5 very challenging levels for countless hours of enjoyment. How far can you get?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:28:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e9/7e97a01ff2b7633d7cf3914abae165f4.jpeg", "website": "http://dreamawakegames.net", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Dreamawake Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Jeremy Patterson"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
