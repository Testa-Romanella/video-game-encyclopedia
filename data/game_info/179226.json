{"id": 179226, "slug": "hex-origins-itch", "name": "Hex: Origins (itch)", "name_original": "Hex: Origins (itch)", "description": "<p>Hex: Origins is a casual puzzle game based on a complete hexagon themed colorful experience. Enjoy a refreshing, calming and original experience, which is extremely easy to pick up but hard to master as you progress in the game. Across the multitude of game modes and levels you will encounter, you must place pieces composed of anywhere from 2 to 10 and more hexagons, each using up to 6 different colors.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Everything in the game is based on two simple rules:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>You can place a piece anywhere on the board with no restrictions as long as all the neighboring tiles are empty.</li><li>If one hex has a colored neighbor on the board, at least one of those neighbors needs to match its color.</li></ul>\n<p>Building upon these simple rules, we added special board pieces and power-ups in order to create a fun and colorful experience. As long as you keep placing pieces on the board, its requirements for placing pieces change - so be careful about the order, colors and type of shapes you can use. Always plan ahead!</p>\n<p>Available on Steam with level editor and workshop integration!</p>\n<p>Get Hex: Origins on Steam<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\n<p>Hex: Origins offers you 4 different game modes, 2 available from the start, and 2 unlocked with tokens you earn while playing the game:</p>\n<ul><li>Classic: a linear experience bundled up in Episodes, structured into 6 Chapters, each containing 6 Levels that you can play in 3 difficulties.
