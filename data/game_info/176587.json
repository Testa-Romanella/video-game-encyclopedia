(sorry, I ran out of time)<br/>- No animations for adventurers (again, ran out of time)<br/>- I probably could have made prettier laser/particles, too.</p><p>Blinky, The Simple Beholder has been stuck underground guarding his dungeon for too long, and now he just wants to go out and explore the outside world!</p><p>There's only one problem... in order for Blinky to get outside he has to sneak past a hoard of dangerous adventurers!</p><p>Blink is a strong beholder, so he can blast away the adventurers with his magic eyes! He can't really control his strength though, so every time he uses his magic eyes, they explode!</p><p>Can you help Blink get outside without blowing up all of his eyes?</p><p>Controls:<br/>X to Start<br/>Arrow Keys to Move<br/>Escape to Quit</p><p>Instructions:<br/>Venture through each level of the dungeon until you reach the outside world!<br/>Hide in the shadows to avoid being seen by the adventurers.<br/>If you get seen, Blink will blast away the adventurers, but lose one of his eyes in the process!<br/>If Blinky loses all of his eyes the game is over... :(</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d37/d37a0b2fc16ec8524fa69cbcb94bea40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["twistedshield"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
