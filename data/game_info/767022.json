Oxygen level dropped, sea level rose and fresh water became scarce. The worst was the soil pollution as many went hungry.\r\n</p>\n<p>The WCRP estimated that the Earth will become inhabitable in the next 100 years. Mass protests ensued.\r\n</p>\n<p>With angry citizens breathing down their necks no spare planet in sight the governments of the Earth met up in Stockholm for a discussion. They decided to control their carbon print, invest in clean energy and to stop mining harmful materials for at least 150 years. This became known as the Stockholm convention of 2145.\r\n</p>\n<p>By the end of 2148, it was obvious that the solution was not feasible despite stricter measures. The supplies were dwindling and Earth still needed those resources. The governments met again in Washington the same year and decided to do outsource mining to a different planet \u2013 Kepler 452b.\r\n</p>\n<p>While the planet was not habitable, it was abundant with ore, oil, natural gas and other minerals.\r\n</p>\n<p>In 2152 they sent a team of scientists with a squadron of robots on a mining mission. It was a success. So much that they decided to move the production there\r\n</p>\n<p>Now, 50 years later, there are fabrics and a whole fleet of ships on Kepler.\r\n</p>\n<p>Your squadron is in charge of mining the most important assets \u2013 oil, natural gas, platinum, lithium and plutonium.\r\n<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T20:55:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/275/27506af6d503f50257fb702fa541ee73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jammed Game"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
