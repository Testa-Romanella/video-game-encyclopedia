But here is the rough concept.</p>\r\nStory\r\n<p>You're Dick Daring! The most daring of all digital dicks, currently in pursuit of the intergalactic gangster Monsignor Arriacini. You've managed to damage the villain's intergalactic engine, but he's still hiding out there in the vastness of space.</p>\n<p>Using the short(Q) and long(E) range sensors of your trusty spaceship Silverbullet(W,A,S,D) you must patrol the emptiness of space to find the evildoer and blast him to bits.</p>\n<p>The blasting to bits is still pending.</p>\r\nWhat Works\r\n<ul><li>WASD movement.</li><li>The enemy ship following a path</li><li>A ghost that follows the enemy ship at varying distances(This is what the player will eventually see when using their radars)</li><li>Turning on/off long range and short range sensors.</li></ul>\r\nWhat Doesn't Work\r\n<ul><li>Basically everything else :P</li><li>Can't shoot the ship's gun.</li><li>No win or loss condition and screens.</li><li>No UI.</li><li>No sound or sound effects.</li></ul>\r\nConclusion\r\n<p>Having never really worked with Godot, I can honestly say that if you're like me and have got industry experience with Unity, and Unreal. Godot feels quite familiar, but in some ways easier and still powerful. I would need to develop a full title and launch it to really give an honest opinion about it.</p>\n<p>I will say that I'm not particularly fond of GD, and would much prefer to use C#, Python, JS or Ruby. After all those are the languages that the industry runs on. If Godot wants to be taken seriously as an alternative for commercial applications, downplaying GD might be part of that journey. I did find that there is support for other languages in Godot, which is brilliant. But the default is still GD and is the thing in which most of the documentation is written in. That being said, I didn't fnd GD obnoxious, difficult to use or picky, more like a layer on top of Python really.</p>\n<p>In conclusion I will say that I loved using Godot for this game jam. I hope to keep working on this project and perhaps even do a small release so truly test out Godot's feature set.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T07:36:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ee/3ee98947ceb6208305da4a8679318525.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PoutineWithSalchichon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
