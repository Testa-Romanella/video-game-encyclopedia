As part of our programme, we got together and made three games together. This is our third game, Dale the Dragon Detective: Murder at Dungeon Mountain.</p>\n<p>This is a game made over the course of 8 weeks full time at The Game Assembly Malm\u00f6.\u00a0The engine is custom-made, and the base was carried over from our last projects: saveTheWorld.exe and\u00a0Spite: Into the Ratacombs.\r\n</p>\n<p>You play as Dale, a cute dragon on his mission to figure out who killed Mr Elwood. Journey through the forest and into the Sky Castle, through to the Underdark, to find everything there is to know. Collect butterflies (that totally have a purpose I promise) and fly through wonderful environments.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T11:05:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81c/81cea7aec3db71008bb91f3a96751a1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["totalaj"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
