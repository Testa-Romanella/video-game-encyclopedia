This is a game where the player will impersonate god and can decide the fate of the planet Earth by just rolling two dice.</p>\n<p>God Plays With Dice\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions please red before to play because I had no time for a tutorial\u00a0:-)\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>This is a god game sand box; There was not time to design a tutorial but I have left some notes in the level to help you out.\u00a0The chicken, God,\u00a0 needs to guess a roll of a dice, fate. You can roll the dice by activating a switch, named infernal machine,\u00a0then you need to run to the right side of the screen an sit on a pressure pad\u00a0to guess the number.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you move out of the pad then you will not be able to guess the dice roll.\r\n</p>\n<p>There is a gate that can teleport you from the left to the right side of the level. Most of the time you need to run against time to reach the pressure pad.\r\n</p>\n<p>Some other time not even God can reach the right side of the level to make his guess because he hasn't got enough time.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you guess right the planet won't be hurt otherwise the planet would be bombed, population killed and houses destroyed :-)\r\n</p>\n<p>Life is unpredictable, not even God knows the outcomes!\u00a0\r\n</p><p>CREDITS</p><p>Developer: Alessandro\u00a0Ambrosone</p><p>Musician: Peter Hawkey:\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/peterhawkey</p><p>Artist for pixel art: Pete\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T16:38:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0a/e0acbee6b196f678795fc977566d5133.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kingpengstudio"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
