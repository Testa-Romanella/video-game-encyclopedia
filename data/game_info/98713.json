{"id": 98713, "slug": "terra-new-moon", "name": "Terra: New Moon", "name_original": "Terra: New Moon", "description": "<p>Terra (2010) was released originally on the RPGmaker VX platform, after it's endemic failure due to several bad design choices and a lack of my own touch, it quickly was forgotten in favor of Intelligence (2011) which would mark the beginnings of my personal success. Sometimes I felt Terra could have been good had I given it more of a chance, however, it always struck me as such an overly-ambitious game, and Menagerie easily creamed it. With RPGmakerMV's release, I started more or less as a joke, working on a completely new version of Terra built from the ground. The joke however, outrageously backfired, and now I actually really like what I've gone and made. It would be injustice to not let your eyes behold what I've made in... less than a week!<br/></p><p>In a world with no sun, three moons orbit to give a perpetual sense of night, this is the world of Terra, a land of magic, wonder and evil. The President of the Atamos Corporation and his 12 Elected officials are seeking to free the Ancient buried Gemini Angels whom were imprisoned beneath Terra's surface in the molten core millennia ago. The people largely object to this, and soon enough Vengeance, a terrifying Dragonar the size of a city is sent by ambiguous forces to deal with the Atamos Corporation and the threat they pose to reality. This backfires when the Atamos Corporation manages to take control of the beast, and use it to keep the citizenry in check. From all this madness, a young girl, barely out of the academy, seeks to free her people from the jaws of tyranny after vengeance destroys her hometown, and the walls that once trapped her along with it-- which allowed her to be free. Now privy of the frivolous upstart, she is hunted by the Atamos Corporation, thus Teratown is the next target of the Corrupted Guardian.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e07/e07e5541ecee7602e1b5b5266a72179d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 327, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Bizarre Monkey"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
