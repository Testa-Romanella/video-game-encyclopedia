It may have a bad experience.<br/>The promotional videos and pictures at the top of this page are all the contents of this game.<br/><br/><br/><strong> What player is this game suitable for? </strong><br/><br/>It is suitable for players who do not have time to play games in work and study, but want to see the game value increase.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong> How to play this game? </strong><br/><br/>This game basically doesn't need to be played. Just hang up. When you are free, change equipment, add attribute points, skill points, and change maps.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong> What is the ultimate goal of this game </strong><br/><br/>Perhaps when the game crashed due to the collapse of the value, the damage value of 10 billion can be basically hit at level 500 during the test.<br/><br/>After level 500, the value will increase crazily, but I'm not going to limit it. The battle value of astronomical numbers is the soul of this game.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong> Will it be updated later? </strong><br/><br/>As long as it is not a bug that seriously affects the game, it will not be updated.<br/><br/>All suggestions and opinions will be adopted and changed in next game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T03:49:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e2/9e227f1cea82965a3da4bb923758ce30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SixLonDuck", "\u516d\u8f6e\u9e2dSixLonDuck"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["\u516d\u8f6e\u9e2dSixLonDuck"], "esrb_rating": null}
