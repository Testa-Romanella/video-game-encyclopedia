After the massive super volcano erupted sending the earth into darkness we have been seeing some seriously crazy stuff. There has been all sorts of creatures just pouring out of the earth from the cracks that have formed.  You will be dropped in a area that has been deemed very hostile and needs to be controlled. There are weapons laying around as well as ammo. We will pay and reward you for each creature you kill. This will allow you to purchase the weapons that are laying around, use everything to your advantage and stay alive as long as you can. That's it nothing else to it,  There are also traps on each map that you can use to your advantage.  The purpose of the game is to get through as many waves of creatures as you can while in hostile elements.  Stay alive and see how long you can. Good luck and happy fighting!!! As the game develops we will be adding guns, monsters and melees.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlease visit our Discord.. link posted in basic info", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T02:56:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f65/f65ccbdbeba6d62f0a0e19b368a90f8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 7, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 280, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IGS Ghost", "IGS Nate", "IGS Kitty", "IGS Redbarnacles", "TheIndieDev"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Invisible Ghost Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
