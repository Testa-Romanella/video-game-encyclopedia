{"id": 816394, "slug": "sakura-succubus-6", "name": "Sakura Succubus 6", "name_original": "Sakura Succubus 6", "description": "This Visual Novel picks up where Sakura Sucubus 5 left off, Ogasawara Hiroki finds himself in Astoria: a small European country with a chilly climate, where it often snows.<br/><br/>Hiroki went to Astoria as Hifumi\u2019s plus one, after the famous actress and reigning karuta queen was invited to stay in the royal palace at Princess Stephania\u2019s behest. Stephania originally intended to challenge Hifumi to another karuta match, after previously losing to her \u2013 but, upon meeting Hiroki, Stephania soon falls for him.<br/><br/>Hiroki is already one of the most envied men in Japan (if not, the world), owing to the recently publicized news of his relationship with Yamamoto Hifumi, not to mention his ongoing affairs with the famous businesswoman Wakatsuki Marina, and the tennis star Hazel Williams, but now he finds himself presented with yet another adoring woman.<br/><br/>Hiroki used to be average, but now his life is anything but!<br/><br/>Will Hiroki\u2019s relationship with Stephania work out? Will the pair of them be able to stay together, even when Hiroki returns to Japan \u2013 and, perhaps more worryingly, will Hiroki be able to withstand the hatred of his co-workers?<br/><br/>It\u2019s hard being so popular!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hifumi is an actress who has appeared in a slew of popular movies over the last decade. She tends to appear in a lot of period dramas, and most of her roles are of demure, refined women.<br/><br/>In her private life, Hifumi is fairly traditional herself, what with her fondness for traditional Japanese clothes and for traditional Japanese sports, but she isn\u2019t quite as reserved as people tend to think.<br/><br/>Hifumi is, in fact, a succubus, and she\u2019s not shy about making the moves on Hiroki \u2013 or about letting him know just how much she adores him.<br/><br/><br/>Successful businesswoman by day, succubus by night, Marina is one of the oldest members of Hiroki\u2019s harem. Fabulously wealthy, but also level-headed, it often falls upon Marina to keep the younger succubi in line: Ayu and Cosmos in particular.<br/><br/>Marina likes to take charge, both in the boardroom and the bedroom, but she has a gentle side, too. She\u2019s more compassionate than she looks, and she loves Hiroki and her silly succubus sisters a good deal \u2013 even if they annoy her.<br/><br/><br/>Hazel is a tennis star whose quick serves and inexhaustible energy have taken the sporting world by storm. There\u2019s nothing Hazel loves more than the thrill of facing off against a tough opponent \u2013 apart, perhaps, from seducing pretty girls (receptionists with flower-themed names in particular).<br/><br/>Hazel is so perpetually cheerful it borders on aggressive, and she talks so much, it can be hard to get a word in edgeways around her. Still, she\u2019s a lot of fun to be with, and it\u2019s easy to relax and unwind around her \u2013 when she\u2019s not trying to force people to go jogging at 05:00 AM.<br/><br/><br/>Stephania is the young princess of Astoria. Born into a life of luxury, Stephania nonetheless grew up lonely, as her over-protective parents rarely allowed her to leave the palace.<br/><br/>Stephania is polite and softly-spoken, but she has a passionate side which comes bursting out whenever she plays karuta.<br/><br/>She might seem sweet and innocent, but she also has something of a mischievous streak, and, as a child, one of her dearest wishes was to run away from home and join the circus. Now, however, she dreams about being Hiroki\u2019s girlfriend.<br/><br/><br/>Elizabeth is Stephania\u2019s maid, who is intensely devoted to her young mistress. She\u2019s incredibly talented, and can cook, clean, sew, and \u2013 in short \u2013 do absolutely anything that\u2019s expected of her. She can even give kissing lessons, should the need arise.<br/><br/>Elizabeth is aware that Stephania has feelings for Hiroki, and she seems determined to pair the two of them together. Selfless to a fault, she only wants to see Stephania smile \u2013 but how does Elizabeth feel about Hiroki herself?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T04:25:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f97/f978ca3e77dfb0762b0f98a8b67e0751.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 30, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 407, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Winged Cloud"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Winged Cloud"], "esrb_rating": null}
