As the gum begins to gain sentience it realizes it can draw power from the radioactive waste by carrying the waste with it.</p>\n<p>Use the toxic sludge stored in your bubblegum bubble sack to solve puzzles and slay fantastic beasts- scratch that. Use your bubble butt to solve puzzles and brutally murder measly rats. End Goal: World Domination. Although maybe you should start by getting out of that sewer first.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T14:14:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4a/b4a1928453deca2a26a5ef7dad8c06ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["unhingethepanda"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
