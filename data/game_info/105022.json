Visit http://bitsandbytescomic.tumblr.com/ to read the full thing in english, if you please.<br/></p>\n<p>This is the story of Nolan Nett, owner, manager, and main chef at <em>Bits &amp; Bytes</em>, a restaurant for <em>Videogame Characters</em>. The main \"hook\" of the webcomic is to see situations and events based on both videogame characters and their personalities, and current events and news of the videogame industry.</p>\n<p>All my current projects (webcomics, games, videos) are free of charge, made more than anything else because I loved working on them and sharing them with the world.
