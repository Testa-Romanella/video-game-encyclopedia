Be careful, your opponent can hurt you as well.\u00a0</p><p>Once the game starts, you must move the player (located at the left-hand side) using A &amp; D and punch the enemy by pressing space. Beat your enemy until he's out of lives!</p><p>Some difficulties we faced when developing our prototype was working with the animations themselves and working on hit boxes. We overcame the animation problem by coming up with an alternative (which took up a lot of time) and cutting the enemy to only one per \"stage\", this way our hit boxes work and animations will run.</p><p>In the future we plan on adding better interfaces to the game as well as more sprite animations! We also hope to add more stages and a wider variety of enemies.</p><p>Thank you to all the TAs for helping us with the development of this small project and we thank Kyle Dencker for teaching us the concepts of game development within Java.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b03/b03251daa84470de7801e79a95acf735.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Phildesro"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
