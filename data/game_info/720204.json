{"id": 720204, "slug": "florence-nightingale", "name": "Florence Nightingale", "name_original": "Florence Nightingale", "description": "<p>Our game allows you to empathize the achievements of Florence Nightingale,\u00a0 founder of modern nursing and an icon of Victorian culture. Nightingale came to prominence while serving as a nurse during the Crimean War, in which she organised care for wounded soldiers at Constantinople.</p>\n<p>You play as Florence Nightingale at Selimiye Barracks in Scutari around 1855. When you arrived one year before, you found that poor care for wounded soldiers was being delivered.</p>\n<p>Thanks to a plea you've sent to The Times for a government solution to the poor condition of the facilities, you can now modernize the facility and have the equipment to process food for the patients</p>\n\n<p>The goal of the game is to take care of the incoming wounded soldiers, keeping their death rate low by upgrading your equipment (the beds) and treating the wounded with food and medicine.</p>\n<p>You play our game only with the mouse. Actions can only be executed, when certain conditions are met.</p>\r\nYour patients\r\n<p>Incoming soldiers suffer from wounds and sicknesses. Some are suffering more than others.</p>\n\r\nActions related to hospitalized soldiers\r\n<p><strong>Assign</strong> a bed to the next soldier waiting at the entrance, better beds improve the healing.</p>\n<p><strong>Upgrade</strong> a bed to the next level, money is needed for that, the bed must be empty.</p>\n<p>Improve the patients health with <strong>Give Meal</strong>. You can cook meals from food you've bought. Wounded soldiers profit more than sick ones.</p>\n<p>Improve the patients health with <strong>Give Medicine</strong>. You can buy medicine for money. Sick soldiers profit more than wounded ones.</p>\n<p><strong>Clean</strong> the beds to improve healing conditions and to prevent infections (not implemented).</p>\r\nOther actions\r\n<p>The following actions take a certain amount of time. During that time, you can't take care of other things.</p>\n<p>You can <strong>Cook Meal</strong> in the kitchen from food you have bought.</p>\n<p><strong>Write Plea</strong> to the English Press to raise donations from the people and government.</p>\n<p><strong>Wash Hands</strong> after cleaning beds. When you cook meals with dirty hands, they are wasted.</p>\n<p>Cleaning and washing hands needs water. You can <strong>Fetch Water</strong> when running out of it.</p>\r\nHow to get money\r\n<p>Recovered soldiers give you a small amount of money to express their gratitude. Writing a Plea to the English press is another way of getting money in form of donations.</p>\r\nMissing winning condition - and a suggestion\r\n<p>We haven't had the time to implement a proper winning condition / victory screen. Our suggestion would be to consider yourself successful when all your beds are upgraded and when you are able to take care of all incoming soldiers instantly and properly (having enough money for food and medicine at hand) and no more victims are to be feared. Your hospital in such a case should somehow look like this.</p>\n\r\nThank you!\r\n<p>Thanks for playing and rating!
