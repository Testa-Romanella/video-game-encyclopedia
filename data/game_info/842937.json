This makes for interesting puzzels and some unique jumping.<br/></p>\n<p>Note: You can easily switch between levels with the 1, 2 and 3 buttons on your keyboard.</p>\n<p>This game is ment to be played with two players on one keyboard. Now if you happen to live alone or just no one is around to play, we recommend that you use a program like Parsec to stream your screen and controls.<br/></p>\n<p>As mentioned before this game was made for the 8th Brackeys game jam where the theme was: 'You're not alone'. We implemented this by making a multiplayer game where you work together. Some of the inspiration came from the mod Partnership\u00a0for Celeste.</p>\n<p>The game was made by myself and Rinke Oosterdijk. Who is a good friend of mine.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T08:31:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/647/64778b4d5ecd9e6a67920d3ecb8dc87b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheCyberOne"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
