After yet another mishandled delivery, you've been given a 10-level sentence in the Pilot Improvement Program. Play through each level and try to beat the developer's times! After, go into the shared-keyboard 2-player mode to fight a friend in a fast-paced dogfight!</p>\n<p>This is my first game, so any feedback would be greatly appreciated! I put the option to donate, but feel free to pay nothing.\u00a0Please let me know if something doesn't work properly!\u00a0Also, the game isn't as choppy as the trailer makes it look, it was just filmed on a laptop.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T07:27:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90f/90f5b584c93a05800fad84a5633c3cb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["SoftPretzelGames"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
