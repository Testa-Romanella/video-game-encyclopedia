{"id": 264002, "slug": "rings-of-color-lite", "name": "Rings of Color Lite", "name_original": "Rings of Color Lite", "description": "The object is to match the colored rings around the same colored balls. Just click the red button to rotate the four surrounding rings clockwise until they match the right colors in the center. The first levels are really simple to solve but then the levels gradually gets more challenging.<br/> <br/> Rings of Color is an interesting rotation game where you must rotate the same colored rings to the same colored centers. You are trying to do this in the least amount of moves possible and the game keeps a tally of how many moves you made. Its a very interesting and challenging game, but one that gives you a satisfying feeling in the end because you can always beat it even if you take 1000 moves to do it. The real trick is to look for patterns. You can\u2019t just concentrate on the rings one at a time because most of the time two or more will be connected in one movement. Try to get movement where you can align two or more of them at the same time in their needed positions.<br/> <br/>- \"Very addictive\"<br/><br/>The lite version has 6 challenging levels.<br/>Purchase to get all 12 levels.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:01:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/195/195a2403a0a8c69ddf9a5ae4117d7b72.jpg", "website": "http://cazualgamez.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Michael Friedman"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Michael Friedman"], "esrb_rating": null}
