Heroes of two iconic series of fighting games will battle against each other at the most popular locations from both franchises.</p>\n<h3>Story and setting</h3>\n<p>Despite the format, the game has a story: according to it, the world was hit by a cataclysm - an object of unknown origin fell into Antarctica. It emits water-like energy that enhances the capabilities of the fighters. For most fighters, the story is standard. The exception is made for the anchor characters from both series: Ryu and Ken or Kazuya and Nina. In total, the game has 38 characters, 19 of each series.</p>\n<h3>Key Features</h3>\n<p>In terms of gameplay, the game is a mix of two combat systems: there are mechanics as Super Combos and EX Attacks from Street Fighter built into the classic for Tekken gameplay. All characters from SF series are controlled by a six-button system, and for Tekken fighters, a standard four-button control is available. Players choose two characters: one from each universe. Fighters can be changed right during the battle. The game also features two new mechanics: the Gem System and Pandora Mode. Thanks to the first, the player can put up to three gems on the fighter that improve from the characteristics, and the second turns on when one of the fighters left less than 25% of health. In this case, this character can be sacrificed in favor of Pandora Mode, which enhances the remaining character strength and gives an infinite Cross Gauge.</p>", "metacritic": 81, "released": "2011-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-24T04:47:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/1e2/1e23f3c3e83e8fb562c58408b3d5fd63.jpg", "website": "http://www.streetfighter.com", "rating": 3.32, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 39, "owned": 1128, "beaten": 87, "toplay": 12, "dropped": 94, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 110, "ratings_count": 172, "suggestions_count": 662, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 173, "platforms": ["PS Vita", "PC", "iOS", "PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["Capcom", "Capcom U.S.A"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": ["Capcom"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
