The second one, with enemies and basic platforms, is generally only a placeholder for future levels.<br/></p>\n<p> The core gameplay should consist of a fighting part for which the opera singer (the brute) is used and a puzzle part for which the Doc and his special \"Liquid Gun\" should be used. For the first version only the Doc and his gun exist, which can be used to damage enemies (right now also only place holders).<br/><br/>Everything was done by:</p>\n<p>Programming: SchuhFiedel - https://schuhfiedel.itch.io/<br/>Game Art: Dominopl - https://dominopl.itch.io/<br/>Game Art: Raphiiee - https://raphiiee.itch.io/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T10:33:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a92/a92a62da062818540e58587256af7486.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Max", "Raphiiee", "Dominopl"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
