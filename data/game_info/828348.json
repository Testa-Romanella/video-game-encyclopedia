Use and abuse physics glitches to score more points, it's part of the fun.</p>\n<p><strong>** ISSUES **:</strong>\u00a0I believe the most annoying issue is regarding the black bars cause by resolution errors. Try ALT+Enter a couple of times to see if it's fixed.\u00a0There are other bugs I've encountered but didn't have the time to fix.\u00a0I bet there are a million others that I don't know, so please play and\u00a0tell me about them!</p>\n<p>I hope you have fun playing. Tell me about your highest scores! My current one is 1930.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T18:13:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48b/48b2cd7b978b72a30d32db938e422aa5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vcesauron"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
