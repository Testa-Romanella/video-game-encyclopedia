But that's not all, if you are able to somehow survive the first three nights you will find yourself in\u00a0a boss battle with a Leather face inspired monster that lives in a basement of a farm house.\u00a0\r\n- Note, This game requires you to solve mysteries to access the next levels. Simply search the rooms for hidden secrets to help you :)\r\nAlso please note that one thing I noticed from the Alpha-Build, was that gamers were enjoying the game but they encountered several crashes to solve\u00a0 this problem I have set the graphics to low to begin with, to make the graphics better simply navigate to the options in the main-menu.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/>-- Please note, I am uploading this as an April Fools joke. This is a project that I had released originally two years ago, but am just re-uploading it to see if there would be any interest if I were to start developing it again.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T04:36:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d9/4d920979bc9e95785ff6b382b27e1b95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 247, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ScotianWolf"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
