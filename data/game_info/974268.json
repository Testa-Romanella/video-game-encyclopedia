You take on the role of a \u201cbrain hacker\u201d detective who is skilled at hacking into the human brain to solve complex crimes. You are about to hack into an airship crash survivor's brain and probe into his memories in order to uncover the horrible truth behind the incident.<h3>-About this game-</h3>\u2013\u2013 Hello, detective. I'm your assistant Kate.<br/>To solve the case, we need you to hack into the brain of an airship crash survivor, and we will help you recreate his memories from one hour before the crash. You will act as the survivor himself, wandering through his memories. Within this hour, you must use all of your detective skills and think of every possible way to access every corner of his memories. You may listen in on discussions you believe are important, look for clues, and search for information related to suspicious persons in order to uncover the truth in a timely manner.<br/>Attention! Once the owner of the brain becomes aware of your presence, he will not only place numerous traps in his mind to stop you, but he will also create horrible illusions that trap you, and launch mind attacks to force you out of his head. It's rare for a beginner like you to last more than 10 minutes. If you feel you can't keep on, don't be a hero and notify me right away; I will cut the connection at any time and pull your consciousness out of his brain...This is entirely for your safety.<br/>Solving this case is both a commission from the Club and a rigorous test. The Club will award you with different levels of detective badges based on your performance. The highest honor is the exceedingly rare Star Detective badge, which can serve as your qualification to join the club. But, according to my research, no beginner detective has ever received this badge; will you be the lucky one?<br/>If you accept the challenge, please sign the commission agreement, and your mission will begin.<br/><h3>-How to play-</h3>Enjoying a feast of deduction in a crisis-ridden mind space<br/><br/>- An immersive crime investigation experience: We offer you a 360-degree immersive experience in an open crime scene, with dead bodies right at your feet!
