The idea was born in a kitchen during coffee break I had with Kimiko, and we decided to try making it into an actual game. First version was created in a weekend, we were pretty happy with what we got, we gave it to some friends, and we decided that experiment was a success and we can move on. Few months and few game jams later I found myself still going back to that rough prototype, until finally I decided to try making something a little big bigger from it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Few months later still, and here we are :D</p>\n<p>This was my goal from the start, a more polished version with 25 levels that I'll be able to show around, and see if it's worth putting a year or so more, to get into final final version (I target around 80 levels split into 4 \"worlds\", this version is basically tutorial and first world). If it turns out me and Kimiko are not the only ones thinking this game has potential, I will begin further development, probably in much more opened way too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>TL;DR hobby project, Alpha version, if (good) {will make more}</p>\n<p><em>Best played on mobile or PC with downloaded version, since Gamemaker can be weird on HTML and I cant promise best experience this way :&lt;<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>EDIT:<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Yeah HTML version was falling apart, so I deleted it for now</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>GAME:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>You can jump ONCE</li><li>Collect energy drink to refill jumps</li><li>Collect cassettes to prove that You're RAD :D</li></ul>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>tap button to jump</li><li>swipe button left to restart level</li><li>swipe button right to go to next level when You get to the goal</li></ul>\n<p>Have fun, and let me know what You think in a comment, I will be forever grateful for any feedback, good or bad!
