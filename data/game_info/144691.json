Weapons now wear down too.</p>\n<p>Stand beside or below (not above) grey altars to offer gold in exchange for experience points and weapons.\u00a0 These get better the higher up in the tomb you get.\u00a0 Don't donate to an altar if there's a monster above it because the monster will take the gold.\u00a0 \u00a0Monsters can pick up gold.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Monsters of your own color can't hurt you.\u00a0 You can swap coats as you get them by clicking on them with the mouse.<br/><br/>Survival tips:<br/><br/>Turn to a color that a monster hates, lead it into a room of hostile monsters, then turn back to that first monster's color.\u00a0 You can get opposing monsters together and they'll fight for you.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>You get experience for all monster-on-monster combat.\u00a0 If your color monsters get a kill you get full ep.\u00a0 1/2 ep for all other monster kills.\u00a0 More violence on the level= faster level up for you!\u00a0 This means if you're wearing a yellow coat and a yellow monster kills something, you get the same EP as if you killed it.\u00a0 If a blue monster kills a red monster (for example) and you have some other color coat on, you get 1/2 EP.</p>\n<p>Turncoat Tomb is all about getting monsters to fight each other instead of you.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/>Don't be too brave early on.\u00a0 Before you have any real weapons or coats you're pretty vulnerable to even the lowly chomp monsters.\u00a0 You should probably steer clear of undead if you're not armed well.\u00a0 \u00a0The undead corpses of the tomb are tougher and more deadly than the rest of the monsters.</p>\n<p>Tything at colored tombs makes them hate whichever color you are wearing less.\u00a0 It's a good idea to turn to your grey coat and at some point make all the monsters less hateful toward grey.</p>\n<p>Never think a skeleton warrior or lich can't kill you in one or two turns.\u00a0 They often can.\u00a0 Hunters (the lizard like monsters)\u00a0are very dangerous too.\u00a0 Treat them with care.</p>\n<p>The lich's life drain attack takes down your max HP and your EP.\u00a0 So it's pretty nasty<br/>The Red caster's fire attack sets you on fire for a few turns causing residual damage and will burn webs.</p>\n<p>The Green caster's poison attack does residual damage.<br/></p>\n<p>Yellow caster is tougher against undead<br/>Blue caster casts lightning which can damage you and other nearby creatures.<br/>Spider web damages you and holds you for a few turns.</p>\n<p>Once you're dead, the game reloads.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Around the levels there are coats.\u00a0 When you get one you can switch to it and those monsters will leave you alone.\u00a0 There are different colored altars that push out monsters.\u00a0 Grey altars give you weapons and health when you put gold in them.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nOther colored altars accept donations in exchange for that color hating you less.\u00a0 When you drop gold in them (10gp at a time) a number form 1-10 floats out indicating their animosity toward you (whatever color coat you're wearing).</p>\n<p>You can get rid of your weapons by dragging and dropping them from the hud.\u00a0 Keep getting better weapons they get better as you go up floors.\r\nThe crypt altars will give you nothing but pain and they will always hate all life.
