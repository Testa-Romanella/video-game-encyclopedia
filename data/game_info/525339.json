Every map, every model, and every event is randomly selected, and each choice is custom made by myself. Every aspect of this game is meant to symbolize life and its issues it brings every day. You can't see very far ahead of you and six out of the eight\u00a0different possible map segments are randomly chosen to lead your way every time you begin. You will eventually find yourself in the red <em>Event Rooms</em> six times along your journey. Each time you enter, one of eleven events occurs along with its trophy. You will be given four choices, and it may be hard to determine which will be the best outcome. As you make your way through life, your score periodically gets lower, even while in an event. You must choose whether you should take your chances with an event, and choose your answer carefully, or to sidle along the edges of the event rooms and play it safe. Your goal is to finish life with the highest score, which can be tricky. Each run only takes around five minutes, but there never is a true end. You'll see when you get there. You'll never know what life may offer you this time. Good or Bad. Simple or Challenging. Predictable or Unprecedented.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T05:15:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41f/41f5889d2c4b75b35d36f73841ed146e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JSaginario"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
