Also, wear your headphone.\r\n<strong>Description:</strong>\n<p>This is my first game jam game. It's an atmosphere game but not horror, no jumpscare. The game will end with a short animation clip, so if you haven't seen it yet, the game is not finished. I predict that the game might be a little bit hard when it comes to the 3rd or 4th stages, but I still strongly recommend you guys to play through the whole game even if you really suffer.</p>\n<strong>Instruction:</strong>\n<p>For the one who <strong>DONT KNOW HOW TO PASS THE INTRO</strong>:</p>\n<ol><li>You can get paper from the tray by jumping and clipping the paper with either LMB/RMB. You can still move while clipping papers.</li><li>Roughly align three papers with the same words and hit the LMB to merge them</li><li>Jump is not strictly restricted so hitting space fast grants you strong momentum</li></ol>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>Mouse:\u00a0<ul><li>left key: hold multiple paper/merge papers</li><li>right key: hold one paper</li></ul></li><li>WSAD: movement control</li><li>Space: jump</li></ul>\r\nAttributes:\r\n<ul><li>Audio: Sound from\u00a0Zapsplat.com</li><li>Sketchfab:<ul><li>This work is based on \"60's Office Props\" (https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/60s-office-props-dc00ea320cfa4aad90811080270672db) by SeanNicolas (https://sketchfab.com/SeanNicolas) licensed under CC-BY-NC-4.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)</li><li>This work is based on \"Empty Cardboard Box\" (https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/empty-cardboard-box-01b2eb9ecd674aca9e9ea1e888ce33e0) by bevanny (https://sketchfab.com/bevanny) licensed under CC-BY-4.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</li><li>This work is based on \"Low Poly City\" (https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/low-poly-city-41697300a4c643d089784b8688b2ed2c) by Alessandro.Diamanti (https://sketchfab.com/diamanti.alessandro) licensed under CC-BY-4.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</li><li>This work is based on \"Low Poly Room\" (https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/low-poly-room-a6bf7976f3ac401e96907aa5b8a0c1c1) by IsaacTheMaverick (https://sketchfab.com/IsaacTheMaverick) licensed under CC-BY-4.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</li><li>This work is based on \"LowPoly Pizza Box\" (https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/lowpoly-pizza-box-fb5a682ee18546b2a0c98273c8f65d5a) by prorookie123 (https://sketchfab.com/prorookie123) licensed under CC-BY-4.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</li><li>This work is based on \"Paper Clip\" (https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/paper-clip-96a6be214d2545ac8321da9ba3395bb7) by Marc Hennessy (https://sketchfab.com/marchennessy20) licensed under CC-BY-4.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T15:42:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72c/72c670cc76c55dea8b3fc72efe4b818a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Charles Peachy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
