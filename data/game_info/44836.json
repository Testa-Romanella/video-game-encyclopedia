It comes in all shapes and sizes and is hidden throughout the city. Teleporting with one hand and grabbing with the other, race against the clock to collect as much as possible before time runs out. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou may notice the large chest in front of you when you start the game. If you're lucky enough you may find a key to unlock it. Be warned, it will not be found easily. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nKeep your eyes open for time boosts as well. These give you a substantial boost in your time remaining and can be found anywhere in the city. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nCompete with your friends to make it onto the high score billboard. Take a top spot and be forever remembered for the riches you've acquired. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nSearch around skyscrapers and behind trash cans, ice cream trucks and storefronts. So much treasure, so little time.
