Time to see what people think!<br/></p>\n<p>Bubble\u00a0Trouble is a relaxing, swiping puzzle game about defending your home from invading bubbles by\u00a0popping them, but watch out! you only have 6 moves and 3 health to do it. Pop all invaders\u00a0to succeed to the next level.</p>\n<p><em>--PLAY IN FULL SCREEN for best quality (expand icon on the bottom right)--</em></p>\n<p><em>Please read the information below </em>(no time to make tutorials unfortunately)</p>\n<ul><li>Click and release with your mouse\u00a0in a <strong>Swipe </strong>motion to move the player (like a smartphone)</li><li>You <strong>lose </strong>HP when you pop an invader</li><li>You\u00a0<strong>use </strong>up a Move whenever you move to a different space</li><li>Moving beyond the home bubble (3x3 grid) causes you to <strong>Orbit </strong>around to the other side, using no Moves and heals your HP back to 3., you even pop any invader you hit for free! <strong>This can only be done Once</strong>. (shown via the green orbiting icon)</li><li>0 HP doesn't mean you die instead, you have 1 <strong>last chance</strong> to do damage. this could save the level from failure</li><li>0 Moves while invaders remain, result in a <strong>loss</strong></li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>All Invader Types</strong></p>\r\nCircleDiamondSquareTriangle<em>Deals 1 damage</em><em>Deals 1 damage<br/></em><em>Deals\u00a01 damage, Consumes an additional Move!</em><em><strong>IF your HP is above 0:</strong><br/>Deals\u00a02 damage and\u00a0pushes you back but doesn't\u00a0use a\u00a0Move!</em><em>Fires a barrier bubble in your move\u00a0direction, popping anything it hits but blocks you from moving through it!</em><em>popping it via orbit allows you to\u00a0orbit again!</em><em><strong>IF at 0 HP:<br/></strong>Deals\u00a0NO damage!</em>\n<p>My advice is to just go for it, levels restart instantly\u00a0so you'll learn what things do naturally and as fast as you want. There isn't anything beside the bare bones, core gameplay loop at this moment.
