Good at melee combat, but has slow speed and is vulnerable to projectiles.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>The Archer, equipped with a bow and small dagger, has well-rounded stats and excels at ranged combat. Good at sniping enemies from behind cover, but has slow attack speed and is vulnerable up close.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>The Rogue, equipped with a small dagger and throwing knives, focuses on speed. Excels at wearing enemies down, but has a tough time against armour.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>The Wizard, equipped with a magic book and staff, focuses on strong projectiles that can harm multiple enemies.
