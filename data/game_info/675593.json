You were the only one on board when the largest hurricane the Great\u00a0Bay has seen in years arrived without warning, pushing your ship out of the\u00a0Key\u00a0Sivuk shipyard onto the open seas.</p>\n<p>If you wish to survive, you have to keep all the functions of the damaged ship running. You need to keep the engine running, track your navigation, fix leaks and check pressure, as well as stir the rudder when it becomes too dangerous.</p>\n<p>You think you can be a one man crew? If so, this game is here for you!</p>\r\n-------------------NOTE TO ORGANIZATION-------------------\r\n<p>As stated in multiple posts on LD webpage, the final product (which is uploaded here) got stuck on a corrupted PC just 30 minutes before the deadline, so as the last resort, the last backup has been uploaded (which was saved 6 hours before that). In the spirit of transparency, we decided to keep this \"emergency backup\" file shared for people curious on what progress has been done in the last 6 hours, for playing the uncomplete game, download the \"<strong>Backup export (see description).exe</strong>\" file.</p>\n<p>For the polished finished game, (which was still created in the time of LD-49 Jam, but was not uploaded in time because of the PC problem), download the Windows, Linux or Apple file, each named \"<strong>Nausea.exe</strong>\", \"<strong>Nausea.x86_64</strong>\" and\u00a0\"<strong>Nausea.zip</strong>\" respectively.</p>\r\n-------------------ON THIS GAME WORKED-------------------\r\n<p><strong>-Glow</strong> - Our programmer, resident maniac and head of this project. Works perfectly to the moment when things go down south, then it is pain in the ass to work with him</p>\n<p><strong>-Fjana</strong> - Our graphical designer who also came up with the game idea and mechanics, (also wrote this description, hello dear world!), did many miscellaneous tasks in the process</p>\n<p><strong>-Gar</strong> - Our sound engineer, our resident American thanks to which we have to switch between our native language and english constantly because he joins our voice chat on random occasions</p>\n<p><strong>-Mike</strong> - Our second coder that was supposed to join us. Only thing we know about him is, that he loves anime and didn't show for the LD Jam</p>\r\n-------------------NOTE ABOUT THE SETTING-------------------\r\n<p><strong><em>Note: This knowledge is not essential to the gameplay and is here for curious people trying to find out what the flag and maps are of.</em></strong></p>\n<p>The\u00a0Great\u00a0Bay <em>(original name Chhakasamout)</em>, as well as Key Sivuk <em>(original name Krong Sivuk)</em>, are names of the geographical locations in the NationStates region of Anteria, in which all of us play and enjoy the game.
