As you\u00a0reach for the doorknob, a gust of icy wind throws the door open, pushing you in. The fireplace lights ablaze and you close the door behind you. In the center of the room, you see it...that festive amalgam of 24 doors:\u00a0<strong><em>The</em></strong>\u00a0<em><strong>Madvent Calendar</strong></em>. Each door will lead you to a different strange world of horror and delight, but may only be opened if that day has arrived!</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>The Madvent Calendar</em></strong> is a collaboration from many developers in The Haunted PS1 Community. A total of 24 haunted scenes or games\u00a0unlocked each day thru December 24th! We hope you have a safe and happy holiday season!</p>\n\n<p>The game launcher was\u00a0created by\u00a0colter.\u00a0This project was organized by z_bill. Countless game, art, and music contributions by the varying and talented members of The Haunted PS1 Community! (play the game for the full credits!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-09T05:51:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/658/658fedcbf6f570c117e66f8d3dbdb8de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Modus Games", "papercookies", "The Haunted PS1", "PixelDough", "Autumn Rain", "OKSoft", "shane yach", "BanzaiBonsai", "Neurobew", "z_bill", "colter", "\u9744\u3000Moya Horror", "pastasfuture", "Negative Entities", "USERLANDS", "Jeed", "VladimereLhore"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
