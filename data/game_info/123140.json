{"id": 123140, "slug": "world-of-hate", "name": "World of Hate", "name_original": "World of Hate", "description": "<p>Made for Punch nazis Jam 2017</p>\n\r\nWORLD OF HATE\r\n<p>It is one year into Donald Trump's Presidency. Donald Trump has not been seen for several months.</p>\n<p>He is preoccupied with a plan to drop a nuke on Syria. He only communicates with the public through increasingly absurd executive orders.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Antifa and fascist groups are clashing on the streets.</p>\n<p>An antifascist transgirl, Jen, is making her way to D.C to protest Trump's nuclear plan.</p>\n\r\nTHE GAME\r\n<p>This game is an arcade beat-em-up. It's also about the modern day (so much so that parts of it are already out of date) and I made it through february to march while in a very bad mood.</p>\n<p>This game is probably slightly depressing, but I made it this way because I stuck to a vision. Not entirely sure how well I pulled it off but, meh, here it is, regardless.</p>\n<p>This game is about beating nazis up, and thus is built around fun. Unlike average beat-em-ups, you can charge all your moves to make them more powerful, and the combat is more about crashing into enemies and careful deployment of moves, than spamming combos.</p>\n\n<p>Soundtrack available on bandcamp HERE</p>\n\r\nCONTENT WARNING\r\n<ul><li>Violence, strong</li><li>Blood / Gore</li><li>Violence as shock</li><li>Violence against animals, strong</li><li>Forced Detransition</li><li>Strong content in text</li><li>References to racism / transphobia / homophobia / ableism in text / imagery</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/059/05955e1097077bb24df2a7fa684e7c80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheWaether"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
