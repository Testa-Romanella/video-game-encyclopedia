The community was great, the discord was fun, and of course making a game is always enjoyable. That being said, the last 5 minuets were crazy. I\u00a0had to leave for vacation 2 hours before the deadline, and (for a good reason) I could not bring my computer along. Taking advice form the community, I had uploaded a earlier version the day before, to make sure everything worked. The next day, I added some player art and a lot more levels, test my local version and it is working good. Later,\u00a0I have to leave in 5 minuets, and I won't be able to edit the game after I leave, so I compress the files, edit my project and upload the<em> zip</em> folder. I was really pressed for time, so I couldn't test the game before I left. Unfortunately, I had uploaded\u00a0<em>GMTK Game Jam 2020.zip\u00a0</em>and not\u00a0<em>GMTK Game Jam 2020 (1).zip,\u00a0</em>meaning that half of my levels (including the gravity and size switch ones)\u00a0and my player art was not gone, but not in the version that everyone plays. Fast forward 4 days, I get back from vacation and realize this (I couldn't play on vacation because I didn't have my computer). Of course I'm disappointed, but I had still gotten positive reviews from people and more ratings than I thought I would, so it wasn't the end of the world. I am uploading this one, because this was the final iteration of my game jam game, and there is no way for me to edit my submission until voting ends. I\u00a0understand that this will not count towards the jam, and that is fine, but\u00a0\u00a0if you are here from my entry, please know that this is what I wanted to share with the community.</p>\n\n<p>Ok, enough story, here's the details</p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>: This is a fast paced platformer, with a twist. Arrow keys to move, and headphones recommended.</p>\n<p><strong>Details:\u00a0</strong>This game was made without any engine, only plain JS and some HTML.\u00a0 All the code was written in 48 hours for the GMTK game jam 2020. Because of that, the last two levels were unfinished, and therefore left out of the game. I\u00a0did all of the programming, and Andrew did the audio and helped me with the player image.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Here is the link to my entry:\u00a0https://bagel03.itch.io/bass-drop\u00a0and\u00a0https://bagel03.itch.io/bass-drop1. The second one was a accidental reupload, and is the same game as the first one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-20T05:18:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e0/4e057ae45009500d09de84d7d953fb6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bagel03"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
