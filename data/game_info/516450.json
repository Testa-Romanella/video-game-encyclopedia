It's up to you to make sure that they are orange. Because that's the right color.</p>\n<p>In this silly and short\u00a0game, you run around the enclosed grounds of a psychiatric treatment facility and persuade other patients to change their color, follow you around and spread the color madness, While your mystical opponent does the same. Make sure to be faster at spreading your orange ideas to gain the upper hand!</p>\n<p>We ended up kind of\u00a0far from this jams topic, but we had a lot of fun making this game and hopefully you will have some fun playing it too.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>HOW TO PLAY<br/></p>\n<p>Convert neutral (white) people to your color with Convert [E].</p>\n<p>Characters with a circle above their head\u00a0\u00a0are following someone.</p>\n<p>Beware of blue doctors, as they revert the patients back to gray.</p>\n<p>Press [SPACE] to ask nearby characters of your color to follow you.</p>\n<p>Key is to outnumber the other color. Always have someone follow you.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Our Opinion on the topic:</p>\n<p>We agreed that the current situation regarding the ongoing disinformation and fake news is like living in a loonybin. People argue about non-important stuff while the truth and the important topics get burried under all the nonsense. People oftentimes blindly follow their leaders, who speak of the only truth they know - their truth.</p>\n\n<p>Music credits:</p>\n<p>Victory Fanfare -\u00a0humanoide9000</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/humanoide9000/sounds/466133/</p>\n<p>Lose Jingle -\u00a0LittleRobotSoundFactory</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/LittleRobotSoundFactory/sounds/270403/</p>\n<p>Menu Music -\u00a0klaudux<br/></p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/klaudux/sounds/264081/</p>\n<p>Game Music -\u00a0Timbre</p><p>https://freesound.org/people/Timbre/sounds/543334/</p><p>All other assets and sound effects were created during the 48 hours of this jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T03:06:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e77/e7769266a258e23acdcb22eddc4b795f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["R4bitF00t", "TK07"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
