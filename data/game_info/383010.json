It's a game made during the #MixAndGameJam 2019. It's a try at recreating the main mechanic of Getting Over It, but in 3D. <br/></p>\n<p>The concept is simple, you have to reach the last platform of the level to find your true nature : <strong>Your spirit animal.</strong><br/><br/>To achieve this goal you'll have to struggle with your mouse and keyboard to yeet between platforms as you discover yourself in this experience.</p>\n<p> We hope you'll have fun playing our game, good luck !<br/><br/></p>\n<p>This project is created by Mathis Abdou, Ronan Cassault &amp; Alex Doumenq, three young students in computer sciences. <br/></p>\n\r\n-- Credits --\u00a0\r\nSound effects &amp; Music :\r\nhttps://freesound.org/people/CGEffex/sounds/96213/\r\nhttps://freesound.org/people/olliehahn12/sounds/262000/\r\nAir in F Major, BWV Anh II 131 - JC Bach -\u00a0 https://youtu.be/ZWk17TRkVFA\u00a0\r\nOur wonderful french voices\r\nTypography :\u00a0\r\nZing Rust :\u00a0 https://www.fontfabric.com/fonts/zing-rust/ - Stan Partalev, Svet Simov\u00a0\r\nMontserrat : https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat\u00a0\r\nAssets :\r\nhttps://thenounproject.com/\u00a0\r\nhttps://www.turbosquid.com/FullPreview/Index.cfm/ID/1266200\r\nhttps://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/fast-ik-139972\r\nhttps://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/exterior/low-poly-styled-rocks-43486\u00a0\r\nhttps://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/low-poly-survival-game-props-107984", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T04:02:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a72/a7244b4f0734c433bdb39588e3444f02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mat", "Alexcommil", "Rakeuh"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
