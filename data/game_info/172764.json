In the process you get attacked by flying space rabbits who figured out that stealing your crystals is easier than mining their own. The more crystals you have, the more rabbits come take them.<br/>The game would need some more work, but that's how far we could get it in 3 days.</p>\n<p># Instructions<br/>WASD - move</p>\n<p>1, 2, 3 - select turret type to place</p>\n<p>**In placement mode:**</p>\n<p>left click - place turret</p>\n<p>right click - cancel placement</p>\n<p># Turret descriptions:<br/>**Slot 1 - Miner - 5 crystals**</p>\n<p>Mines for crystals.
