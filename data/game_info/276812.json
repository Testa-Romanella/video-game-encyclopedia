Introduced on May 14, 2007, as a replacement of ROBLOX Points, Robux was formerly one of two currencies on the platform alongside Tix (which were removed on April 14, 2016). <br/><br/>Robux is known as Roblox's primary currency by the community and staff; all paid items created by ROBLOX within the catalog are sold for Robux, and user-created content like microtransactions and gamepasses also follow the same rule. The name 'Robux' is a portmanteau of Roblox and \"bucks\" (bux).<br/><br/># Remember :<br/>We made this App for Roblox Robux fans, in order to facilitate explain all about Roblox Robux .<br/><br/># You will find inside the App :<br/>- WHAT IS ROBLOX ?<br/>- WHAT IS ROBUX ?<br/>- ROBUX PRICE<br/>- HOW TO GET FREE ROBUX ?<br/>- ROBUXAT FOR ROBLOX<br/><br/># Every page guides you to things you maybe was not knowing them before about Roblox Robux !!!<br/><br/># Disclaimer :<br/>This is an unofficial Roblox Robux App and has NO affiliation with Roblox Corporation\u2122 !!!<br/><br/>+ WE DO NOT SELL ANYTHING INSIDE THE APP.<br/><br/>THIS IS JUST A GUIDE APP THAT EXPLAIN AND GIVES DETAIL SPECIALLY ABOUT ROBUX PRICE.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:52:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9a/b9af4ec705cb2d52d9eae1955b5e1b88_SuXAVcW.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Achraf Oufkir"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Achraf Oufkir"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
