The player controls Pac-Man, who must eat all ther dots inside an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored ghosts.</p>\n<p>When Pac-Man eats all of the dots, the player advances to the next level. Levels are indicated by fruit icons at the bottom of the screen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If Pac-Man is caught by a ghost, he will lose a life; the game ends when all lives are lost. Each of the four ghosts has their own unique artificial intelligence\u00a0(A.I.), or \"personality\":\u00a0</p>\r\nBlinkyGives direct chase to Pac-ManPinky and InkyTry to position themselves in front of Pac-Man, usually by\u00a0cornering himClydewill switch between chasing Pac-Man and fleeing from him\r\n<p>Placed at the four corners of the maze are large flashing \"energizers\" or \"power pellets\". Eating these will cause the ghosts to turn blue with a dizzied expression and to reverse direction. Pac-Man can eat blue ghosts for bonus points; when a ghost is eaten, their eyes make their way back to the center box in the maze, where the ghost \"regenerates\" and resumes their normal activity. Eating multiple blue ghosts in succession increases their point value. After a certain amount of time, blue-colored ghosts will flash white before turning back into their normal form. Eating a certain number of dots in a level will cause a bonus item \u2014 usually in the form of a fruit \u2014 to appear underneath the center box; the item can be eaten for bonus points.</p><p>*So far single player version but this can be updated by community and feedback.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Input</strong></p>\n<ul><li>1: Switch Bezel</li><li>Enter: Selec</li><li>Space: Pause</li><li>Arrow Keys: Pac-Man controller</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T07:57:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e95/e954cd49beb6c3c88c437671a186682d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mr.bilishueco"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
