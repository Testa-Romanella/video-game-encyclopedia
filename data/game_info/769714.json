Your memory becomes fuzzy, as demons begin to swarm your house. Your place has become literal hell. Run away from demons as you recall your memories in an unorthodox manner, in an attempt to escape from the hell YOU yourself caused.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Lorelei's Limbo is very unorthodox, I hope the unusual game play loop   doesn't catch you too off guard. My friends say it's addictive but  hard.  Beginner's playtime can last up to an hour, but if you know what  you're  doing you could finish the game in 15 minutes. It may be more  fun than  it is scary, which is something that I've accepted. The game  feel is  very similar to that of fnaf, where you meet more enemies as  you  progress in repeated tests of skill. I am making a re imagining of  this game in the side, some characters  will be retained but the story is  more simple and the game play loop is  a little different. \r\n </p>\n\n\n<p><strong>If I were to really explain the game play loop, it's kinda like baldi's basics except you buy more story to progress with the in-game currency. The more you obtain the story, the more you obtain more threats. The Story? It's vague in the start but as you progress you'll figure things out.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Still can't convince you to buy the game?
