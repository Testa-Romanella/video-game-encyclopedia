During this time players can swap any pieces on the board, whether they match or not. If player's make a match 3 during this time nothing will happen, only once the timer ends will the board update. This allows quick players to make massive plays and the chance to see really large matches. This mechanic could tie into other mechanics to enhance these large matches.</p><p><strong>Gameplay Video</strong></p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T05:49:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/977/97774e04b4ec3a43bc376c4d9ec5c284.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BenjaminAllen"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
