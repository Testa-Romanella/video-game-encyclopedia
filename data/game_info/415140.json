NEKCOM Entertainment based locally in Wuhan will personally facilitate the donation process to ensure full transparency and direct transfer.\u00a0 (until the coronavirus situation ceases/ call for donations end)<br/><br/>Inspiration for the game came from\u00a0reports of the the normally bustling city of Wuhan suddenly empty after the quarantine, akin to\u00a0sights commonly only found in post-apocalyptic genre works.\u00a0 However, a viral short of an unknown hero risking his life to deliver a box of facemasks reminded us of the value of humanity and compassion in the face of disasters.<br/><br/>We originally intended to create a 2D homage to works such as\u00a0<em>What Remains of Edith Finch, Everybody's Gone to the Rapture</em>, or more aptly, <em>The Graveyard and Passage</em>.\u00a0 We also tried to challenge ourselves by developing in the open source Godot engine for the first time.\u00a0 Unfortunately due to a combination of engine unfamiliarity and time constraints, we had to strip away a lot of planned interactions and content to just focus on the core concept and emotional experience.<br/><br/>The final result is pretty short and\u00a0a bit rough around the edges but we hope it's worth your time.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Concept: Allan Xia<br/>Code: Gordon Larson<br/>Art: Allan Xia, Matthias Chua<br/>Sound (Freesound.org):<br/></p>\n<p>Smooth cinematic intro\u2019 by tyops<br/>\u2018Footsteps Concrete A\u2019 by InspectorJ<br/>\u2018Soft Wind\u2019 by florianreichelt<br/>\u2018Autumn Forest Wind\u2019 by Akacie<br/>\u2018HopefulAmbience1\u2019 by RichardCulver</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T06:22:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa0/fa06cdf918e271cbea92c9a7ca0866e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Allan Xia"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
