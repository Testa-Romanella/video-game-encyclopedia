The entire game including code, sound effects, and assets were all made within 3 hours and 23 minutes.\u00a0My take on the \"One Enemy Only\" theme was to make a game where there is only one enemy among many similar entities and you need to find the correct one to kill.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Play as a hired assassin who is assigned with a targets to take out. Each round has \"Only One Enemy\", but they are surrounded by similar looking civilians! So\u00a0be careful not to accidentally take out a civilian or you will lose. Correctly taking out a target will add 1 second back to your clock in addition to adding to your score, so try to take them out as fast as possible without making a mistake!</p>\n\n<p>Use your left mouse button to shoot a target.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T11:38:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bef/bef43098a56271a5af69ce34be7b1580.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sumdeos"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
