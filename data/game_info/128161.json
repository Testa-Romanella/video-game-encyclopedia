A tower defense rhythm game made for Ludum Dare 41.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>--Mouse to place towers</p>\n<p>--Arrow keys to hit the notes</p>\n\n<p>The theme of the jam was \"combine two incompatible genres.\" After having a rough start on Friday attempting to\u00a0 think of an idea and then some personal-life stuff getting in the way, the game didn't truly start getting created until Saturday. We picked this combination of genres because I really wanted to make a rhythm game and he really wanted to make a tower-defense. I think we are both pretty happy with what came out in the end. This is our second game jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72f/72f99818dd94fc7bfa22ea724686799e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Suess"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
