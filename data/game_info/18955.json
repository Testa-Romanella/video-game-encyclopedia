Each dream brings a new maze of puzzles to explore, but there\u2019s not much time before you wake up\u2026<br/><br/>Every room is a puzzle, filled with coins to collect and high scores to chase. Switch between characters on the fly to solve increasingly complex puzzles in make-believe worlds of adventure\u2026 and treasure! Use the Robot\u2019s brute strength to push heavy blocks, swing the Knight\u2019s sword to clear the way, and use the Astronaut\u2019s gravity defying jumps to leap over blocked paths.Special thanks to the photographers below for their expertise and support in making this project a reality!<br/><ul><li>David Bebber</li><li>James Marcus Haney</li><li>Richard Pohle</li><li>War Child UK</li><li>Will Carter</li></ul>Key Features / How to play<br/><ul><li>Solve block-based puzzles in an amazing dream world<br/></li><li>Play as three different characters, each with their own abilities<br/></li><li>Collect coins and chase high scores<br/></li><li>Learn about War Child and the children that will benefit from you playing this game!</li></ul>Studio Message/Creators<br/><ul><li>Matt Burnill<br/></li><li>Andy Morriss<br/></li><li>Maxime Bonin<br/></li><li>Nick Gomersall<br/></li><li>Oliver Wood<br/></li><li>Andy McKinnon<br/></li><li>Kev Carthew <br/></li><li>Gavin Hood<br/></li><li>L\u00e9lia Peuchamiel</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af4/af422938c19f83ac9da8bacd1f6f740a.jpg", "website": "https://www.warchild.org.uk/HELPTheGame/Team17", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 13}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team17 Digital"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": null}
