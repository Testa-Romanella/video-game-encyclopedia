I look around to find people sitting at the tables, therefore, I shall approach them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The boy who is sipping on his DRINK tells me that I ended up in a place called SAFETY, he tells me that everyone here is for the same reason. He does not have a name, neither do I, he refers to himself as NUMBER 35. Apparently he has been here for quite some time, he tells me he does not want to leave, he tells me that nothing but sorrow lives in the outside, he tells me that no one has come back once they leave through that DOOR.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is now my choice whether I want to leave SAFETY, after all, as long as I stay, I am SAFE.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T06:51:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec7/ec7e9bdd061f67b57f90f65c4e2a7a71.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["aposakat"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
