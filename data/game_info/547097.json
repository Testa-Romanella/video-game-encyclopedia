The goal of this game is to introduce beginners to the wonders of the world of Computer Science! The game has have two core components:<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Lessons:</strong> An interactive course to teach you how to think computationally, how to write programs in Pythons, and how to design classes using the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).<br/></li><li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Multiple choice, short answer, and math problems to test your understanding of Python, computational thinking, and OOP. These challenges are embedded throughout the Lessons, so you can practice your understanding of concepts in real-time under an Active Learning framework.</li></ul><br/>This game assumes absolutely <strong>zero prerequisite background</strong>. We hope you will join us as we explore the wonders of Programming in Python!<br/><br/><ul><li>Game developed by <strong>Niema Moshiri</strong><br/></li><li>Lesson content developed by <strong>Sabeel Mansuri</strong></li></ul><h3>Table of Contents</h3><br/><ul><li><strong>Chapter 1</strong> - Introduction: The Nuts &amp; Bolts<br/></li><li><strong>Chapter 2</strong> - Conditionals: Ice Cream Isn't for Breakfast<br/></li><li><strong>Chapter 3</strong> - Loops: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Breakfast, Lunch, Din...<br/></li><li><strong>Chapter 4</strong> - Data Structures: I'll Have Combo #3, Please!<br/></li><li><strong>Chapter 5</strong> - Functions: How Do I Stop Rewriting Code?<br/></li><li><strong>Chapter 6</strong> - Recursion: Give Me a Minute, I'm Getting a Call from Myself<br/></li><li><strong>Chapter 7</strong> - Objects: Python, Have a Burger<br/></li><li><strong>Chapter 8</strong> - Exceptions: You Can't Eat an Empty Bag of Chips<br/></li><li><strong>Chapter 9</strong> - File I/O: Here's a Recipe, Make Me Some Macarons<br/></li><li><strong>Chapter 10</strong> - Libraries: Hasn't Someone Done This Before?<br/></li><li><strong>Chapter 11</strong> - Epilogue: What Now?</li></ul><h3>Important Notes</h3><br/>The game executable is <strong>incorrectly flagged</strong> by some antivirus systems. The game, which was itself written in Python, is packaged into a single executable that contains a portable Python environment to ensure that the game will run even if Python is not installed. This packaging is being done using <strong>PyInstaller</strong>, and the issue of antivirus systems incorrectly flagging PyInstaller packages is <strong>well-known</strong>. I will be reaching out to antivirus companies about this issue, but for full transparency, here is the complete VirusTotal report:<br/><br/>https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/0fd68d9f3cbb6dfc34514386cb4cb78c5465dfc194acc7346036a94a75b9d37e/detection<br/><br/>Also, as a gift, I have decided to release the game's source code for free! This does not include the lesson data, but it contains the actual Python code behind the game engine. I hope this practical application of Python sparks your interest in learning the language!<br/><br/>https://github.com/niemasd/Learn-Programming-Python-Source<h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h3><ul><li><strong>How can I increase the font size?</strong><br/><ul><li>The game should be using your default Windows command prompt settings. To configure, when you start the game (which opens it in a maximized window), you should be able to right-click the bar above the window (which says \"Learn Programming: Python\"), click \"Properties\", go to the \"Font\" tab, and select a larger font size.</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T04:19:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc0/bc0629e205ff300d5629e691573bee1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["niemasd", "Niema Moshiri"], "genres": ["Casual", "Educational", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Niema Moshiri"], "esrb_rating": null}
