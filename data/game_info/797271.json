Upon death, the player's corpse becomes part of the level and you can use the corpse to reach the other side of lava lakes or to block the patrol of enemies. But be careful - you can only die once and the next time you'd die, it's lethal.</p>\n<p>There's also a checkpoint system that allows you to retry the level at the furthest point you've progressed so far. Hint: When \"picking up\" the checkpoint, the player can die again!</p><p>I'm really looking forward to the next GameDev.tv game jam! Next time I hope I can allocate more free time to create a bigger submission.</p>\n<p><strong>Control:</strong><br/>Arrow Keys / WASD --&gt; moving<br/>Space Key --&gt; jumping<br/>Mouse --&gt; clicking buttons in the menu</p><p><strong>Special thanks and credits go to:</strong><br/>Tarodev\u00a0(https://www.youtube.com/c/Tarodev) - for the player controller<br/>Daniel Wood - for the 2D platformer video series on YouTube<br/>SpeedTutor\u00a0- for the animation video on YouTube<br/>GameDev.tv (https://www.gamedev.tv/) - for the amazing content on their platform and for hosting the jam!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T19:23:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f2/2f22ebce48a951812f6f365ca18e283b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pineapple_z"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
