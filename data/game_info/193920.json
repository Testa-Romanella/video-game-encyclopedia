But what if the process of \r\nmemorization was a part of an engaging game? That was the thought I had \r\nin the conception of Tangomon: a libre, educational monster battling \r\n(Pokemon-like) game.<br/></p>\n<p>Tangomon is a very simple game which helps you learn. It was \r\ndesigned with vocabulary in mind, but can be theoretically used for all \r\nkinds of learning. Your monsters, known as tangomon, attack with words, \r\nknown as tangojis. When you have completely memorized a tangoji, you can\r\n convert it into a tangokan, which you can use to convince other \r\ntangomon to join your team! Your goal is simple: collect them all!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a5/5a53b9f1b26271dceb724be1df24028e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["onpon4"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
