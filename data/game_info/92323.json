Play by yourself or with someone else in local multiplayer. Source included under MIT but with no commercial use allowed. I didn't have time to include a proper tutorial, so please read the following or the included README.txt :)</p><p>Directions:</p><p>1. Player 1 (bird) uses WASD or arrow keys to move around</p><p>2. Player 2 (turret) uses mouse and the left mouse button to aim and fire</p><p>3. Shooting an enemy drops ammo, player 1 must walk up to it to pick it up</p><p> and walk near the turret to drop it off</p><p>4. Ammo is limited, use it wisely</p><p>5. The game is over when player 1 is hit by any enemy just once, get the highest score!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8b/d8b15c5b7d756fd1fd322b90844a4532.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pixelrobin"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
