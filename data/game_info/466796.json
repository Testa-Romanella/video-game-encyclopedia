Instead your control lies in the environment and what you can do with it to get your player to safety! Even the Physics of the world seem...Out Of Control.</p>\r\nNow the game:\r\n<p>\"After having a nice cup of coffee all your character wants to do is head back home to its friends. Knowing the road is treacherous, it prays to the Almighty and asks for a safe travel</p>\n<p>You being a gracious Almighty decide to help out\u00a0, so you must get....whatever it is, back to its home.</p>\n<p>If you don't want to be gracious...you could always drop a rock or bomb on it...just for fun....\"</p>\r\nHow To Play:\r\n<p>Use the Arrow Keys or W/D to move the character...when you can. The rest of your game relies on your <strong>mouse\u00a0</strong>click and drag anything that goes transparent when you mouse over it to be able to interact with the object!</p>\n<p>Press Escape to pause the game.</p>\r\nLinks:\r\nMy Twitter\r\nMy YouTube where I do devlogs!\r\nAsset Pack by Kenney\r\nWord From Creator:\r\n<p>This was my first ever GMTK Jam and my first time creating a game in 48 hours! It was stressful but a lot of fun, using an asset pack really helped and I am glad I did it. I just wanted to say this game was a lot of fun to make, albeit very short, <strong>if anyone would like to see me adapt this game please let me know!</strong> Some of the systems in the game could be improved (most of them) and I had a lot of ideas for this game too, so please let me know.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck to everyone!</p>\n<p>Saul</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T14:05:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e87/e87283deba0fe8d64997578957d52031.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GamesbySaul"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
