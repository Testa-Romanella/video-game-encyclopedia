I decided to make this game really just to get\u00a0 practice with my cpp skills.\u00a0It's mainly just a practice project and I would like to know if you guys like it :)\u00a0\u00a0The objective is to get all the boxes on a \"star\". It's a star in the original game but I redesigned the star to be just a yellow circle placed on the map. You move around with the arrow keys and you push the boxes with the player. The boxes\u00a0 CAN go inside of walls, and no that is NOT a game mechanic, it's just a bug that I couldn't fix. But yeah other than that, I would really appreciate any feedback to improve my games in the future :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T09:54:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00d/00d7f1dabbc172cedff1c7ba06ac3568.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BruceWalker"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
