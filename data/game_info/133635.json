Big business isn't\u00a0easy\u00a0though - this year another supplier has been flooding the market with\u00a0cheap nasty wine, but Jack's wholesome organic produce still rules the\u00a0market - despite all the competition tried.</p>\n<p>But last night,\u00a0at the end of another fabulous growing season, when he\u00a0had started collecting the fruit for this year's vintage he heard a\u00a0clanging of metal, smelt the foul smell of big business, and saw huge\u00a0steel monsters roaming the allotments, trampling the paths and\u00a0destroying his crops!</p>\n<p>\"By eck! Me\u00a0'arvest! It's a rum-do this!\" Jack exclaimed, and off he\u00a0set again to gather his harvest, and deal with the competition's\u00a0mechanical menace that was threatening his livelihood...</p>\n\n<p>As\u00a0<strong>Dominetris</strong> was\u00a0well received I decided to turn my attention to\u00a0converting an arcade game which I liked and the Speccy never had a\u00a0decent version of - \"Mr. Do!\". Improving my coding all the\u00a0time, and\u00a0using TommyGun to design all the sprites, the resulting game strayed a\u00a0little from the arcade by replacing the \"magic ball\" with a number of\u00a0bombs (it's my game and I never got the hang of that ball!).\u00a0Largely\u00a0well received it set the character of Farmer Jack firmly on-track to be\u00a0used again in future games, such as \"Farmer Jack and the Hedge Monkeys\"\u00a0which followed early in 2008.</p>\n<p>The game also\u00a0marks the beginning of a fantastic partnership with Lee\u00a0du-Caine (found via a \"Wanted...\" add in the WOS forums) who did all\u00a0the music &amp; sound effects for this and all my games since, and\u00a0literally adds another dimension to the games. His input into\u00a0the\u00a0final result, and the creative process cannot be underestimated.</p>\n\n<p><strong>MicroMart</strong> -\u00a0\"<em>The\u00a0</em><em>graphics are nice and bright ... special\u00a0mention should be made to the wonderful AY music ...
