The community having been weakening year by year, we started this project for strengthening our solidarity, improving mapping skill, and so on. We aimed a low-threshold project which anyone could participate. Some doomers were inexperience mappers or beginners, so Tatsurd-Cacocaco, a project leader, supported map&#39;s detail and port compatibility. We finally managed to complete 32 maps which are the same quality as modern maps.</p>\n<p>Japanese status HUD is included .If you load JPCP_HUD.wad with this wad, status bar in &quot;Katakana&quot; and &quot;Kanji&quot; can be used.</p>\n<p>We hope that you have a good time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-06T12:53:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ad/0aded0030669f25697881124c7bfba1e.jpg", "website": "https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/Ports/megawads/jpcp", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
