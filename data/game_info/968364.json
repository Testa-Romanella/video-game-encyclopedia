{"id": 968364, "slug": "simply-moose", "name": "Simply Moose", "name_original": "Simply Moose", "description": "Reflex-based puzzle game based on Boulder Dash principles, but with its own unique style. This time you control Moose in a forest environment, and your task is to collect cones. Each stage contains a certain number of cones that have to be collected to open the teleport to the next stage.<br/>\r\nBut, of course, it isn't always that simple. You'll have to confront falling balks, exploding puffballs, as well as company that doesn't quite get along with Moose. There are, however, some items that facilitate the task. Some obstacles can be used to your advantage!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDuring gameplay you'll be accompanied by stylish chip-tune music (4 different tracks) made by Piotr Le\u015bnikowski (pragmahead.com).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game contains 2 packs of 38 and 50 stages respectively. Some require complex logical thinking, some - good reflexes and awareness, and some - both. In addition to that, an editor is included, allowing creation and sharing of your own packs.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game was originally released in 2002. From that time the game community arose which created more than 100 custom stage packs. Currently they are active on Discord channel (Polish but we can speak english too).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-27T04:18:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce7/ce7e90a0dc76c5ca2e371fddc80dfc19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ENTI - Rafa\u0142 Bar"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["ENTI - Rafa\u0142 Bar"], "esrb_rating": null}
