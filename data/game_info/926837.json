We designed it to make every punch visceral. <br/>A successful strike on an enemy makes you feel the crushing weight of the blow. Every time the player\u2019s character gets hit, it\u2019s impossible not to flinch.<br/>The camera is tied to the action, giving players total control over their character. <br/>The game features four different weapon classes, each built for a completely different playstyle.<br/>We based one of the pillars of our game\u2019s design on a simple idea: at all times, the player should feel their next mistake can be their last.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-16T09:40:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63d/63d1015b8dad3f132e4c1e3c12ce2438.jpg", "website": "https://www.themoonhell.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 3, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 364, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["A.M.
