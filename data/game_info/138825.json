Drag coal by left-clicking anywhere in the coal cart into the generators.<br/>2. You can buy coal underneath the cart. Left click over the \"0\" on the bottom left and use it as an input field(It's counter intuitive I know...)<br/>3. The more coal you buy the cheaper it is but the longer it will take to arrive.\u00a0<br/>4. All the energy gets dumped into the battery and from there you'll feed the demand. You can buy extra battery storage space by clicking on the button underneath it.<br/>5. You can only have 8 generators. You can buy them in the bottom center for 50\u20ac. \u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Last as much as you can!</strong></p><p>(There is no time counter to know how long you lasted. This is for one sole reason... I suck!)</p>\r\nDescription\r\n<p><strong>This game was created for Ludum Dare 39.</strong></p>\r\nDuring a Ludum Dare, developers from around the world spend a weekend creating games based on a theme suggested by the community. Ludum Dare events take place every April, August and December.\r\n\r\n<p>The theme was \"Running out of Power\". I approached the theme by making a VERY simple power plant tycoon where you need to cover demand all the time.</p>\r\nTools\r\n<ul><li>Unity 5.6</li><li>Audacity (for Sound)</li><li>Lunapic (for Graphics)</li><li>Bosca Ceoil (For the music)</li></ul>\r\nLinks\r\n<ul><li>LD39 Game Site<br/></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/376/376f3aad2406d9b6011f221161352766.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Gris"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
