You will be able to go into the pinball field table to capture wild pigs to raise on the farm table. There are some interesting ideas on the pipeline. Hope you guys like them when they come out. :)</p>\r\nFun Options\r\nAcid Mode\r\n<p>In any game mode (and even the main screen) you can activate Acid mode in the settings menu. You will instantly experience what it's like to see through the eyes of a hallucinogenic drug user.
