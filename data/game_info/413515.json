Its adventure mode is limited to repeatable expedition quests. Bookmarks saved in the demo are not compatible with the full version.</p>\n<p>Purchasing the full game removes these restrictions and supports the future development of soundStrider.</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>soundStrider is both an exploration game and a relaxation tool. Explore and appreciate its environments at your own pace. In this demo specifically, one valid way to play is by entering Free Roam and pressing the Auto Move button to hear endless hours of unique ambient music.</p>\n<p>Each new world is born from a seed. It can be any word or phrase you select, or simply allow the game to randomly generate one for you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Its Adventure Mode provides a more structured experience for folks who desire an objective. Occasionally it will spawn quests for you to complete. With its spatial compass system, you should have no problems arriving at your next destination.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>soundStrider has full support for keyboards and standard gamepads.
