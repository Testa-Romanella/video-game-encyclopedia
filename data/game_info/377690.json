She has one goal:\u00a0Reach the end of the tunnel to retrieve something precious.</p>\n<p>The problem is that darkness closes in every minute or so, and you must be safe at home when that happens. You can't go out to the end of the tunnel and back right away-- you must collect resources and place powerups around the tunnel to help you get around faster and faster until you can retrieve what's at the end and return home.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>WASD or Arrow Keys - Movement</p>\n<p>W, Up, or Space - Jump</p>\n<p>Space or Enter\u00a0- Continue dialogue</p>\n<p>1 - Cast Light Socks</p>\n<p>2 - Cast Portal</p>\n<p>3 - Cast Doublebuff</p>\n\r\nImportant Things!\r\n<p>You will need to venture out and return Home safely multiple times in order to eventually venture out long enough to reach the end and back.</p>\n<p><strong>Shards</strong>: Collectable items found along the way. Bring these back to craft Powers that will help you get around faster!</p>\n<p><strong>Memory </strong><strong>Shards</strong>: Collectables which give insight into why our heroine is here. They also give a few seconds to your total time on each adventure!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Light </strong><strong>Socks</strong>: A Power which temporarily increases your speed. Any tiles you touch will light up, letting you move faster on them in future runs!</p>\n<p><strong>Portal</strong>: A Power which opens a portal that spans a large distance.
