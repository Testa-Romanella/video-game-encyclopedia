The Elves don't stay happy for long going about their business - if you take too long clearing the snowballs, they will magically turn on Quasimodo and become Naughty Little Elves looking to stop him with their snowball guns.\u00a0 And watch out! lurking in the wings is an evil snowman called Boris who will be out to try and thwart Quasimodo from completing his Christmas Caper.<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Current game features v2.48 Release 2:</p>\n<ul><li>12 Christmas-themed levels filled with collectables and obstacles to avoid along the way.</li><li>Hidden Bonus level.</li><li>3 levels of difficulty.</li><li>'Widescreen' mode.</li><li>In-game music.</li><li>Loading screen/music for tape version of game.</li><li>Single player - joystick only in Port 2.</li><li>Works on (<strong>PAL Only</strong>) Commdore 64s/128s, VICE 3.4+, CCS, Ultimate64e, MiSTer (FPGA), TheC64.</li><li>Digital .PRG, .D64 and\u00a0 .TAP download (Other digital formats may follow).

Switching between PAL and NTSC via the menus doesn't save the change unfortunately.\u00a0 It will affect all PAL games, not just Quasimodo's Christmas Caper. </p>\n<p>Please report any bugs in the comments section. \u00a0There may be some quirks I already know about and have noted down to fix in a later release. \u00a0 Thank you. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Quasimodo's Christmas Caper - An rwx designs game.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Coding, Graphics, Sound FX and Music by Robert Wilson.</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Please download only from itch.io and support the author!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T12:58:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a49/a490816de921b21541643c6e5175e90a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rwx designs"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
