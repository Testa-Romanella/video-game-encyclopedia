I unfortunately didn't have enough space to include a menu or automatic resetting after a game over, so instead the game freezes intentionally so at least the player can get to see how well they did.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls: z - shoot, arrows - move, enter - bring up menu (which is also where you reset the game if you want to play again)</p>\n<p>The numbers at the top-left are the number of enemies left. It doesn't count enemies that left the area, since they don't come back afterward (they have only one volley worth of ammo). The other number is score, which is gained by lasting longer at 10 points per second.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T07:14:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f15/f1584f729d42b11cdb862222c7c8fcff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Colin EUMP"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
