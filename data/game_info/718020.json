The story takes place over two winter days. The farmer runs into various characters and spends some time talking with them, based on which actions you choose to take.\u00a0<br/></p><p>This is the first game I've coded! It was a frustrating and fun experience and I very much look forward to finishing it in 2022. <br/></p><p>Currently, this mockup uses dummy images and dummy text, although I've already written all the dialogue and illustrated most of the characters. I've written it in a way that hopefully people not familiar with the game and its characters would find it enjoyable. The story was written during NaNoWriMo of this year, which was also a very fun experience. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-03T06:19:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/681/681bce19608e9fa15451c91a0b61886f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Zoeboe"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
