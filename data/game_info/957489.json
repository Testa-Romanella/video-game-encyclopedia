Once they learn about her affair, they offer Kouta not only a considerably hefty bonus for his many years of work, but also settlement money to make up for her shameless infidelity.<br/><br/>With his newfound fortunes in hand, Kouta pledges to begin his life anew. His deceased grandfather had owned a dilapidated, practically abandoned house out in the boonies, which Kouta sees as the perfect opportunity to fix the place up and settle down in the countryside. <br/><br/>Beside his new home is a small shrine. And while the house's upkeep has been neglected for some time, the shrine has been maintained remarkably well thanks to Kouta's parents. A miniature archway stands in front, flanked by two even smaller, moss-covered statues, representing goddesses of harvest. Kouta can't even remember a single time he's visited this shrine before, but from now on he'd be its caretaker.<br/><br/>\"It's in pretty great shape considering how little my parents tended to it,\" Kouta muses to himself out loud, and to his surprise, someone responds. <br/><br/>\"I take good care of it if I do say so myself.\"<br/><br/>Suddenly appearing before him is a woman with silver hair, bronze skin, short in stature, but plump in proportions, with fuzzy ears, a fluffy tail, and dressed--at least somewhat--like a shrine maiden.<br/><br/>This is how the two meet for the first time. Her name is Onatsu, a kitsune who's resided in the shrine beside Kouta's grandfather's house for generations. She shares this shrine with her tanuki companion, Otama.<br/><br/><strong>So begins Kouta's new life with a kinky kitsune and tantalizing tanuki as his neighbors!</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Under the authority granted to her by the Royal Court of Kitsune and Tanuki, she governs the land of Toyoho Naminokuni. Her mom's aunt is a concubine to a loyal retainer serving the Ouji Great God of Harvest. In other words, she's some big-shot kitsune's distant relative, and she's tasked with overseeing the general area around Kouta's house.<br/><br/>She has silver hair, bronze skin, is short in stature, but plump in proportions, with fuzzy ears, a fluffy tail, and dressed--at least somewhat--like a shrine maiden. Influenced by human culture, her interests are very otaku-oriented, and she's so fond of kogals that she bought a tanning bed just to look like one. Her favorite food is fried tofu... actually, no, make that mayonnaise.<br/><br/>Very much a product of modern society, Onatsu likes to browse the web, play multiplayer online games, and also maintains a food blog. She also sells cosplay photo albums online that feature herself and her best friend Otama. The two of them utilize their shape-shifting prowess to spice up their photoshoots.<br/><br/>She's been acquainted with Kouta's family line for many, many decades (perhaps centuries), and she tends to get along particularly well with middle-aged men.<br/><br/><br/><br/>She's Onatsu\u2019s childhood best friend, and the youngest child of the Venerable Tanuki Kajikaiwa Magoichiro. Under the authority granted to him by the Royal Court of Kitsune and Tanuki, he governs the land of Kokeshi Mizukuni. In other words, she comes from a wealthy, sheltered family and doesn't have any sort of job. <br/><br/>The kimono she wears fits her short, busty frame very well, leaving little to the imagination. Perhaps her most striking feature--bushy tail and fuzzy ears aside--is her black, bob cut-styled hair, just long enough to completely cover her eyes.<br/><br/>Her many, considerably older siblings take care of any important family business, and her family loves doting on her. They're always pushing her to attend matchmaking events and other formal affairs. Otama eventually gets fed up with this lifestyle and proceeds to move in with Onatsu.<br/><br/>In return, Otama helps Onatsu take care of the housekeeping and other menial activities. She also joins Onatsu in her cosplay photoshoots, so she does earn some cash for herself. Although she keeps said photoshoots a secret from her family, as they'd without question do something shady to ensure those photos would entirely cease to exist if they ever found out.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-26T03:47:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c58/c5842e5ded3c535e2e43b945baa834b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 490, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Orcsoft", "FAKKU"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["FAKKU"], "esrb_rating": null}
