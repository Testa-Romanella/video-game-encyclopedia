{"id": 266790, "slug": "red-hot-robot-ultrarena", "name": "Red Hot Robot Ultrarena", "name_original": "Red Hot Robot Ultrarena", "description": "<p><strong>What is this?<br/></strong><br/>Red Hot Robot Ultrarena is a single-player giant robot shooter that attempts to blend the fast-paced arena deathmatch combat of games such as Quake and Unreal Tournament with the vehicular systems and piloting mechanics of simulation games such as MechWarrior. <br/></p>\n<p>This version serves as a polished vertical slice of the game containing the following features: <br/>- A fully-featured mech chassis, the Dervish.<br/>- Seven unique weapons to customize your mech with.<br/>- Three varied combat arenas in which to face off against AI foes.<br/>- Tutorial missions to teach you the basics of play.</p>\n<p><strong>System requirements<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> A full keyboard and a (minimum) two-button mouse that allows simultaneous button input is assumed. Trackpads and magic mice are not suitable.<br/></p>\n<p>Robot Ultrarena should run on any Windows or OSX computer that counted as a mid-tier gaming machine five years ago. Performance using onboard graphics chips is not guaranteed, but hey, try it out and see.</p>\n<p>(Sorry in advance, Linux peeps. I don't have the hardware to test the game on those platforms, and I won't distribute what I can't test. If you'd like to volunteer for testing, give me a shout!)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Is it under active development?</strong><br/><br/>As a vertical slice this release is considered complete for now. The intention is to gauge interest and build a fully-featured version if feedback is very positive. As such, very little additional work is expected to take place beyond essential bug or balance fixes.<br/><br/><strong>Why was it made?<br/></strong><br/>Robot Ultrarena was developed as a one-man hobby project starting in March 2014, but somehow gained a skilled 3D artist/animator and an audio wizard somewhere along the way. The game's grown in leaps and bounds over the last four-and-a-bit years, and it's finally in a state to show the world. That said, it's a little janky in places and may have some bugs remaining, but it's good to play!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>What about Multiplayer? WHY NO MULTIPLAYER?<br/></strong><br/>When I started the game back in 2014 every other mech game on the market was exclusively online multiplayer, which pushed me towards a single-player design. Unfortunately, this means the game wasn't architected to easily accommodate multiplayer, but who knows? Maybe one day!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eee/eee8cf70891c27b81fdf3c26aedbd2fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Gazza_N"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
