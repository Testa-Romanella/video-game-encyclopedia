Use your magic brush to guide the serpent and make it eat the flying offerings, and grow as long as possible.

Too much strokes or strokes in places it can\u2019t get to, makes it act in unexpected ways.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/023/0232fe6496687fb712b29c237fd2236f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["tuomo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
