The local shopkeeper auctions them off to the highest bidder! This is your chance to nab illustrious spoils from far off lands without ever risking your neck \u2013 but you aren't the only opportunistic knave in town! Alongside three other eager bidders you must bet your gold wisely based on only a glance into the chest and the weight of the items combined. Winning the auction could still mean defeat if you bid too high, but get your wager just right and your loot can be sold to fund even greater acquisitions!</p>\n<p>(Check out our other games here: Two Scoop Games)</p>\r\nModels\r\n<ul>\n<li>Low Poly Fantasy Medieval Village by JustCreate</li>\n<li>Animated Fantasy Polygon Chest by David Aldy 3D</li>\n<li>Definitive Stylized Water by Marc Sureda</li>\n<li>Low Poly Swords by Catalin Pavel</li>\n<li>Low poly key by yd</li>\n</ul>\r\nMusic\r\n<ul>\n<li>Battle Theme A by cynicmusic</li>\n<li>Town Theme RPG by cynicmusic</li>\n<li>funny-fanfare-1 by olver</li>\n<li>trumpet-fanfare by bevibeldesign</li>\n</ul>\r\nSounds\r\n<ul>\n<li>record-scratch by ludvique</li>\n<li>chest opening by spookymodem</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T11:45:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71e/71ed9563c16026edceabfd4ca5a36c1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Two Scoop Games", "Eric Lathrop"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
