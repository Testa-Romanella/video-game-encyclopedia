Separated from your daughter, and haunted by memories of your crime, you're looking to carve your way out of this mess. </p><p>As you do that, you'll have to deal with a variety of bloodthirsty monsters, some of whom carry weapons or snipe at you from a distance, as well as the few characters you'll meet along the way.<br/></p><p>It's not gonna be pretty. That's why you can save and load anytime. There's also an in-game map.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6a/e6a7885f0b67ba93e9fa8fe1b6d44cb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SVG"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
