But during his journey, he discovers that his real home is with those he loves, his friends.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the 2018 Global Game Jam at the Kennesaw State University site. The theme was \"what home means to me\". This game is horribly unfinished compared to my submission last year. I tried too many new things and failed to meet my goals, but at least I learned a lot. I spent most of my time working on the procedurally animated legs. I used a simple Inverse Kinematics solver from one of Unity's workshops as a base, but all the procedural animation is my code. Also he doesn't actually jitter, if you check out my trailer with a static camera, you can see he walks smoothly on flat surfaces - my camera script is just bad.</p>\n<p>This was also my first time working with Unity's tilemap system, and I'm rather disappointed, but not surprised. I've been doing pixel art in Unity for 4 or 5 years now, so I know the typical speedbumps, but for some reason I could not for the life of me figure out how to fix the seems in the sprite tiles without completely redoing my spritesheets (which I didn't have time for). None of my usual fixes worked, nor did any of google's suggested fixes.<br/></p>\n<p>I'd like to continue experimenting with procedural animation and IK in Unity and someday turn it into\u00a0a puzzle platformer. The gameplay of this game is pretty heavily inspired by Pikuniku, a game for PC and Switch that was recently released. I love it and wanted to give programming its mechanics a shot. Let me know if you have any questions about the game.</p>\n<p>My Twitter handle is @SkeleboneJones. My LinkedIn is\u00a0https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-hunter-jones-16168716b/.
