You can use the plow to clear an asteroid field and collect the useful materials left behind. The P.L.O.W is controlled by a Tractor Beam which connects it to your ship. The tractor beam creates artificial gravity so the closer you are to the P.L.O.W. the more it will be pulled towards you. Careful! The Plow is indiscriminate in its destruction of asteroids and space ships.</p>\n<p>CUSTOMER WARNING: The Tractor beam will break if it is streached to far or hit by an asteroid. If the P.L.O.W. is disconnected for too long the plasma will become unstable and explode (probably destroying you with it). To fix the Tractor Beam just maintain a close distance to the P.L.O.W. for a short time. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T17:45:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/851/851321c07aa810dde478e385627241ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Owen"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
