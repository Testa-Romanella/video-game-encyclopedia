It is inspired by the games of our childhood, played on the Brick Game E-9999 console and has some 90's references.</p><p>The only controlling device one needs to play it is a mouse, since we wanted to make it mobile-friendly (so we can remake it for mobile platforms in the future).<br/></p><p>Authors:</p><p>Joanna Kamelska \"Aschau\"</p><p>Filip Stolarczuk \"Fifka\"</p><p>Mateusz Roszkowski \"Ro\u017cek\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ff/2ff3c050539dab796cce23883d7ca859.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fifka"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
