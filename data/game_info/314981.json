You have been chosen to demonstrate your skills of battle in the arena. In there you will find several enemies: spiders, bats, drones, sorcerers, and the doomba. All of them are attempting to kill you and they get stronger over time, you must dodge their attacks. You also fight back. Look out for heart crystals to replenish health. The first slot is your sword, it deals damage and knock back. The second weapon is a bow. Hold to wind up, then release. Your arrows are limited. Next is your handgun. It is instant fire and deals more damage. Next is the spell book. You have several spells each with its own code. Learn the codes to perform the spell, but at a cost! Finally, you have a tele-porter that will bring you back and fourth from the shop. At the shop, and you can buy swords, armor, arrows, and bullets. In the shop, you don\u2019t spend money - you spend blood. So keep your health up in there! Good luck gladiator!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T08:26:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/023/0234ec22092b8c030ce48910ea06ea72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ryfi"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
