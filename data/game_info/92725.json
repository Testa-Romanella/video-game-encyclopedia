And to make things worse, my damn leg is gone. I have no choice but to use this wheelchair I found to move about and this camcorder to see in the dark. Shit, will I ever find a way out of this horrible place?\" - Ryan<br/><br/>This is an Outlast inspired horror game about trying to escape an asylum full of ghosts trying to kill you, or worse, turn you into one of them. You must traverse the asylum on your wheelchair and find fuses to activate the front door to escape. But... This is not an easy task, your wheelchair has limited mobility and makes turns slow and difficult, will insanity and frustration consume you or will you be able to find a way out and escape this nightmare?<br/><br/>To be honest, the game might be easy or difficult depending on how your playthrough turns out and if you get used to the wheelchiar controls. Well, I hope you enjoy this short experimental horror game!<br/></p>\n<p>Note: If you encounter a bug where your wheelchair moves EXTREMELY slowly, let me know! One user out of a bunch encountered this issue and I have no idea how to fix it. Edit: A theory of mine seems to have proven that this only occurs for EU users strangely enough. So if you encounter this, try to play the 32 bit version of the game. That helped one user fix the problem while the second user just waited a day and for some reason it fixed itself somehow.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:26:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3b/d3b1fa4433157c51ea010c537f450e14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dave Microwaves Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
