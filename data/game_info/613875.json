The hero Gudbrand wants to redeem himself of his past sins through a series of trials that will challenge his wit, vigor and might.<br/></p>\n<p>This is an early prototype of an action adventure game made during a 48 hour GameJam. We wanted to show how much can be done in such small time. The game includes detailed melee combat with block and combo mechanics. Includes 5 different types of enemies ranged and melee and has a fully featured taunting end game boss with lots of different types of attacks. The game also has a dark theme and custom made amazing ambient sounds and soundtracks that reflects the nature of this devilish environment in the depths of hell.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T04:48:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/835/8354d826213e12d2e0786d46bb63506c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["erencalayir"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
