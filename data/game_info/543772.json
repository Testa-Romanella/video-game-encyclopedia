{"id": 543772, "slug": "my-noir-demo", "name": "My Noir (Demo)", "name_original": "My Noir (Demo)", "description": "<p>(currently only compatible with Windows)</p>\n<p>A demo about a man and his dog.</p>\n<p>Ron is a man who lives in his apartment with his working boyfriend, James. But Ron hasn't been doing so well, barely eating, never leaving the building and... letting his feelings out in unspeakable ways.</p>\n<p>One day,\u00a0a black puppy shows up in his home. James never adopted a puppy nor were they planning to ever adopt a pet. Only Ron can see this puppy so he gets used to having it around, playing pong and talking. But as the puppy grows to a full sized dog, Ron can feel his mental health deteriorate.</p>\n<p>What is this dog doing to him? And how can he help himself now when this dog is consuming his life?</p>\n<p>(This game is inspired by my own experiences and uses assets from Gacha Club and Google. If I need to, the full game will have completely new assets, all originally drawn.)</p>\n<p>If you suffer with depression or any of the symptoms shown in the demo or full game, please do not suffer in silence. Talk to someone, take care of yourself. If you won't I will kick down your door and hug you until you do. Honestly, you are all amazing, every single one of you, please don't let this Black Dog become a demon. Let your voice be heard, allow people to worry about you and help you. It may not get rid of the dog entirely but it'll bring it back to puppy size for sure.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you self-harm or are considering suicide, I shall list four suicide and crisis hotlines. Please, don't do this alone:<br/></p>\n<p>National Suicide Prevention Hotline -- 1-800-273-8255 (pretty self explanatory. Please, suicide is not the answer. If you give up now, you'll miss out on all the opportunities life has laid out: success, friendship, love, happiness, achievement. Don't throw it away, get help. Talk to someone before it's too late)</p>\n<p>Crisis Text Line -- Text Hello to 741741 (most people don't like calling so this line is just texting. You can talk to someone if you're suicidal, self-harming, depressed or just need someone there who will listen. We all care about you, we're all here)</p>\n<p>YouthLine -- Text teen2teen to 839863, or call 1-877-968-8491 (I know there are teens out there who suffer in silence. I won't allow you guys to be silent anymore. We're in this together, okay?)</p>\n<p>SAMHSA National Helpline \u2013 1-800-662-4357 (for drug addiction &amp; alcohol. This is, in a way, self-harm. If you find yourself in any of these addictions, look for help, seek intervention. You are an amazing person, don't harm yourself in this way)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T07:34:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55f/55fe2d58ae0162cfdc58c3a9044eadfc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BraneGrumps"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
