Soar through 30 pre-built cities, or import your own SimCity 2000 cities - and see them in hyper-realistic 3-D. Either way, the urban skies aren&#39;t exactly friendly. There are fires to fight, shipwrecked Sims to save and traffic to un-jam. Complete your missions and reap your rewards: a snazzier copter and a tougher aerial test. SimCity 2000 not required. Nerves of steel recommended.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T03:56:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d7/2d799fe4d147e2a279e9c7c886c9d382.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.71, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 4, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 208, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Maxis"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts", "Maxis"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
