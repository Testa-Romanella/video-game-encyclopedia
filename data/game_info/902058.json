In this game, your goal is rather simple : save every citizens lost throughout the archipelago, take the risk of drowning to reach them, and use lifesavers to travel easier between islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls : </strong>Use arrows to move your character, right-click on it to place a lifesaver where you are, and use right-click on any village to purchase the lifesavers.</p>\n<p>PS : This is the very first game I publish, and the first I take part in a Game Jam, please be kind (especially about graphisms, I'm not that much of a great artist). It was made with Construct 2.<br/>Feel free to send me feedbacks !<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-30T08:00:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efe/efe1bef660867a078a972e116896e2aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["plolyna"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
