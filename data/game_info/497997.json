It is based on children\u2019s books and fairytales. <br/><br/>Although the game is for all ages, one of the aims of the game is to help younger players with reading and text comprehension.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>In BeetleQuest the three beetle friends, Magnus, Boris and Dagmar are playing with their most beautiful marble, when Boris accidentially shoots it into a molehill.<br/><br/>The mole inside is very angry for he has a large bump on his head. He refuses to give back the marble. Only if he gets a nice present from the beetlefriends will he give the marble back.<br/><br/>And so, their quest begins! To find a nice present for the mole and get back their precious marble.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>In the Netherland and other countries reading skills are on the decline. With our game we hope to stimulate young players to read and develop their reading skills.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>If you would like to try the game out, an online demo of the game can be found on our website.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T01:53:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19a/19aa89009702c52eb1c65da92f8a8794.jpg", "website": "http://beetlequest.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Fasold Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Fasold Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
