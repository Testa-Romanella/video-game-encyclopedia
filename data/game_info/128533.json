{"id": 128533, "slug": "defender-of-ramsbottom", "name": "Defender of Ramsbottom", "name_original": "Defender of Ramsbottom", "description": "<p>The quiet village of Ramsbottom is under attack! You are charged with organising the village defences. Place and repair towers to defeat a variety of enemies. Three game modes, story, random and budget. More enemy types, tower types and difficulty as you progress. Ideal for kids as well as adults, easy to play.</p>\n<p>It has been made with low requirements so should run well on low power Android devices and scale to anti aliasing and shadows on desktop. Although primarily designed for\u00a0mouse and touchscreen, there is also keyboard, joystick and gamepad support (I'm unable to fully test Android gamepad support, but it works on my tested devices and input is configurable on desktop).<br/></p>\n<p>Please comment any feedback, ratings, suggestions\u00a0and bug reports. If you enjoy the game I will work on it more! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/607/607dec71319f5ec78f93633b74f97066.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["lawnjelly"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
