Well, <strong>TOO BAD!</strong>.\u00a0 The architect of his tower was drunk, you can barely maneuver in the air while you run and your lighting spell sucks too! At least your robe can sustain enough damage, but... can you climb the tower and get away with... The Gold of the Neverquaker?!</p>\r\n\u00a0Controls (If you need them):\r\nAD keys: Move Character\r\nW key: Jump and double jump\r\nMouse: Move Magic Wand\r\nLeft Click: Run\r\nRight Click: Cast MILWA, the Light Spell (if you can...)\r\n\n<p>LORE BASED PREMISE (read if you want to know more)</p>\n<em>\"Finally! That old Neverquaker has finally passed away!  However, it would be a shame for his fortune to go to waste, and I would not mind putting it to good use myself. After all, that old decrepit man never got along with anyone, I don't even know if he had a family so most likely there is not any heir to take his money. To his abandoned tower at once! I said while unaware of the trials that awaited me. It turns out this damn tower is as cursed as his own fate for even a magician such as myself has trouble navigating this place; my trusted magic barely works and even a simple light spell becomes very unstable in here. Luckily my enchanted clothes can still protect me from any harm. I must get to the top where his treasure is and flee as soon as I can, for I even feel my own sanity crumbling every minute I'm here...\"<br/></em>\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<p>Adhemar\u00a0(GAME DESIGNER, GRAPHIC DESIGNER, PROGRAMMER)</p>\n<p>SacredHX\u00a0(PROGRAMER)</p>\n<p>Chuck Stardude\u00a0(2D ARTIST, PIXEL ARTIST)</p>\n<p>Diadem\u00a0(MUSIC COMPOSER)</p>\n<p>Alpha Bit\u00a0(GAME DESIGNER, PROGRAMMER)</p>\n<p>Gherard (GAME DESIGNER, PROGRAMMER)\u00a0</p>\n<p>FULLDAKA\u00a0(2D ARTIST, PIXEL ARTIST)</p>\n<p>Ghosty (GAME DESIGNER, PROGRAMMER)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Vydah\u00a0(SOUND EFFECTS)</p>\n<p>NaPLZ (ASSIST GAME DESIGNER)</p>\n<p>Dialogic addon Made by\u00a0Emilio Coppola.</p><p>Dos de los integrantes de este juego son estudiantes formales de Image Campus (imagecampus.edu.ar)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T12:23:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0b/d0bc248404bb557b46d2066fbd0494a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adhemar"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
