[PROTOTYPE 1]", "description": "<p>A small game I wanted to prototype over a day or so. I programmed the game, make the art/animations, but found the sound effects and music online.</p>\n<p>You \"bank\" a coin by holding onto it for 5 seconds. Once you bank 5 coins you win. Upon death your character will disappear for a few seconds, and then reappear with full health and will still retain their banked coins.</p>\n<p>Player1 (just called Player in the game)\u00a0controls via A/D for left/right, W for jump, and E for attack.</p>\n<p>Player2 controls via left/right arrows for left/right, up arrow for jump, and right CTRL for attack.</p>\n<p>The game will reset 5 seconds after a player has won.</p>\n<p>This game was meant to prototype an idea I had for a somewhat larger game. The larger game would possibly include the following:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>ability to attack in 4 directions</li><li>sword, flintlock pistol, bomb</li><li>dashing/rolling</li><li>much larger and more dynamic levels</li><li>changeable hats</li><li>support for up to 8 players and team/FFA modes</li><li>online support</li><li>modifiers such as timers, coins needed to win, attack damage, etc</li><li>polished gameplay, art, music, sound effects</li></ul>\n<p>Thanks for checking out the game!
