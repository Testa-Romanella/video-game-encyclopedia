So I spent hundreds of hours on this one and learned many things later on in the project which would have made the development easier at the beginning. I'm 19 years old, life in Austria and love making computer games and learned using the Unreal Engine all by myself. Maybe you would like to have a look at my piece of software.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is a first person shooter which is a combination of COD and CS. I tried to make the movements and animations as smooth as I can. I created two different game modes. \"Team-Fight\" and \"COOP-Zombies\" with 7 maps included. This game should probably run on any computer even without an own graphics card. That's what the name \"potato computer\" means ;-) You can change graphics settings in the settings menu.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Zombies:<br/></strong>You can play the Zombie-Maps alone or with Friends LAN (up to 8 players).\u00a0 Weapons on walls, new ways to go through (recommended for zombiewave 5 and above) and \"random boxes\" can be bought on the map with the earned money. You get money for zombiewaves, zombiekills and bonus money for headshots. If one of your colleagues doesn't have enough money you can drop them a weapon. Let's see how long you can survive!</p>\n<p><strong>PVP:</strong><br/>In \"Team-Fight\" everybody who wants to play needs to join before the game starts. When everybody is ready and has chosen a team the host needs to press ESC and klick on \"START GAME\". After the countdown is over, the game starts. In the first 10 seconds everybody is able to buy new weapons by pressing B (if you have enough money). If you die you lose your weapons. You can drop weapons with G. The team that reaches 9 points first, wins the game.</p>\n<p>The more players play on the same server, the stronger the server should be. The server should not play with a refresh rate less than 30fps in order to work perfectly. Firewalls could probably block the game (just for local multiplayer) so disable them for the private network for this application before you start the multiplayer server!<br/></p>\n\n<p>(SaveGames will be saved to: \"C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Local\\TPCPG\")</p>\n<p>If you like the game I will probably continue with creating games. If you want to be a tester for my future games, just contact me!<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you like the game! Donations are very appreciated! :-)<br/></p>\n<p>Let \u00a0me know if you have any troubles!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e7/6e76061d34d8b534d4aec08505ed8261.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 265, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AustrianSandman"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
