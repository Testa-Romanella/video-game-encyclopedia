{"id": 949180, "slug": "simple-ai", "name": "Simple AI", "name_original": "Simple AI", "description": "<p>This project was completed as part of a Live Creator Challenge, and it was developed in Unreal, primarily using C++ and expanding on the pre-existing Third Person template.</p><p><strong><em>Implementation</em></strong><br/>As the name suggests, this project focuses on the implementation of a simple AI enemy which follows the player when they are in its line of sight. Its behaviour was implemented using behaviour trees:</p>\n\n<p>The enemy has a patrol path that it follows until the player is detected, in which case, it follows them. Once the player leaves the enemy's field of view, it investigates\u00a0 by\u00a0moving to the player's last known location. If it does not \"see\" the player again, it returns to its original patrol route.</p><p><strong><em>Further Improvements<br/></em></strong>Due to the in-engine functions that were used, the enemy can detect the player even when it isn't facing them, and that, along with the low walls, make it almost impossible for the player to lose the enemy.<br/></p>\n<p>Moreover, at the moment, there are no win or lose conditions implemented into the project and no goal for the player.</p><p><strong><em>Assets</em></strong><br/>This projects makes use of the\u00a0Modular Gothic Temple asset pack\u00a0available in the Unreal Marketplace.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T14:43:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c40/c40a039cb2b7489915bddb0c973f8184.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nico Oprescu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
