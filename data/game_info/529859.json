When you fall down you must start the level at the begin. There are red obstacles, when you touch them you lose a hitpoint. You have ten hitpoints, when you lose all you lose a life. There are also blue diamants which give you hitpoints back. There are four levels.</p>\n<p>Controls are with the cursor-keys, with the mouse you can look around.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T08:15:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7f/f7fa45776d56f9e3c008f076c391ccba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bardon"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
