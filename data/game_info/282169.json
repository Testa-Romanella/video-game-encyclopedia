The hero would go through trials based on the minor arcana in preparation for defeating all of the major arcana as big boss monsters!\u00a0It sounded like a fun idea that I would never do, so why not just pull out a part of the made up story and make it up? Disclaimer: I am not very knowledgeable when it comes to tarot, so consider this tarot-inspired instead; the card descriptions in here are certainly not accurate in at least a few ways.</p>\n<p>Made with:</p>\n<p>Bitsy by Adam Le Doux</p>\n<p>with help from\u00a0Borksy by Ayolland\u00a0</p>\n<p>using\u00a0\u00a0hacks\u00a0by\u00a0\u00a0mildmojo\u00a0and\u00a0Sean S.
