However, there is no supervisor around to help you. At the end of the day, all that matters is your ability to organize the lab. Good luck!\r\n<p>This was quite fun to make, the 1-bit art is so quick to produce and although I had some big ideas for stuff like conveyors, spillages, explosions and doors with buttons, I didn't think it was in keeping with the Low Effort jam. It was also the first time I've made music in OpenMPT!
