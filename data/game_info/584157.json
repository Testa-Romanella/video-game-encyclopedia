Is a Roguelike bullet hell with methodical combat that leans heavily into resource management. Achieve the proper flow to maximize your damage output. Build up a loadout as you play and find the synergies between 3 classes and over 50 abilities! Battle your way through 3 different procedurally generated areas! Dodge attacks, defeat bosses, customize your loadout, and destroy The Orb!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>!ALERT! there is a known issue causing crashes on player death, this is caused by a windows security feature and can be fixed by running the game as administrator.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>There are a couple important things that aren't explained in the game so consider this paragraph your startup guide. In Destroy The Orb you pick two of the three classes to make your loadout from, you pick a primary class from which you take three of your starting abilities and a secondary class from which you take one. Much of the game is about finding the synergy between classes, so mixing and matching is recommended. To change your classes, while in the practice room\u00a0press <b> or interact with the wheel called the loadout changer. The practice room is the room you start the game in, from there you can access a basic tutorial plus three additional tutorials explaining the mechanics of each class. The portal to the first tutorial is in the top right corner of the practice room, the other three are off to the left.\u00a0It's recommended that you complete them all.</b></p>\n<p>This game is listed as a prototype because the extent to which development will continue depends on how much interest the game gets and whether I can find a new artist to bring onto the project. If you would like to be that artist, details are in the next paragraph.</p>\n<p>It will be immediately obvious that most of the art in the game right now is temp art. The project had a dedicated artist for a while but currently we have none and are looking for an artist of undergrad level as well as a composer to score the game, payment will be in the form of a share of the games revenue but this individual should primarily be in it for the reason I am which is to make something creatively satisfying and which can be put on a resume. Basically I'm doing this for the experience primarily and you should be too if you want to join me. contact me at maxw9787@gmail.com if you are interested.</p>\n<p>Have fun! -Max Wilde</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T02:45:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aff/aff011a91850c68ede627adcd1cf0790.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Max Wilde"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
