Something smells bad about this whole situation!</p>\n<p>Check out the included README for instructions on how to play, or make use of the special facility for those who want to stream the game.</p>\n<p>If you need some hints, check out the hint page.</p>\r\nVoice cast\r\n<p>This second instalment features the voice talents of Jason Cryer as the protagonist and Durinde as Eddie the security guard. The lovely Erika Sanderson did triple duty as the receptionist, Queen Elizabeth and President Harris. Natalie Winter answers the phone in the most annoying way I dared to ask of her and Paul Thomas must be on his way to retirement if he rakes in the money well as his character Doug the toilet paper salesman does in this game. Last but not least, we have my dear friend Dirk M. Weger as the German chancellor in dire need of some \"Klopapier\".</p>\n<p>Thank you so much for bringing these characters to life!</p>\r\nSpecial thanks\r\n<p>A special thank you goes out to Al Lowe for being a good sport and providing material to an easter egg in the game.
