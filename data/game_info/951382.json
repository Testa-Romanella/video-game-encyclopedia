In this environment where anything can cost its survival, a small civilization of rats thrives. This is the City-State of Haven.</p>\n<p>Located in the heart of a wheat field whose borders few mice have had the chance to map, the city stands on the Ruins of the ancient people. The rubble of that past hides a lost magical treasure: technology. Hundreds of rats venture into the Ruins every day, looking for equipment, weapons, resources that they can use to fight threats up to five times their size.</p>\n<p>As a recruit of the city's official guard, the player will also venture into the Ruins and patrol the forests, with the goal of keeping their people safe.</p>\n\n<p>But how safe would the people of Haven be? You can't eat technology, and soon, there will be nothing left but dried wheat. They need to go deeper into the forest.
