This was originally created for the Advanced Games Engineering module I did at university, but has been adapted for public release.</p>\n<p>The application currently contains four scenes which can be explored and rendered in real-time. As the camera moves, noise appears on the screen. By keeping the camera stationary, the frames converge to give a better image. The application is capable of rendering four different materials - Lambertian, metallic, dielectric, and emissive - which alter how rays are reflected and refracted.</p>\n<p>This toy application does not require DX12 RTX enabled GPUs and should work with DX11 GPUs. However, performance will vary for different GPUs. If performance is an issue,\u00a0 try reducing the resolution from the main menu.</p>\n<p>The application is contained in a zip file, which can be downloaded below.\u00a0Feel free to leave a message or issue in the comments below.\u00a0</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<p>The controls for the application are detailed as follows:</p>\r\nMOVEMENT AND CAMERA\r\n<strong>Input</strong><strong>Action</strong>WMoves in the direction that the camera is facingSMoves away from the direction the camera is facingAStrafe leftDStrafe rightMouseChange where the camera is looking\r\nSKY COLOUR\r\n<strong>Input</strong><strong>Action</strong>F1Enable a blue skyF2Enable a night skyF3Enable a vaporwave skyF4Enable a\u00a0 textured sky\r\nOTHER CONTROLS\r\n<strong>Input</strong><strong>Action</strong>KReduce the ray bounce limit by 1LIncrease the ray bounce limit by 1NEnable denoising (enabled by default)MDisable denoisingEscapeReturn to the main menu\r\nFUTURE WORK\r\n<p>Although this is a toy application, there is still further work to carry out.\u00a0 These include:</p>\n<ul><li>Improvements to performance</li><li>Adding volumetric fog effects</li><li>Adding textures</li><li>Adding more materials</li><li>Adding physically-based rendering techniques</li></ul>\r\nVERSION HISTORY\r\nDateDescriptionVersion21/05/21First public release1.0", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-24T08:35:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ac/3ac2b5c3dc8af45014948d13804af6bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Graeme"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
