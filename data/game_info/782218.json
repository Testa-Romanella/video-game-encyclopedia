But now, four brave adventurers seek to destroy the evil lord once and for all, and claim his treasures for themselves!</p>\n<p>Three of the adventurers set out into the dungeon's 20 levels to battle its perils face to face. The fourth is the powerful wizard Zpectru, who uses his powers to watch over his comrades from afar, guiding them to the riches - and protecting them from the necromancer's many deadly minions and traps.</p>\n<p>You control Zpectru's Eye of Force. By guiding it to a spot and pressing Fire, the adventurers will make their way to that point as best they can. If the Eye is passed over an enemy, the wizard's magic will destroy them. Be warned, though; many enemies will soon be revived by Skulvort's malign power, and some cannot be harmed at all - only briefly stopped.</p>\n<p>The controls are Q/A (Up and Down), O/P (Left and Right) and Space (Fire). Can you find all 60 pieces of treasure and defeat the necromancer?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T23:57:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/550/55098907e976a379ea5c8272ce58e11d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Payndz"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
