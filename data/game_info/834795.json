It's not done yet. Maybe you can help me finish it. Is it pretentious to leave it like this and call it an art piece?</p>\n<p>Note: The \"Final\" build is left because that was the original release, but the OpenXRFix one is recommended as it SHOULD support a wider variety of hardware. Please feel free to give feedback if you hit any snags.</p>\n<p>Same goes for the Quest build...I have no hardware to test on, so let me know if it has issues. I'll try and get it working for as many people as possible!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T15:18:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae4/ae45672ebd4bef80b9632956e8de7c22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["ProdigiaGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
