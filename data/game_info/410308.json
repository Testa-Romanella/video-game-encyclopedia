Hex priests can put themselves into the state of suspended animation and enter the realms beyond, they call it veil-walking. These incursions into enemy territory are limited, it is only possible to stay in these realms for a limited time that's why every hex priest uses visualization technique called veil hourglass to time their presence, not only that but demons also become more and more enraged the longer they feel your presence, killing them there slightly increases this time limit, it is said that those of high ranks in hex priest order are so skilled, they're able to sustain themselves for months and even years veil-walking.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Demon army is planning to invade earth via cthonic wormholes, which started to appear in every realm, one by one. Because of that your mission is to kill as many demons as you can before your time runs out. This must be low profile, safely executed mission. Avoid physical contact with enemy at all costs, since beginner veil-walkers can't take even a single touch from otherworldly entities without being kicked out from suspended animation right away. For this reason you're given sword, crafted with special metal by the strongest of hex priest blacksmiths, that negates dangers of contact with demonic entities. Keep an eye out for demon shards, these are small pieces of soul that sometimes are left on the ground after executing demons and are attracted to your veil hourglass. You can use it to speed up your personal time flow - giving you the power to exceed human speed limits for a short time period.</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>WASD - movement</p>\n<p>SPACE - attack/start game/restart</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T05:00:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f3/1f3399f1258976c82371f3adf38c9f4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Druidokva"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
