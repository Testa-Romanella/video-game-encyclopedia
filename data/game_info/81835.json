Wouldn't it be something if you could tell at a glance how many matches were actually on the ground? This is somehow what happens in the movie Rain Man (1988), where this is one of the special gifts of idiot savant Raymond Babbitt, played by Dustin Hoffman. In this game you can test how much of this gift you have yourself. And you can even try to develop it further. You will see a number of matches on the floor, and must pick the right number as fast as you can. If you are correct, you go on to the next level, in which the number of matches will probably get higher. How long will you be able to guess the right number, and what level will you reach? Don't think this is a game of luck... At the beginning you may not be able to see the differences, but after a while you may develop the ability to recognize the size of a pile of matches fairly accurate. So yes, practice makes perfect!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:22:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe5/fe5bf6d5758e170724e401936aaae1ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Mark Vertegaal"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Mark Vertegaal"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
