{"id": 5148, "slug": "kahoots", "name": "Kahoots", "name_original": "Kahoots", "description": "<p>Guide your Kahoot to the exit of each of the 50 levels by dragging the blocks that form the floors of the platforms to create a safe path. Along the way you will be able to make use of special blocks, like bounce blocks and trap doors to aid your route through the levels. Don\u2019t worry if you reach the edge or bottom of the level, the world wraps around, so you\u2019ll be able to use this as a way to move around some levels. Cannons can be used both to travel long distances the Kahoot cannot get to on foot, or as a useful way to get past barriers and obstacles. Talking of obstacles, the spike blocks will make the Kahoot very unhappy, whilst cardboard boxes just get in the way. Beware of the Cardborg! It patrols the levels intent on making the Kahoot\u2019s exit as difficult as possible, though even it can prove useful at times in clearing your route home. Got stuck? The Pegbeast will be on hand with his happy songs to help you learn how to play!<br />\nKahoots is \u00a92009 Honeyslug Limited.
