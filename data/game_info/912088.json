Players must reach their collection goal first by collecting same colour blocks, and then race to their final gate to win!</p><p>Players can sabotage the other player by collecting special blocks which decreases the other player's block count and speed, or focus on\u00a0collecting\u00a0the most blocks first.</p><p>Each player has a speed and block counter, which impacts gameplay for a unique experience on each play. Speed can be increased by going through rings, and blocks can be increased by collecting your colour block as well as by collecting grey bonus blocks. Players can choose their strategy; are you going to focus on collecting all the blocks as fast as you can? are you going to increase your speed to be quicker when racing to your final gate? are you going to sabotage the other player?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T10:26:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/398/398dcc236a8ce439fefed9071148c135.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hattie"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
