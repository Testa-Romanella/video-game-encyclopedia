You must carefully manage your resources, and pick your\u00a0targets wisely, saving that final, devastating\u00a0round in the chamber for the big bastards.</p>\n\n<p>Controls\u00a0(Controller Only)</p>\n<p>Move - Left Stick</p>\n<p>Aim - Right Stick</p>\n<p>Shoot - Right Trigger</p>\n<p>Swap Health for Ammo - Left Trigger</p>\n<p>Dash - A/X (Bottom-most face-button)</p>\n\n<p>DEPLETER was developed in 5 days for Blackthornprod Jam #3 by a team of one; just me.
