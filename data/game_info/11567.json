You play as one of the marine corps sent to investigate what is going on.</p>\n<p>The game features both singleplayer and multiplayer modes. Singleplayer serves both as a tutorial and a part of a story that continues in multiplayer.</p>\n<p>A heavy emphasis is put on the game&#39;s class system that features 8 classes from Assault to Recon. The game offers some degree of replayability as every map&#39;s feature is randomized and an average play session lasts no longer than one hour. There is some element of RPG mechanics to the game as players are able to gain experience points. There are 25 Ranks and 10 Speciality Ranks. While ranks are an indication of a player&#39;s progress in the game, Speciality Ranks are used in order to level up a specific class. With each new Specialty Rank, there is an Attribute bonus for the player.</p>\n<p>Different parts of the marine equipment can be replaced in order to change one&#39;s stats and customize the playstyle.</p>", "metacritic": 74, "released": "2015-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:25:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d87/d87268c4b7b33b278cbc1f152db39729.jpg", "website": "http://www.theredsolstice.com/", "rating": 2.27, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 229, "owned": 3186, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 12, "dropped": 53}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 73, "ratings_count": 167, "suggestions_count": 519, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 166, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ironward"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Nkidu Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
