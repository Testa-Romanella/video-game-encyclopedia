In the 2D version of the classic tin can alley game<br/>it's about hitting cans with a ball and clearing them. You have to remove different obstacles<br/>or solve small puzzles in order to get to the cans. Good timing and skill are always helpful.<br/>Sometimes, however, it only helps to knock the cans down with enough force.<br/><br/>In the 8 scenarios with a total of 160 levels the little tennis ball \"Benny\" has to master <br/>various environmental influences such as weightlessness or currents on the seabed, <br/>to clear away all the cans. Insidious dangers can lurk here and there.<br/> <br/>The difficulty varies from scenario to scenario and caters to both beginners and savvy <br/>Gamers. There are also 22 motivational achievements. Those who have already <br/>mastered KnockDown can also prove their skills in 16 leaderboards.<br/><br/>KnockDown is a \"real\" indie game. No 30-person development team, no million-dollar budget, <br/>no publisher, nothing.
