HVR is a VR experiment inspired by Marvel's Iron Man designed to push the boundaries of VR locomotion by providing a way for players to experience free flight and 360-degree aerial combat without a cockpit. <br/><br/>HVR puts you inside of an armored suit and straps jetpacks to your hands that let you fly, dodge, and shoot in all directions! Live your dreams of being a superhero and take on a horde of enemy fighter jets that won't give up without a fight. <br/><br/>If you liked this or have feedback, please direct them to the HVR Demo Community Discussion page: http://steamcommunity.com/app/510950/discussions/ <br/><br/>I'd love to make this a full game if there's enough interest and support from the community! <br/><br/>Special thanks to Jabili, Austin, Jared, Zach, Sean, Rohan, and Ramya for providing feedback and helping test.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7a/e7afb348a15cb86b747bf371c654e9cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MistahLe"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
