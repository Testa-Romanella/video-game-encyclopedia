They are gathered into a barnyard with the aim of building a house and getting the free eggs. Players need to avoid the cross-hairs of lasers, which eventually lead to ending up getting hit or killed by lightning. There is a lot of aggression in this game. Players are chasing each other and throwing objects on each other. Your duck will be carried away by laser and you can only save it if you catch it.</p>\n<p>I recommend this game to the players who love a unique experience and appreciate creativity in games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T08:36:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/981/981edecde7fb3486ea9136e11537b915.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Phasmida"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
