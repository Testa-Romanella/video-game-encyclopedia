Tumblin' Dice seeks to understand what it must feel like for a die as it tumbles down a dice tower. Or that's what it set out to do, whether\u00a0it succeeded... who knows?</p>\n<p>Rotate the die as it falls to meet the colour of the obstacle with the colours on the face of the dice. Succeed and you will continue to move down. Fail, or stop moving down, and you will lose a die. Fail as the D4 and you will need to restart.</p>\n<p>Made by two people with barely any real experience in the engine we used it came out pretty alright. Have a play and let us know what you think!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Move the die with the Arrow keys</li><li>Rotate the die using W,A,S,D,Q, and E</li><li>Press K to destroy your current die if you get stuck</li><li>Press R after losing the D4 to respawn</li></ul>\n<p>Touching an obstacle with the same coloured face as that obstacle will allow you to progress, any other colour will destroy your current die.</p>\n\n<p>Music by audionautix.com</p>\n<p>UI from UI pack by Kenney</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T13:28:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/002/002399d94a5383043266acdab0a6aab7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dreamhost"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
