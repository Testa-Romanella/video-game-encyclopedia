{"id": 117049, "slug": "commander", "name": "Commander", "name_original": "Commander", "description": "<p>You are a senior military officer of Cinethra, an impoverished kingdom being attacked by a much larger and richer neighbor. You must decide how far you are willing to go to save your kingdom, or whether to save it at all. <br/> <br/>Not to spoil too much of the game, but there are 3 story branches where you turn traitor, 2 story branches where you continue fighting for Cinethra, and one story branch where you become a monk. And it is possible to make either Cinethra or Japreth win the war, so your decisions actually do matter beyond just whether or not you survive. Includes 50,000 words and five songs. Please do not run on Internet Explorer.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/793/793563fa32c6d3345f0eb0f77e6f494d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nathaniel"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
