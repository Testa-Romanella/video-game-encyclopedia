Presented with profit targets by a boss who has no hesitation to sack you, you\u2019ll need to engage in panic sales and timed events, lobby society groups to influence the stock market, and even undertake all-out majority share acquisitions. Read the news to see the signs, or dabble with some insider trading to get the upper edge. But, be warned, a financial investigation into your company has begun, and you may well become the focus.<br/><br/>Intentionally political, The Invisible Hand explores the way we value things in a story-driven stock market simulator that will have you reaching for your tenth coffee before the working day is done.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Your job is simple: make money, lots of money. The more you make, the happier your boss is, the richer you become, and the more you have to invest. But can you keep the cycle going?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Use your profits to lobby key groups in the community, driving the price of raw commodities up or down to suit your stock market portfolio.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Every day comes with a myriad of deadlines: mission objectives, profit targets and more. But if that\u2019s not bad enough, rumours of an impending financial investigation have started to circulate\u2026<br/><br/><br/><br/>When all is done and traded, what was it all worth? What did it earn? What did it cost? And who decides?", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-07T19:59:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aba/abaaa2c0b791e778a53794eb8c65b6d0.jpg", "website": "http://fellowtraveller.games/games/the-invisible-hand/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 10, "owned": 144, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 20, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 219, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Power Struggle Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fellow Traveller"], "esrb_rating": null}
