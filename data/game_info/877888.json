I created a pseudo rhythm game, in which the character(to the best I could do) matches his jumps and movement to the beats in the song. For example, the track ends perfectly once you complete the level. Also, the falling section is during a steady staircase of notes that fall to a lower octave.</p>\n<p>2. I modified the code so that I could accomplish a few things. For 1, I made it so that my character moves continuously without needing any input. Also, I made it so that the song can loop at the beginning of the level(This isn't a major mod, just something I thought I should mention).</p>\n<p>3. I created the track for which my character runs to.</p>\n<p>4. Now you may be wondering who that handsome devil is that is running? Well that's MEEEEEE!!!! I had a friend shutter shoot me doing the actions in the game, and used stop motion techniques to create animations for my character.</p>\n<p>Created by Aiden Kalisz</p>\n<p>Assets provided by MSU CAS 117.</p>\n<p>Character animation and level music provided by Aiden Kalisz</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T17:48:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98a/98a698e368d7e5a66894812c316fd9e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["NOOBDUDEMANDUDE"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
