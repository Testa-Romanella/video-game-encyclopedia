Your task is straightforward and classic: Pull the sword from the stone.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0I\u00a0guess you'll find out.</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0Play as each of three characters, each with their own set of tools and strengths. Select a tool and click on items in the scene to try and get the sword out of the stone. You can't mess up- even if your attempt doesn't work, you might just discover something else. Though you make choices about what you do and when, the narrative is eventually linear and you will uncover the whole story as you play.<br/><br/>Sound on, headphones recommended. If you use full screen and the scene doesn't fit, just use your browser's zoom in/out function: CMD +/- on a Mac, or CTRL +/- on a PC.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Average play time: 20 - 40 minutes<br/></p>\n<p>-----------------------------------</p>\n<p>Destiny was built as a single page web app\u00a0with Vue.js, and created with hand-painted watercolor art. The sound effects were created with Audacity, and the music is\u00a0River Flute by\u00a0Kevin MacLeod, used under\u00a0CC License.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is free!

This is my first game, and I'd love constructive feedback on what worked for you and what didn't, if you have it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T13:25:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c5/1c54efe460588240e10b5bde3218b2bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["goblinwife"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
