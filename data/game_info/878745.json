This level is designed to be an immersive 3D shooter experience, though this first demo lacks any combat.<br/></p>\n<p>Almost the entire level is created with free and premade content, from either the Unreal Asset Store, Free3D.com, or FreeSounds.org.<br/>I intentionally wanted to build a project with premade assets that were not made together to demonstrate my ability to create within constraints and to design without the ability to request additional content. I did however program a majority of the scripting within the level and implemented all effects myself.<br/>If you are interested in my work, my other projects are created with art specifically made for those projects. You can find them here:\u00a0https://myfirstnamejake.wixsite.com/jackalopegames<br/><br/>This project is still in progress, so any feedback is appreciated! Thank you for checking out my work.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T10:32:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc5/dc58e35ea92cb550c338901ca3e07b7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 192, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bubblenuts13"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
