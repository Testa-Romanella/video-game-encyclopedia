At approximately 4:27 pm, Tatsumi\u2019s captor was subdued by Alexander Kunyo, a friend and upperclassman of Tatsumi\u2019s. No later than 4:34 pm, local authorities arrived to apprehend the captor, with little harm coming to him, Tatsumi, Kunyo, or any of the other students on campus at the time.</p>\n<p>This game is not about that story.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game IS about high school sophomore Alex, who has vowed to give physical fitness\u00a0 training to his best friend, who he affectionately refers to as \u2018Marou-chan.\u2019 The training, Alex hopes, will get his friend to a level of strength that would prevent him from the possibility of getting, say, kidnapped or something. You know, on the off chance that might happen. Said training begins with Alex inducting his friend into their school\u2019s dodgeball team, in turn forcing him into whatever potentially head trauma inducing activities that come with the membership. That is where this game begins.\r\n</p>\n<p>This is my first project in unity, so it isn\u2019t anywhere near perfect but I hope you enjoy it! The highest score I was able to get in Endless Mode was 162, so if you were able to get higher than that please leave a comment with your score!\r\n</p>\n<p>Downloading the Windows build is recommended, but the browser version is there if you can\u2019t/don\u2019t want to download it.\r\n</p>\n<p>As always, thanks for playing!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T05:50:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f5/5f5fd642e2209a82c93210bdcd0c984f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Phil Johnson"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
