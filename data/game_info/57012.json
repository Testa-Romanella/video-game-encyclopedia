The game follows a puppet named Headdy in his efforts to stop an evil puppet king from taking over his world. Headdy can throw his head at enemies to defeat them and use it to pull himself to various areas and move objects. The player can find a wide variety of \"heads\" which act as power-ups that provide different effects and alter gameplay.</p>\n<p>Critical reception to Dynamite Headdy was positive. Critics highlighted the game's originality and creativity in distinguishing it among other games in the platform genre. They also commended Treasure for demonstrating their technical expertise with impressive graphical effects and building on the success of their earlier game Gunstar Heroes (1993). In reviews from the time and in retrospect, Dynamite Headdy is cited for being one of the best games on the Genesis. An 8-bit port was released for Game Gear, which itself served as the basis for a Master System port released exclusively in Brazil.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T01:57:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/990/99032ae5c015e807b143c6d5f05b9370.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.93, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 9, "beaten": 13, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 8}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 15, "suggestions_count": 345, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 15, "platforms": ["SEGA Master System", "Wii", "Game Gear", "PC", "Genesis"], "developers": ["Treasure"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": null}
