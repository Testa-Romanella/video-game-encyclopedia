{"id": 497500, "slug": "the-preta", "name": "The Preta", "name_original": "The Preta", "description": "<p>Controlled, rigid, unnerving, and hungry. The Preta is driven to be around others even if their actions may sometimes be repulsive. Their domineering side allows them to literally eat away at control others may levy at their companions.</p>\n<p>This Skin is a powerful one, metaphorically speaking. It touches on control issues which can easily be directed to eating disorders. Make sure you have a good idea of the safety tools in play and bring this up with other players and/or the MC before playing. The Preta, like the Chosen, Princess, Hunted, and other Skins can really color how the game will be played.</p>\n<p>If you have ever wanted to leverage control over others in a way that makes you indispensable then\u00a0the Preta is for you. If you have ever wanted more out of being tempted or resisting the best efforts of others then the Preta is for you. Wrap yourself up in failed karma to find your way forward.</p>\n<p>The Preta brings catharsis to Monsterhearts 2 for trusting groups.</p>\n<p>Content Warning: Allusions to eating disorders</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T06:04:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/791/79195becb5d1027a8f7de8ad14fb4080.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ferretheim Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
