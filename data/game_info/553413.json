The mafia took everything that's dearest to you - your beloved EGG. Be careful - taking damage means you lose one of your controls! You will need to catch these pesky buttons once they land in the level. The recoil of your minigun will help you move when you can't anymore or reach otherwise unreachable areas. Supported inputs: gamepad (XB/PS), keyboard. Gamepad controls: D-PAD to move and aim, SQUARE/X to shoot, X/A to jump (hold to jump higher). Keyboard controls: WASD to move and F to shoot.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T05:21:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b7/4b782563093e9d28479948dc9a9c33e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MatteoV"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
