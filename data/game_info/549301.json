I've spend around 4 hours on this game and it's my first game jam so don't judge to hard :)</p>\n<p>Everytime you move, a clone spawns at you location, which if you touch you'll die. Furthermore there's a timer wich if it hits 0, you'll die. Have fun!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game fits into the theme \"Less is more\" by existing out of just 1 single square but having many different functions. Also the fact that you duplicate everytime you move creates more with less.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T09:14:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe0/fe03fadf03c09a4e1705228e9348fda9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ferrefire3344"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
