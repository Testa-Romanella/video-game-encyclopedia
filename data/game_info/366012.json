The idea was\u00a0to make a pinball game with a transforming board.  You hit targets to gain money, to buy upgrades (including access to a lab), where you gain science to get access to asteroid mining, to eventually build all the stages of a colony ship to escape earth.    Every time you lose a ball, earth gets closer, and you're trying to get build the colony ship before the moon hits the earth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sadly, that didn't make it into the Jam version, as the pinball systems took me juuuuust a bit too long to devise.\u00a0 One more night... just one more... and I'd be able to bring it all together!</p>\n\n<p><strong>The entire board is not visible at the start of the game!\u00a0 (Hint:\u00a0 You might need to go to the lab bottle a few times before unlocking the next segment, you need 1000 science to unlock the meteor launch!\u00a0 This should be about 5 trips to the bottle.)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Also, you need to use the nudge controls in the asteroid.\u00a0 The original idea was for it to be a low gravity area without flippers and nudges were the only controls.\u00a0 As the least finished portion of the game, the functionality never made it, but the controls scheme, unfortunately, did.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>Left/Right <strong>SHIFT</strong> - Flippers<br/></p>\n<p>Arrow Keys - Nudge</p>\n<p>Spacebar - NudgeUp</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Assets used:</p>\n<p>Bolt\u00a0 (of course)</p>\n<p>Peek<br/></p>\n<p>ProCamera2D</p>\n<p>Moon image is from NASA.</p>\n\n<p>Everything else is hand created!\u00a0 I'd also like to thank my daughter for playtesting, and finding all the creative ways to get the ball to escape the level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-16T09:34:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/adb/adb8428912d244ad218ec02e8931354d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Reality.Stop()"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
