NOT made using RPG Maker. Also, NOT made sticking to the initial game jam intent as even we grew attached to the characters and decided to write more stuff.<br/></p>\n<p>You have one week to repay your loan of 700 shiny gold coins. As your tavern just opened, you need your lousy lot of heroes to succeed on quests so they attract customers to your place. Apart from the first quest every day, quest and events happen randomly.<br/></p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS: </strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Move \u2013 Arrow keys</strong></li><li><strong>\r\nAction \u2013 C</strong></li><li><strong>Run \u2013 V </strong></li><li><strong>Back/Open Log \u2013 X</strong></li><li><strong>\r\nQuit \u2013 Escape</strong></li></ul>\n<p>We would like to thank all our friends who played the game and gave us feedback to help us making it better.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T04:28:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1de/1decfd2d39dbbaf40a0b215fcd468b9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 188, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Goneril"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
