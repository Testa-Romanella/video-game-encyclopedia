With technically infinite (or however many floats are between 0 and 100) caves through random generation, you get to experience all the coding without\u00a0<strong>any</strong> of the game design or fun testing!</p>\n<p>So if cave generation is nice, you'd probably have more fun just running down as far as you can again and again ten times to reach the \"end screen.\" Of course, if you like playing MMO's, you can mine and get money to upgrade your mining speed and mining power! And thanks to it being scuffed, \u00a0there's nothing beneath the surface to find. No really.<br/></p>\n<p>But remember to (not) enjoy....<br/></p>\n<p>Beneath the Crystals, the Scuffed Edition.</p><p>Quick note: the windows build much more more stable<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T20:36:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/204/204270cd7d392c376ffcfe62c8811a83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Elioc997472"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
