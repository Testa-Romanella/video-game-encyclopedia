Middle wheel for zoom. Full screen recommended.<br/></p><p>Try to upgrade your farms while keeping the balance, since higher the production, more you attract the demons.<br/></p><p>Collect resources to fulfill the endless desire for party and booze of the demons. The game is casual and relaxing, would have required some more balancing and bug fixes but unfortunately really ran out of time.</p><p>It was mostly a solo project with like 90% of everything done during the jam. Music was created and recorded by my brother. Hope you enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f44/f4406288fdb002b49e991aef0a7f9d5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sfey"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
