If you count time these toys are 5D.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt turns out that the rules of how objects bounce, slide and roll around can be generalized to any number of dimensions, and this unique toy lets you experience what that would look like.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures:<br/>\r\n\u2022 Over 100 beautiful interactive scenes to play with, with more to be added in updates.<br/>\r\n\u2022 Groundbreaking 4D+Time Physics Engine that uses new mathematics created for this project.<br/>\r\n\u2022 Bonus:  2D/3D \"Flatland\" Interactive Explanation teaches by analogy about a fourth spatial dimension.<br/>\r\n\u2022 Both VR and regular (Mouse and keyboard) support.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSome things to do:<br/>\r\n\u2022 Manage to fit the hypercube into the hyperhole!<br/>\r\n\u2022 Use the 4D shapes as fancy, perfectly symmetric, fair dice that have 5, 8, 16, 24, or even 120 and 600 sides!<br/>\r\n\u2022 Make a stack of 4D hypercubes and smash it!<br/>\r\n\u2022 Set up an interesting path for a few 4D dominoes!<br/>\r\n\u2022 Unbind Rings using the fourth dimension!<br/>\r\n\u2022 Make levers that throw hypercubes into the fourth dimension!<br/>\r\n\u2022 \"Squeeze\" out objects into the fourth dimension!<br/>\r\n\u2022 Play in a 4D ball pit!<br/>\r\n\u2022 See Tesseracts (i.e. 4D hypercubes) slide down slopes!<br/>\r\n\u2022 etc...!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-02T02:31:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07f/07f38cc2f9e7e658086ce0a3acb5b1ae.jpg", "website": "http://4dtoys.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mtb design works"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["mtb design works"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
