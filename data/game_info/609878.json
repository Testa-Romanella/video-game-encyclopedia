I\u00a0am a\u00a0 full time video editor and building this game was actually very similar to video editing, so this was a very fun experience for me. Please play for free, the creation of this game is not intended for profit, but for fun, and\u00a0is\u00a0built with default in-game and unclearable assets.<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong><br/>TILESETS<br/>PandaMaru<br/>Celianna<br/>Ayene<br/>Candacis<br/>Kokoro Reflections</p>\n<p>PLUGINS<br/>Yanfly<br/>Khaz<br/>Galv<br/>LevelNoMatter<br/>Terrax Lighting</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T10:07:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22f/22f79b8748a66e8a089877cc7c145e2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["angosllo"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
