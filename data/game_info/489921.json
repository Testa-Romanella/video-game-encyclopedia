THE WORLD IS WATCHING IN TERROR AS A NOVEL COMPUTER VIRUS,\r\nKNOWN ONLY AS 'COVID', HAS MADE THE JUMP FROM COMPUTERS TO HUMAN BEINGS.\r\nTHE VIRUS HAS SPREAD RAPIDLY ACROSS THE 'WORLD WIDE WEB', INFECTING\r\nCOUNTLESS INNOCENT VICTIMS THROUGH THEIR TERMINALS.\r\n</p>\n<p>IN A COMBINED GLOBAL EFFORT TO DEFEAT THE VIRUS, THE GREATEST MINDS OF A GENERATION<br/>HAVE ASSEMBLED; DOCTORS, ENGINEERS, WEB DEVELOPERS. BY THEIR POWERS COMBINED,<br/>THEY HAVE GIVEN US OUR LAST, BEST HOPE: THE NETWORK-ENABLED INTELLI-CELL PADDLE,<br/>CAPABLE OF TREATING PATIENTS OVER THE INTERNET!</p>\n<p>YOUR MISSION: YOU WILL ASSUME DIRECT CONTROL OF AN INTELLI-CELL PADDLE WHICH WILL<br/>BE \"UPLOADED\" INTO A PATIENT. FROM THERE, YOU WILL DEFEAT VIRUSES, EVADE THE\u00a0<br/>PATIENT'S IMMUNE CELLS, AND OUTLAST ANY ROGUE AGENTS THAT STAND IN YOUR WAY. REMEMBER THAT NO OTHER CELLS CAN\u00a0<br/>BE TRUSTED IN THIS ERA OF NETWORK-ENABLED PANDEMICS. BE<br/>THE LAST CELL STANDING TO SAVE THE PATIENT!</p>\n\n\n<p>Covid '99 is a multiplayer infect-em'-up battle royale where you must outlast your opponents, survive viral infections and be the last cell standing!<br/><br/>How to play:<br/></p>\n<p>Move your paddle with the mouse cursor (ideal), A/D keys, or swipe on mobile</p>\n<p>You can fire cells by clicking, tapping, or pressing SHIFT.<br/></p>\n<p>When your BLAST! meter is full, blast away with spacebar or tapping the icon!</p>\n<p>To survive, keep your temperature under 104 degrees! Viruses\u00a0(red) and T-cells\u00a0(white) will damage you and raise your core temperature!</p>\n<p>If you get hit by viruses you will become INFECTED! Infections will raise your temperature over time, but become easier to heal the hotter you get.</p>\n<p>Watch out for mega-cell stage hazards! They take damage from impact, and will eventually burst! Viral damage will cause them to spawn more viruses, but T cell damage will cause them to pulse a healing busrt!</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for playing and I greatly appreciate any feedback, complaints and bug reports!</p>\n<p>I beefed up the servers for the weekend and any donationswill directly go towards that!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T04:56:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a72/a72db6cbc4780c3523f45ff69a9b4a6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["thecovidev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
