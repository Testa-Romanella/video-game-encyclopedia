Division", "description": "<p>Greetings!</p>\n<p>The slimes are under the threat of extinction as a huge meteor storm brews, signalling their homeworlds destruction.</p>\n<p>You\u2019re their only hope.</p>\n<p>You\u2019re in charge of the Super Long-range Interception Meteor Elimination Systems Division, or S.L.I.M.E.S. Division. In this game, you will take control of a missile launcher, and with the support of a few upgrades and additional buildings, you will get the slimes through the storm.</p>\n<p>This is my first game jam entry\u00a0ever, after years of intending to enter. I\u2019ve spent 3 sleepless nights making this game, streaming most of it on Twitch.tv. The game balance is likely questionable, it starts slow but very quickly gets crazy. It\u2019s something I\u2019d love to work more on. I really do hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T05:34:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03e/03e42a7eb769bb6ce0ed88c34291bab9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Yoshify"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
