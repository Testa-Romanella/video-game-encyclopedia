Pop songs are often divided into a structure like - intro, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus, outro. In this game, you play through a short narrative that follows this structure, repeating the verse and chorus of the gameplay, with a separate intro, outro, and bridge.</p>\n<p>It's an experiment, and certainly doesn't line up perfectly, but was fun to try out and think about a different kind of narrative structure for a game!</p>\n<p>The music doesn't fit too well, but it something I wrote a few weeks ago while learning how to make digital music, so is also in a fairly rough state and was useful for testing :)<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T03:53:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/040/040aa46824cc24c0a489f720996697b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Claire Morwood"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
