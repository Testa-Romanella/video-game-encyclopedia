{"id": 534373, "slug": "spiritsurge-proof-of-concept", "name": "SpiritSurge (Proof of Concept)", "name_original": "SpiritSurge (Proof of Concept)", "description": "<p>-Please remember that this is a proof-of-concept, and not everything in the game is set in stone-</p>\n<p><strong><em>General\u00a0 Description:</em></strong></p>\n<p>SpiritSurge is a RPG Maker VX Ace game mainly inspired by games such as LISA, Chrono Trigger, and PMD.<br/>Players play as Nathaniel Andrews in a top-down view of Conterra, engaging in combat when needed.<br/>Combat is focused around enabling and disabling skill/power trees to buff yourself, and take edge off of your enemies.<br/>Not to add, but every skill has at least a 1 turn cooldown period after their use, making it so players cannot spam the same skill over and over.<br/>The combat is definitely a step above the \"Kid's first RPG Maker Game\", and I'm hopeful that it at least provides enjoyment to you.</p>\n<p>There's also a decent amount of dialog, and some optional side content.<br/>So be sure to explore and talk to npcs, because you'll often find extra items or information to help you on your adventure.</p>\n<p>The demo can take around 1-2 hours, and maybe 3-4 if you read all the dialog and do all the optional content.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Story:</em></strong><br/>It's overall hard to explain the plot without spoiling a good chunk of the characters and other plot elements, but I have a simple summary of the plot as it is:<br/>There's an ancient evil being revived, and Nathaniel needs to stop it.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Technicalities:</em></strong><br/>This game was built with a Fullscreen in mind, so there's no black border that's common with most other RPG maker games; making it so you can play in definitive Fullscreen with the simple press of the F5 key.</p>\n<p>Also be aware that the music in the game is all placeholders at the moment, minus a few ambient tracks. They will eventually get replaced sooner or later.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Quick: Q &amp; A:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Q: Mac compatibility?</p>\n<p>A: Sadly no official Mac compatibility yet; though you can try using Wineskin to play.</p>\n<p>Q: I found a bug/typo/error!</p>\n<p>A: It's probably best to bring that to the development discord, it's best place to bring criticism and other important information directly relating to the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-There's more Q &amp; A on the game's development discord, so please check that out if you're interested.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Social Media Outlets:</em></strong><br/>Definitely consider following/joining one of these if you're interested with my work.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My twitter is just a good place to see quick, no-nonsense updates about the project,</p>\n<p>and the discord is more for in-depth discussion and more focused on development.</p>\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/crustsato</p>\n<p>Discord Server:\u00a0\u00a0https://discord.gg/7YXhFg2S4M</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T03:24:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/645/645de21ae481da7295774f30357cc4af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crustsato"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
