You must dodge the spirits' attacks and survive for as long as possible. Use WASD to move, space to switch between day and night. The two-faced spirits will only move and attack in their active time, otherwise they will freeze. You can use the frozen spirits as a shield against the active spirits and kill the frozen spirits. Surviving gives you point. Killing spirits gives you bonus points. Staying in bound and close to the tower will increase your points faster.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T04:33:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9e/f9ea5ee684360ff9619909944152cfa9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gabriel Chan"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
