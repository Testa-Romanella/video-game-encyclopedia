{"id": 748713, "slug": "paladins-oath", "name": "Paladin's Oath", "name_original": "Paladin's Oath", "description": "You are a <strong>Paladin that took an Oath</strong> to liberate the land and its Cities from enemies coming from another plane of existence.<br/><br/>The core mechanics are based on <strong>board game</strong> systems like <strong>Mage Knight</strong> and <strong>Gloomhaven</strong> with music reminiscing of Warcraft 2. <br/><br/>It combines elements of RPG and light deck-building where Cards / Mana / Recruitable Followers and always-on Blessings must be <strong>synergized</strong> to Move, Interact and Battle with <strong>unlimited undo mechanics</strong> during battles to find the best possible outcome.<br/><br/>This game is a <strong>labor of love</strong> made by and for people that enjoy complex and thinky board games, digital or physical card games and deck builders, puzzles, strategy games and chess.<br/><br/>The randomness is limited and somewhat mitigated making it ideal for players that like to plan ahead.<br/><br/><strong>Absolutely no micro-transactions, live service, virtual currencies, always online or any of that, ever. You just buy the game and enjoy high complexity challenging fun.</strong><br/><br/><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li> <strong>Card-based everything</strong>: movement, interaction, battles. Akin to a resource management game with puzzle mechanics.<br/></li><li> <strong>Slow paced</strong>: take your time, plan your turn, manage your cards and resources wisely.<br/></li><li> Heavy focus on <strong>Strategy</strong>: maximize your current hand and synergize all your resources to make the seemingly impossible, possible.<br/></li><li> Deep, <strong>intricate gameplay</strong> with sessions typically lasting 3 to 5 hours depending on the scenario.<br/></li><li> Turn-based battles with unlimited <strong>undo/redo</strong> possibilities to allow you to explore and find the best outcome - should you take wounds and clog your hands for the next 3 turns or should you use all those cards and come out unscathed but unable to move on the next turn.<br/></li><li> An <strong>ever-changing</strong> experience with randomized maps, decks and varied character combinations let you experience a different kind of puzzle each time you play.<br/></li><li> <strong>Configurable scenarios</strong>, characters and decks allow you to fine-tune the experience to the level of complexity and commitment that suits you best.<br/></li><li> Awesome <strong>power curve</strong>: you start powerful and grow even more powerful, if you can synergize your cards thoughtfully that is.<br/></li><li> <strong>Challenge-based</strong> tutorials to introduce you organically to major game mechanics.</li></ul><br/><h3>Are You Up For The Challenge?</h3><br/>Similar to the thinky board game systems Paladin's Oath is inspired by, you are expected to rack your brain when playing this game if you want to succeed; although the experience is <strong>not stressful</strong> with no real-time pressure and unlimited undo/redo during battles (the most complex part of this game) allowing you to change your card configuration for better outcome as much as you want.<h3>Extensibility</h3><br/>The game already ships with multiple scenarios each offering a unique type of challenge. The suite of Characters + Oath combinations also enables you to fine-tune the experience and provides varied playstyles: move more, recruit more, ability to use stronger cards more often, etc.<br/><br/>Paladin's Oath was designed to be extensible so I'm hoping to add more scenarios, maps and content and eventually support modding or user-generated content depending on how much traction the game gets.<br/><br/>If you are really into the game and want to contribute and have some basic scripting experience don't hesitate to reach out.<h3>Previous Games</h3>If you enjoy this kind of custom board game digital \"adaptation\", you should try my previous game <strong>Mighty Dungeons</strong> which was my own take on the classic <strong>HeroQuest</strong> board game:<br/><br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/349550/Mighty_Dungeons/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T04:35:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6c/b6c77aa50fd0e1527d0891c2b080410b.jpg", "website": "https://games.firebiscuit.com/paladins-oath", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 50, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 328, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Fire Biscuit Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Fire Biscuit Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
