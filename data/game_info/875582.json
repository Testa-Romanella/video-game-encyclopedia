{"id": 875582, "slug": "demon-route", "name": "Demon Route", "name_original": "Demon Route", "description": "Your village has been overrun by demons, get rid of them\r\n\n<p><strong>Known issues:<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. </strong><strong>there is a bug where the contact point for killing enemies is to the right of the center of the screen or the red reticle. <br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>2. There is an even worse bug where the contact point for collecting valuables is behind you so... if you want to collect valuables you have to do it backwards</strong></p>\n<p><strong>3. There is another bug where if you crouch you will have to stay crouched if you want to jump or move fast </strong></p>\n<p><strong>4. The file size is kind of huge because I forgot to remove unused massive light maps, and I didn't even compress them</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>I'll fix all this stuff and more after the jam</em></strong><br/></p>\n\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>This is a first person stealth game<br/></p>\n<p>The goal is to kill as many enemies as possible without as few detections as possible while collecting valuables hidden around the map.</p>\n<p>The game is very unfinished and I had no time to playtest so it's  either extremely easy or extremely difficult. Either way, I didn't have  time to add a win condition, so the only way to see your score is to die  :)\r\n</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>WASD to move</li><li>Left Click to Attack</li><li>Hold Right click to stick to a wall with grappling hook</li><li>Space to jump.double jump</li><li>Jump onto a ledge to vault onto it</li><li>Shift to sprint</li><li>C to crouch</li><li>F to collect valuables\u00a0</li></ul>\n\r\nVisibility Mechanic\r\n<p>The eyeball on the bottom right of the screen shows how visible you are based on the lighting. Unfortunately the lighting is broken so the eye doesn't open and close where you'd expect it to. Also I didn't have time to balance the speed at which enemies detect you so to play it safe, just try to stay out of the enemies line of sight whenever possible<br/></p>\r\nDevelopment Notes\r\n<p>My main idea for this game was to make a mashup of Metal Gear Solid, Thief the Dark Project, and Tenchu Stealth Assassins (which all released in 1998).</p>\n<p>The core mechanics were the light sensor from Thief, and a Metal Gear Solid alert system. I was gonna make a character controller similar to Tenchu, but I'd never made an FPS game so I wanted to give that a shot. From Tenchu I took the ninja theme and the grappling hook which eventually just turned into a claw for climbing.</p>\r\nLight Sensor\r\n<p>I wanted to use fully baked lighting so I decided to use light probes for the light sensor, and it worked out pretty great! Until I realized I would have to manually place light probes all over the level... <br/></p>\n<p>I'd say about 60% of development time was spent fighting with Unity's lighting system and light probes to get the light sensor working. I was using the HPSX render pipeline which made it difficult to predict how light would look after baking. I weighed a lot of options, considered scrapping the sensor altogether, and even considered switching to Godot, but eventually I forced myself to move on and focus on the rest of the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The light sensor in game works, but the positioning of the light probes makes it not react properly to light in most places.</p>\r\nAI\r\n<p>I wanted to have 3 enemy types: a beast, an archer, and a swordsman. I only managed to get the archer working properly. The beast is in the game in the form of a dopey looking demon bear, but I didn't have time to have it attack the player so all it does is aggressively try to get a better look at you.</p>\n<p>The archers do work , but due to the light sensor problems and the lack of time to play test, it feels like they just chase you the moment you get in their FOV. It's a bit more nuanced than that, however. They have an alertness meter which should rise gradually based on distance, occlusion percentage, and lighting. After a certain point they are alerted and try to investigate by moving closer to the last spotted position. If the alertness meter maxes out, they sound a silent alarm and alert the nearby enemies who chase you down.</p>\n<p>If you break line of sight for more than a few seconds, they enter a search phase where they move to random positions in a radius around the player's last known position. After a few seconds an all clear is called and they return to their regular patrols.\u00a0</p>\n<br/>Credits\r\n<p>Literally everything except for sounds - @Skleembof</p>\n<p>Sound effects - freesound.org</p>\n<p>Chase music - https://soundcloud.com/alexlisi/speed-chase</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T13:39:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aac/aac9e79a128f8fa23c9d74bbf20fe7ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Skleembof"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
