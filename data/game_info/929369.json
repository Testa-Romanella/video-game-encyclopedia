{"id": 929369, "slug": "dungeon-of-possession", "name": "Dungeon of Possession", "name_original": "Dungeon of Possession", "description": "<p><em><strong>NOTE:</strong>\u00a0Please read mechanic explanation to avoid confusion.</em></p><p><em>Post your high scores as a picture in the comment of this page, and I will regularly manually update the top high scores for the three difficulties and feature them on this page.</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>LORE:</em></strong> A lot of dungeons are popping up mystically around the world. The wizard society steps up to the challenge and vows to conquer the all. They send battle wizards to each dungeon, however no matter how many they send in, be it one at a time or all at once, only one wizard survives. Those survivors all share the same story - everyone else died, except one, who wielded their magic against the survivors, as if he/she was possessed.</p>\n<p>Control wizards to conquer the dungeons, while minimizing the casualties as much as possible. Challenge different difficulties, clear them as fast as possible and your score will be featured on this very page!</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p><strong><em>CONTROLS:</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>WASD / Movement arrow keys to moving around.</p>\n<p>Use mouse to aim.</p>\n<p>Left Click to shoot.</p>\n<p>ESC to pause.</p>\n<p>SPACE to either proceed to the next room, or spawn enemies to challenge.</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p><strong><em>MECHANIC EXPLANATION:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Top right\u00a0is your sanity bar.\u00a0It will drain over time.</p>\n<p>Top left is your health bar. Taking a hit reduces some health.</p>\n<p>When either bar is depleted, you will faint. The dungeon room will take control of that wizard, inheriting all the upgrades you have collected for that wizard. You'll control a new and different wizard with base stats.</p>\n<p>When either bar is depleted while battling in the room where the possession took place, you will be destroyed - because the room could only possess once.</p>\n<p>A dungeon consists of multiple rooms, therefore plan your sacrifices and strategies to minimize casualties.</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p><strong><em>LIST OF POWERUPS:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Red: damage up.<br/></p>\n<p>Purple: increases fireballs summoned by 1.</p>\n<p>Cyan: increases fireballs' speed.</p>\n<p>Yellow: increases fire rate.</p>\n<p>Green: restores some hp.</p>\n<p>Grey: increases movement speed.</p>\n<p>BIG ORB: Spawns from a dying wizard.
