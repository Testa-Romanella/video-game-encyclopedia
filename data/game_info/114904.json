In this game, your goal is to escape the dungeon as quickly as possible, both on foot and in cars that you find throughout the map.\r\n</p>\n<p>To help you do this, you\u2019re given a live-time minimap, which shows your location (flashing red), the cars\u2019 locations (cyan) and the exit location (flashing green).</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD or Arrow keys controls your movement for both the player and the car. However the player and the car handle differently - you have to steer the car.</p>\n<p>Space bar pulls you in and out of a nearby car.</p>\n<p>Tab toggles the minimap on and off.<br/></p>\n<p>Dungeon Drift generates levels automatically each time you play, so no two times are the same. <br/>Sometimes backtracking to get a car might be a good idea, other times going on foot may be faster. <br/>Once you complete a level, the game will display your total time, which constitutes your final score.<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>svntax - Programming, Art<br/>GenTel - Programming, Design<br/>LockeDoor - Music, SFX</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f20/f20e6cedebab17845937075082134c12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["svntax"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
