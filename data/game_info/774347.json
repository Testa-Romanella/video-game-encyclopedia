The game aims to pull on the heartstrings of 80s and 90s nostalgia with our weapons, throwables, and perk cards. (Currently throwables and perk cards are not hooked up in the game, as well as the HUD.)</p><p>This is just a place for our community to easily download our test builds and give feedback.\u00a0</p><p>Though we have a discussion board enabled on this page, please join our Discord server and follow the project and give feedback on there.
