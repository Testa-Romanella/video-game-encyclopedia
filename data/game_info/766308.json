Use `h` or `help` to pull up a list of possible commands. Some standard system commands are corrupted and may require tinkering to use. Executing a valid command takes a cyberspace second (exempt: `help`, `exit`, `return`, and `audio`).<br/></p>\n\n<p>Even being trapped (okay, maybe it's a vacation now) in cyberspace doesn't get you out of meetings. Especially not when you're a henchalien.</p>\n<p>From the daily standup to the quarterly board meeting (though why you have to attend is <em>absolutely beyond </em>you), the inevitable meeting invites and \"helpful\" links are quickly taking over your little corner of cyberspace.</p>\n<p>Worse: the links and invites clone themselves!</p>\n<p>Soon you will have nowhere to go before you have to accept and link and are dragged into the meeting.</p>\n<p>And then it's game over for you. Back to work. No more chatting with your new cyberghost friends, who incidentally also dislike meetings.</p>\n<p>But until then, fly and be free.
