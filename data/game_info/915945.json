This machine never existed! The goal is to Spell out \"Soda Jerk\" and then hit the drop down targets to get multipliers. The In-Game game play gives more instructions. The sounds system was created by DLG creations with some per-recorded sounds for the pinball mechanics. The pinball has a gate and when open you can not loose the ball on the left out lanes. Good players will have to nudge the ball. It can be set as 3 or 5 ball and can be set as a conservative play for more of a challenge. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T12:38:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f02/f02be2f984d6fc7a657b0b1b3057e685.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DLG Creations"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
