(If they haven't exploded, they are not happy enough)<br/>Avoid other's projectiles.<br/></p>\n<p>BACKSTORY:<br/>Backstory is irrelevant. Your life has no meaning anyways; why should i even tell you?\u00a0Nothing matters anymore, just shoot guys and gals with jokes to make them laugh.<br/>There is definitely not a secret reward in level 6 so don't bother looking for it. Just don't. Its so meaningless.\u00a0<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T07:44:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6aa/6aa618d134ba209c61c6b28898012a4f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["IllegalRazer", "Tamtentononc"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
