{"id": 218164, "slug": "in-cell", "name": "In Cell", "name_original": "In Cell", "description": "IN CELL is a kinetic visual novel (linear, no choices) about the epidemic of sexless, nationless, and friendless men.  Gender dynamics are currently not functional, sustainable, or beneficial to either men or women.  IN CELL is an uncensored conversation between the sexes.  Not that such a conversation will solve anything.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are no specific characters, just mostly nameless men, and women.  It is better to think of men and women as the characters rather than specific people.  There are themes of racism, violence, sex, porn, and pretty much anything you could think of that may bother you.  There's a healthy dose of memes too as the subject matter necessitates it.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou'll enjoy the hot new dating app \"Let's **** Chad!\"  You'll consider violence a reasonable solution.  You'll hate, you'll love, and you'll be numb.  IN CELL while primarily written by me does include direct quotes of men from youtube, 4chan, reddit, and other corners of the internet.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIN CELL does not come from a place of wanting to solve the problem.  It is merely a talking point in the form of a visual novel.  I wanted to write about the modern male experience.  I was inspired by innumerable sources that I won't name as they may not want to be associated with this work.  I've read books, watched hundreds of thousands of hours of youtube videos, browsed forums, and have gone outside.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI, like many other men, do not like this world.  IN CELL is about our experience as men.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T03:18:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcc/fccbe64e14b44351ebc1f58cf8887089.jpg", "website": "http://studiofant.wix.com/fant#!blank-1/wvxun", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Cleril Calamity Studios", "MARIYA ZOLOTOVA"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Cleril Calamity Studios", "MARIYA ZOLOTOVA"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
