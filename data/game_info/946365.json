Travel through secret facilities in a short amount of time, gathering knowledge and power-ups to be able to reach your destination. If you end up failing, do not worry, prototype will traverse back in time to give another chance for the success.</p>\n<p>Loop Runner is a 3D platformer/shooter\u00a0 with a very high difficulty curve so it can be considered as a rage game as well.<em> [No, actually, trust me, few of the testers already voiced their fury over the high difficulty and it cannot make me even happier].\u00a0</em>The addition of in-game cinematics, voice acting for better story-telling and more full-fledged levels are currently under development.</p>\n<p><strong>Warning:\u00a0</strong>This game is currently in a very early development stage as a test demo to receive feedback and improve the game with the help of it. Only one level is available with three available difficulty levels. The current level will be revamped and replaced with an actual tutorial and additional features\u00a0later this week. It would be highly appreciated to voice your opinion about current build and possible changes to make the game more enjoyable.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T16:04:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae4/ae49446e8dbc27a96746ed8c5f121614.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MaxPro48"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
