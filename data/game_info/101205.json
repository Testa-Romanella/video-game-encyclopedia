This is your reward? Your first thought may be fuck this, but who wouldn't take the chance to see a different path? You won't let it devour your people this time will you? Maybe instead of shredding through the nefarious hordes you can close the gate this time.\"</p>\n<p>The main focus of Ultra-Violence is giving players an adrenaline inducing cooperative action adventure they can experience with their friends.</p>\n<p>This game is not a part of the DOOM franchise, but it is inspired by it. It does not feature remakes of DOOM levels or DOOM content. It is also inspired by Starship Troopers, Quake, and Left 4 Dead.</p>\n<p>paypal.me/NathanSegally<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/468/468bde7cb8496f0f51ed4dcc6ba985ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 533, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Mysterious Journey"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
