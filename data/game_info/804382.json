Killing bugs is messy and they will leave their blood behind, press the enter key to swap to a cloth to clean it up for some extra points.</p>\n<p>To pause press the esc key.</p>\n<p>If too many bugs go in to the fire it's game over. Ear money based on how many bugs you will which can be used to upgrade your score multipliers, money multiplier and how many lives your fire has.</p>\n<p>Made for the ZenoJam #5 with the theme Light attracts bugs.</p>Change Log:\u00a0<p>30/05/2022</p><p>Fixed some bugs</p><p>Added a reset position.
