Now I'm working on Kiotbo, which I can count as the renewed version of mini life (and yes, I do it with scratch too because my facilities are not enough) but I put mini life here, because why not! The controls are a bit weird because...uhh I don't know lmao. I did this about 2 years ago. Anyway, if you're going to play, the controls are as follows;\r\nE - interaction\r\nQ - mostly exit something\r\nZ - weigh in\r\nO - getting game save code\r\nL- game save load \r\nD + Q - undress\r\nQ + R - quit room \r\nC - cellphone open/close\r\nJ - I don't remember what this did\r\nthats all i hope you can play!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T07:35:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/574/5741f303bdcae7776574956414a77135.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android"], "developers": ["TahaKRBS"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
