You have to defend this circle by moving your character, the orange circle, to collide with incoming white orbs. You get three lives, and you lose a life whenever an orb hits the centre circle! The game will become more challenging, and the orbs will appear faster and faster, the longer you last. This is a Single Player game, which you can download on Mac OS, Windows, or Linux! Try it out right now in your browser, and comment your HIGH SCORE!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T05:00:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d81/d812d60d763644f28fd6f936b5fd3550.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["DouglasMassey"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
