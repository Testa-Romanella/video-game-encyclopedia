Nevertheless there is no need to understand those Mathematics to play. The game is simple and easy to enjoy alone or with friends. <br/></p>\n<p>There are two real levels for a one player game. A simple level is a level which can be used to get a Brownian motion graph, that level is easy to win but its timing cannot be deterministic.<br/></p>\n<p>How to play:<br/>\u00a0For a one player game:<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Just use the mouse to choose line and the computer will choose the direction<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 For a two players game:<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Player 1 uses the mouse as in the one player game<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Player two uses left and right arrows to switch between the possible\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0two\u00a0 directions, and select one with the space button.<br/>Notice: At each step, the player has 10 seconds to take a decision, otherwise it will cost him a bad choice in the favor of the other player.</p>\n<p>What else, are you able to win?
