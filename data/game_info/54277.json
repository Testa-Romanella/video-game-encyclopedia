{"id": 54277, "slug": "mad-dog-ii-the-lost-gold", "name": "Mad Dog II: The Lost Gold", "name_original": "Mad Dog II: The Lost Gold", "description": "<p>Mad Dog II: The Lost Gold is a live-action laserdisc video game produced by American Laser Games, released for the arcade, Sega CD, 3DO, CD-i and DOS, the first release being in 1992; the quality of the video is the lowest on Sega CD. A sequel to the moderately popular Mad Dog McCree, the game abandoned the rather simple style of the original, introducing elements that can be considered \"Hollywood\", including dynamic shootout scenes and in-game music, as opposed to the original's almost complete lack thereof. Like the first game, the player follows the storyline and is required to quickly shoot certain enemies to proceed on the quest. The game was re-released by Digital Leisure in 2003 on DVD-Video and again in 2009 on the Wii as part of the Mad Dog McCree Gunslinger Pack, a compilation that also includes the first Mad Dog game as well as The Last Bounty Hunter.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2003-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:01:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76f/76f22d123327718cfc41cc9112c04bf3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 9, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 325, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "SEGA CD", "3DO"], "developers": ["Digital Leisure", "American Laser Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Majesco Entertainment", "Digital Leisure", "Philips", "Philips Media", "American Laser Games", "IBM"], "esrb_rating": null}
