I'm not sure why, but I am  looking into it. For now, just don't use it!</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The United Galactic Federation needs new Star ships! Get to work  producing star ships for the federation by clicking on the 3D spaceship  button! Hire astronauts, commission robots, and deploy factories to get  the federation the ships they need! Power-ups (i.e. astronauts, robots,  and factories) cost star ships, the price indicated to the left of  the corresponding icon on the right side of the screen. In the top  center of the screen resides the total number of star ships that you  have produced! On the left side of the screen is your stats display,  here you can retrieve info about how many power-ups you own. The  rotating ship in the center is what you click to build. The more  power-ups you have the faster you can build! If you need to adjust the  game quality, sound, or want to switch to full screen there is a gear  icon in the top right of the screen. Click that gear icon to open up the  options menu.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>#Game Version 0.2 Credits</em></strong></p>\n<p>| CREDITS |</p>\n<p><strong>UI Design:</strong></p>\n<p>Johnny Shumway</p>\n<p><strong>Level Design:</strong></p>\n<p>Johnny Shumway</p>\n<p><strong>2D Art:</strong></p>\n<p>Johnny Shumway - Astronaut Sprite</p>\n<p>Johnny Shumway - Robot Arm Sprite</p>\n<p>Johnny Shumway - Space Factory Sprite</p>\n<p><strong>3D Art:</strong></p>\n<p>Johnny Shumway - Starship Model</p>\n<p><strong>Music:</strong></p>\n<p>yd - My Very Own Dead Ship</p>\n<p>yd - Spacecrusher</p>\n<p>yd - Out There</p>\n<p>brandon75689 - Last Stand in Space</p>\n<p>Sudocolon - Space Ace</p>\n<p><strong>Programming:</strong></p>\n<p>Johnny Shumway</p>\n<p><strong>Fonts:</strong></p>\n<p>\"UNICEPHALON\" - Andrew Young, Disaster Fonts - From (https://www.dafont.com/unicephalon.font?l[]=10&amp;text=STARSHIPS%3A+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+0) licensed under CC-BY-SA 4.0.</p>\n<p>\"Russo One\" -Jovanny Lemonad</p>\n<p>\"Raider Crusader\" - Iconian Fonts</p>\n<p><strong>Ending Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>yd and Sudocolon are all users of (https://opengameart.org/)!
