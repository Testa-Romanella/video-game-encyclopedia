Based on the theme of \"Running Out of Space,\" I decided to riff on the concept of how an anti-virus or other malware protection software operates. What if they are working behind the scenes to destroy the virus throughout the computer? The premise of this game is you are in control of the software, maneuvering through the user's computer to reach the master override before the virus can catch up to you and make your efforts futile. Along the way, you will encounter obstacles in the computer, but the grunts and turret fire of the virus itself. Make a mad dash through the level and gather charge to your special meter which, upon reaching its max, will allow you to you Delta Crawl, an ability that slows down time around the player. Using this can help you get the drop on the enemy and even give yourself a distance from the encroaching virus wall. This was made over the course of a week and I was responsible for the blueprinting, level, design, gameplay elements, and other aspects of the game. I hope you all enjoy and good luck to everyone else who participated!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD - Movement</li><li>Left Shift (While Moving) - Sprint</li><li>Spacebar - Jump</li><li>R - Activate Delta Crawl</li><li>C (Hold) - Switch Between 1st and 3rd Person</li><li>Left Mouse Click - Melee Attack</li><li>Right Mouse Click While (Sprinting) - Slide</li><li>Esc or P - Pause the Game</li></ul>\n<p>Credits to the following for some of the assets used in this project:</p>\n<p>Unreal Marketplace:</p>\n<ul><li>Advanced Locomotion System V by LongmireLocomotion</li><li>Frank Fighting Set 2 by Frank Climax</li><li>CYBERPUNK Music Pack by Sidearm Studios</li></ul>\n<p>Other:</p>\n<ul><li>Slide Animation by Mixamo</li><li>Time Icon by Delapouite - https://game-icons.net/1x1/delapouite/backward-time.html#download</li><li>Heart Plus Icon by Zeromancer - https://game-icons.net/1x1/zeromancer/heart-plus.html#download</li><li>Ethnocentric Font by Typodermic Fonts- https://www.dafont.com/ethnocentric.font</li><li>Keyboard Key Icon by Arthur Shlain, RU - The Noun Project</li><li>Mouse Icon - PikPng.com</li><li>Sci-Fi Sound Effects - Mixkit.co</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T08:42:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f40/f4075e35d14a922ff3e068f6849f60a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JimSny2"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
