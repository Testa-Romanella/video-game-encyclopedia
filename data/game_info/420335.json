In this game, as in my other projects, you will have to choose how you will behave, each action will affect the consequences. Now the game is in English and you, dear player, can enjoy it. Become the head of a gang, create your own, become a slave, or be the one that everyone will be afraid of? Show me what people are really made of... Well, not literally, of course.</p>\n\n<p>The game will explain everything in detail, so I will not waste your time, download and play! I will be actively engaged in updates if you also actively support me on PATREON.\u00a0There you will have the opportunity to influence the characters, improve, add new scenes by voting. From there, you will also learn the latest news. I also have a page on devianart.\u00a0This is the first version and only it will be free.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T03:32:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d60/d60a40d3bbacd5ee6cdacb1a47d8940e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Ubarefeet"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
