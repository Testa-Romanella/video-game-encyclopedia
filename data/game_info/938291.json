{"id": 938291, "slug": "meg-and-the-trapper", "name": "Meg and the Trapper", "name_original": "Meg and the Trapper", "description": "<p>Meg and the Trapper is a <strong>fangame </strong>with a double <strong>tribute</strong>. First to the <strong>arcade </strong>games of the early 90's like Tumblepop (my favorite) or Snow Bros. And, especially, a tribute to <strong>Dead by Daylight</strong> reimagining it as a classic arcade.<br/><br/>The game has <strong>infinite randomly generated levels</strong>. <strong>Repairing four generators</strong> will <strong>open the exit door </strong>and the access to next level. Use the <strong>CTRL key to repair</strong> the generators and the <strong>SPACE bar\u00a0to jump</strong>. <strong>Press F</strong> at any time to <strong>switch fullscreen</strong> on and off.\u00a0Escape from the killer, as you only have <strong>two lives</strong>. And beware of the traps!<br/><br/>I made this game in my spare time and it may have some bugs here and there. If you have any issues, please leave a comment. Hope you like it!<br/><br/><strong>Download installer or .ZIP file\u00a0<br/></strong><br/>If\u00a0 <strong>Windows Smartscreen</strong> prevents to run it, just click on <strong>More Options</strong> and <strong>Run Anyway</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T09:19:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60d/60d0af0f3e2b714be2e4b4bc67a1f00c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 279, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["El Tentacle"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
