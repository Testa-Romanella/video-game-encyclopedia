{"id": 192642, "slug": "cocos-collection", "name": "Cocos Collection", "name_original": "Cocos Collection", "description": "<p>The Cocos Collection is a portfolio piece made up of two puzzle games I made in the Cocos2D C++ Framework. </p>\n<p>One of them is Minesweeper, the classic game in which you have to find a certain amount of mines in a grid, the other being a sliding puzzle game in which you must put back together a scrambled image. </p>\n<p>Both games have 3 levels of difficulty (easy, medium and hard) with the size of the puzzle being different depending on the difficulty. In Minesweeper, the amount of mines per a level, as well as the size of the grid increases as the difficulty gets harder, while in the sliding puzzle game the size of the grid is increased. </p>\n<p>The Puzzle Game also allows you to pick one of three images, which can be changed in the Settings screen.</p>\n<p>This is a portfolio piece, hence why there are no original games, just my take on old classics. Source code is included but not the project file.</p>\n<p>Officially the language support is English, however as long as you only need to understand the concept of the games you are playing, you may be able to play it without understanding written English, as the text is not compulsory to gameplay. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/783/78399ef23edd29228192dc059e7d7c81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JEPDraper"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
