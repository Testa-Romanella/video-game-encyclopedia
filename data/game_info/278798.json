{"id": 278798, "slug": "once-upon-a-doll-story", "name": "Once Upon a Doll Story", "name_original": "Once Upon a Doll Story", "description": "<p><strong>Once Upon a Doll Story </strong>is the tale of a forgotten doll lost in a spooky\u00a0attic filled with dark corridors and glowing eyes. Unsure of who she is or what her purpose is this little doll seeks a way out of this dreadful place and seeks a girl called Emily.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is the first chapter demo of Doll Story and plays approx 7-10 minutes long. No current alternate story routes, however there are some point and click elements which can give dialogue variety to different sections.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Doll Story was created in the Tyranobuilder engine.\u00a0All visuals, photography, and\u00a0art are all original works by me. All other credits are listed within the game.</p>\n<p><strong>~Extra Credits\u00a0</strong><strong>Game Jam Info~</strong></p>\n<p>Created for the Extra Credits Winter Game Jam 2018 with the theme<strong>\u00a0\"present\"</strong>\u00a0 over the course of 4 days. This is actually my first time dipping my toes into making games/visual novels, as I've relatively stayed on the more artsy side of the table and left the coding to other more skillful people. However I'm incredibly grateful to have gotten to participate in this jam, as it turns out, I loved making this little VN!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is only the first chapter of five I had originally planned on making, but only had time for the one within the 4 days of the jam. It's only a little baby of a game right now, so I'm\u00a0hoping to continue this into a full playable version of the whole story by Christmas so fingers crossed! A big thank you to Extra Credits for holding this, giving me the push to finally try to make some games with some of my cute art.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>~Extras~</strong></p>\n<p>Interested in the making of Doll Story? Over the four days I worked on the game I documented the whole process from making the art and visuals to sound design to programing the game. I'll be posting about the process of making it soon in a devlog soon. So keep an eye out ;)</p>\n<p>This is only a short demo of my vision for the whole game of Doll Story yet to be released. If you have any ideas on things to include into the game to improve the experience then feel free to mention them below, I may include them in the next update!\u00a0As the full game is still in development I'm still changing things around, such as adding branching choice variables and such. So any feedback is very helpful!\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed the art and story of Doll Story then please feel free to\u00a0share your thoughts in the comments, and I hope you all have a wonderful time playing!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>~Updates/Fixes~</strong></p>\n<ul><li>12/19/18 - Fixed windows version opening\u00a0issue.</li><li>12/20/18 - Fixed spelling errors, added \"Credits\" button to main menu, fixed\u00a0 minor timing\u00a0tweaks and click-boxes.\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd8/cd86117007c12236ecadd9de0d848e15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["MiFuWorks"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
