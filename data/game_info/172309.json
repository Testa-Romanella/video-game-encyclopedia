You must hurry before he has a chance to do anything to you. This is my first game and I wanted to make something really bizarre and different. This weird little game is what I ended up with. You might want a pencil and a piece of paper to help through certain mazes. This game might not be suited for young children.</p><p>v1.1:</p><ul><li>Fixed an issue that caused parts of the whalicorn to be invisible.</li><li>Made the whalicorn's hair a little less crazy looking.</li><li>Added a pause menu that lets you quit to the main menu and quit from the game entirely.</li><li>Changed the movement to be slightly more responsive and not have that feeling of input delay.</li></ul><p>v1.2:</p><ul><li>Fixed the pause menu.
