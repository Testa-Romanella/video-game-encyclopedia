To <strong>kill many good ideas<strong>, ok... freeze them for a future release.<br/>2. To try <strong>something you have never done before<strong>, no matter what.<br/>3. The best way to turn <strong>doodles into a sprite<strong> is... well... not sure about this one as it was a hot mess!<br/>4. The difference between our <strong>timezones<strong> (@jabba lives in Tokyo)<br/>5. Many <strong>Unity secrets<strong> (we are completely new to it)<br/>6. That Unity holds <strong>MANY more secrets<strong>!<br/>7. Which <strong>video encoder<strong> never to use again! (won't share this :D)<br/>8. How much you can accomplish in a short time <strong>when you are inspired<strong> and your team is thighter than the deadline.</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>\n<strong><strong><strong>\r\n Where we go from here? \r\n<p>As more llamacorns start to populate the planet, we have plans for <strong>more animalcorn madness<strong>!! <br/>There will be piggiecorns, bunnycorns...</strong></strong></p>\n<strong><strong>\n<p><strong>Working together for the first time and in our first Ludum Dare jam was a lot of fun</strong>, <br/>we'd definitely love to repeat this experience and take Spermicorn to the next step!</p>\r\n Hope you have fun playing Spermicorn, \r\n and may you feel a little special too :D \r\n\n</strong></strong>\n<p><strong><strong>Note: we are currently refreshing Linux\u00a0 and Mac releases.
