His goal is to overthrow the current Mimic Monarch and seize the throne!\u00a0To do that, you have to amass a large enough base of followers and prove to them that you can provide a steady source of food, aka humans. You start off with a small house with only a little food and must prove your worth by taking over the largest mansion in the city (mansion to be added later).</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Play:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Disguise mimics by dragging them from the toolbar onto furniture. Once a human is near a disguised mimic, they'll be eaten up. It takes a bit for some mimics to eat a human and if another human sees that happen, they'll panic and run away.\u00a0 Mimics also need some time to digest humans before they're ready to eat again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can scare humans by clicking on furniture.\u00a0Human movement is much more predictable when they're panicked.\u00a0\u00a0Be careful, though, panicked humans might try to make a run for an exit. Don't let too many out or else you lose!</p>\n\n<p>The mimic minions you have at your side are:</p>\n<p>Skitter Mimic - Will run at humans in range to eat them before returning to its original position. Since it's so sneaky, it won't\u00a0scare humans when it moves.<br/></p>\n<p>Sleepy Mimic - Can eat humans in rapid succession but will take a nap if it hasn't gotten food in a while.<br/></p>\n<p>Fungal Mimic - Once it eats a human, it gets all other mimics ready to eat if they're currently digesting or sleeping.<br/><br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<strong>Credits</strong><br/>-----------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Directors</strong>:<br/>Game Director: Kevin Aly<br/>Programming Director: Daniel Fuerlinger<br/>Art Director: Ian Elquiero<br/>Art Assistant Director: Nicolo Allado<br/>Sound Director: Jacob Lee<br/>Assistant Sound Director: Ryan Urgel<br/>Design Director: Merlin Ahrenadel</p>\n<p><strong>Programming Team:<br/></strong>Spruce Rami<br/>Mustafa Fitrat<br/>Saran Ramesh<br/>Jordan Radich<br/>David Naccash<br/>Stephen Happ<br/>Brandon Tran<br/>Cole Szymonik<br/>Austin Mack<br/>Anh Nguyen<br/>Abegail Aquiro<br/>John Delaney<br/>Jason Villanueva</p>\n<p><strong>Art Team:</strong><br/>Alesazem Asuagbor<br/>Ben Giffen<br/>Brandon Dover<br/>Chloe Turnbull<br/>Erica Hoots<br/>Gillian Sanders<br/>Hunter Hill<br/>Jennifer Perez<br/>Marzana Chowdhury<br/>Nina Johnson<br/>Taylor Dinh<br/>Tori Collins<br/>Valentin Sanchez</p>\n<p><strong>Sound Team:<br/></strong>Elijah Anderson<br/>Thinh Dang<br/>Francis \"Xavier\" Pastor<br/>Caroline \"Caro\" Whichard<br/>Stephanie Hostetter</p>\n<p><strong>Design Team:<br/></strong>Alex Akl<br/>Allison Terry<br/>Ethan Hart<br/>Ben Zeitlin<br/>Nuzhat Saleh</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-28T04:36:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c6/5c6b74c34b588f216cbd66e4dd83eb00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GADIG"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
