And Every Toll It gets more ruthless.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Guiding Arrows update every 10 seconds to point you towards both the Eyes and the Ophanim.\u00a0 (golden arrow points to It, blue arrow points to Its eyes which you must find)</p>\n<p>Instructions:\u00a0WASD to move, Shift to Sprint, R to reset, and Esc to quit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Look down to see the arrows. They move with you, and only update when the bell tolls.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Random Maze is exactly what it sounds like. It's an option to play the game with a randomly generated Maze every time. Eyes will be randomised as well.\u00a0 The reason this wasn't the main submission is that it only works around 9/10 times. With the there being a chance to start up boxed in and can't get out. But pressing R just refreshes the maze.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T20:18:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00c/00cf2e388e74d3904d53d5483c8cb493.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GenericParadox"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
