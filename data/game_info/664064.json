You know, chain-reaction. That's <em>clearly</em> what Lana and the Azure team meant right? ;)</p>\n<p>(I'm terribly sorry. I also have\u00a0that condition.)<br/></p>\n<p>Current goal of the game is to land red boxes in the red lane, green boxes in the green lane and blue boxes in.. well, you'll probably guess it. If you land the right box in the right lane, it's good. If you mismatch it and land it in the wrong lane, it's bad. Grey and beige boxes are neutral, they will just disappear; however you can no longer destroy grey boxes by clicking/tapping them. I'm going to get some sleep now and continue in the morning. You can restart the game by pressing R and toggle full screen mode by pressing F.</p><p>\u00a0I'll be updating this page and the devlog quite a few times in the next 26 hours and I'm also starting a Github repo (not with the source code, but the exported HTML5 game) so development progress can be tracked in accordance with the jam rules.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T03:55:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1fe/1fecc7d26630e79ab42f70c351c9f8c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fodi"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
