ANRPG was made in 2 weeks, with a week-ish prior for planning. this is also the first time in a very long time that i've managed to finish a project!</p>\n<p>in ANRPG you take control of a party of adventurers who take on a seemingly simple task for some extra cash. however, just how deep does this task go? i'm sure you can figure that out from the title...</p>\n<p>playtime is 15~30 minutes, but could take longer depending on if you get stuck or decide to grind lol</p>\n<p>also sorry if some of the cursor effects are hard to read, you'll probably know what i mean when you play - i could fix this but it would be extremely tedious and you wouldnt do that to lil ol me, would you?</p>\n\n<ul><li>grinding isnt necessary but might help!! enemies in the forest respawn after leaving the map, though rumor has it that theres something lurking around the warren mansion...</li><li>omelia's \"dance\" skill requires no SP to use, making it easy to heal up after battles without having to head back to town.</li><li>if you get stuck, try talking to everyone! i will say there was a slight design oversight on my part at one point - just remember you can't teleport back to the warren mansion once you teleport away! you'll have to go all the way back through the forest!</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li>character, art, design, game credits to rigby vitulina (thats me!)<br/>twitter // tumblr</li><li>music, sound effects credits to PANICPUMPKIN<br/>website // twitter</li><li>color palette (pear36) credits to PineappleOnPizza on lospec<br/>lospec // twitter</li></ul>\n<p>feel free to post bug reports in the comments here on itch.io - i may or may not get to fixing them, but at least then other people will know about it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T04:52:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18d/18dac5e72733836b6414e48535114105.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vitulina"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
