During the game, the background noise will get louder as you get closer to your current objective, but if you want to play on mute or the sound difference isn't noticeable enough, there is a hot/cold text prompt in the corner of the screen.</p>\n<p>Game 2:\u00a0In Game 2 \"Apple Picker\", you need to move left and right using the mouse in order to catch objects being dropped from the top of the screen. Catching objects increases your score. Try to get as high a score as you can!</p>\n<p>Game 3:\u00a0Game 3 is a top-down shooter game. Surviving waves of enemies will increase your score! This is another high-score-based\u00a0game, each wave is worth 1 point, and every 10 waves will have a boss.</p>\n<p>Game 4:\u00a0Game 4 is a 2D platformer. Our class used Celeste as inspiration for the basic mechanics of this game, so the professor required that we include double jumping and wall clinging in the final submission.\u00a0Additionally, you can air dash by inputting left or right and then pressing the middle mouse button.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T13:37:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86e/86ec32d83d4568430f6001a94f9ae253.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aidan Rosenblatt"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
