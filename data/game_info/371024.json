Depending on how you fare with puzzles, it may take anywhere from a few minutes to an hour. You CAN win, don't let the game fool you.<br/></p>\n<p>Just A Circus was created for the Community Game Jam! The theme of the jam is \"The Game Is A Liar\". We made this in\u00a0one week and was our very first game jam (and third game ever!). All artwork and programming and some sound effects were\u00a0done by me (Sarrah Wilkinson, AKA Ms.RedNebula), with the music and remaining sound effects done by my husband, Robbie.</p>\n<p>Please comment, let me know if you figured the puzzle out and if you have any praise, critiques, or just want to say hello! Thank you very much for playing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T08:03:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/426/426c797bb3a08162f2a7ce123cb99a38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ms.RedNebula"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
