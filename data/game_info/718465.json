The game is a simple Shooter game.<br/><br/>You have a crosshair and you need to shoot coins flying in the map. Each coin gives different effect. There are currently 6 coins.<br/><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\u25a0 Coin - 5 points</p>\n<p>\u25a0 Blue Coin - 2 points</p>\n<p>\u25a0 Yellow Coin- 1 point</p>\n<p>\u25a0 Red Coin - Lose 5 points<br/></p>\n<p>\u25a0 Shield Coin - \u00a0On click - Takes 5 clicks to clear and gives 10 points<br/>Not clicked disappear - lose 5 points</p>\n<p>\u25a0 Target Coin - On click - 0 points and The next 5 objects to appear are coins. Not clicked disappear - lose 10 points<br/></p><p>However because i was lacking assets all the coins look the same :P. You could say it increases the difficulty by a bit.<br/><br/>Upon getting 120 points you win the game, if the timer runs out you lose and the game restarts. You also have 120 seconds to win.<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy playing it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T05:08:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ec/1eceb6cafaa012da0afa0d150c18abde.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MaxxBurn"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
