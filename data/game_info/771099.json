Only a person who is familiar with the language can recognize it and it\u00a0is not easy to ignore what you can hear/understand even if you try to. Also inspired by the cocktail effect both in a physical and <em>web</em> environment, this project\u00a0reflects on how our voices are being stored and shared in the modern cloud as a form and process of communicating\u00a0in the present.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T17:12:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e39/e39732d6613de641557e4f3d72d360d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["scoobymoo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
