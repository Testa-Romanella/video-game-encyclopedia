I did not use them all sadly because putting all of them doesn't give coherent look when aligning them together. So decide to take only a spiky ball and eyes. (so sad... if you are not proficient with C#... )\u00a0\u00a0The subtle colors changing is the mind making choices every micro-moments on what I\u00a0want to do and what my values to stick to, such as meditation you lose your focus then coming back to recalibrate what your life value is for.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In future steps, I\u00a0will\u00a0randomize size changes on spikey balls which I\u00a0failed to create an intense\u00a0feeling, and enable\u00a0shape and color changing by clicking to manifest action of DONE! so you can be free from your ambivalent emotions.\u00a0 I\u00a0guess some amount of clicks will appear on UI to be \"making an effort\", then next some clicks could appear to be reaching to your mindfulness that you are getting to controlling your mind.\u00a0 the final amount of clicks will say you have full control of your mind!\u00a0lol\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T09:13:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db3/db3f2b591566d51e736c8deeee8d833e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["binnalee"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
