Clicking will move your claws. Left clicking moves the left claw and right clicking moves the right. I recommend playing with a mouse if you have one.<br/></p>\n<p>All of the graphics are made from circles squares and triangles that I\u00a0positioned within the Unity editor. This is because the jam's rules were to not create nice looking things.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I spent a lot of my time creating my own inverse kinematics for the arms and legs of the crab, which probably goes against the rules of the jam. I probably should've spent more time working on level design.</p>\n<p>Some known issues right now are that your claws can become detached if you hook them behind walls. Also, there are a few points in the game where the frame rate drops drastically. This is because I'm loading in more of the game. I built this system before decorating the levels, and didn't anticipate using over 4000 squares to decorate the sand. Another issue is that the IK on the last few legs seems to break when you land while moving. I don't know why this happens yet.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing my game (if you do),\u00a0I hope you enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T02:55:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/030/03067e72c3dde1c5ed260a1ed4e78a64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gnomeling"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
