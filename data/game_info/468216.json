{"id": 468216, "slug": "fire-season-entropyspark", "name": "Fire Season (EntropySpark)", "name_original": "Fire Season (EntropySpark)", "description": "<p>This game was made for the GMTK Game Jam 2020 (theme:\u00a0Out of Control).</p><p>You control two firefighting helicopters as the surrounding forest starts to catch fire. Click to move, left-click for the red helicopter and right-click for the white helicopter. The helicopter picks up water when over a body of water (water level indicated in bottom-left corner), and dumps water on fires when near trees that are on fire. Fires start randomly, with the rate increasing as the game continues, and the fires may spread from tree to tree. The game lasts for five minutes (time in bottom-left corner), with points collected for every tree still standing each second, with a higher multiplier as the game continues. Good luck!</p><p>Graphical assets by me, particle effects created by me using Particle Editor</p><p>Sound assets:</p><p>Helicopter -\u00a0deleted_user_3544904\u00a0-\u00a0Attribution 3.0 License</p><p>Fire Burning\u00a0- JaBa -\u00a0Attribution 3.0 License</p><p>Frying Pan Hit\u00a0(Game End sound)\u00a0-\u00a0Mike Koenig -\u00a0Attribution 3.0 License</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T19:13:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b8/0b82b1b9f42bd89bb9bd5445bb8abbfc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["EntropySpark"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
