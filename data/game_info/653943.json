I had to create a simple and fun game, without using external ressources, except for musics and sounds. So here is this game !\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is like a pong, but better. Indeed, each player can control 2 pads and I modified a little bit the collisions to get closer to things we can see in a football match !\u00a0</p>\n<p>To conclude, this game is a fun 2-Player Game that I advise you to try. Enjoy ;) !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T10:01:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/102/102a506d71cece4c0257be5248e12f87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["YogS-974"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
