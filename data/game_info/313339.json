It is turn-based strategy-puzzle game in which you have to collect treasure in order to advance to the next level. The gimmick consists in you not being able to make the same move twice, however you can press SPACE in order to pass the turn. There are also randomly generated explosions that tick down for three turns and then kill you if you are in their blast radius.\u00a0If you get stuck on a level, feel free to press TAB in order to skip it. We strongly suggest you not to do so because some parts of the puzzle may be present in future levels as well.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-29T05:28:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fc/4fc799520f9b9d3a2dbcf6b0a62fe299.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UWW"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
