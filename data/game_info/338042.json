Make hamburgers, cheeseburgers, sodas, slush, salads and fries. Go quick before the customers decide to head out! A game requiring fast actions and fast thinking. But it doesn't stop there, if it did, it would'n fit the occult theme of this gamejam. I'll let you figure out\u00a0by your own what the game has to offer.</p>\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<p>PROGRAMMER / GAME DEVELOPPER</p>\n<p>Enric\u00a0Soldevila (MoSk)</p>\n<p>ART WORK</p>\n<p>Main artist : Zack Nolet (KingJacky777)</p>\n<p>Additionnal help: Matys\u00a0Labbee (OriginSmyth)</p>\n\n<p>Enric Soldevila email: soldevilaenric2003@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Zack Nolet email: nolet.zack@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Matys\u00a0Labbee email: swapeur.yt@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f0/7f0ec2a0230c99ee5ad356735bd1e79c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["M0Sk"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
