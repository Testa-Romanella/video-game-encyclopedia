Originally developed for the Amiga and Atari ST, it was later ported to the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC and MSX. It casts the player as an industrial spy in a science fiction future, assigned to halt an evil Empire's production of fearsome war machines called Terrorpods. To win the game, the player must manage colonies with specialised industries to produce a Terrorpod of their own, while fighting off enemy forces like in a traditional shooting game.</p>\n<p>The appearance of the Terrorpods was conceived from a rejected design by Psygnosis cover artist Roger Dean for the Martian fighters in Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1987-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:01:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/808/80842eab79fa30aa4ac5e3d93523c28d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 362, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Atari ST", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["SCE Studio Liverpool", "Psygnosis"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Psygnosis"], "esrb_rating": null}
