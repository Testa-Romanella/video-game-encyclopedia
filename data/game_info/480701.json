This is my second game ever right\u00a0here! Submitted for the Mini Jam 60. It's not great and I lost a lot of steam working on this project. By the end, I mostly just wanted to see it finished and I'm sure that's reflected in the quality of my game bahaha. I did learn stuff making it though, so mission complete. Still working on figuring out a bunch of stuff, so hopefully next jam will be even better!<br/></p>\n<p>I kinda took a different approach to pausing. Making the character stop and wait in place to recover stamina is still a kind of pausing right? Right!?
