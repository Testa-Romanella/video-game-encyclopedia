Players can equip themselves with prosthetic arms, legs and wheelchairs and train in a number of para-sports including the precision-ball-sport boccia, football 5-a-side, athletics and wheelchair basketball. The Mine can forge new relationships with other avatars by freely roaming around the city and participating in a variety of tournaments.
