Check back often for updates and news!</p>\n<p>The controls are simple...</p>\n<ul><li>A / D - Steer left and right</li><li>W / S - Advance or reduce throttle settings. There are 3 forward settings and 1 reverse setting.</li><li>Left Mouse Button - Fire weapon at aim point.</li></ul>\n<p>We know the game lacks a lot of conveyance and polish, but we would be excited for any early adopters to check it out in this early state.
