{"id": 626105, "slug": "toybus", "name": "ToyBus", "name_original": "ToyBus", "description": "<p>A basic game made for week 206 of the Weekly Game Jam. The theme was Clockwork.</p>\n<br/><br/>Gameplay\r\n<p>You're a bus driver in a toy city where catching the bus is always faster than walking. Since it's a toy, your bus runs on clockwork, so you'll need to wind it up every so often to keep it moving.</p>\n<p>Pick up the waiting customers by stopping the bus next to them and waiting for them to get on, then take them to the other bus stop that matches what they look like.</p>\n<p>Everyone here is pretty impatient, so don't let the bus stops get too busy. It's game over once any bus stop has been left full for too long.</p>\n<br/><br/>Controls\r\n<p>Hold down Shift to apply the brakes.</p>\n<p><strong>While the brakes are applied</strong>, quickly press the Q and E keys to wind up the key on the back of your bus. Once it won't go any further, let go of the brakes to start moving.</p>\n<p>Use the W, A, S and D keys to change the direction of the bus when it reaches a corner. Be careful - your bus can only move forwards!</p>\n<p>People will automatically get off and on (in that order) at bus stops once the bus isn't moving.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T05:44:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/362/362174510e63438bdbd4e9469bbca472.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Teljen"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
