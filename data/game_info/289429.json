But now, they worship you and you kinda like that. Why wouldn't you stick around and make these idiots build you a village? All you need to do is keep the raiders away so the villagers keep thinking you're some kind of hero.</p>\n\n<p>I made this game for an AI project at Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Chicoutimi. The main rule was to implement some kind of advanced AI in a game. I\u00a0chose to do that with independant workers who would organize themselves to achieve the goals you give them (build stuff) while respecting some constraints: they have to take care of their energy and rely on the hero to protect them from the enemies. This AI works with a behavior tree and a finite state machine.</p>\n<p>This is my second \"big\" project with Unity and making games in general.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-01T04:18:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ab/3ab3e5878333663f8b4e1b25b36033bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AurelienGttn"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
