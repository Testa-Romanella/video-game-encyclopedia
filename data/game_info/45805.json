Just be sure to keep a box of tissues handy, because it\u2019s about to be a bumpy ride.<br/><br/>This isn\u2019t a cutesy high school rom-com anymore; it\u2019s an epic tale of political conspiracies, international espionage, an alien menace, quantum causality, bittersweet reunions, genetic modification, and much, much more.

In that time, he\u2019s been through an awful lot \u2014 enlisting in the military, meeting parallel-universe versions of his old friends, and even falling in love. But unbeknownst to Takeru, he and his squadmates were being trained to participate in a top-secret UN contingency plan known as Alternative IV \u2014 a last-ditch effort to take back the Earth via experimental technology. Unfortunately, however, development screeched to a halt when the project\u2019s chief executive, Professor Kouzuki, hit a wall in her research due to technological constraints. With tensions rising, and pressure to shift gears from governments all across the world, the UN delegation opted to scrap the project in favor of its successor: Alternative V. This was humanity\u2019s last resort \u2014 a plan that utilized all of their remaining resources to build a migrant fleet of interstellar craft, allowing a tiny fraction of the population to abandon the Earth in the hopes of finding life anew in another star system. Takeru and his comrades-in-arms were among those left behind, condemned to death by their fellow man.<br/><br/>But it seems the hand of fate has bigger plans for Takeru, because it\u2019s at this point that he wakes up to find himself back in his childhood bedroom once again. Not in his own world, mind you \u2014 but back where he was first spat out into this hellscape three years prior. This was no dream; this was a recurring nightmare. But then it hits him: this is a second chance. If he\u2019s truly been sent back in time, then he\u2019s the only one who knows of the impending doom that awaits this world. Perhaps he can use this knowledge to warn Professor Kouzuki, and together, they can somehow find a way to prevent Alternative V from ever being enacted. And who knows? If he can change history, then maybe \u2014 just maybe \u2014 he\u2019ll find the answers to all of his questions. Why has he gone back in time? Why isn\u2019t Sumika here? And most importantly, what IS Alternative IV?Features:<ul><li><strong>Linear Visual Novel</strong> - Unlike the first two parts, Muv-Luv Alternative is almost designed  as a straightforward interactive premiere movie, complete with voice acting, subtitles, and intense music, perfectly fitting for a finale.<br/></li><li>Over <strong>50-70 hours reading time.</strong><br/></li><li><strong>Available in three languages </strong>- Japanese, English and Simplified Chinese.<br/></li><li>The UI has been reworked, so it's compatible with the newest tablet PCs and touchscreens.<br/></li><li>User save data are stored in Steam cloud so readers can continue their progress anywhere with ease.</li></ul>Muv-Luv Alternative Reviews (Original AppID)https://steamcommunity.com/app/449840/reviews/?p=1&amp;browsefilter=toprated&amp;filterLanguage=all", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T14:34:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/767/7675ae7581d5cf73498f3d68e056bb8f.jpg", "website": "http://www.muvluv.moe", "rating": 4.42, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 13, "owned": 105, "beaten": 13, "toplay": 12, "dropped": 2, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 9, "achievements_count": 36, "ratings_count": 12, "suggestions_count": 525, "game_series_count": 13, "reviews_count": 12, "platforms": ["PS Vita", "PC"], "developers": ["Pqube", "Anchor", "ixtl"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Sekai Project", "Degica"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
