A lost Sphere is trying to escape a dark Place.<br/></p>\n<p>The game was developed during a project in the module \"Game Programming\" at the University of Applied Sciences Flensburg. It is my first \"real\" game in Unity. So expect a few bugs - feel free to report them in the comments and also leave feedback if you want. I learned a lot during the development and hope you have some fun playing it.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>** Actually, there should be a cutscene after the start, showing the Cubes taking over and the Sphere being taken by train from the start screen to a dark place. Maybe I'll add that when the time comes, so the Train and the Game-Start makes more sense :D\u00a0**</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T05:47:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/506/506150e52d8e639376b2694b987a00eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SneakyFriday"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
