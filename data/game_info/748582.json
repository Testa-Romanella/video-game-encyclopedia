The amount of keys in the game is reduced and there is an easy to understand interface. Traverse multiple levels, gaining items and experience as you battle foes. Choose from 1 of 9 characters (of the Wu-Tang Clan) each with unique attributes.</p>\n<p>Story<br />\nWhat seems like an ordinary day is turned upside down when a baby arrives at the doorstep of the Wu-Tang Clan. Naturally, they take the baby in and treat it as their own. Little do they know, the baby has a very powerful necklace and an Evil Wizard sets out to attain it. He sends his Cheese Panda XD to capture the baby, and once they notice the baby is missing, they set off into the sewers to regain the Wu-Tang Baby.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T01:34:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fd/4fd290fb2ab2e3df0a68bc56261519dc.jpg", "website": "https://gzstorm.com/sewer-goblet/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GZ Storm", "Tales of Game's", "Tales of Game's Studios"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Tales of Game's Presents", "GZ Storm", "Tales of Game's Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
