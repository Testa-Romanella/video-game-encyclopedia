Juno Markev has a killer to tail, a debt to pay, and more trouble headed her way. Rebel Galaxy Outlaw takes place in a greasy, blue-collar world of outlaws, truckers, cops and thieves.</p>\n<p>Strap into a variety of spacecraft, settle a score in a filthy space-bar over a game of 8-ball, rock out to over 24 hours of music, and engage in white-knuckle dogfights.</p>\n<p>In the Dodge Sector it\u2019s hard to get by \u2013 and even harder to get even.</p>\n<p>Rebel Galaxy Outlaw is an open-world space combat adventure game, spread across the nearly 40 systems of the Dodge Sector. Play as a mercenary, a trader, a pirate, or whatever mix of the three you feel fits you best. With an engaging storyline and a full conversation system, you can follow the narrative, or ignore it and forge your own path at any time.</p>\n<p>Engage in white-knuckle combat, and use the included Autopursuit function to effortlessly fly like an ace, instead of space-jousting for hours. Save up your credits, buy a new ship, kit it out, and then paint it in a fully-fledged 3d-painting application. Make a fortune exploiting lucrative trade routes. Join guilds, help or hunt those in distress, buy and outfit your own space station. Grab a tip in a local bar and hunt hidden treasure. In your down-time, shoot some 8-ball, play some dice-poker, or aim for the high-score in an arcade game in the local seedy watering hole. Flip through the 7 included radio stations and vast music library for just the right track to fit your current mood.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2019-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-17T08:28:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/274/274d4c452a0bfed04db9e9de1795232b.jpg", "website": "http://rebelgalaxy.com", "rating": 3.44, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 23, "owned": 248, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 45, "dropped": 16, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 133, "ratings_count": 27, "suggestions_count": 466, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 27, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC", "Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Double Damage Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Double Damage Games", "Double Damage Games."], "esrb_rating": null}
