This is a game about remembering them.</p>\n<p>This puzzle visual novel was made in Ren'Py for the\u00a02023 O2A2Q Jam and thus was designed around the jam's rules: 1000 words, 1 sprite, 1 background, 1 background sound, and 1 sound effect.\u00a0It is a\u00a0logic puzzle where you attempt to identify the each student based on the information given. This may be a tough task for some, but I encourage you to give it your best shot.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, a web build cannot be given at this time. Please use the download links below if you would like to play.</p>\n<p>If you are a fellow jam participant, good luck! I can't wait to see what creative ideas you come up with.<br/></p>\n\n<p>This game uses modified assets borrowed from the creative commons.
