I hope it is enjoyable. I\u00a0was able to learn a lot by putting this together. Feedback is absolutely appreciated. I have uploaded a web version, Windows executable, and a Linux executable. You can use either keyboard or a controller. Many of the jumps require dashing. It's E on the keyboard and X on an Xbox gamepad. There is an instruction/controls screen. Gamepad is recommended.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T08:30:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23d/23d4463f54297e07ba0b3069141a51aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["bondreal"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
