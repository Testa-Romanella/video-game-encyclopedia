{"id": 82907, "slug": "chesscards", "name": "ChessCards", "name_original": "ChessCards", "description": "Here is a clever little solitaire card game. It works a bit like a sliding tile puzzle, but the playing card \"pieces\" do not just move in four directions. The cards move like chess pieces, depending on their values. Try to organize the deck in as few moves as you can. You will learn new strategies as you play. You will also find it hard to stop, as the game is surprisingly addictive. This is another simple, yet very devious, little mobile puzzle from The Code Zone.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:49:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7b/c7bdc5b66c27ca45250ed6ab5c9cd681.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "macOS"], "developers": ["The Code Zone"], "genres": ["Card", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["The Code Zone"], "esrb_rating": null}
