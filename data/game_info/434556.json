Unfortunately, the job is a stressful one, and between that and spotty WiFi coverage, you have your work cut out for you. It\u2019s going to take careful planning and some quick thinking to keep these meetings alive.</p>\n<p>Meetings will periodically run in the background. You\u2019ll need to answer participant\u2019s questions when they come up (you\u2019ll see a ??? under their name) in order to keep them engaged. Participants lose engagement more and more quickly as time goes on, so it will take carefully management of your time in order to get as many points as possible.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll have to periodically re-connect your router in order to keep your WiFi connection going. If your connection cuts out, you won\u2019t be able to access your computer to respond to participant\u2019s, which could eventually cause them to leave your meeting.</p>\n<p>All of this causes a lot of stress. If your stress level gets too high, it\u2019ll be harder for you to focus, and you\u2019ll end up moving slower, making it harder to get between your router and your computer. To relieve stress, you can take a quick nap in bed - you\u2019ll lose stress as long as you\u2019re asleep.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll need to manage all of your resources to get the highest score possible. You only receive points for completed meetings.
