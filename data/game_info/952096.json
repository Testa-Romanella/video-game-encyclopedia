Eliminate monsters and collect necessary items.<h3> Powerful Enemies </h3>Even the weakest enemy can cause fatal injury to the player. Identify the weaknesses of each enemy and target them. Even if the player dies, you can resurrect indefinitely without penalty.<h3> Killing Npc, Irrevocable Choice </h3>Kill the NPC to get powerful weapons or rare equipment, or to improve your skills, or just because you're bored.
