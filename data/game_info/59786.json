In this episode, a section of the game is a top-down stealth game.<br/><br/>As stated immediately above, this is a point &amp; click adventure game and thus contains the standard compliment of point &amp; click adventure game features including:<br/><br/><ul><li>Walking around from place to place by pointing and clicking!<br/></li><li>Talking to NPC's by choosing dialog options and receiving witty responses!<br/></li><li>Picking up everything that isn't nailed down and putting it in your inventory!<br/></li><li>Using your inventory items on objects or people in the world in order to solve puzzles!<br/></li><li>Using your inventory items on other inventory items in order to solve puzzles!<br/></li><li>Using your inventory items on absolutely everything you see because you're stuck on this puzzle and can't figure out what to do!<br/></li><li>Literally slapping yourself in the face because that puzzle solution was so obvious and yet it took you 20 minutes to figure it out!</li></ul><br/>Also, as already stated, a portion of the game is a top-down stealth game, and as such contains the following features:<br/><br/><ul><li>Walk around and avoid obstacles, some of which are moving!<br/></li><li>um... yeah... that's pretty much all the features of a top-down stealth game.</li></ul><br/>While a stand-alone game in its own right, this game continues the over-arching story from Unicorn Dungeon:<br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/813250/Unicorn_Dungeon/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-26T10:06:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/580/5802dd71193376a3aa1aa3b8b18e9f07.jpg", "website": "http://www.standoffsoftware.com/unicorn-dungeon/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 411, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Stand Off Software"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Stand Off Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
