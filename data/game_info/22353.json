Experience skiing like never before! No clunky boots, no chairlift lines and no harsh cold! Just you and the mountain--and any number of obstacles. Trees, fences, logs, rocks and poles might slow you down and ruin your chances on the leaderboard but at least you won\u2019t need ski patrol! Tilt your head to steer and use your ski poles for speed. And remember, just because you won\u2019t get a concussion doesn\u2019t mean the bumps don\u2019t hurt!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBuilt from the ground up for VR, The Slopes is compatible with both the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift + Touch with support for standing AND roomscale spaces.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:07:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d53/d5336a31e12086a1accd86a159f0d89c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 27}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Peter Labick", "Connor Laux"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["GreenHopper Development"], "esrb_rating": null}
