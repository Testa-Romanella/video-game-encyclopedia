Struck by a car and cast (prematurely) into the afterlife, every remaining heartbeat brings him one step closer to salvation... or the grave!\u00a0 From award-winning indie game developer David J. Sushil (Vanessa Saint-Pierre Delacroix &amp; Her Nightmare, Not Without You) comes a novel platformer with a wicked sense of humor. Guide Pete through 27 levels of white-knuckled arcade insanity. Dodge dimwitted Ghosts, soul-sucking Spectres, and ravenous Grabby Hands. Collect secret items, unlock trophies, and earn a spot on the global high score list.\"\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>In 2013, a group of game developers in Orlando organized a meetup for the Global Game Jam.\u00a0 Over the course of a weekend, several great games were developed, all based around the theme:\u00a0<em>heartbeat</em>.\u00a0 The friendships made then planted the seeds of what would later become\u00a0Indienomicon, Orlando's monthly showcase of local independent video games, which I hosted for the first four years.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anyhow, at this particular meetup, I brought several members of the Terncraft team - Sam, Paul, Pascal, and Joe.\u00a0 We built most of\u00a0<em>A Lighthearted Game</em> that weekend, and then spent another few weeks polishing it up.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>I love this game.\u00a0 It landed with a thud and nobody played it, but there's something great about it that I wish more people could see.\u00a0 Maybe it will find an audience here on itch.io?</p>\n<p><em>A Lighthearted Game</em> was originally coded in C# using the XNA framework, but\u00a0has\u00a0been pretty faithfully rebuilt in JavaScript.\u00a0 It is\u00a0lacking only access to a global high score list.\u00a0 Maybe if there's enough interest...</p>\n<p><strong>Design<br/></strong>David J.
