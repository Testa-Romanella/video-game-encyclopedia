If a player's main base is destroyed they lose! Once your main base is placed, new buildings must be placed within a certain range.\u00a0 Control the camera with\u00a0WASD or Arrow keys.</p>\n<p>If you wish, you can follow me on twitter, where\u00a0I post gifs/vids of my random projects. https://www.twitter.com/Andrew_LGN</p>\n<p><strong>Afterthoughts</strong><strong>:\u00a0</strong> <em>(You can skip this)</em></p>\n<p>Though lacking a lot of what I wanted to put into the game, I am quite happy with what I have managed to do. I\u00a0only had roughly 12 hours to create the whole thing, and personally consider creating the rts system, with randomly generated maps, and a very basic AI, overly ambitious for myself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>With the core programming finished, it is ready for me to throw in new units and buildings at a quick rate and given another couple of hours, I think the selection of them would be at a point where I am happy with it. So, I\u00a0think I\u00a0will continue this over the coming weeks and post an updated version with the units. Regardless I am satisfied with what I have done, it is a functional prototype of the idea I had in mind.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8cd/8cd30df0e27f07289ac05c8d474fe061.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AndrewLGN"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
