As you can see, this is a conversion for PC and to be used with a mouse instead of a touchscreen, and at the moment, multiplayer features completely broken.</p>\n<p>The thing is, that I was able to have a working multiplayer back then when I was working on the Android version. I was even\u00a0in the phase of improving multiplayer and core game elements when the framework I used for the multiplayer aspect\u00a0got an update\u00a0\u00a0that made\u00a0 the game unable\u00a0to make proper connections between players anymore.\u00a0 And recovering the old version didn't help, I had a services problem. Anyway, the beta is still out there if you are interested...\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well!, given the situation I was in, I decided to put the development on hold until a new multiplayer framework update came in. But alas, a few months later, GooglePlayServices anounced that the services I was using for the game were going to be discontinued and that I 'should'\u00a0move to Firebase.</p>\n<p>There are even more misfortunes I could talk about related to the state of the project on GooglePlay, but I got tired of them so I decided to try to make a quick conversion of the game so you can enjoy it here, although partially.</p>\n<p>I considered implementing a classic LAN multiplayer feature for the game while working\u00a0on the conversion and improve the game mechanics, but because I'm in the middle of a more atractive project at the moment,\u00a0I prefer to see if\u00a0players may be interested in improving this game first. A little bit of healthy curiosity.</p>\n<p>I hope you can enjoy it!</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T04:05:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99d/99d5a8d6cc7ed235ba86c46c4b019656.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cimeto"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
