As well as dealing with memory loss, he also has to guide a blind young girl, who was abandoned by her companions, through an elaborate post-apocalyptic environment teeming with treacherous rooms and numerous puzzles. The two will have to face many hardships if they are to make it to safety, as well as perhaps facing the ghosts of their past as well.</p>\n<p>{Developer note: 95% of the description is not a reality in this game. This is my first time coding as well as my first time using Unity, so I'm not quite ready for making games in a few days, especially with how ridiculous my development scope was. Despite all of this, I'm glad I participated and hopefully I'll be able to make my original game idea a reality in the future.}</p><p>Music: Gotama - Forgiveness<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T09:39:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd6/fd6c361b0943899ee521278fe5e1fba3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hotshotksw"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
