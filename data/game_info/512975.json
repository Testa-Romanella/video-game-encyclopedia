I expected for a long time a more physical challenge, with few to no aid on performing cool actions, so that anytime you do something cool you feel proud of it. <br/></p>\n<p>The game took several forms until its current state after I played a lot with my friends. It became an easy to use game that everbody can enjoy, but hidding at the same time a set of layers that hard players will use to their advantage or to become a real badass inside the game.</p>\n\n<p>I would like everybody to play the game, so I released a demo full of stuff to play.</p>\n<p>Hope you all enjoy it!</p>\n\n\n<p>&gt;Demo available</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>Omega Blade Demo includes 4 introductory challenges and a single OST theme. The full game includes 20 challenges, 4 OST themes, more enemies, game modes and future updates.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T07:23:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae9/ae9a9fa965c8c3080072eaab439bc8a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 223, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Omega Blade"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
