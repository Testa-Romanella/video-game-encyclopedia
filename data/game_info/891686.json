These games provide an open world, in which you not only see history unfold as it was, but experience it yourself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This title focuses on the Scandinavian explorations of North America, around the year 1000. Northmen (or Vikings, as we call them today) explored the modern lands of Newfoundland &amp; Labrador during this time, encountering local Native American tribes. Evidence suggests they even traded with each other and occasionally came into conflicts.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>They settled on the island of Newfoundland, which they named Vinland. Here they lived for about 10 years, before mysteriously abandoning it.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>10 years ago, your brother set sail westwards with the Vinland settlers. Now, some of them have returned to Greenland, saying they could not stay. Your brother, however, has not returned. You don\u2019t know what to think, all you know, is that you must find him.\r\n</p>\n<p>Set sail from your home in Greenland to the Vinland settlement and try to uncover what really happened. You will have to explore the empty village, doing your best to survive.</p>\n\n<p>This game was made and designed as part of the Startup Project in CMGT at Saxion University.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Made by:\u00a0 HistoVRians</p>\n<ul><li>Designers:<ul><li>Dan Markov (Danidan)\r\n</li><li>Afonso Santos (Chibi Lord Cthulhu)</li></ul>\n</li><li>Artists:<ul><li>Bohdan Shkel</li><li>Allan Bukowski</li></ul><ul><li>Anastasia Lalaeva</li></ul>\n</li><li>Engineers:<ul><li>Casper Sikkens (marsmaantje)\r\n</li><li>Milan Roumimper</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T06:17:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e0/1e0f56bf4838cfab08ca764630cd2265.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 248, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Danidan"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
