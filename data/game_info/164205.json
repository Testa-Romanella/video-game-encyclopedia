In a lot of competitive games, especially competitive video games, it is often yourself who is causing your failures by falling into predictable trends.</p>\n<p>Rock-Paper-Scissors is one of the most basic competitive games.\u00a0At first, it seems like a completely random game - you compare choices and either you or your opponent wins (or there is a tie!) However, more competitive players will learn the trends that their opponent follows, often without knowing their knowledge!</p>\n<p>So, ultimately, you are playing yourself - does he know I typically follow Rock with Scissors? Can she find patterns I accidentally fall into? Even the difficult AI attempts to predict your move based on your past.</p>\n<p>On top of this, the time restriction and building pressure causes you to make mistakes in your choice, or even not making a move at all! When the pressure builds, you are your own worst enemy.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you and your opponent have the exact same tools and restrictions. There isn't a difference between the two, almost as if your opponent is you...</p>\n<p>Currently I've uploaded\u00a0 prototype builds after the first few days of development. Since I won't have a full day Saturday to work on it, I'm mostly going to focus on cleaning it up to be presentable.</p>\n<p>Final build is ready!</p>\n<p>Thanks for checking it out!</p>\n\n<p>The source is available on github, It was made with the Godot engine.<br/></p>\n<p>Tools used were:</p>\n<ul><li>Godot</li><li>BeepBox</li><li>Paint.Net</li><li>Audacity</li><li>Marmoset Hexels</li><li>SourceTree</li><li>Github</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1c/f1c56f37d077b31042f29d5ebf26f240.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dorblin7z7"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
