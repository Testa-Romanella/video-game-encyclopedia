Imagine if Chess pieces came to life! Imagine if you had tiny little magical Dragons and toy Knights that moved on their own! Magic! (Or boring modern technology.)<br/><br/>The boardgame pieces are deployed on the board in the style of Chess. Each player has 8 pawns (4 archers, 4 foot soldiers), 2 Rooks (heavy infantry), 2 Knights (Ni), 2 Bishops (mages), 1 Queen (a healer who acts more like the traditional King in Chess), and 1 Dragon Ridire (who acts more like the Queen in Chess). <br/><br/>There are several types of terrain. A grassland offers little defense, but it\u2019s very quick for certain units to walk through. Forests and Hills offer great defense for all units. Mountains and Castles offer the best defense. Dragons are the only ones allowed to fly over Mountains. Don't get caught with your trunks on while swimming, you'll take major damage!<br/><br/>You can pick the type of victory you wish to go for at the start of the game. Regicide\u2019s goal is to murder the Queen! Capture Castle's goal is occupy the enemy's fortress! Kill All Human's goal is to eliminate the opposing army! Dragoncide's goal is to decimate the enemy\u2019s Dragon Ridire!<br/><br/>Only the best strategist with the smartest tactics will win!<br/><br/>Thanks for playing and Good Luck!!!!!!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:21:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/914/914f8f1aebfee584f0d3235d1496e136.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Wulveagfin Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Organized Designs Wulveagfin"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
