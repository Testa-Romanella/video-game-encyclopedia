Feel free to share your opinions!<br/></p>\n<p>The full source code is available on my github.</p>\n<p>I plan to do further work on this game, for a list of all planned features etc. check out the issue page on github.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>w - move up</p>\n<p>s - move down</p>\n<p>c - change power</p>\n<p>space - shoot</p>\r\nRules\r\n<p>You can move using the w and s keys on the left side of the game area. The enemies will spawn randomly on the right side of the screen and move towards the left. There are two types of enemies: rats and villagers. Rats just have to be killed, while villagers have to be healed from the plague. Rats move quicker than villagers and if they happen to catch one AFTER they have been healed, the villager will be infected again.</p>\n<p>Your goal is to survive as long as possible and get as much score as possible in the meantime.</p>\n<p>Killing a rat will grant you 1 score. A healed villager reaching the left side will also give you 1 score. If you kill a villager instead of healing them, you will lose 1 score.</p>\n<p>Touching a rat or a plagued villager will take 1 life from you. If you lose all 5, you obviously lose the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T05:25:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ca/4ca9b1b3c5386df011fe073cddb934a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["pmarkee"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
