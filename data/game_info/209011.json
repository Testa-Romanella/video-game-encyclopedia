Final star is much fancier and ends the game. Avoid that falling green fel fire and do not fall off the platforms or you will die. There are also some platforms that are an illusion, they are lighter in color than the other platforms that are real to you.</p><p>Design challenges were that this was my first game made on Construct 2, it was basically a learning process so there was some trial and error to get various events to be correct.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jacqumasc"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
