Every 100 clicks bring you\u00a0one step closer to evolving humanity (11 steps total). Does it work for education? Honestly, somebody try it, then we'll know. But it beats reading a book, which was the point.</p>\n<p>Final version is planned to include several branches of evolution beside the human one by giving options at key points.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T20:50:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1bf/1bfcb5308e9f3d48e188d992bacb551b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Thomas Diehl"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
