{"id": 923223, "slug": "the-dying-god", "name": "The Dying God", "name_original": "The Dying God", "description": "<p><strong>A mortal with ambition so bold, Dreams of divinity to unfold. A quest for power he does implore, To reach the top and be forevermore.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>He yearns for grace and endless might, A force that shines with endless light. He craves for worship and adoration, A ruler of worlds, beyond imagination.\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>But little does he know the cost, The burden of such power that is lost. For with it comes the endless strife, The constant struggle, the endless life.\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The weight of worlds rests on his shoulders, With every decision, he grows bolder. But every action has a consequence, And as a god, he must be hence.\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>So now he stands, with power in hand, A conqueror, in his own land. But with each step, his feet do shake, As he realizes, this was a mistake.\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>For being a god, is not a game, It brings no joy, only endless shame. It's not the power that he sought, But the love and respect, that he has lost.\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>And so he stands, in all his might, A mortal still, in the eyes of sight. For in his heart, he knows the truth, That true divinity lies in youth.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T05:49:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b9/0b9599ac8c52a59fca5ac96be879b4b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheDoctor989"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
