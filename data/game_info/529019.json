Can you fill your box with the best Tokens...<br/>Exchange text-based Tokens to play this full \"offline\" multiplayer game. Your token is the most important. If it jumps many other players, and get back to you, it will multiply the point of the visiting Tokens.<br/>You can have 10 visiting Tokens. To get more Tokens, you need to move some to the Vault of Remembrance. Only by getting back a Token will it move back to your box. So think carefully about what is best to do.<br/>Normal (good) Tokens can be sent, as can bad Tokens, that will eventually force your visiting Tokens back to the Vault of Remembrance. But... Getting bad Tokens is the only way to get special Tokens, Tokens with existing high values, and that are created at that time. If they get moved to the Vault before being exchanged, they are lost forever!</p>\n<p>Complex, but actually quite simple, once you start exchanging all will become clear!</p>\n<p>So, are you ready for the Days of the Tokens?</p>\n<p>All feedback/contribution is welcome! :)<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Music by Chris Huelsbeck: Galactic Light, used under a royalty-free license, please visit www.patreon.com/chris_huelsbeck for more info!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T04:43:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b96/b9606a9cf4a55c7ff1e298f0c184f078.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["The Giant (Beach) Ball Studio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
