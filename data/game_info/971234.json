{"id": 971234, "slug": "snakenpon", "name": "Snakenpon", "name_original": "Snakenpon", "description": "The classic snake game is back merged with the Jankenpon game! A relaxing casual game where you eat the fruits and needs be aware of the symbols: if you are rock, paper will make you grow 3 times longer the default, scissors will not change your size and rock will produce the classic behavior.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Who does not know this game? Move the snake around the board, eat the fruits, avoid the walls and the snake tail. That's all... not really...<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The Rock, Paper and Scissors logic exists in the game. The snake have a symbol on it's head. So does the fruits. When you eat a fruit representing the opposite symbol (the one you have advantage on) the snake size does not change. The same symbol will make it grow by 1 piece. The disadvantage one will make the snake grow by 3 pieces instead. So you need to proper calculate your moves!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minimalist visuals, multiple beautiful backgrounds, uplifting music will make you calm. A game to make you feel good and nostalgic.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T10:26:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/241/241658ef9c81a6d1b7614622c8e96905.jpg", "website": "https://www.indigoware.net/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IndigoWare"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["IndigoWare"], "esrb_rating": null}
