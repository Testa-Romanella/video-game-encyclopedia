Your task is to go through the maze, destroy all the enemy robots and get to the finish line. The passages to the other rooms of the maze are littered with stones. You need to use bombs to free the passages. Your robot can shoot to destroy other robots, you can also use bombs for this. To take the bomb, you just need to approach it, the robot takes it from the ground itself, while the timer starts counting down. After dropping the bomb, do not forget to move a decent distance away, otherwise you will explode. You can not touch walls, stones and other robots - an explosion will occur. A number is indicated on the opponent's robot - how many hits are needed to destroy it. Different robots have different skills - some do not shoot, others shoot different projectiles. At some levels, you have the opportunity to take a super weapon - it destroys robots with one shot.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T00:02:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4c/c4cf447e83a526e2ed4506487655e54b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aleksey"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["AlekseyN"], "esrb_rating": null}
