Of course, there's always alcohol to numb the pain (drink responsibly, guys). \"2016\" is a simple little game I whipped up to help you get hopelessly inebriated while being reminded of all the most painful and bizarre parts of the year that's now thankfully mostly behind us.</p><p>From celebrity deaths to wildfires and from bizarre inventions to ridiculous political fuckery, \"2016\" has it all. Gather your friends, gather some alcohol and take turns to pick a day from the calendar. If something happened, follow the instructions and drink... or add a little something to the \"Bad Decisions\" glass for future use.</p><p>This little game is free. Hope you enjoy it, and donations are welcome; they'll be put towards working on a neater, tidier, expanded version.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/843/8437a2663dee92868a99bc333728eebf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Drink To Destruction"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
