The biggest feature missing is the survival mode and the reason for that is I firstly want to focus on the core mechanics like building which is best used in \"creative mode\". I am also not sure how I want the game to end up but survival will probably make a return in the future. New features and patches will be released regularly but not on a dedicated schedule.\u00a0</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Move - WASD keys.</p>\n<p>Fullscreen - \"F11\".</p>\n<p>Save game - \"ENTER\". Note that when you save the previous save will be overridden.</p>\n<p>Switch between building layer - \"K\".</p>\n<p>Destroy tile - left mouse button.</p>\n<p>Place tile - right mouse button.</p>\n<p>Press one of the following keys to swap the current building\u00a0tile: \"1\",\u00a0\u00a0\"2\",\u00a0\u00a0\"3\",\u00a0\u00a0\"4\",\u00a0\u00a0\"5\",\u00a0\u00a0\"6\",\u00a0\u00a0\"7\",\u00a0\u00a0\"8\",\u00a0\u00a0\"9\",\u00a0\u00a0\"0\",\u00a0\u00a0\"ARROW_UP\",\u00a0\u00a0\"ARROW_DOWN\",\u00a0\u00a0\"ARROW_LEFT\".</p>\r\nHow to run:\r\n<p>Firstly, you need Java installed to be able to play Tileland. Extract the .zip folder and ensure that the .jar file and \"res\" folder are in the same location, then just run the .jar file.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T08:30:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/183/1835ca85227bcff19198e4742386ca0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Philliam"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
