We'll meet him when we die and he will decide if we go to heaven or hell.<br/></strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>A couple centuries ago however, he made a mistake and accidentally sent ten good people to hell. Not to hard to understand how, considering he has to keep track of all people on earth.\u00a0Mistakes happen... , but a\u00a0serious mistake like this is not acceptable.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Good people were sent to hell to suffer for eternity. They need to be saved, for they do not deserve hell. They belong in heaven.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>St. Peter was sent to hell to save them.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Satan sent some of his\u00a0creatures of hell who will do their best to make the priest\u00a0fail his mission.</strong></em></p>\n<p>The game takes place sometime during the\u00a015-18th centuries.\u00a0 Playing as St. Peter\u00a0you will fight against the creatures of hell and solve puzzles in the labyrinth,\u00a0In the castle you will search for keys and face more monsters who are trying to\u00a0kill you, they will not make it easy for\u00a0you to save the prisoners.</p>\r\n\r\nDevelopment\r\n<p><strong>Saint To Hell: The First Mistake, </strong>A game by\u00a0Robin Hagner, 23 y/o, a student studying Game Development and more in N\u00e4rpi\u00f6, Finland.</p>\n<p>The project began in April 2021 when I got the idea for the game. I found a Priest on the Unity AssetStore while looking for inspiration. This priest became the main character.\u00a0From there on until\u00a0now almost a year later, I've\u00a0spent many hundreds of hours\u00a0to develop the game.</p>\n<p>In the beginning as the school year was ending and during the summer break. I used\u00a0Mixamo.com and the 3rdpersoncharacter from Unity's Standard Assets to make movement for my priest. I made a good start with the labyrith terrain, the first enemy called Skelezombie, and\u00a0the green spell which could kill the enemy. I also imported a bunch\u00a0of other enemies. This first project was mainly a sketch and just for fun to visualize what the game could look like.</p>\n<p>When the 2021-2022 school year started I made a new project and imported what i needed from the sketch. I started by making the other attacks for my priest, I payed close attention to how the weapons could be switched, in other words: not to be able to perform an attack with a different weapon in hand.\u00a0Soon after that while searching the Asset Store again I suddenly stumbled upon the \"Ultimate Low Poly Dungeon\" asset from Broken Vector, which had most of the second level ready in a demo scene. Thanks to that asset I didn't need to design the second level on my own, in other words this was a\u00a0huge time saver. I made the rest of the second level with prisoners, keys, more monsters and so on.</p>\n<p>After I had made most of the second level, I soon started making level 1, which is a labyrinth with puzzles to solve and killing some Skelezombies.</p>\n<p>More sound effects were made for attacks, monsters and puzzles.</p>\n<p>As 2022 had begun and school started again, I made the trailer and\u00a0finished the development and handed it in after having\u00a0connected all the sounds to sliders in the main and pause menu's and reducing the file size.</p>\r\n\r\nA time in hell you will not regret\r\n\n<p>Saint To Hell is inspired by a\u00a0big favorite among games from my childhood \"<strong><em>S</em><em>erious Sam 2</em></strong>\", such games about fighting monsters in different environments are\u00a0in my opinion by far the best. Unlike Serious Sam having firearms as weapons, Saint To Hell has magic, a grenade and a\u00a0cross that is thrown.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Saint To Hell will take you on a unique experience. As St. Peter, one of Jesus' twelve disciples, you will go on a short adventure in hell, solving puzzles and fight monster's with your magic, while searching for keys to save good people who were mistakenly sent to hell instead of heaven where they actually belong.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Can you as St. Peter having made a blunder, prove that you are still worthy to guard the gates of heaven?!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I hope you like my game,\u00a0Let me know\u00a0what you think.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T07:07:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c3/9c3ed225b83f802aebdabc94b41f9610.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 282, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["THurisaz"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
