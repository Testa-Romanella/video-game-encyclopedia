The backbone of a ground invasion is the U.S. Army Infantry, and in the midst of combat, their skills, courage, and teamwork are put to the test.<br />\nWhile readiness continues to be the U.S. Army&#39;s top priority, how it goes about its business is changing. Full Spectrum Warrior began as a training aid for the U.S. Army to reinforce Army doctrine and team effort within the troops. It is the most realistic portrayal of Infantry-level urban warfare via unique tactical action gameplay. Players become the Squad Leader, commanding Alpha and Bravo squads. There is potential for danger down every alley, behind every window. Watch those angles folks, we&#39;ve got a job to do here. Hooah!<br />\nUnique combination of tactical and action gameplay.<br />\nAuthentic implementation of U.S. Army Infantry doctrine.<br />\nSimple control scheme lets you command eight soldiers in real time.<br />\nSquad equipment reflects real weaponry and equipment currently in use by the U.S. Army.<br />\nImmersive urban environments with danger around every corner.<br />\n2-player co-op, each player controls one fire team.<br />\nIncludes 2 exclusive bonus levels not available on Xbox.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2004-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-30T21:01:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e3/3e3a6634bde0810ba728a1df6191365e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 30, "owned": 370, "beaten": 9, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 9}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 24, "suggestions_count": 558, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 24, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "Xbox", "PC", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["Pandemic Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["THQ Nordic"], "esrb_rating": null}
