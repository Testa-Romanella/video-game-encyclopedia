Together, Carlos (programmer) and Max (artist) share a taste for sims and classic gameplay -- which is easy to see in The Spatials, their first project. Inspired by the great classic sim games of the '90s, The Spatials combines classic base-building gameplay (based on isometric tile room building) with a real-time combat system and an exploration campaign. After publishing version 1.0 in mid 2014, Carlos and Max saw the potential of their idea and developed a much improved second version with Early Access starting in August 2014.  In October 2014, the game was approved for release on Steam. In 2015, The Spatials continued to grow in popularity -- featured in Let's Plays from YouTubers and articles in major sites such as Rock Paper Shotgun.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-25T02:25:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ca/2ca492db3cd8e52c1203fa96f8e4ec2f.jpeg", "website": "http://thespatials.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 122, "dropped": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 48, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 457, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["iOS", "Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Weird and Wry"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Weird and Wry"], "esrb_rating": null}
