The game consists of colorful geometric shapes. Players will control blocks of two colors: red and blue. The game will be learned throughout the progression of the levels. Controls will be simplistic and easy to understand. The main idea behind its simplistic style and control system is to create complex puzzles while trying to avoid confusion about the controls. For now, the game has only 10 levels. The fate of the project is unknown. The background music is Introduction by Solar Fields for the game Mirror's Edge.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a9/1a9ece97192247f6552dd5d394f91885.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ahmet Zahit D\u00f6nmez"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
