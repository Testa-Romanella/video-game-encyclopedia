I am quite happy about the progress I made.\r\n\n\r\nFifth release, now ready for the jam!\r\n<p><em>If you are curious and willing to help me, please try it and do not hesitate to point out everything that make you think it is not normal, it would be much appreciated :D !!<br/></em></p>\n\n\n\r\nLink to the theme:\r\n<p>Stronger together.</p>\n<p>You play as the Queen of a species that can absorb its children to get bigger, heavier and... stronger.</p>\n<p>I wanted to play on the fact that stronger is not always good. Like making traps for big or heavy blob.</p>\n\n\r\nInfo:\r\n<p>I did\u00a0everything\u00a0by\u00a0myself,\u00a0except\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0fonts.</p>\n\n\r\nFeatures to add/change:\r\n<p>There are always room for improvements, but I think I will focus on bugs and feedback !<br/></p>\n\n\r\nChanges done:\r\n<p>-Background added</p>\n<p>-Springs has water</p>\n<p>-Sounds are set</p>\n<p>-Projectiles should be fine</p>\n<p>-Platforms breaks ok</p>\n<p>-Jump stuck issue should not be a bother anymore</p>\n<p>-Text bigger</p>\n<p>-Controls shown first time you play</p>\n<p>-Music (by a jukebox, I recommend track 2, which one do you like most?)</p>\n<p>-All secrets are accessible</p>\n<p>-Spelling mistakes should be corrected (but a few remain... I just know it...)<br/></p>\n\n\r\nIdea for the future:\r\n<p>I will keep my idea until the end of the Jam... !<br/></p>\n\n\r\nKnown issue (somehow fixed):\r\n<p>You can get stuck on the ground with the animation playing a jump. It happens when you hit jump button but don't leave the collider of the ground, or when you jump stuck to a wall.</p>\n<p>If this happens, you can just wait a second without moving, it should work again.<br/></p>\n<p>If you can't, just hit Escape and Restart or Menu and Continue. There should be enough checkpoints to not feel too frustrated.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Find below a Windows version if you want to play it better.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T12:42:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d4/7d4382ce5d45ac040d9180667b8b93d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Shagar220"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
