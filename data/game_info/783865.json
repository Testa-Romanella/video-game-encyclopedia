Carried by your dark folly, you decide it&#39;s time to teach those white pieces to fear the Shotgun King.<br />\nEvery turn, you may either move your king or shoot at enemy pieces, after what you&#39;ll need to move again to reload your shotgun. Avoid checkmate and kill the enemy king to complete the floor. After each floor, you may choose between two random combinations of one upgrade for you and one upgrade for the other side. Choose wisely and keep on winning floors and you just may get your kingdom back.<br />\nRuns may take ~20 minutes to complete. The game features 5 difficulties, plus an endless mode!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-22T00:36:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c31/c316119c765eadca9fd31a86fad8d82e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.87, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 37, "owned": 210, "beaten": 19, "toplay": 20, "dropped": 10, "playing": 5}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 84, "ratings_count": 30, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 31, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Goblinz Studio", "PUNKCAKE Delicieux"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Goblinz Studio", "PUNKCAKE Delicieux"], "esrb_rating": null}
