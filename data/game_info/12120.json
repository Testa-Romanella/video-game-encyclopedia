{"id": 12120, "slug": "savage-lands", "name": "Savage Lands", "name_original": "Savage Lands", "description": "<p>Savage Lands is a fantasy survival game with heavy emphasis on cooperative multiplayer. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The players spawn in a vast fantasy open world. The game does not give you any main goals or tasks that are necessary to \u201cbeat\u201d the game. Instead, you can explore the world at your own pace. One of the main game mechanics is crafting. You can create different tools, items or build structures using recourses that you can find throughout the game world. Players can come across ruined villages. The building in them can be repaired and used as a temporary base. <br />\nThe environments are filled with hostile animals and mythical creatures such as boars, wolves, skeletons. Killing enemies is off the primary way to gather certain materials such as animal skin that you can get from slain deer or boars. The most notable monster in the game is a giant dragon that inhabits a tower in the center of the map. Killing it requires cooperation and the best armor and weapons you can find or create. Aside from wild animals and monsters, the other great menace to the player is cold temperature. Staying cold for a long time makes you lose hope. To get warm, you can use torches, campfires or warm clothes. Any players in the game world can use the campfires, so they often become gathering spots for players. Alternatively, you can craft warm clothes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-17T03:36:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bb/0bbb4b354fa779acc1f08ad1cf693956.jpg", "website": "http://www.savagelandsgame.com", "rating": 1.98, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 46, "owned": 1077, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 23}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 20, "ratings_count": 53, "suggestions_count": 536, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 53, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Signal Studios", "Smart Ghost"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Signal Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
