It's sort of like Towerfall with a freeze/melee combat mechanic.

I have a feeling that using a different combination of gamepads and operating systems will have the buttons not work properly, but we're gonna try to update the game with a more robust input system sometime soon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e80/e80b9bc1abf6bb03a72162c28e9e59f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["jakintosh"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
