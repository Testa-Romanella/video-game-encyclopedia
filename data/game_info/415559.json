The Asenra, a technologically advanced species, landed on Paragon and sought to make it their new home. However, there was a rift amongst their people; a divide on how the species would make their home on this new planet. The Techons, led by the Technological Empress Shin-Ri, believed that their prowess over technology should rule. The Ruglist, led by Prophet Arkini, believed that they needed to change their ways; their over reliance on technology and disrespect of their previous home cost them everything. Unwilling to see eye to eye, the Ruglist left their colony ships and wandered into the wilds of their new home. The Techons swore their allegiance to their Empress and worked to create an empire built on science and technology. They worked tirelessly to spread their new influence over the land, naming their new empire the Techon Dominion. The Ruglist had found a primal force in the lush forest of Paragon, and inspired by their new nature deity Silaris, they worked to protect the lands of their home. The forest became their kingdom, and their duty became clear to them: Prevent the loss of another home, no matter the cost. Naming themselves the Protectors of The Sili, they fight to preserve the planet. Now, decades later both sides fight for resources in the lands between their two nations, each trying to gain the upper hand in the conflicts. Both sides have deployed Scouts to contested regions, and now many fight each other in duels to gather the resources and information their people need. Who will come out on top remains to be seen, but both empires are not willing to back down for ultimate control.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T03:55:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/995/995de3bfec9f3b25b6ec647b89ca3681.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AeroChow"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
