Let me know if you have any issues with the Mac build as I haven't tested it.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Press enter to begin</p>\n<p>wasd for movement (with mouse for rotation) (it's wonky right now, my apologies)</p>\n<p>While moving you can press e while looking at one of the engineering panels or interfaces (Currently only the navigation levers work as well as the engine and shield panels.</p>\n<p>While within a panel your mouse can be used to drag/drop interactable components (warning, if you drop your wires you currently can't get more, was having trouble with that system)</p>\n<p>Tap Esc to go back to moving</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the goal marker and jostling of the mobile habitat aren't implemented yet.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>WIP notes on the premise behind the game:</strong></p>\n<p>You are an engineer on a rover on a hostile barren landscape.<br/></p>\n<p>(for the sake of time) you have no visibility outside your rover and must rely on a sensor for all of your navigation needs</p>\n<p>Two Levers control the bearing of the vehicle (xy)</p>\n<p>Many risks exist:</p>\n<p>* Changing angle too swiftly can cause damage</p>\n<p>* Certain storms can impact sensor range/effectiveness</p>\n<p>* Certain inclines are too steep for base power</p>\n<p>* Fuel is somewhat limited (can refuel?)</p>\n<p>* components can be damaged by overriding safeties/limiters</p>\n<p>* creatures? can purposefully damage components for emp? or perhaps route more power to system to negate their attacks? like slow the drivers and choose a lower gradient route until they tire of attacking</p>\n<p>Target destination</p>\n<p>Potentially cargo? Can cargo be damaged? Does this affect mission score?</p>\n<p>How long should a mission take?</p>\n<p>10-40 minutes?</p>\n\n\n<p>Todos (in no particular order):</p>\n<ul><li>Polish... So much</li><li>Finish out the other engineering panels</li><li>Jostle the hab by movement changes as you go across the terrain</li><li>fix the emp</li><li>add the faked enemies</li><li>give more reasons to do risky wiring</li><li>fix occasional crashes when messing with the wires</li><li>lighting</li><li>fix the character animations (that walk cycle..)</li><li>Music, sfx</li><li>the list goes on</li></ul>\n\n<p>This has been fun. I hope to clean this project up a bit and get it up to par with the vision I had for it. Hopefully you found it interesting</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T16:39:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b0/6b0b2786db3238f6db3f2e96b178a02b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["NAPTlME"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
