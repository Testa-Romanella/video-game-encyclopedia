Embark (ha, ha, bark...) on a quest to bury a very important bone. Suck up blocks with your dirtpack and build into the sky to get them out of the way. The higher you build, the more power-ups you'll find to help you dig deeper. Can you reach the bottom... or the top?HIGHLIGHTS<ul><li> No baddies! Just you, a big pile of dirt, and a huge, blank canvas.<br/></li><li> Unlock power-ups like new colors, hats, and even a jetpack.<br/></li><li> Work towards the end-game, or simply have fun making pictures with dirt blocks.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d7/8d7e163a25aa33969979c40f58f4cb9e.jpg", "website": "https://www.roppychop.com/pc/doggo-dig-down/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Roppy Chop Studios"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Roppy Chop Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
