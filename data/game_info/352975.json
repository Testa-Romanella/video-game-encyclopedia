{"id": 352975, "slug": "shfl", "name": "SHFL", "name_original": "SHFL", "description": "<p>A timed puzzle game. Everybody loves those, right? No? Dang.<br/></p>\n<p>This is a rough proof of concept, expanded from an old Ludum Dare jam game. It features 50 levels of puzzles in which the core mechanic is to shuffle rows of tiles in order for the little robot to safely make it to the other side. Block types allow you to turn, jump, smash things with a hammer, teleport, and some buttons that unlock gates.</p>\n<p><strong>The sequel and why this is on Itch</strong>:<br/></p>\n<p>I started working on a follow-up some years ago, but have put it on ice.  What I am hoping for, is to raise <strong>$400</strong> here in donations, which will buy enough time to finish it.</p>\n<p>The sequel, which will likely not be called \"SHFL\"-anything due to trademark conflicts will have a few key differences over the original.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Puzzles are not timed</li><li>Puzzle complexity is higher</li><li>Different sized levels</li><li>Movement can be in all 4 directions</li><li>A level editor</li><li>Updated graphics</li><li>More variety in environments</li></ul>\n<p>I originally began to update this existing jam version with the above changes before deciding that it needs to be its own thing.</p>\n<p>Here is the Greenlight trailer for the updated jam version (2017). It's pretty much what is here, but also shows off the level editor.</p>\n<p>And lastly, here you can see the the improved graphical style of the sequel. Seen below are tiles from the forest set. Also will have way more feedback, effects, better sounds, etc. <br/></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>So, if any of this is your kind of jam, we'd appreciate a small donation. If we hit $400, either from this or any of the other things in our itch account, we can make it happen.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-27T10:40:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f57/f5761c67c9e00ed06b27a28b319750f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Screwy Lightbulb"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
