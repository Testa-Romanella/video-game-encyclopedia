{"id": 9334, "slug": "pathogen", "name": "Pathogen", "name_original": "Pathogen", "description": "Pathogen is a real-time strategy game, where you take control of a plague that is causing a pandemic. Your goal is to defeat humanity by improving your abilities and earning points from infections.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Choose from many different types of pathogens, each with unique abilities. You can customize your plague by choosing a color and a disease name. Lots of extra customization will come in the future.<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Bacteria</strong>: Simplicity to use. High climate resistances. Can grow a flagellum which makes it faster.<br/></li><li><strong>Virus</strong>: Fast spreading speed, mutates in new strains with random benefits. However, dies fast outside of the host.<br/></li><li><strong>Parasite</strong>: Play alongside mosquitoes to reach its full potential.</li></ul><br/><br/><br/>Superplagues are special plagues that differ from realistic ones, as their special abilities (thankfully) are purely fictional.<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Thanatus</strong>: Create fake outbreaks around the world, created by only collective paranoia. However, these outbreaks may be even more destructive than real ones.<br/></li><li><strong>Radion</strong>: The most unstable pathogen, as radioactive material is stored in its nucleus.</li></ul><br/><br/><br/>You can play PvP human vs plague games on a LAN network. In multiplayer games, you can play as the human side, placing hospitals, setting lockdowns, and researching for new medicaments, trying to stop the disease as much as you can until your scientists find a cure.<br/><br/>Research for new compounds in the compound table, and combine them to create a huge spectrum of possible medicaments. You can also customize your medicaments by selecting a name and a color for the box.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T04:08:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd6/bd67501e48e98d8db20087742a0a263a.jpeg", "website": "http://www.gameblyr.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 392, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Gameblyr", "LMJ"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Board Games", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Gameblyr", "LMJ"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
