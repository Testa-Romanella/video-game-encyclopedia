Amber is trying to find her missing brother while being aided by her trusty teddy, Ted E. Bear.  At the end of the first episode, the search for Amber\u0092s missing brother led the duo to a black-and-white metropolis inhabited by Amber\u0092s other toys,who moonlight as the hard-nosed underbelly of Paper City. The elusive Red Man, suspected as the cause of sprawling fires, still serves as an omnipresent menace in Episode 2. \t  Their search will cross paths with a new roster of allies and suspects including CBG, a former detective who now believes surveillance cameras are strapped to the seagulls throughout Paper City. If it\u0092s true, they\u0092ve likely filmed the nefarious deeds of the Reef King, crime lord and operator of Westpaw Casino.
