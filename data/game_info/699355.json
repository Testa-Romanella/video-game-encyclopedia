Bring the football onto the trophy cup atop \"the greatest heights\", any mistake will make you lose tremendous amount of progress.</p>\n<p>The game is short, spanning entirely on one single level and there are multiple paths you can take to get to the top, or you can make your own path.<br/></p>\n<p>Note: I couldn't add all the features I wanted in time like RGB lights for the blocks when you slowly approach the end of the game. <strong>Also, there is no desktop version because I don't know how to make it</strong>, here's the thread: https://itch.io/t/1764741/how-do-i-port-an-electron-project-to-nwjs-gdevelop<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Left + Right OR A + D = Move</p>\n<p>Shift OR Space = Jump</p>\n<p>Click or touch anywhere on screen = Shoot a silent energy ball</p>\n<p>Bump into the ball (As Pepe) to knock it. Walking into it whilst it's on the ground will propel it further forward, but giving it a headbutt will send it flying which is required to get past certain obstacles. Create and aim an energy ball at the football to propel it into the air, so you can give it a proper headbutt.<br/></p>\n<p>(Title Screen only) <strong>Press on 1</strong> to obtain a different football with GDevelop's default physics for an object. <strong>Press on 2</strong> to get the rugby ball (Or American football ball) which is easier to control on the ground, but will get propulsed further in the air than the default ball. <strong>Press on 3</strong> to get a peculiar ball. All its stats are randomised and shooting energy at it will knock it at completely arbitrary angles which makes for a very unpredictable ball.</p>\r\nAttribution\r\n<p>(Will be added later)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T05:35:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/765/7654d24674899b91213bbfc83f0b01d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CyberRobotnix"], "genres": ["Sports", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
