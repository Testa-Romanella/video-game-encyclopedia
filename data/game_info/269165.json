Jump over obstacles with your CTRL button. You will automatically shoot at enemies that are in your sights.</p><p>Once you've practiced a bit, try enabling some of the features on the setup screen. These will make the game a bit more challenging (and enabling a lot of them simultaneously will make it MUCH more challenging), but your score will be amped up with each enabled challenge.<br/></p>\n<p>NOTE: Does the game seem stuck after you die?
