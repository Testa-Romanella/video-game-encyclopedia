While access to state-of-the-art technology and the internet can provide opportunities to enrich our lives, it also proves to be a place where iniquitous activities thrive. From the hidden horrors on the dark web, to the seemingly innocuous social media websites, the online world is a breeding ground for acts of deindividuation- like cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is defined as \u201c\u2026repeated behaviour, aimed at scaring, angering or shaming those who are targeted [through digital technologies]\u201d (UNICEF). Victimization rates differ depend on region, and groups being surveyed. In one study, it was reported through United States data that of 1,200 children aged 6-17, \u201c10% had experienced online bullying, 7% were bullied by phone, and 8% via text messages\u201d (Bauman, 251). Using Twine, I decided to raise awareness of some different forms of cyberbullying from the perspective of the perpetrator. I use an interactive storyline to showcase how online communications can start as a harmless prank and develop to cyberbullying as well as some of the serious consequences for both bullies and their victims.
