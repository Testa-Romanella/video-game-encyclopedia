Currently, there is red paint, which is bouncy, and green paint, which is sticky.</p>\n<p>I made this game as part of my final major project for the first year of the games design course that I'm doing. As a result of this, I don't intend to finish this game (unless it somehow becomes popular or if I randomly decide that I want to work on it). This doesn't necessarily mean that there won't be updates in the future, it's just unlikely.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>(These are also available in-game)</p>\n<p>WASD              - Move\u00a0</p>\n<p>E                 - Interact\u00a0</p>\n<p>Space             - Jump</p>\n<p>\r\nEscape            - Open/Close menu\u00a0</p>\n<p>Left mouse button - Shoot paint</p>\n<p>R - Toggle shapes (This can also be done from the menu)</p>\r\nFinal notes\r\n<p>I hope you enjoy playing the game that I've made.</p>\n<p>If you want an extra challenge, the fastest time that the level has been beaten in (that\u00a0 I know of) is 26 seconds. This should still be possible\u00a0(maybe even easier) in this version of the game.</p><p>The font used in the game is Arkitech Stencil.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T14:55:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a7/5a7218339d7c2d594ea7f9afd2edf222.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jacman9000"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
