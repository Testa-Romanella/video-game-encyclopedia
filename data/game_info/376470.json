I created it for my master's thesis at IST in Lisbon.</p>\n<p>It's a casual game where you simply answer whether each word is masculine or feminine while enjoying the tranquility of fishing. It features 37 boats to unlock (their effect is only cosmetic) and includes an algorithm to choose words of appropriate difficulty.</p>\n<p>I hope it's useful to anyone learning Portuguese!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-23T05:01:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7dc/7dca1ed86d7f92e0e30e216824d09db1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Petzi"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
