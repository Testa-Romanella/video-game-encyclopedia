Although is very simple I find it very satisfying to watch and I hope that you do too.</p>\n<p>Algorithm:</p>\n<p>The algorithm is based in a video from\u00a0Think Twice\u00a0 channel, here's the link: </p>\n<p> but to describe it in a couple of words:<br/></p>\n\n<ol><li>Draw a polygon</li><li>Draw a start point</li><li>Pick a random vertex\u00a0</li><li>Create a new point halfway between the random vertex and the last point drawn.</li><li>Repeat step 3 until enough number of points.</li></ol>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>E -&gt; Create new polygon point</li><li>W -&gt; Create start point</li><li>R -&gt; Reset polygon</li><li>Space -&gt; Start/Clear the simulation</li></ul>\n<p>Note on the setting \"Can Repeat Vertex\": This check button is to block from picking the same random vertex more than two times in a row when deciding the random vertex in step 3.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For example, if we have a triangle with vertices 1-2-3, we could have the next sequences:</p>\n<p>- Can Repeat Vertex = true -&gt; 1-1-2-3... (Vertex 1 is picked two times in a row)</p>\n<p>- Can Repeat Vertex = false -&gt; 1-2-3-1... (No vertex is picked two or plus times in a row)</p>\n<p>This Boolean changes the result a lot, so I recommend to always try it on and off while searching for fractals.</p>\n<p>Hope you learned something or at least you had fun hunting fractals.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Have a wonderful day and stay safe!</p>\n<p>PD: My favorite is a 6 points hourglass like polygon without vertex repetition.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T23:14:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/870/87012504f46d786436ef40a03a1f962a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Oriol - Rough Skin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
