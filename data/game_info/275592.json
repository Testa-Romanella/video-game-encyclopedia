(Survivor Minions) You can\u2019t shoot your enemies. You can\u2019t even hurt your enemies. All you can do is be a nuisance to your enemies. Just run into them and just be in the way. Each contact with them will release one of your Surions from your bind with them. They will then attempt to escape to their designated pods before the damage destroys them and leaves them stranded forever. Do everything you can to be a distraction and let your fellow Surions escape. Even if it means sacrificing yourself. Beware as each contact with the enemy causes damage to you. Take the punishment to sacrifice yourself for your loyal Surions. Select from one to as many as twelve to escape the horror. If you are lucky you may still be able to even save yourself.\u00a0\r\nThe slider allows you to choose how many of your team you attempt to save. It defaults to one at the beginning. After each successful mission it increases by one. Try and work your way up to ultimate survivor with twelve but you are free to choose what you want before each level.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a22/a22eedfefebc775d09870b7f97f44526.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["marvalgames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
