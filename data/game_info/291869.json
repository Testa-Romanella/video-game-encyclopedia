Or you can re-enter a \"seed\" and play the same game again.</li><li>The more controversial roguelike aspects are configurable: you can turn permadeath on or off (but you NEVER keep progression between games), item identification can be enabled or disabled, and the hunger clock is configurable.</li><li>There are 50 levels included in the game. More are planned for future expansion.</li><li>Most of the game is defined in Lua \"raw\" files - it's moddable out of the box.</li></ul>\n<p>You can\u00a0learn more about the game at the work-in-progress website (at a temporary URL for now):\u00a0http://oneknight.epizy.com/</p>\n<p><strong>Status</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>The game, right now, is in PRE-ALPHA.
