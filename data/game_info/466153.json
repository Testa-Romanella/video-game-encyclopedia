Play as the Quantum Hellbullet, a ship with no offensive or movement capabilities which instead of\u00a0weaving between projectiles you instead use the ships Quantum spacetime manipulation tools to move the projectiles around you. See how long you can survive.</p>\n<p>Part of the 2020 GMTK \"out of control\" gamejam</p>\n<p>How to play<br/>Press the 1, 2, 3 keys to switch between tools</p>\n<p><strong>1. Quantum tether:<br/></strong>Use your mouse to grab projectiles to move them in the screen. Beware, they will still maintain their previous momentum when you release them!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>2. Gravity Well:<br/></strong>Click to create a gravity well which attracts projectiles towards the centre. Be careful not to curve them into yourself.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>3. EM Barrier:<br/></strong>Click to create an ElectroMagnetic barrier which destroys any projectiles caught in its influence. Although the most powerful, it takes the longest to recharge.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T11:36:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52e/52e9c4b297e1f3dd7734282227b3425f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ELECTRICALLY CHALLENGED"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
