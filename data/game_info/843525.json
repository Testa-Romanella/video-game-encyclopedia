It was designed to make you rage. You can try to speedrun this, but I'll tell you right now, it's gonna be hard. I'll be surprised if you beat the game in 1 hour!</strong></p>\n\n<p>This game is a copy from Brackey's beginner get started series game. While it is a copy it's completely different, as I added, 7 new challenging levels, 3 new obstacles, and completely changed the genre and feel of the game to match the rage inducing trauma it's supposed to inflict.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T13:09:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a2/9a2a6f2bae468701ab2f398acc39077b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Creativity"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
