Even the first version was targeting android, 2D platformers games are always better for playing on PC, I enjoy myself much more playing Crabby Ball on desktop with keyboard or controller. <br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tI'll appreciate a lot your sincere comments to know if you would like to play a game like this on your desktop PC and what additional features would you like to see.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tThis are some of the plans for the PC version: <br/>\r\n\t- Additional game modes: Local Co-op and local Multiplayer. \r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t- Tons of new levels with interesting mechanics. \r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t- Improved graphics environment. \r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t- In-game Level editor.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tGreenlight: \r\n\thttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/...\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tHope you like this game as much as I have fun making it!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tKind regards, \r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tDenys\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f00/f0031c5a2d41a32dd39cd3dddc71ca9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["piXelicidio"], "genres": ["Sports", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
