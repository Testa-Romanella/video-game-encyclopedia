Draw routes between cities to transfer 3 types of resources for the war effort. Hire more operatives to increase the intel generated. Keep tabs on Axis operations around France to respond quickly to unrest. Keep a majority of cities in Allied hands by 1945 to win. If the Axis gain majority support in all cities, you lose.</p>\n<p>Notes:<br/>Operatives generate intel and require supplies.<br/>Supplies are generated at a constant rate.<br/>Intel generates percentage points for the Allies.</p>\n<p>Windows build only.<br/>Couldn't get UI scaling to work so unfortunately it really is only playable in the resolution 1920x1080</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T04:29:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/290/2903ebb189c755560a0f1b492555b111.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UncleGubbsy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
