{"id": 135254, "slug": "the-story-of-harambe", "name": "The Story of Harambe", "name_original": "The Story of Harambe", "description": "<p>\r\n\tA text-based adventure game made using unity 5.4.1f1. It is about Harambe and how he has become the overlord of the world. There are two endings to the game. If you would like to know those two ways I guess your going to have to play it to find out!\r\n</p><p>\tIn the making of this game I learned how to code a state machine and how to add music to play in the background of the game. I created custom titles for each state using textcraft.net. This was a very simple game. I think that this is a cool and fun first game.</p><p>\tThe main thing that I took away from this game was how to take the basic idea of one thing and turn it into another. This was originally supposed to be a prison escape game that I took and turned into something that was a little more complicated then a really basic escape game. I would highly recommend this game for anyone who is trying to learn how to make games. You can find more information on this game at Udemy.com!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/310/310b606f9cabd47c944a13cf1b6735d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lewisstone85"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
