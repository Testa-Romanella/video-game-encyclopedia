But don\u2019t worry about over-simplified rules that will make the game easy to get boring. Because the game has many mechanics, and the levels are diverse.<br/><br/></li><li>The art style of the game is minimalist, which mainly refers to many theories and techniques in graphic design, rather than realistic art. This is not a lazy move. Many designs of the game have been carefully considered. This style is designed for players to understand the game easily and enjoy the fun of the game.<br/><br/></li><li>Currently there are about 90 levels in the game, and it may increase to 120 in the future. We tried to make all levels look elegant. There are more than such count of levels. The game level editor and creative workshop will be opened in the future for players to create a variety of levels. </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T02:12:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c4/1c443cf8be02c36a6a5fcfb0a0aa9ceb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Leta Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Leta Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
