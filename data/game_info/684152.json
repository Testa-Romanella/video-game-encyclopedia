We are a group of random indie developer\u00a0from Russia, who first heard each other a little over a week ago, and decided to test their strength in this jam. The time of each fighter from our squad was disproportionately limited. Each of us had no more than two hours a day to the project, but what we could create with such a compressed graph, anticipates all my not the wildest expectations. The forces between us and jam were clearly not equal, but what was born during this cruel battle, you can watch by playing our wonderful project, in which you are collecting fragments of your poem in an attempt to escape from the terrible runestones. Only light can save you. Have a nice game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T07:33:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe6/fe62827c65157f938fb23174fd2fb4bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tugix"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
