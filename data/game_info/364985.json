In the early stages, you face hordes of undead miners.<br/>Contents of the tracks are changed as the player progresses throughout the story. <br/>They are also the grounds for resourcing building before the player chooses to unlock the rooms.<br/><br/><strong>Rooms</strong><br/>While the adventure down the tracks is infinite, you may come across restricted areas called <strong>rooms</strong>. Rooms are designed to be unique challenges for you to complete and offer story progression. Completing rooms unlocks more difficult rooms which reward you with higher tier content. After rooms are completed, they will also introduce new gameplay to the tracks.  Most of the content in the rooms are arranged differently each save.
