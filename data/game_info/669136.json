{"id": 669136, "slug": "at-the-edge-of-the-universe", "name": "At the edge of the universe", "name_original": "At the edge of the universe", "description": "<p>Made for Vim Jam 2 with the theme \"Boss\" and limitation \"On the edge\" in mind. <br/></p>\n<p>It's probably a bit of a loose interpretation of the theme/limitation - the 'boss' is the character at the start of the game, the skeleton foreman. The 'on the edge' is the setting, the edge of the universe, or the edge of reincarnation of the universe? Sure.<br/></p>\n<p>There are a few bugs that I'm aware of like the stars sometimes showing way too many at the same time and though it's now disabled, the dialogue at the end of the game was bugging the heck out. Also some dialogue in the Tutorial button popup doesn't match what's in the game - consider that a fun finding out bonus I guess lol.</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, also it has an alright soundtrack that I put together in a few hours, mainly procrastinating and finding the spiciest of chords. Hope you guys enjoy the game, I learnt so much from making it - it's the second game jam I've been in. I loved the 10 days instead of the 3 day one I was in before, I could go to work and not worry about handing in a rushed game. And feel free to steal the song I made, it's only really made for a 1 minute, speeding up game but yeah.<br/></p>\n<p>Cheers<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T09:30:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/579/579c1746e59644c67e19a2221ed64150.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["elacim"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
