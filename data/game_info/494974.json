Rely on intelligence only.</p>\n<p>There are no instructions for how to play. You have to figure out how to play the game and how to win it. The mission of the game is to teach you how to discover \"pattern\".</p>\n<p>The game may have some characteristics of a \"Rubik's\" cube, but it differs radically in gameplay and outcome.\r\n  </p>\n<p>This game is one of a series of games that aim to form a team of very smart people who are able to decipher the secret codes and find the hidden numbers found in one of the ancient archaeological obelisks that were found buried under one of the relics in Mesopotamia.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The code to be solved was mentioned in a novel titled \"<strong>The Gambit Plan</strong>\" or \"<strong>The Black Series</strong>\", the chapters of which may be reviewed in future games.\r\n  </p>\n<p>When we tested this game on some people, they became addicted to it\r\n because the rate of challenge and suspense was very high, according to their description.\r\n  </p>\n<p>One of the women said that she feels comfortable playing with this cube and does not know the reason for this happiness.\r\n Another person said that the game is strangely discharging his negative energy.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Another said he felt disconnected from the world whenever he played it.\r\n  </p>\n<p>It is not easy to get the result and pass the required stage if you do not have a lot of intelligence and a little luck!\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>A </strong><strong>Cube</strong> is neither a game nor a program. It is a program and a game at the same time.\r\n <strong>A Cube</strong> is a program to enhance the human skill in rotating shapes and bodies. Whereas, the skill of rotating shapes is one of the main skills in measuring human intelligence and intelligence.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>A Cube</strong> is a game because you are in it and through it you can spend many hours of entertainment, excitement, fun and challenge.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The most important thing that distinguishes this game is that it is new, innovative and unprecedented, so there is no game similar to this game as far as we know\r\n And because we built this game from scratch without quoting from any other game.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Everything in this game is innovatively designed and no similar game has ever been imitated.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Any similarity with any other game is just a matter of chance.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The challenge in this game is to be able to rotate the cubes in the least number of clicks and in the shortest time to win and move to the higher level.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The skill in this game is that you can rotate all the cubes in the fastest time and with the fewest clicks.\r\n  </p>\n<p>At the end of the game, you will involuntarily master the number system in the ancient cuneiform language without realizing it.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>The way of playing:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The gameplay is very easy and you only need to click on the cube.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Click on one of the cubes in front of you and the cube will rotate at a certain angle ... You have to turn the cube until the line drawn on it lights up. When you rotate, the whole set of cubes and light up all the lines on them, you will be shown the group of numbers hidden in that cube.\r\n  </p>\n<p>You can find out the required number through the cuneiform numbers near each number.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>The buttons</strong><strong>:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The buttons on the left let you change the angle of rotation of the cube.\r\n  </p>\n<p>On the right, there are buttons to move to the main menu, a button to pause the game, a button to restart the same level, a button to stop the sound of the music and the sound of the ticker, so you can focus better.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Help:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Many players will not be able to reach the final goal, in the specified time and with the number, of specific clicks. So we have made a <strong>help</strong> for you, which is the button at the top left, through which you can reduce 10 clicks, from the clicks that you clicked, if you continued watching the advertising movie to the end. You can also stop the time sometimes.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Finally</strong><strong>:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When you complete all stages of this game, your visualization skills will increase dramatically, especially spin, which is one of the most important skills in IQ.\r\n  </p>\n<p>When you complete all stages of this game, you will be ready to enter the next phase of training, which is to search for the \"hidden numbers\".\r\n  </p>\n<p>When you complete all stages of this game, you will have passed the first test of forming the \"Special Qualifications\" team that we are looking for.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Therefore, you have to wait for us in the next game, and the next training, to complete the refinement of your skills and prepare to enter the team \u2026\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0Team: <strong>\"&gt;&gt; ? &lt;&lt;\" .</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Good luck and goodbye\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T04:32:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5d/b5d43282cf0771cc91ff0632fff21db2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["AmmarSalimD"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
