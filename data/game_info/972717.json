Players will control a platform that can move left and right, and control the platform to bounce a small ball and destroy bricks of different shapes and colors at the top of the screen. Here's how the game is basically played:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nObjective: The player's goal is to destroy all the bricks at the top of the screen with the ball. Each level has different arrangements of bricks, and players need to try to eliminate them.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nControlling the platform: Players use a keyboard or similar controller to move the platform left and right so that the ball does not fall and continues to bounce.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMovement of the ball: When the game starts, the ball will be launched from the platform, constantly bouncing and destroying the bricks on top. If the player fails to catch the ball, it will fall, resulting in a loss of lives.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBrick elimination: When the ball hits the bricks, the bricks will gradually disappear. Different types of bricks may require multiple hits to be destroyed.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGame props: Various props will appear in the game, such as acceleration props, props that make the ball bigger or smaller, explosive props, etc. These props will affect the speed and ability of the ball, adding variety and challenge to the game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPassing levels and scoring: When the player successfully eliminates all bricks, he will pass the level and enter the next level. A player's score will be calculated based on factors such as the number of bricks destroyed and props used.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThrough constant challenges and changes in different levels, players can experience a game full of challenges and fun. They need to use platform controls flexibly to find the best strategy to destroy more bricks and get higher scores.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhen players successfully pass a specific level or reach a certain score, they will be rewarded with beautiful CG images.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-27T05:53:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/517/517ccc4c007ba46363af3f0212734c7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 291, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BBB Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Racing", "Casual"], "publishers": ["BBB Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
