You will need a recent version of either browser to run this game.</p>\n<p>The Machine is my\u00a0first published game so I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>The game features beautiful pixel art and animations with\u00a0376 hand drawn sprites. The sprites will scale well, (in other words,\u00a0the graphics will look best) at the common 16:9 resolutions. If the resolution is a multiple of 320x180 then the art and animations\u00a0will look best. This includes 1280x720, 1920x1080,\u00a03840x2160, etc.</p>\n<p>The Machine is about attention to detail. That lever looks like it opens the door to the exit but it really closes the door indefinitely (at least until you restart the level). You'll have to think carefully before taking action. The game is about understanding and reverse engineering The Machine to make your way to the exit.\u00a0The levels escalate in difficulty fast so you'll feel like a genius when you finish the last one.<br/></p>\n<p>The music from the Mac version\u00a0was disabled because it was taking a really long time to load. Also, progress can't be saved so if you want to save your progress, don't reload the page. This might be fixed in a few days but don't get your hopes up.</p>\n<p>If you have a Mac, run the Mac version.</p>\r\nControls\r\nRequired\r\n<ul><li>WASD or arrows to move</li><li>Space to activate things</li><li>R to restart a level</li></ul>\r\nOptional\r\n<ul><li>B to go back to the previous level</li><li>N to go to the next level (if you've completed it)</li><li>Start holding down L, type a number, stop holding down L to navigate to a particular level.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/213/2130a757a3321d1c7febb86b6822120f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Indi Kernick"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
