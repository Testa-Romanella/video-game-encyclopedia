{"id": 461813, "slug": "friskdice", "name": "FriskDice", "name_original": "FriskDice", "description": "Now you can play the game of world domination without the hassle and math of throwing the dice! IMPORTANT: This does NOT replace the game and you must own the game for the app to be useful. It only replaces the dice-throwing component.<br/><br/>Select My Turn when you are on offense and throw the number of dice that you wish. The defending player will then throw the appropriate number of dice, and the app will compute how many armies are lost on each side. Repeat until your turn is over. The other player should then select My Turn and proceed.<br/><br/>Select the color of each player in the settings. Complete head-to-head by placing your iPhone on the game-playing surface accessible to both players. Still takes up less room than dice flailing everywhere and knocking over your drink!<br/><br/>Developer Note: This app was written solely to help me learn development skills and techniques and to learn to interact with the App Store. No support is provided for this app. 99 cents means you get what you pay for!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-06T02:20:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21f/21f3e040f763799e1d9aa034cf3ce655.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Peter Goertzen"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": ["Peter Goertzen"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
