I only left the donate option if you really want!</strong></p>\n<p>Pixel Shooter is a simple 2D pixel based basketball game, this is the first game by Mythial Studios and will not be the last! Pixel Shooter consists of two game modes, Shootout and Freeplay. Freeplay is exactly how it sounds, you have unlimited swipes and slow motion for your enjoyment! Shootout is a little different, you only have one swipe, if you miss then you restart however if you get it in, you keep playing. Tell us your high score in the comments below!</p>\n\n<p>This game is my first ever game I have made, the development went from January to March pretty much full time, then from March to September on and off due to school exams. If you have downloaded it, then thank you for doing so. Have a nice day!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T04:32:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9fe/9fefbd58e6c643009cb497377e9d5bfd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Mythial Studios"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
