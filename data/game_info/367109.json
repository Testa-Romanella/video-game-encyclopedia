Recover long forgotten technologies and upgrades to unlock new abilities and save your home!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBut keep your solar meter constantly in mind.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAvoid dark places and stay in the light to avoid surprising shutdowns.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs the last salvation of a civilization you'll be sent on the mission to gather as much information and data as possible in order to <br/>\r\nprevent the decline of your homeland. Maybe you'll find a new home for your creators?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nE.R.S. is a planet full of different landscapes and complex cave systems. Often times you'll reach dead ends, whose overcoming will cost more<br/>\r\nthan mere force of arms. Always think of your energy supply while researching though. If the \"SU\" drops to 0, it means Game Over! Look for light sources and solar tanks to keep your systems up and running.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n--- Watch out, Speedrunners! ---<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWith the built-in timer function you'll have your current time always displayed on screen. <br/>\r\nBut watch out: in this game, sprinting costs valuable energy. So what do you prefer? <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWeak and fast or slow and strong? <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWill you find the route that'll lead you to that one run?<br/>\n<br/>\r\n--- The influence and inspiration--- <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis one is obvious: It's Super Metroid through and through. And I tried to reflect that in every pixel and every note played, without transforming into<br/>\r\nan uninspired copy.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5a/f5a4909a8a61d1b6fa559082e34f4f46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 241, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Inferno"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Inferno"], "esrb_rating": null}
