Today your dream has come true, as you both can now embark on an adventure in the wild plains of the Savannah, dressed to look like a horse.<br/><br/>Can you and your friend run free among your fellow species without falling over? Only your cooperation, synchronization, and determination will decide, as you saddle up, buck-le up, and run with a stable relationship.<br/><br/>Why the long face? Right now, this version is only playable with controllers and with a friend. We're working to update the game, and provide you with keyboard support, and single player for those who choose to ride off alone into the sunset.<br/><br/>TOJam 11<br/>The HueHueHues:<br/>Liam Clarke - Programmer<br/>Calvin Gaspar - Programmer<br/>Sean Browning - Graphic Artist<br/>Ethan Frankel - Graphic Artist<br/>Chris Goodfellow - Musician/Sound<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a46/a46ab0d7a299ba031001c67096b05c2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Shramper"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
