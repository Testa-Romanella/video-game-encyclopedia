Major Earth corporations ventured to space in order to prevent the decay of civilization, and the player takes command over the elite force to fight the aliens directly in space. Interceptor primarily is a space combat simulator. But the commander is still in charge of the region, so it would be players\u2019 responsibility to manage bases, resources, and finances. <br />\nThe game main screen is no longer shows the anthill of interconnected rooms of the X-COM headquarters. Now players see the map of the space section. Over the course of the first several missions, a new commander will be taught how to locate, intercept and destroy enemy ships. Every battle is played out as a flight simulator. Commander can purchase equipment, hire pilots and research technologies. It\u2019s the first X-COM game to include multiplayer, where players participate in the space combat.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1998-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-05T16:25:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/277/277d4b377e73caa25179d07706a06480.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.19, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 88, "owned": 1596, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 19}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 68, "suggestions_count": 319, "game_series_count": 10, "reviews_count": 68, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MicroProse Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["2K Games"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
