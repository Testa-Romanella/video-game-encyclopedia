{"id": 848152, "slug": "the-legend-bruised-bunny", "name": "The Legend (Bruised Bunny)", "name_original": "The Legend (Bruised Bunny)", "description": "<p><strong>The Legend\u00a0</strong>is a fantasy interactive fiction WIP that is character and choice driven, with the story being based on stories and legends about <em>El Dia De Los Muertos</em></p>\n<p>The story takes place in Diatos, a fictional city within Isla de Almas, a fictional island that draws inspiration from both modern and historical settings in Latin America. Much of it is based on Mexican culture, drawing from my own experience as someone with direct Mexican descent and a long list of Mexican ancestors.\r\n</p>\n<p>Your character is 20 years old and was born and raised in Diatos where speaking, seeing and just plain old communicating with spirits is considered a skill no different from reading or writing. Seen as a tradition that parents pass on to their children. Gender, sexual orientation, and race have no bearing on social position or class; instead only based on wealth, level of education, and connection to the spirits.\r\n</p>\n<p>The island is overseen by a coven of witches, with a <em>bruja blanca</em> overseeing all the choices, or at least that is what your character has been told, for the <em>white bruja</em> hasn\u2019t actually been seen for years. A new member of the coven is chosen as the need arises or whenever someone really talented in spirit communication is discovered. But unlike traditional governments, the position of <em>bruja blanca</em>\u00a0is not given through vote. Whenever a new <em>bruja blanca </em>needs to be chosen due to the passing of an old one, a new <em>bruja </em>is chosen by the spirits of the underworld to take over the mantel of <em>bruja blanca</em> with a vision: this is said to happen at random, as <em>brujas </em>in the past have ranged from the poorest farmer to the wealthiest noble.\r\n</p>\n<p>Their parents suddenly go missing and now a rumor that the previous <em>bruja blanca </em>of Diatos has been dead for 2 years, what else could go wrong? Well, your character who has never been able to even feel spirits now finds themselves supposedly the new <em>bruja blanca. </em>So they do what everyone would do under stress, follow a cute stray animal only to find themselves surrounded the next second by what look like skull people<em>. Normal right???</em>\n</p>\n<p>Unseen enemies at their heels and with the stress of leadership, will they succeed in finding their parents, having to deal with discoveries of their past that will try them, figuring out how to bring back spirits from the dead, and unlocking their spiritual capabilities? Or will they lead their small island to its end and fall to literal ghosts that will haunt them? \r\n</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the story, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to customize your mc\u2019s name, pronouns, sexual orientation, and their alebrije. You can also customize many parts of your mc\u2019s appearance: hair color, hair texture, hairstyle, skin color, height, and the choice of having a mix of mental and/or physical disabilities are all up to you and will be reflected in the story as well.\r\n</p>\n<p>Their ethnicity and culture are locked in as Hispanic/Latin American. That means the mc is also locked in as a person of color, as is in line with the setting - their specific race is up to the player to imagine.\r\n</p>\n<p>As for your mc\u2019s personality, there are twelve different character traits in total, six of which will be decided based on the choices you make in-game. This will subsequently change your mc\u2019s behavior during story and romance scenes.\r\n</p>\n<p>Depending on what your mc\u2019s sexual orientation is, the gender of the love interests will change accordingly to match that. There are four of them in total, and each love interest will have their own route which you will get to choose from at the end of the common route\r\n</p>\n<p>The guide; Mirabel/Macerio(m/f/nb)\r\n</p>\n<p>The mc\u2019s spirit guide is widely regarded to be a prodigy and expected to become the most powerful guide on the island. Very kind and understanding with a warm heart open to all.\r\n</p>\n<p>The Eagle warrior/knight; Latoya/Lautaro (m/nb)</p>\n<p>Was a well-renowned <em>cu\u0101uhtli</em>, known for many strategic victories in warding off attacks from both hostile nations and spirits. Calm and understanding, you would think nothing could rattle them until those dear to them are in danger or hurt.\r\n</p>\n<p>The Jaguar warrior/knight; Valeria/Valerio (m/nb)\r\n</p>\n<p>Once a peerless <em>oc\u0113l\u014dtl </em>in the Aztec Army, they died before being promoted and returning home. Their unrivaled fearlessness and exceptional strength always land them on the winning side of fights. Don\u2019t hide their fiery protectiveness of those they call friends and aren\u2019t scared to display affection\r\n</p>\n<p>The Mystery; Fem Name/Masc Name\u00a0(m/f/nb)\r\n</p>\n<p>A legendary mercenary when they were both alive and dead, now specializing in finding lost relatives in the confusing land of the forgotten and the leader of orphans who left the living realm too early. Can come off as prickly and closed-off until you get to know them better.\r\n</p>\n<p>The alebrije: Selectable Name<br/></p>\n<p>Your personal spirit guide thought to only exist in legends. They keep you from danger while also urging you toward adventure, ensuring that you live a life filled with everyday magic. Mischief will follow where they go\r\n</p>\n<p>La muerte:\r\n</p>\n<p>She has a wide variety of powers including love, prosperity, good health, fortune, healing, safe passage, protection against witchcraft, protection against assaults, and protection against violent death which will all prove very helpful at different points in the story. So make sure to get on her good side\u2026or don\u2019t might make things more interesting\r\n</p>\n<p>and more to be discovered as you go on!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T20:03:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/879/8798ce233476c1a3c014b8436b156c9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bruised Bunny"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
