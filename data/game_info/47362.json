There are two characters, and they move simultaneously, so the need for careful actions is significantly increased. The game is complicated due to the structured level, thanks to which each of your actions produces some other action, for example the second cube jumps on the laser. <br/><br/>You are waiting for an incredible adventure through the mazes of different levels, brick and block levels. Also there is an opportunity to return time and change the course of action in order to pass the level correctly. Your task is to collect all the diamonds that are in these labyrinths, labyrinths full of lasers and bayonets. Labyrinths, in which not everyone dare enter.
