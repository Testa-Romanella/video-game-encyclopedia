Your left stick moves your dot, but\u00a0your right stick allows your partner to temporarily see the walls of the maze around them, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>The game is meant to symbolize a simple truth; that the way we move through the world, and even the way we see the world, is shaped\u00a0by our connections with others.</p>\n<p>You will need two gamepad controllers, and two players;\u00a0<strong>Together</strong>\u00a0is played in local multiplayer co-op mode\u00a0only. It should take you and a partner\u00a0no more than ten minutes on average\u00a0to play through\u00a0one of the randomly-generated mazes.<br/></p>\n\n<p><em>This project was developed as a submission to the fourth Extra Credits Game Jam, with the theme of the jam being \"Connect.\"\u00a0</em><em>The following 'extra credit' challenges were attempted as a part of this project:</em></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Extra Open:</strong> The GMS2 project file and source code are included for download.</li><li><strong>\"Extra\"-Vert:</strong> The game requires two players to play in local co-op multiplayer.</li><li><strong>Extra Monochromatic:</strong> The game is in a minimalist black-and-white color scheme.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Thank you for your time, thank you to the community of other game jammers,\u00a0and thank you to Extra Credits for hosting this jam.\u00a0I hope you enjoy the game, and will spend time with many of the other excellent and inventive submissions as well!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-03T05:06:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c82/c82667cade254fbad211855b372bdcd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["roanarts"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
