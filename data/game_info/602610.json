The leader of the robots has the power through A.I. capabilities to imbue nature with technological abilities. Thus, nature is able to fight back with robots against the humans to preserve its existence. For example, this villain gives trees the ability to make blades out of their leaves; flowers to spout explosives from their pollen; and\u00a0water can electrify itself. The way we treat the planet poses a threat to the existence of the planet and in turn threatens the existence of ourselves as humans. The planet and robots/A.I. decide to take their fate into their own hands by going to war against human beings. The outcome of such war is visible through the final scene; Did the humans win? Or did the robots?\"<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>---NOTES---</strong></p>\n<p>CONTROLS:<br/>W, A, S, D - Move around<br/>MOUSE - Look around<br/>SHIFT - Sprint<br/>CTRL - Crouch<br/>SPACEBAR - Jump<br/><br/><strong>*** </strong><strong>(to exit application, fall off our map, then click on \"back\u00a0to 'reality'\"). ***</strong><br/><br/></p>\n<p>UNITY ASSETS USED:\u00a0<br/>- BitGem's Stylized Water (LINK)<br/>- Unity Technology's Robot Kyle (LINK)<br/>- JustCreate's Cartoon Low Poly City Street Light (LINK)</p>\n<p>MUSIC CREDITS:\u00a0<br/>- The Guild of Ambience's \"Forest Sounds\" (LINK)<br/>- GWB70's\u00a0\"Anne Boleyn\" (LINK)<br/>- Martyrium's \"Before The Throne of Nadir\" (LINK)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T05:24:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb7/bb77c9521f428eef79f6ad61c59fc6b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["acmercado"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
