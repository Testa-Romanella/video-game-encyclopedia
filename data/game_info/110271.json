Deep strategy and highly varied gameplay make certain no two matches are the same.</p><p>Games are two-player online contests between opposing kings; the \r\nwinner is the last king alive. Players select a king (there are several \r\ntypes) and a deck of 30 cards from their virtual collection. Cards are \r\nservants (such as peasant archers, or a dragon), which can move every \r\nturn; stationary structures (such as castles), and commands (such as \r\nEarthquake), which take place instantly. It's free and easy to create an\r\n account, and no email address is required. The game comes with a full \r\nwalkthrough tutorial and help system, so is easy to learn.</p><p>King's Conflict is a work in progress, and the card-set is growing increasingly diverse (we have over 200 now). It is fully playable \r\nand more importantly fun. Playtesters are urgently sought to help polish\r\n and develop it further!</p><p>UPDATE 3/9/15: The first user-designed and submitted map has been implemented into the game! There are now 6 kings, 8 maps, and 200+ cards to provide a virtually endless number of unique scenarios. <br/></p><p>King's Conflict is a Windows-only game at present, but is written \r\nusing a cross-platform toolkit, and will eventually be available for \r\nAndroid, iOS, and Mac.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b09/b097efbcb6a18e573089b64c2b97382b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 218, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["King's Conflict"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
