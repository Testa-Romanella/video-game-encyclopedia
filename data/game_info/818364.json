The roll depends on your current level. Level up between stages.</p>\n<p>Level 1 - D1 - only ever rolls 1</p>\n<p>Level 2 - D2 - rolls between 1 and 2</p>\n<p>Level 3 - D4 - rolls between 2 and 4</p>\n<p>Level 4 - D6 - rolls between 3 and 6</p>\n<p>Level 5 - D10 - rolls between 6 and 10</p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> - The final build we submitted has some unity events bugged. This causes the enemies to never move and the dicerolls to be stuck on a random value. The submitted version also gives each dice resource x20 at the start, proper values should be D2 x10, D4 x6, D6 x2 and D10 x0. This sadly makes an integral part of the game loop inacessible.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T09:42:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad6/ad6eb45b022a5844cf1d267317900d7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dmitrijBerg", "GeSoFe", "Begoniia", "Mr.Mark"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
