With fast paced action, plenty of blood-n-guns and more demons than you can shake a shotgun at, you will be truly tested as you attempt to beat Satan's trials in order to win your soul back and get a ticket home.<br/><br/>Unleash Hell upon waves of demons in hellish arena-style environments that evolve as you progress. Face Overlords in Boss Battles as you work your way through the ranks until you ultimately face Satan in a battle for your soul. Unlock the arsenal from hell to devastate everything Satan throws at you. <br/><br/>Abilities, Weapons and Player Skills can be upgraded in the Hell Shop between waves, if you survive, to become the ultimate soul-less killing machine. <br/>Combine \"Totems\" with abilities to create even more terrifying power and send those demons and their overlords back to the pits of hell where they belong. <br/><br/>An original pulse pounding Heavy Metal soundtrack will provide the background for all the demon slaying you will be doing as you fight your way deeper and deeper into Hell.<br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Arena style environments designed for fast and furious gun play that evolve as you progress.<br/></li><li>Boss Battles against Satan's Overlords.<br/></li><li>9 weapons of destruction you can unlock.<br/></li><li>Character, Weapons and Abilities can be upgraded in the \"Hell Shop\" between waves with the points you earn when completing a wave.<br/></li><li>\"Totems\" the player can summon to enhance their abilities or give beneficial buffs.<br/></li><li>Player Abilities and Ability Pickups that can be combined with Totems to unleash devastating power.<br/></li><li>Two Game Modes: \"Main Mode\" and \"Endless Mode\" (Endless Mode must be Unlocked to play)<br/></li><li>Stats Tracking (Main Mode and Endless Mode)<br/></li><li>Online leader boards - Compete with the world and your friends to be the top demon slayer<br/></li><li>33 Achievements</li></ul><br/>Think you have what it takes?<br/>Then prove it.<br/>Hell awaits.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca3/ca30b6c869d3444662cad6cd85c8dc08.jpg", "website": "http://www.nolightgames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 244, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NoLight Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["NoLight Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
