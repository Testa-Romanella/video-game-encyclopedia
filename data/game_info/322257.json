Its more challenging than it first seems</p>\n\n<p>Developer's note: This is a game I made for fun and to practice my game development skills as certain circumstances are preventing me from making this my job. Usually I don't update my games after I first post them but for this I hope keep adding more to it till it becomes more professional. I especially hope to add more game modes so that I can explore all the different ways I can modify the classic tic tac toe game.</p>\n<p>Want to help me improve this project? I'd love to hear your feedback here:\u00a0https://forms.gle/TQR3yo7YxXV47SCZ6</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-24T09:01:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b74/b74d91c2c68ae7b10f318d66100876cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Random Thoughts"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
