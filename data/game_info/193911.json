You cut into the waiting line to stand with your pal, a sentient vacuum cleaner called Mr Chmod. By \"outside\", you mean under the life bubble where there's wholesome oxygen, but no freaking sunlight. You oversleep a lot.</p>\n<p>Because Phobos will break up into rubble within months, everyone in the colony is evacuating, and in honor of the occassion, the club has got a clone of president\u00a0<em>William Howard Taft</em>\u00a0to make a speech. Cloning has gone mainstream, and this is the social event of the year. You don't want to miss it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f47/f47784df981735cd35aee260e99545ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["joltcountry"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
