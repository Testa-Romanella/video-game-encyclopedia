This would starve your nation and those trading further south.<br/></p>\n<p>But being in the position where you control the military, who's records must be made public, you need to let your people know everything even if it means the enemy knows too.</p>\n<p>Can you keep your people safe and on your side while winning a war?</p>\n\n<p>This project is my final exam for my final year in university.\r\n</p>\n<p>The real news is a combination light strategy and arcade-action game where you manage a newspaper as a military leader to bolster your defense against an opposing nation. This project was mainly intended to combine contrasting gameplay styles and have a story with more serious themes but without it impacting gameplay. So, the gameplay is largely representational and this game is here to show off my skills mainly in the area of programming and design but also trying my hand at art, sound and writing.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T13:35:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd2/fd261b326d9d00c4c5bd5806820f0c04.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bowlerk"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
