It's THE HORDE!", "description": "At the end of each season, the horde will come, ravenous in hunger.\r\n<p>In\u00a0<em>Oh No! It's THE HORDE</em><em>!,\u00a0</em>you take control of a wayward lad named Sir Chauncey, who has been tasked by the king to defend a town in the Toshim Plains. You have a few turns to orient yourself, build, and hire before hordelings begin to attack the village. If the hordelings are successful-- if all of the villagers are killed-- your life is forfeit.\r\n</p>\n<p>To defend the town from the ever-growing horde, you must build walls and traps, hire mercenaries, and train your skills. However, these things aren't free. You will need to defend your townsfolk and their possessions to earn enough gold.\r\n</p>\n<p>The king isn't altruistic. His only interest in the town is the tax money that it provides- so you will need to set aside enough gold to pay your taxes each year, or you may find yourself wishing The Horde had gotten you.</p><p><strong><em>Note: Windows Defender will warn about an unsigned EXE.
