Learn, buy completely unnecessary things for the student, meet with lol, and do what you want. Isn't that what everyone wanted in school years: complete freedom of action that will not be limited by law, adults and other factors?\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay elements:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>RPG system presented in the game itself will be developed before release. It will be added perks, appearance features, as well as neutral skills needed to overcome any difficult situations or accelerate the pumping of other elements. In other words, this game is a sandbox, completely tied to the RPG system, where there will be dialogues, local events, as well as global events, lasting five hours one.</p>\n<p><strong>Our plan:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Fully implement the game in the layout, written in the tab \"gameplay elements\", complete replayability, as well as well-remembered stories in a good way. Each event is different from each other, so in addition to this RPG system will fully affect the outcome of these events.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you are passionate about the project or you want to help something, then support us on patreon. All your money will go to the game: artists, writers, writers, and translators.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T05:35:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d7/1d7ca41c306485ec82f292f09c456a09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KaitoSi11"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
