{"id": 854735, "slug": "coco-cozy-coffee", "name": "CoCo: Cozy Coffee", "name_original": "CoCo: Cozy Coffee", "description": "CoCo : Cozy Coffee\r\n<p>It is your first day in your very own coffee shop set in a fantasy world.</p>\n<p>Your only goal is to make the best drinks you possibly can and please your customers!</p>\n<p>Note: This game has minimal amount of directions on how things work.</p>\n<p>This is meant to leave the thinking to the player rather than explaining everything. (Actually, we didn't have time to make things obvious enough)</p>\n<p>But fret not, we have compiled a How to play below describing each moment of the game.</p>\n<p>You can skip this if you just want to dive in and try your hand at our game!</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Pick out the ingredients you like for your drinks; but remember!</p>\n<p>You can always add extra or less of these ingredients when serving them to your customers; but do it on your own risk! You don't get extra money for just using extra ingredients!</p>\n<p>Customers can be allergic to ingredients and will refuse to pay if you try to serve a drink including one of those ingredients.</p>\n<p>Customers have likes and dislikes, and can be either super strict or not at all.</p>\n<p>At end of each day, the cost of the used ingredients will be calculated and redacted from any revenue.</p>\n<p>On every 5th day you have a $50 rent to pay. If you can't afford it, you will go bankrupt.</p>\n<p>Every drink you have on your menu will have a 25% margin profit based on the cost of the ingredients used.</p>\n<p>In this world, customers don't care about prices.</p>\n<p>So if you make a drink with a lot of ingredients, it will sell for more but it will cost more too. It will also take longer to make.</p>\n<p>The more drinks you sell, the more money you will earn.</p>\r\nThere are mainly two phases in the game.\r\n1. Preparation Phase (4:00 AM to 9:00 AM)\r\n<p>First you need to make sure you have at least one item on the menu.<br/></p>\n<p>You can create new items and\u00a0set a name. Prices are decided based on ingredient use.</p>\r\n2. Shop is open (9:00 AM to 20:00 PM)\r\n<p> While the shop is open, you interact with customers to increase your relationship with them.</p>\n<p> But don't spend too much time chit chatting; otherwise you wont have time to serve drinks!</p>\n<p> You always start mixing drinks by asking the customer what they want; a dialogue option colored in yellow.</p>\n<p> Choose your ingredients and when ready; use one of the tools to finalize the drink. The Blender or The Coffee Machine.</p>\n<p> Make sure your customers are happy, they will tip you for it!</p>\r\nFAQ\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>How do I serve a drink to my customers?</strong></p>\n<ul><li>You first select ingredients you want to have in your drink.\r\n</li><li>After you have selected all the ingredients you want to use press on either the Blender to make a smoothie or the Coffee Maker to make a coffee.\r\n</li><li>If you make a wrong decision with the ingredients you can press on the trash can, this will remove the last added ingredient but you still have to pay for the ingredient.\r\n</li><li>If you use the trash can after using any of the tools, the whole drink is with all its ingredients are discarded.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>I can make a coffee without actually putting coffee in?</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Yes! A coffee in this game is actually both an ingredient and\u00a0a method of how the drink was created. Using the Blender will make a smoothie, using the coffee machine will make a coffee, regardless of ingredients used.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>How do I remember what a customer wants?</strong></p>\n<ul><li>When creating your recipes, make sure to name them in a way that is easy to remember. Ex: 2 coffee beans, name it Espresso or 2x Coffee.\r\n</li><li>Another tip is to always name your drink with either \"smoothie\" or \"coffee\" to hint what tool you need to use for making it.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>How can I increase the tip received from the customers?</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The higher relationship status you have with your customer, the higher chance of them tipping.\r\n</li><li>A very strict customer will almost always tip if you have done their drink to their likings. Just following the recipe in those cases can be enough.\r\n</li><li>If you know what the customer likes, adding extra of the ingredient that ingredient can make them happy.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>How do i know if a customer is strict or not?</strong></p>\n<ul><li>You dont. It's decided upon start of the game. And never told to the player. You will however notice that they will often refuse to pay if they don't like the ingredients.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>I just saw a -$50 rent all of a sudden, what is this?</strong></p>\n<ul><li>At the end of every 5th day you have rent to pay a $50 rent. Running a fantasy coffee shop is expensive.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T09:08:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eda/eda4b6ec7e55d71d1b49ca8cc53809c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["zerratar", "FreakyFeet", "chavalo"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
