The theme of the jam was \"Out of Control\" and the time limit was 48h.</p>\n<p>The game is an anti-infiltration game where the goal is to be seen by as many security guards as possible, trigger every alarm you can and spread \u00a0chaos everywhere you can.<br/></p><p>If you're stuck because of a bug that went unresolved, press Space at any time to restart the current level.<br/></p>\n<p>I made the game entirely alone using GameMaker Studio 2 as my engine, paint.net for the graphic assets. The sounds were found on freesound.org. The font is from Chaos Fonts.<br/></p>\n<p>Hope you'll have fun! :)<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T13:11:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15b/15b96ffac8cec159d22d4db27df0e00a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Five Halves"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
