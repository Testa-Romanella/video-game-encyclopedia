It's you on a race against time to save the woman you love before Death takes full hold of her soul.</p>\n<p>Battle the ghosts of your past mistakes as you venture through the mazes of the dead. You'll have to use your sword, magic, and wits to claw your way to the final encounter where success means coming home with your family whole and failure means leaving your daughter an orphan.</p>\n\n<p>----</p>\n<p>The game is not complete. This is a short demo to be used more as a proof of concept for the story.\u00a0Many features of gameplay couldn't be completed and it does have some bugs. Please don't press the D-Pad when talking to characters. Hit A to advance. It will freeze the game if you touch the D-Pad during text boxes. I apologize for not fixing the glitch in time. Have fun, and enjoy the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-21T03:46:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/832/8321ac5ec1d3859f687cc97005e1faff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cpt-kite"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
