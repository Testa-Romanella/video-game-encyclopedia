It's the first time I participate in a game jam and it was a really fun experience creating this game in so little time. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>The game<br/></strong></p>\n<p>In the game, you are a white cube with a gun. Red cubes are spawning and you have to shoot them to gather points and to avoid them so you don't end up dragged in the spikes at the bottom. The catch is that the room you are in is shrinking until it becomes like a small tunnel, hence the \"Running out of space\" theme of the jam.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/328/3288052f4004b0df30a16f34bb4ea933.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["emy149"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
