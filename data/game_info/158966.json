Be careful though, it was once said that while Martin Luther was walking about, he was almost struck by lightning. After almost being struck by lightning Martin Luther chose to become a monk, and this eventually led to a major reform of the medieval church.<br/><br/>As you play through the game you will get to read Martin Luther's Nintey-five Theses, and have a fun time doing it!<br/><br/>Special thanks to:<br/>Coalition of Lutherans Advancing in Mission (CLAIM)\u00a0<br/>Thrivent Financial for Lutherans<br/>Calvary Lutheran Church of Mt.
