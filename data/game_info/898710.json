It has working health and infinitely replay able without exiting the game.<br/><br/>3 precreated assets were used and taken from the Unity asset store which you can find here, here, and here.\u00a0 Everything else was created from me and the base XR toolkit in Unity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tested on Oculus Quest, there might be compatibility issues on other headsets.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy and thanks for stopping by!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T08:36:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1bd/1bdaad60b9e2d25a90d8644eb2a591b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Felix Amari"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
