He loved the Chrome dino runner game and asked me to make him the same kind of game but with a car - he loves cars. After creating a prototype, I let it sleep for a fews years, I was too busy with my job and life.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A few weeks ago, for many reasons, I decided to restart doing game development. I found this little prototype I had made, it was a perfect tiny project to start with, in order to prove myself I could release something.</p>\n<p>But I wanted to add a twist to it. A message for my kid.\u00a0This is the result. It ain't perfect. But it's a start.</p>\n<p>To get news about this game and other future projects, follow me on twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/Alastor_Games</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Music: Meyd\u00e4n /\u00a0https://meydan.bandcamp.com\u00a0<br/>Produced by Alastor Games</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T05:58:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e79/e797ad882d6d032624e31cb4d824bde7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alastor Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
