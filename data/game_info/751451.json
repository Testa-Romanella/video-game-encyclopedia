It uses a heuristic learning algorithm (learn by doing) to teach a computer to play the game by playing it repeatedly until it has learned only the winning paths.\r\n</p>\n<p>The goal of each player is to advance one of their pawns to the opposite end of the board or to prevent the other player from moving. Since it is a two-player perfect-information game, there is always a perfect strategy for one of the players, meaning that the game always ends in a win for one player or the other.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T08:06:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9c/d9c979e893f3d110de5ec029974069f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Overseek"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
