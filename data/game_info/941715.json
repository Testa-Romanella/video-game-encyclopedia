He must travel through Fish Park, the Wasteland, the Waterway, Nakatomi Plaza, and River Trout, facing mutated predators and collecting cans along the way. Trout McClaine meets other creatures searching for the cure and fights off dangerous predators with his skills and abilities. In the final level, he battles a massive mutated catfish to collect the final cans of the cure he needs. Will Trout McClaine succeed in finding the cure and saving his life?<br/><br/><strong>LORE</strong><br/><br/></p>\n<p>Trout McClaine was a trout living in a world that had been devastated by an unknown disaster. The waterways and oceans were polluted and filled with radiation, and many of the creatures that had survived the disaster had become mutated, dangerous beasts that roamed the land. He lived in a polluted river that was once a thriving ecosystem but was now barely able to sustain life. <br/><br/>One day, Trout McClaine became sick. His scales were discolored, and his fins were sluggish. He knew that he needed a cure, but he had no idea where to find it. He asked the other fish in the river, but none of them knew where to find the cure either. It seemed like all hope was lost. <br/><br/>Then, one day, he overheard some animals talking about a cure that could be found on the other side of the world. The animals didn't know much about it, but they had heard rumors that it could cure anything. Trout McClaine knew that this was his only hope, so he set out on a dangerous journey to find the cure. <br/><br/>Trout McClaine's journey began in Fish Park, a once-beautiful park that was now overrun with mutated predators. The park was filled with obstacles, including spiked walls and dangerous predators. He had to use all of his skills and abilities to dodge jaws and claws, swim against strong currents, and navigate the treacherous terrain.<br/><br/> After successfully completing the first level, Trout McClaine traveled to the Wasteland, a desolate and dangerous place that was once a bustling city. Here, he encountered mutated rats and roaches, as well as other dangerous predators that he had never seen before. Trout McClaine had to use all of his cunning and strength to fight his way through the Wasteland and collect the cans he needed to make the cure.<br/><br/> In the Waterway, Finley swam through narrow channels filled with toxic sludge. The water was thick and murky, and the smell was overpowering. Trout McClaine encountered giant leeches and mutated snakes, but he persevered and collected the cans he needed to make the cure. <br/><br/>The fourth level took Trout McClaine to Nakatomi Plaza, a once-grand skyscraper that was now a ruin. The building was home to some of the most dangerous mutated animals, including radioactive bats and spiders. He fought his way through the building, battling his way to the top to collect the cans he needed to make the cure.<br/><br/> Finally, Trout McClaine reached the last level, River Trout. This was where the boss awaited him, a massive mutated catfish with teeth like knives. He fought the catfish with all his might, but it was a tough battle. However, in the end, Finley emerged victorious, collecting the final cans of the cure he needed. <br/><br/>With the cure in hand, Trout McClaine returned to his home in the polluted river, cured of his sickness. He knew that there were many other animals out there that needed the cure too, and he vowed to continue his fight against the mutated animals, one can at a time. Trout McClaine became a hero among the animals in his world, inspiring them to fight back against the destruction and devastation that had been brought upon their world.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T10:20:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30f/30f4a01b8626d05838df01a6cbd1657d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Heras Revenge"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
