Still very much a work in progress.</em></p>\n<p>Scription is a rogue-like that focuses largely on determining the meaning of a procedurally generated set of glyphs. At the moment, your only obstacle is the environment you are wandering through -- heat and cold can eventually cause your death. Some more survival mechanics are likely to find their way into the game over time, as well as some combat.</p>\n<p>The current version is quite small and short, but you can explore and interact with things, and you should be able to successfully complete an adventure with a bit of good luck.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T06:28:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85d/85d9e4b71d4fc50ef06ea3be7f5a1be7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Spinfoam Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
