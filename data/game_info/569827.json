A new form fo sound corrupted every machine\u00a0with artifical intelligence, which led to them turning against their creators.</p>\n<p>Only the weapons created by the machines are strong enough to destroy them, so humanity - in a last ditch effort - created a device that manipulates the received sound frequenzy of surrounding objects, which lets them be utilized against the enemy. But it has to be used with care because the weaponry is still extremly lethal to human beings.</p>\n<p>Waveform 2.0 is a complete redesign of\u00a0Waveform 1.0. While Waveform 1.0 featured melee combat and a loose interpretation of the frequenzy manipulation device,\u00a0Waveform 2.0 scrapped its combat\u00a0entirely and put more emphasis on manipulating the environment in favour of the player as well as\u00a0puzzle solving while trying to avoid dangerous environmental hazards.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Philipp Forstner (me) - AI programmer/designer, Gameplay programmer</p>\n<p>Alexander Graf - Gameplay programmer</p>\n<p>Daniel Flockert - Gameplay programmer</p>\n<p>Thomas F\u00fcrst - 3D Environment Artist, Texturing, FMOD</p>\n<p>Philipp Labner - 3D Art, Texturing, Enemy design, Lore</p>\n<p>Adin Besic - Sound design, Soundtrack, FMOD</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T07:23:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b99/b997f42d97bc0671d6fbc42144c8d669.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 183, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["itsPhil"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
