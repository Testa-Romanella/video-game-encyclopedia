You've always been a master of monsters, a builder of dungeons, and a hunter of heroes. For many years, you've competed with other Bosses in contests of prowess and villainy. Now it's time to emerge from the underworld. It's time to shape a new land and bend it to your will. It's time to claim your crown as the ultimate OVERBOSS!\n<br/><br/>\n<br/>\nEach turn, you'll draft one tile and token set from the Market. Place the tile in an open spot of your map. Every terrain type is scored differently!\nSwamps get Power points for being adjacent to coasts and other Swamps. Graveyards give a big bonus to whoever collects the most, while Forests increase in Power as you collect more.\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/>\nEvery tile comes with a token. If it's a monster or Miniboss token, put it on top of an open terrain tile. A monster with a matching icon scores a bonus point, and \"bands\" of monsters - lines of two or more in a row - give bigger bonuses.\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/>\nAs you fill your map, use Portals to move your Monsters and Minibosses. Collect Crystals to multiply your power. With smart placement and clever combos, you can build a truly powerful map. At the end of the game, the player with the highest score is crowned OVERBOSS!\n<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T06:54:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/693/693bbbef4b64f3b80b4c895444459dc3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["TavroxGames", "Brotherwise Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Goblinz Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
