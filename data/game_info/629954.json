The only controller you need is your keyboard, and you can press the spacebar at any time to repeat the last set of instructions in case you miss them.<br/></p>\n<p>This is my entry to the\u00a0Inclusivity Game Jam by Backtrace, made in under 48 hours. The two themes were Inclusivity and \"find it, fix it\".\u00a0 I thought it could be interesting to mix these together by creating a repair-themed game that was playable by folks with visual impairments who might have difficulties with other types of puzzle games. Sadly, the user still has to use the mouse to give the game initial focus on the web version, but I couldn't find a way around that.<br/></p>\n<p>That said, I did still try to add a little pizzazz to the visuals since it's a grading category but none of it's necessary to finish the game.</p>\n<p>If I had some more time I'd like to add more levels and see what other mechanics I could add in without it becoming a mess, but I'm pretty proud of how it turned out! Having to design around not being able to use visual cues was an interesting challenge and led me to some neat design choices that I don't think I would have come up with otherwise.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it, please let me know what you think! Oh, and you can throw an exception to test out my Backtrace integration by hitting the Escape key in the Windows or Linux versions (doesn't work on the web embed)</p>\n<p>-------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Made by Kyle (me@kylebyte.com)</p>\n<p>Backtrace instance:\u00a0https://kylebyte.sp.backtrace.io/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T15:06:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/509/509e13628c28feade83baffb3d03a111.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["kylebyte"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
