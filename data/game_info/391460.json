{"id": 391460, "slug": "exotic", "name": "Exotic (itch)", "name_original": "Exotic (itch)", "description": "<p>A work in progress game where one will be able to complete many quests to unlock more of the world and create many things. Currently, a player can test out and find bugs in an alpha version where many of the basic mechanics have been implemented but not thoroughly tested.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also planned: Animals that will roam the world, a main town, currency, resource automation.</p>\n<p>I also ask, since this is an early, very buggy version, that you fill out this form to report any issues or bugs you find\u00a0within the game or the download.</p>\n<p>This game is made with the Unity game engine.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Learning to play is simple. WASD or arrow keys to move. Use scroll wheel to switch tools. The axe and pickaxe break things in the world by left-clicking them. The hoe plows the ground for cultivation and the hammer allows you to build buildings that can craft more complex resources. Press \"E\" to open your inventory and click on any one of the slots to see what you can do with that item.</p>\n<p><strong>CURRENT KNOWN ISSUES:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The recipe for a windmill requires wool which is not obtainable at this time. Use the cheat key \"C\" to get some when you want the windmill.</li><li>There is an issue with the menu that slides in when you want to interact with a slot. If you were to click the \"Never mind\" button in this glitch, (I haven't found the cause yet) the animation will loop and the menu won't close.\u00a0The easiest way to fix this is to click on another slot that has an item in it\u00a0and click \"Never mind\". Yes, I am aware that \"Never mind\" is two words. That will be fixed next update.</li><li>When using a building to craft, if the UI is over another building or thing you can interact with, it will interact with the thing under the UI instead of interacting with the UI. I recommend placing your buildings four spots away from each other horizontally and/or two space vertically.</li></ul>\n<p>All of the issues above are being fixed for the future so if you have any tips or ways to fix them, send them in with a bug report.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-18T01:53:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f0f/f0ffd5c444e6152a1a0f6eb7c84e85f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["redpanda577"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
