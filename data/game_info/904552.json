The gameplay consists of walking around and interacting with objects/people.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You play as Fenner, a boy going to an end-of-summer going away party for his senior class. He hasn't seen his childhood friend in a while, and he's looking forward to seeing her there.</p>\n<p>Please enjoy, and the biggest thank you EVER for playing :) To make these experiences for other people is a dream come true, and I can't wait to see what's next &lt;3</p>\n\n<p><em>(The game is totally free! When you go to download, you can press \"no thanks, just take me to the download\" and it'll give you the game for free! (unless u wanna donate &lt;3))</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>Also, I would highly recommend\u00a0getting the window sized/positioned how you'd like before you proceed\u00a0past the main menu. Moving the window while playing will pause the visuals but not the audio, so it might throw cutscenes off! (I couldn't figure out how to fix this, but I'll keep this in mind for the next game I\u00a0make!)</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T06:06:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c04/c04191024c64c24ccd6d292135e91126.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["windfollowing"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
