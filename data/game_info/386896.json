The game attempts to subvert some of the damsel-in distress tropes of the traditional story and reflect on a darker truth. In this game, Little Red has agency while she faces a threat that\u2019s closer to home than the original. It\u2019s a spooky journey into the woods and I hope you enjoy the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>=====</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-28T04:28:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/486/486cacdad78a6e3620c6edccb7d62b35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Mike Ren"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
