This game mixes  exploration and beat-em-up with a unique art style in a procedural world, created for GameDevUnlocked Game Jam #2  with the theme 'Lost &amp; found.

It will be included in future updates along with different enemies, weapons and a <strong>hover bike</strong>. Most of these were already half finished, but had to be cut due to the time constraints.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T05:36:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40f/40f6530f62f102c85fc30a670cb97dac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gypynkt"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
