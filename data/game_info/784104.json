{"id": 784104, "slug": "train-outbreak", "name": "Train Outbreak", "name_original": "Train Outbreak", "description": "<p>On a cold summer evening, you board a train with no passengers or destination. The alien Zenoid creatures have mysteriously invaded, killing every passenger in sight and destroying the furniture. With nothing but a pistol in your hands, you have no choice but to survive the most dangerous train ride yet. Kill off the Zenoids before the outbreak spreads, and reach the end of the train.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>[DISCLAIMER] </strong>Due to time constraints, we did not have the chance to properly fix most of the bugs which occur during gameplay. We apologize if you run into any bugs. Please let us know if you run into them. The scope of our project had to be significantly cut too, so we also apologize for our demo being so short. Please view this as more of a proof-of-concept for a much larger game. A future build with more levels will be released soon.\u00a0Thank you :)</p>\r\nOFF THE RAILS GAMES DEVELOPMENT TEAM:\r\n<ul><li><strong>David Marshall</strong> -\u00a0 Producer, Level Designer,\u00a0Technical Rigger, Game Designer</li><li><strong>Tina Allen</strong> -\u00a0Lead General, Audio &amp; Gameplay Programmer</li><li><strong>Elijah Green</strong>-\u00a0Music Composer &amp; Sound Designer</li><li><strong>Sean Ramirez</strong> - Concept Artist, 3D Artist</li><li><strong>Zach Shirikjian </strong>-\u00a0UI Designer, UI Programmer, Audio Programmer, Systems Designer, Source Control Specialist</li><li><strong>Kalynn Vazquez</strong> -\u00a0Lead 3D Artist, UV/Texture Artist</li><li><strong>Mike West</strong> -\u00a0Lead Animator</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T09:05:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c9/0c981359d8a71787f5eff9bfd4137ab0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zach Shirikjian"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
