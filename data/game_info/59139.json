Play one of two S.E.A. agents - Billy Bishop or Sheila Crawford - as you utilise your specialist espionage skills and hi-tech equipment to overcome an intelligent and heavily-armed enemy.<br />\nThis action-packed adventure delivers all the hi-octane thrills and heart-stopping suspense of a big screen spy movie. Capture 3D images of anyone you meet with your 3DA camera to process into full-body disguises. You&#39;ll be able to walk right past the &#39;impenetrable&#39; terrorist security.<br />\nWhen not incognito, use your stealth suit to blend into the environment or stick to the ceiling with your Spider-Grips. If things get physical, use hand-to-hand combat, silenced weaponry, shock guns or flares to escape your would-be captors and return to the shadows. Good luck.</p>", "metacritic": 61, "released": "2003-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-01T06:51:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/128/128ad57783dd1c64f5c3cf12a9f7d6e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 3, "toplay": 10, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 466, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Access Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Sammy Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
