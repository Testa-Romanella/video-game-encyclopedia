The goal is to traverse the map, discover the 4 different challenges to find the 4 different elements, and escape. If you get caught by the other characters, touch any fire, or drink the wrong drink the game restarts. I\u00a0used to Blender to make the first person character and AI and used Unreal Marketplace assets to build the map and other models.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Below I\u00a0explain how I\u00a0meet all of the requirements for my BSU Game Development class assignment. All requirements can also be seen if playing the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>1. Custom Modeled Mesh</p>\n<ul><li>I have an animated first person character and AI (walk, run, and idle)</li><li>The character has 11 bones</li><li>I used a Blend Space to make a smooth transition between the 3 animations dependent on speed of the character.</li></ul>\n<p>2. Polish</p>\n<ul><li>The game is very linear with checkpoints along the way to help guide the player. Everything fades in and out and is not sudden.</li><li>Menus and HUD animations fade in and out.</li><li>Although sometimes buggy with the AI, the character animations are all smooth, including the elements and platforms moving around.</li><li>I built the game using the same asset pack and attempted to make the other objects resemble that same style.</li><li>The asset pack came with great lighting and sound options that are also present.</li></ul>\n<p>3. Fun or enjoyment</p>\n<ul><li>The theme was 4 elements and all of the challenges somewhat resemble those elements and the goal is to collect all 4.</li><li>If you follow the exclamation points and accept the theme\u00a0the story makes sense.\u00a0</li><li>Some of the challenges have surprises if you fall down as well as somewhat of a riddle/puzzle\u00a0to get the water element.</li><li>The game is relatively difficult to complete at least in one life so I believe there is some replayability to get better and try in one life.</li><li>I would hope that someone would recommend it. At least some of us in the class to become intrigued.\u00a0\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>4.
