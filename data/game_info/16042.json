That means that death is permanent. Upon death, the players lose all their items, yet it is still possible to retrieve them if you find a way to the spot you died on. The main objective of each level is to find an exit off of it.</p>\n<p>The game has no saving system whatsoever. The players have to play through the game in one sitting. There are more enemies on each level with them being much tougher. The players will have to win a boss fight every five levels. After defeating a boss, a new world biom is unlocked. Each boss is different, has more health and does more damage upon hitting the player.</p>\n<p>It is possible to collect gold and use it to purchase several character upgrades, such as increased health, damage multipliers and much more. The game also features a leaderboard that logs how much levels did the player pass, how much gold did they gather, and how much time did it take them to do so. </p>\n<p>Your arsenal is not large, as the only things you can get through your enemies are your ax, your bow, and your whip.</p>\n<h3>Controversy</h3>\n<p>The game was pulled off Steam for violating copyright law, because of the usage of the open-source code of another game Spelunky and copying another game called Caveblazers, but on a different engine.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:44:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b7/9b7a0b5098e32bfe030115f17df363ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 1.8, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 49, "owned": 1264, "beaten": 3, "dropped": 15}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 56, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 56, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Unika Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Unika Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
