Developer\u2019s Game Description<br/>\n<br/>\r\n Hello, we\u2019re SHB Soft.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n Flying Slime! is a 2D Platform Game that moves Slime to  the target point through mouse manipulation(Drag the mouse like a bow and fire). <br/>\r\n It can be played in Windows and only supports single play.<br/>\r\n In Flying Slime! we tried to provide users with cute pixel graphics and tranquil sound. <br/>\r\n But unlike the cute image, it is a difficult game and requires high concentration and control. <br/>\r\n Even users who are confident in mouse control will find it difficult, and later in the game, they will start to feel pain their fingers. <br/>\r\n We tried to provide users with a difficult challenge while also providing them with a high sense of accomplishment and fun. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n Flying Slime! has four stages in spring, summer, fall, and winter. Each stage is made up of 20 sectors. <br/>\r\n The image graphics and sounds of each stage are configured to the concept of that stage, and of course, as the stage moves on, the difficulty increases.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n We hope it will be an interesting experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n Thank you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/396/396acf4656bc88116e6e2f15e787f950.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 244, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SHB soft"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["SHB soft"], "esrb_rating": null}
