You're stuck on the perimeter of a tube and you job is to shoot at everything in your way. If things get too hectic, you can slam on the brakes, which stops your forward movement for a few seconds and gives you time to change your direction or clear a path. Once you've destroyed all the level's eggs, your next task is to take on the game's huge bosses. Graphically, the game is very bright and colorful and definitely exhibits a techno influence. The soundtrack is done by the techno group Crystal Method, who supply some remixes as well as older tracks, which helps put you in the groove.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:08:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e1/9e1b77383f1e238540c05623d91ff225.jpg", "website": "http://consoleclassics.co/?games=n2o#", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 24, "beaten": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 209, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "PSP", "PS Vita", "PlayStation", "PC"], "developers": ["Sony Interactive Entertainment", "Gremlin Interactive", "Urbanscan"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Racing", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Gremlin Interactive", "Fox Interactive", "Console Classics"], "esrb_rating": null}
