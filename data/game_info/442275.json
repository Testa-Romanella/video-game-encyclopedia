The Team consists of two programmers creating procedurally generated levels, AI integrations, and a dialogue system for quests. The artists created sprites and animations using a 32x32 pixel art style. A member, who is a musician, mixed all the sounds and ambient/soundtrack. The playable character must help other animals earn karma points, depending on how well the player does this will change the ending of the game.</p>\n<p>The general consensus was to create a game similar to the indie game \"Do it for me\". The idea was that players' morals will be challenged based on multiple playthroughs. The game was made in Unity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T04:28:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f66/f6634c2b78c37144f943f98d4c6c706d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FlickerBird312"], "genres": ["RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
