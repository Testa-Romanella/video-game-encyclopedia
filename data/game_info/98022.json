They have sixty seconds to ascend as high as possible. To ascend, they have to cooperate, occupying switches and holding open doors for one another. When time is up, each player leaves their avatar behind to hold open the last switch they touched for all future players.</p><p>Everyone who plays contributes to the success of the group. Even players who aren't traditionally skilled at videogames can occupy switches earlier in the game, helping all future players in a big way.</p><p>Someone once told me that, in any movement, the person who staples the leaflets is as important as any of the more visible heroes who march at the front of every protest.  This game is inspired by that idea.</p><p><strong>NOTE: To quit game, hit ESC five times!
