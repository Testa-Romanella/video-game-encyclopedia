The premise was to mix a \"Magic Cube\" with a crossword puzzle. Earlier versions had more complex gameplay, but I drastically reduced its\u00a0scope for the sake of keeping the game out of my abandoned project graveyard.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Click and drag on slices of the cube to rotate them, just like physical \"Magic Cube\".</li><li>Click and drag on empty space to rotate the cube.\u00a0</li><li>Click the button in the bottom right to reorient the cube.</li><li>Click your given word in the bottom left to review its definition, etc.</li><li>Dynamic soundtrack ramps up as you complete the puzzle. Use this as a \"hint\" for the state of the puzzle on faces you may not be able to see.</li></ul>\n<p>There are known bugs, however I have no further\u00a0plans to work on this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T05:22:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/120/120adc9920b4471aa14fe1e743335aad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ze___eb"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
