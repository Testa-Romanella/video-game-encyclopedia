{"id": 899185, "slug": "spectres-library-chapter-i-demo", "name": "Spectre's Library: Chapter I (DEMO)", "name_original": "Spectre's Library: Chapter I (DEMO)", "description": "<p>Libraries have always been home to hundreds of stories that can take you on a grand adventure, and Spectre's Library is no exception. From an evil clone to a homeless man with a guitar, there's a story for everyone!</p>\n<p>\"Spectre's Library\" is a little game that me and my siblings are making. (Even though I am doing most of it.) It's mainly a demonstration of each of our writing abilities, with (a minimum) of 3 chapters, each one showcasing a story we've written.</p>\n<p>Currently, its just a little demo for the first chapter; roughly the first third of the chapter, give or take. The full chapter will have the following:<br/>-Voice acting for all characters!<br/>-An actual, proper opening to the game!<br/>-More artwork by Joseph McGreevy!<br/>-A short playable story written by Rose McGreevy!<br/>-Bug fixes! (If needed)<br/>-More puzzles!<br/>-And more!</p>\n<p>The full chapter will be coming out when we finish it, which will (hopefully) be sometime next year, in 2023. Each chapter will be released when we finish them, with all the\u00a0chapters being combined into a single game in the end. The current plan is to make 3 chapters, but if the game gains enough traction, we might extend it. (We'll see.)</p>\n<p>If you'd like to stay up to date with the development of the game, make sure you hit the \"follow\" button on this game, and check out my Patreon!
