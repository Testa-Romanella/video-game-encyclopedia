When an enemy is defeated, your color changes to get closer to theirs. Once an enemy is defeated, they drop a heart, and picking up that heart changes your color to be closer to theirs, changing your abilities to be closer to theirs as well.</p>\n<p>P.S. Move down from the starting room to find the door!</p>\n\n<p>Creators:\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Sean Brandon\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Frank Gomez\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Andy Tran\r\n</p>\n<p>Other art:\r\n</p>\n<p>https://maaot.itch.io/2d-browncave-assets\r\n</p>\n<p>https://www.pixilart.com/art/animated-slime-90852e82310e3f5\r\n</p>\n<p>https://0x72.itch.io/dungeontileset-ii\r\n</p>\n<p>https://pixel-poem.itch.io/dungeon-assetpuck\r\n</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/EVRetro/sounds/495005/\r\n</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/cabled_mess/sounds/350985/\r\n</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/BaDoink/sounds/562279/\r\n</p>\n<p>https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wiktionary.org%2Fwiki%2Fcol...\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T08:20:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f8/4f8648b426b6fbc950881e5fe9a202a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["seanb33"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
