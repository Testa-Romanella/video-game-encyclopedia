Everyone can understand the game messages differently, and there is no right or wrong. The core idea of the game is about making choices and observing the consequences of those choices.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The main narrative of the game is about the character \u201cIt\u201d and the bug in its mind, as in the game title. Character \u201cIt\u201d can be any humanoid individual. The same concept applies to all other non-playable characters in the game. Everything remains abstract and anonymous that leaves rooms for players\u2019 own imagination, assumption and comprehension.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The bug has many meanings. The bug can be the evil side of \u201cIt\u201d, the evil spirit that controls \u201cIt\u201d, the evil choice, \u201cthe big thing\u201d in the forest, \u201cIt\u201d itself, or even the dark forest \u201cIt\u201d is in.
