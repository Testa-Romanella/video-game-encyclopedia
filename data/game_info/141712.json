Perplexing, isn't it?'</em><br/></p>\n<p>The name of the game is Cynthia, who you will eventually get to know within great depth, as she is the protagonist of this game. On the outside she appears to be a completely normal and regular teenager.. but then I guess things aren't always as they seem. In reality she is anything but, seemingly adrift as she desperately to grasp onto any aspect that explains her purpose within life and even why she still exists. Although it is true that her existence may not be that important on a greater scale within that of the outside world, it is essentially only a matter of time before she realizes that the existence within that of her own mind is anything but an aspect that will - and can be - ignored.</p>\n<p>The main genre of this game will be psychological horror, along with mystery.</p>\n<p>The prologue is a working progress, I'm still learning within unity, so as I bring out new chapters they will each have improvement. That being said, if you do have any feedback (good or bad) pls tell me as it will help me improve this game. Thank you :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b00/b00d8f0902fac700b3a35845ac1b23ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Snowchxll"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
