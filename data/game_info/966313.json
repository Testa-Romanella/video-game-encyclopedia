{"id": 966313, "slug": "poly-ego", "name": "Poly Ego", "name_original": "Poly Ego", "description": "So, you've got a knack for virtual reality and a touch of masochism? <br/>\n<br/>\r\nFancy getting your digital head messed with in an uncanny world where logic is king and folly is your only solace? <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWelcome to Poly Ego, a mind-bending adventure in the heart of a vast digital labyrinth. As an unsuspecting lab robot, you're thrown into an intricate world of puzzles, partnered with a fellow robot, Bluepy. Logic will be your compass and cunning your key as you navigate this uncanny reality.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe core gameplay revolves around distinct mechanics. You'll encounter cubes within the levels that are essential for solving the game's complex puzzles. These geometric tools can be placed on pressure plates or used to manipulate laser beams. The pressure plates trigger various mechanisms, from hiding obstacles to redirecting laser pathways.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe laser beams come in two colors: yellow and red. Yellow lasers are benign and can be interacted with without harm, while red lasers are hazardous and should be avoided. The cubes you find can help here too, by redirecting the lasers to guide their beams in new directions. This redirection is often essential for hitting laser sensors, which in turn activate specific events or objects within the level.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEnemy robots lurk within these digital corridors, ready to attack on sight. But fear not, for they have a vulnerability: they can be neutralized by directing a laser beam at them. Strategic positioning of a cube to redirect a laser is often your best defense.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCoordination with Bluepy is pivotal. Some puzzles necessitate simultaneous actions, requiring precise timing, positioning, and communication between both characters.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour objective in each level is to reach the spheric yellow portal. Access to this portal is only granted once all puzzles in the level are successfully solved, serving as a testament to your problem-solving prowess.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPoly Ego is a harmonious symphony of cerebral puzzles, strategic coordination, and moments of pure, virtual adrenaline. In this world, cubes are more than mere shapes, lasers more than light, and victory is a portal away.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-15T04:45:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d47/d47f71da4ff844ec86e89e76207c285f.jpg", "website": "https://www.polytooldesign.com/polyego", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Poly Tool Design"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Poly Tool Design"], "esrb_rating": null}
