{"id": 954837, "slug": "infralight", "name": "Infralight", "name_original": "Infralight", "description": "<p>A game submitted for Dungeon\u00a0Crawler Game Jam 2023. The theme was Duality. Infralight is a sci-fi adventure set on an asteroid mining base, and in the game, you fight two types of enemies (robots and mutants), so you need to choose between two types of light to use, because the mutants have natural camouflage and only show up under \u201cInfralight.\u201d</p>\n<p>The first level is fully playable, but a late-breaking bug means you cannot progress past the second combat.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>In combat, which is a third-person party view,\u00a0you give orders to your characters. Click on the character and then click where you want them to move: it\u2019s a good idea to get behind cover! Then click shoot and pick a target. When you have given all your orders, click the Orders Done button in the bottom right corner and all actions will happen simultaneously with the enemies\u2019 actions.</p>\n<p>Sadly you won\u2019t get to see much of the second or any of the third level during the jam, where you would add two more members to your team. However, once the jam has ended we will upload a fixed version. \u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for trying it out!</p>\n<p>Check out a PDF of background story for the game.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>We used the Synty Low Poly SciFi asset pack, animations from Mixamo,\u00a0Badlands Music Pack 3 by Michael La Manna, and\u00a0an A* library by Aron Granberg. Our focus was on building out the code, story and levels, as we had no artists or composers.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T10:43:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c61/c618818cf23e6ff3cfa7acdd02abf843.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["7isAnOddnumber"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
