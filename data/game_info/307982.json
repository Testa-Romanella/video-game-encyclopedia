That's the basic idea behind Test Tube Titans. The game has been in development for almost a year now and is currently aiming to have an initial version completed by the start of 2020. By purchasing this pre-access version you'll be helping to fund development as well as having access to updates as the game evolves.</p>\n<p>The current demo includes 4 campaign missions, local multiplayer wrestling, and a level editor.</p>\n<p>This game currently requires a gamepad controller. The Xbox 360 controller has been thoroughly tested, but all similar gamepads should be supported. Should you have an issue with your gamepad let me know and I'll resolve the issue as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>Join the Discord community here!</p>\n<p>Follow Test Tube Titans on twitter.</p>\n<p>Please post your feedback/suggestions/issues in the itch.io forum here, or start a discussion on Discord.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-08T06:24:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e27/e2786a9b3e00a13417327f4c545432bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ghost Time Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
