All has been going well, until robots of unknown origin began wreaking havoc on various sectors. Upon analysis of one of the destroyed bots, it was discovered that they had been receiving signals from two sectors. If the computers sending these signals could be deactivated, the robots efforts would no longer be coordinated.</p>\n<p>An autonomous robot, Kinematic 3304-302, has volunteered to venture to these sectors to deactivate the signals.</p>\n<p>Armed with his trusty (and easily modifiable) laser weapon,\u00a0Kinematic 3304-302 set off on his journey.</p>\n<p>But who is responsible for these malicious bots\u00a0to begin with? And what could they be planning? How far does their power go?</p>\n\n<p>GAMEPLAY:</p>\n<p>The game features two distinct playstyles:</p>\n<p>The main part of the game is a 2D platformer, where you'll explore the level, and deactivate the signal.</p>\n<p>In order to get to the next sector, you'll have to travel through space in a Shoot-Em-Up style where bots will try to defeat you before you make it to the next sector.</p>\n<p>You can also pick an Arcade mode, which is an endless version of the 2D Space Shooter. Try to get the highest score that you can!</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<p>Game created by Joshua Young</p>\n<p>Music licensed by neosounds.com</p>\n\n<p>Additional Thanks:</p>\n<p>Thanks to Clickteam for creating Clickteam Fusion!</p>\n<p>My friends and family for supporting me!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T12:20:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb8/cb8b372aa6d7a413f8d22b979386a5d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joshua Young Video Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
