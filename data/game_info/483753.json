But you can also find the kit you like best. Do you like archery, shooting magic bolts, or just slashing away at tons of skeletons, goblins, pirates, and more?? If so you might like this idk. Really had fun as this was my first project I've ever submitted, and my first time trying procedural generation(it was a headache). I'm not good at sfx or music, and the overall polish is meh to me. I didn't have much time to play test or check for bugs so have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T05:20:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28f/28fb7999df258060f3201f42984ddaf5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["drewtrobinson"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
