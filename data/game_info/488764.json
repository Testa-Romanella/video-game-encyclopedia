To do so, press the right button at the right moment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the right buttons?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, you have three possible lanes where the squares are thrown. The upper lane, the mid lane and the lower lane. For each lane you have a button to make the square on it bounce (Check to be in azerty before playing).</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the right moment?</strong></p>\n<p>When a square is on your racket/bouncing zone (the thin vertical grey line), you can make it bounce. Be careful! If you press the button while there is no square on your racket of the corresponding lane, you lose health points.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the other things to know?</strong></p>\n<p>Know that each time you make a square bounce, its speed will increase. Also, you have a bunch of other features: <br/></p>\n<p>- You can choose the difficulty (changing the speed of the game).</p>\n<p>- There is a trickshot system, healing you when you make 2 or 3 squares bounce in a very short amount of time.</p>\n<p>- There is a combo system letting you entering a sort of rage mode making the game a hell lot faster for a short duration. Squares will deal more damage on your opponent and you will regen a bit for each bounce you make.</p>\n<p>- You can earn some portal allowing to teleport some squares incoming on your opponent. To do so, keep pressed a key of your choice and different from the bouncing keys, then press also the key corresponding to the lane on which the square you want to teleport is (This is very unclear, but anyway it's kind of a pgm move so it's not that important).</p>\n<p>- You can play against a little AI. Just a stupid one throwing randomly squares at you and make the square bounce all the time<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>How to win?</strong></p>\n<p>Just kick the ass of you opponent's healthbar.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Bindings :</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Player 1</p>\n<p>Upper : z (azerty) / w (qwerty)<br/>Mid : e<br/>Lower : f<br/>Throw : q (azerty) / a (qwerty)<br/></p>\n<p>Player 2</p>\n<p>Upper : p<br/>Mid : o<br/>Lower : k<br/>Throw : \u00f9 (azerty) / ; (qwerty)</p>\n<p>Note that throwing is random: when you press the key, a square may be thrown or not. So just spam the key!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Important things :<br/></strong></p>\n<p>- When starting the .exe, it will say that a .pdf is missing. That is normal don't worry, just keep going.</p>\n<p>- Be sure to play on a 16/9 screen. The game is supposed to adapt its resolution but the best one is 1920*1080.</p>\n<p>- Be sure to play with an AZERTY configuration.</p>\n<p>- To start a game, just select which players are playing by checking their box (when it is not checked, a dumb AI will replace the player), select you difficulty and press start!</p>\n<p>- If you have an error message, try to play anyway. Most of the time, it is just Pure Data doing some mess.</p>\n<p>- The game may be BROKEN, because it's made on PURE DATA, a visual scripting software, not a game engine at all.</p>\n<p>- Have fun :)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits :<br/></strong></p>\n<p>- Conception: Valentin di Domenico</p>\n<p>- Ultimate Senior Playtester: K\u00e9vin Teyssier<br/></p>\n<p>- Music:\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<ul><li> Fastway - Rockin Hardcore</li><li>Max Coveri - Running in the 90s</li><li>Manuel - GAS GAS GAS</li><li>Dejo &amp; Bon - Wheelpower &amp; Go!</li><li>The Immortals - Techno Syndrome</li></ul>\n<p>- Voices:</p>\n<ul><li>Announcer: Mortal Kombat</li><li>Players: Kenshiro</li></ul>\n<p>- SFX:</p>\n<ul><li>Dragon Ball Z</li><li>Me</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T05:33:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/956/956230a27c2b3baeb518f1a8e8f4bb3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Valentin di Domenico"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
