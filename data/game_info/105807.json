Here you can peer into the thoughts and desires of those without names.</p>\n<p>Extrospect is a short game about observing and connecting with peoples most private thoughts. Move through a calming and tranquil space as you interact\u00a0with orbs containing responses from hundreds of anonymous writers. Each orb holds a unique message from an anonymous writer.<strong><em> THESE RESPONSES ARE UNFILTERED AND UNCENSORED. \u00a0Most are written from the users most secret self, words that are typically not uttered in public. This is a game to show you that we aren't alone, that we all share a common emotion, be it pain, pleasure, confusion and more.</em></strong></p>\n<p>OTHER NOTES:</p>\n<p>The game runs on Windows 10 and Mac <br/></p>\n<p>ARTIST STATEMENT:</p>\n<p>This game creates a mixed bag of emotions for me. I\u00a0smile at the pleasant parts and cry when the heavy words hit. This short project has taught me a lot about the pain and pleasure many of us go through. We all need a chance to express are most inner thoughts and so I\u00a0thought this was a good chance to express and visualise that.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>W,A,S,D:\u00a0Move the character</p>\n<p>SHIFT:\u00a0to run</p>\n<p>SPACE BAR:\u00a0to Jump</p>\n<p>ESC:\u00a0To exit the game</p>\n<p>POST MORTEM:</p>\n<p>https://medium.com/@ZacCroslow...<br/></p>\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<p>Created &amp; Designed by: Zachary Croslow</p>\n<p>Twitter: @ZacCroslow</p>\n<p>Programming by: Lanz Jordan</p>\n<p>Twitter @LanzJordan</p>\n<p>Music by: JackWinn</p>\n<p>Special thanks:<br/>Lee Mingwei, creator of \"Writing the Unspoken.\"</p>\n<p>Brendan Keogh</p>\n<p>The Twitter community</p>\n<p>The Reddit Community</p>\n<p>Erika Verkaaik, creator of the game \"BEAUTIFUL\"</p>\n<p>And all my friends and family on Facebook</p>\n<p>********</p>\n<p>And a BIG THANK YOU to the anonymous users who took the time to write a response.<br/>I Could not have made this without you all!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbf/bbf2ad8e917ef6d0b76c42eaa03e1597.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Zac's Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
