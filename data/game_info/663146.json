Do expect that this game will have janky controls, more out of whack collisions and, mechanics sometimes breaking.</p>\n<p>These levels are easy to finish however if you were to get stuck on a level then you can press the escape key\u00a0to return to the main menu.\r\n</p>\n<p>Any comments on my game, whether it be positive or negative, to help me improve on what I could work harder in the future (or something).\r\n</p>\n<p>Don't expect a game like mine to be fun, I'm sure it would not be entertaining when playing my game. If things don't go as you like it, you can always delete the game.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T06:32:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/400/4004e9f235945ecac8170d96ed77f417.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BlankNReady"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
