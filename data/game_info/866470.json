Some of the most important monuments are being taken away, among the complaints of the citizens, and the lower part of the city becomes inaccessible more often than not. In Venice 2089, you'll explore the city through the eyes of Nova, a bored teenager who has no clue about what to do in life and just wants to relax from the stress of their usual routine. Yet tides change for everyone without exception...<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Navigate the streets of the city in a unique 2.5D artstyle. Explore numerous points of interest from Nova's Boat-house in Santa Marta to the cleaner calli of Punta della Dogana. And watch out for the rising tides, they'll change the way you move throughout Venice!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Meet a diverse cast of characters scattered throughout the city. Know their personalities, learn their points of view and help them in different quests. Fill your house-boat with important objects, and remember the experiences you made.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Use your hoverboard to navigate Venice, perform tricks and create a dynamic soundtrack that'll match your mood. Interact with the world using your drone, collect objects out of your reach and solve some puzzles.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>WARNING: <br/>THE DEMO CURRENTLY AVAILABLE DOES NOT REPRESENT THE FINAL STATE OF THE GAME AND DOES NOT SUPPORT WIDESCREEN RESOLUTIONS.</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-07T01:53:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/601/601be6b918b1981765e812a6991d530f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Safe Place Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Safe Place Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
