Can you accept this challenge?</strong></p>\n\n\n<p>In the story, you are a neural network created by Admin. You are the first neural network created by Admin. And to test the neural network (you), he built an \u201cobstacle course\u201d to see how you would overcome it.</p>\n\n<p>The rules of this game are very simple, we play in space as a rocket. You need to get alive from the beginning to the end, overcoming various obstacles. But not everything is so simple, each level is a new mechanic, and for which the passage of all levels will differ from the previous ones.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>The game has thoughtful humor (almost). As you progress through the game, you may come across fun levels to cheer you up until your nerves burst from the complexity of the game. Also in the game you can find Easter eggs, and you can also find Mr. White.</p>\n\n\n<p>I'm on VK:\u00a0\u00a0https://vk.com/mr.white_der<br/>My group in:\u00a0https://vk.com/error_box<br/>Support with a coin:\u00a0https://www.donationalerts.com/r/der_official<br/>Contact the developer (report a bug):\u00a0der-der-der-der-der@mail.ru</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T11:52:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6c/f6cd7fae1fdbcdc73ce80119e07f9111.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Der"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
