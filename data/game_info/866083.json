In this vertical slice,\u00a0players can host/join lobbies and fight each other in some fast-paced, silly first-person action. The project is actively being developed and is intended to serve as the codebase for a future game title once all networking solutions are explored.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Main Features :</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Lobby System\u00a0- Players can create, host and join lobbies. Lobbies are hosted over Steam, so no IP-Address swapping is needed.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Networked FPS Systems\u00a0- All the systems you would expect for a simple FPS template. Networked movement, projectile instantiation and pickups. Fling fireballs to your heart's content.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Powerup Pickups\u00a0- Networked fire-rate and shield potions are placed around the map for players to enjoy.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Message Feed and Scoreboard\u00a0- A basic message feed is visible by all players, which notifies all players when others get kills. The scoreboard will allow you to see your K/D/A scores.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Character Selection\u00a0- Play as a flying, fire-breathing monster or the default wizard bean.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>QoL Features\u00a0- Press 'P' for a bare-bones options menu.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>In-Development Features :</strong></p>\n<ul><li>AI Enemies and Loot System\u00a0- Allow players to defeat enemies and gain personal loot from corpses.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Inventory &amp; Gear System\u00a0- MMO-style inventory and gearing systems.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Melee Weapons\u00a0- Soon you will be able to choose between melee and ranged combat on the fly.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Classes\u00a0- Three class concepts are being developed and for the wizard bean. These classes will focus on moving core gameplay away from simply clicking the LMB.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Additional Notes :</strong></p>\n<ul><li>This\u00a0project was developed by one person and is not bug-free, though it should be crash-free.</li><li>All art was either purchased or provided for free online.</li></ul>\n<p>Please feel free to report any issues in the comment section below.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks for playing!</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T12:50:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49d/49d1efc438db7f6fa479bd1a9fe6e152.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zercury"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
