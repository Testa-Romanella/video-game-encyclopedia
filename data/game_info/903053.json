I had to ditch it entirely and write my own vehicle movement\u00a0controller in C++. My little brother helped with some of the graphics including the elf.</p>\n<p>The scope was, in retrospect, obviously too large, hence failing the main point of this jam. I should have probably just made it 2d in unity.\u00a0But, overall I am pretty happy with the result. Most of the time was spent on the movement component, and I\u00a0am fairly happy with the result of that especially.</p>\n<p>Thank you taking the time to play my little game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T04:16:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c3/5c31860999104df4d332001f0a75603a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Snailsy"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
