Press down to soft drop. Use Z and X to rotate. Press enter to pause/unpause.</p>\r\nMechanics\r\n<p>The mechanics are very similar to NES Tetris. It uses the same DAS, entry delay, and level speed timings.\r\nAll of the pieces are made out of 3 connected right triangles. There is also a white, single triangle piece which can be used to fix holes in your stack. It will always come out 3 at a time. The single triangle is also special, lines will only be cleared once they have all been placed. This allows you to fill 3 lines to score a Tritris!</p>\r\nPhasing\r\n<p>One of the most unique mechanics of Tritris is phasing. A piece will always move to the next location as long as the next location is valid (no intersecting triangles). By moving a piece in multiple ways at the same time, pieces are able to do many types of tucks and spins. Below are a few examples.</p>\r\nThe pieces are able to easily move down into an empty space.For the bottom right triangle, down and X (rotate) are pressed simultaneously. Once all 3 triangles are placed, the line clears.\u00a0Left or right are held when the piece is above the desired position, and when the piece moves down, it also moves horizontally.Here are a few examples of some phases!\r\n\r\nScoring\r\n<p>In Tritris, clearing 4 lines at a time is not possible, so the highest score value is obtained from 3 lines at a time, a Tritris. This can only be achieved by settings up 3 rows, each missing only one triangle, then placing a single triangle in each row. Once all triangles are placed, the rows clear and a Tritris is scored!\r\nA triple is equivalent to a Tetris in NES Tetris, a double is equivalent to a triple, and a single is equivalent to a double.<br/></p>\n\r\nA Tritris is scored!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T05:38:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb2/cb283ce568572d38f617a6e77be7a26f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Goel"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
