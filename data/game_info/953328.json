The first player to reach the goal wins the game and becomes the ultimate \"Platform Hunter\".</p>\n<p>Credits for all used game assets are in the attached Credits.pdf file.</p>\n<p>Sometimes multiplayer does not work instantly just go back to main menu and try it again.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T14:17:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e30/e300905d591c48d49d61a548f278e162.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Shaquiri1"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
