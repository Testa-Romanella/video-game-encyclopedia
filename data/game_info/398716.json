I guess I'll have to deliver the request myself. Get me my nanosuit!\"</p>\n\n<p>In this game your aim is to get to the server modem to give hatfilms their 1 millionth subscriber. To do that you have to move through codeblocks avoid or kill YT firewall and get to the modem before you're timed out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>WASD or arrows to move, leftmouse to shoot.</p>\n<p>ESC to quit if it becomes too repetitive.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Basically go right as much as you can, and then go up or down until you find the modem, the white diamond shape.</p>\n<p>I wanted to add many more enemies and a boss fight but I just didn't have the time. Maybe I'll add those in the future.</p>\n<p>You can play TheFatRat's Unity in the background, I didn't add it myself as it is free to use on youtube but may not be on twitch.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8X9_MgEdCg</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy it. /u/rutiancoren on reddit..<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-16T03:00:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83e/83ec1a649bfd8d4784ea284d9d235f66.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rutian"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
