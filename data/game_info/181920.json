Follow a boy on his journey down the river of time to become a man. Also there are monsters. And at least one ghost or ghost-like figure. Only finished up to 3 stages of a planned 6, but I kinda like it so will finish it and add in music, a bunch more story and some better graphics eventually.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc8/bc85e0354678d565e312843ef7f1f0f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["missingrooster"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
