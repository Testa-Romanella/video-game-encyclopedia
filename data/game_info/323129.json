Your adventure will take you through time and space in a 1950's fridge, all on a quest to undo Clive's cousin Nancy's mistake and ultimately thwart the tyrannical Dr Daucus.</strong><br/><br/>Clive 'N' Wrench features <strong>11 distinct levels</strong> as well as boss battles and a hub world. Your adventure will take you all the way from the prehistoric ice age in Iceceratops, through ancient Egypt in Tempus Tombs and even all the way through to the old west in The Chimp, The Bag, and the Bunny.<br/><br/>Clive 'N' Wrench have a <strong>diverse and tight moveset</strong>, tailored for both experienced players and beginners alike. Personally, I think the single most important part of a 3D platformer in this vein is control, as such a huge amount of time and effort has been put into both the feel as well as the animation of each move.<br/><br/>Clive 'N' Wrench also features a colourful cast of characters, both from the modern day and throughout time.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-02T21:42:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f99/f990a3a20a8b2dce5fafd02424ea0337.jpg", "website": "http://www.clivenwrench.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 10, "achievements_count": 38, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 508, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["_Rob_", "Dinosaur Bytes Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Numskull Games", "Dinosaur Bytes Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
