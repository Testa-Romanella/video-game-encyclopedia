Here at the MSA (Major Secret Organization), we recruit only the greatest spies and give them an AI companion to help them steal secrets from other organizations. Why send a robot? Robots are expendable; humans are not!</p>\n<p>Your mission is to infiltrate the ZIA (Zimbabwe Intelligence Agency) and steal as much confidential information as you can. What will we do with this information? That's not your job. Your job is to control your AI companion and blend in with the humans around you.</p>\n<p>Humans greet strangers with a salute, so you must make sure to salute back! Press the correct key as it pops up to salute back; otherwise, the humans will become suspicious of you. Steal as many secrets as you can (50 should do) without being found out. Make sure to return to the exit with the secrets; otherwise, it's all for naught! Good luck!</p>\n<ul><li>Models + animations\u00a0by Chris Gauthier\r\n</li><li>Programming by John Wuller\r\n</li><li>Sound design by Chris Hedge</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T20:09:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84d/84d38eb36a14a10682c0fb91b7859eb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["John Wuller", "Sirchedge"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
