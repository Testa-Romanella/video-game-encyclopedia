{"id": 490765, "slug": "defenders-of-the-camp", "name": "Defenders of the Camp", "name_original": "Defenders of the Camp", "description": "<p>How to PlayEach adventure in this game will start from a camp, with the camp as the starting point. Each time you start the adventure, you can choose three of your more than ten controllable characters, equipped with their equipment and Skills, explore around the camp, eliminate the threats in those places and ensure the safety of the camp. After that, your team will return to the camp, supplies will be replenished, various states will be restored, and the next adventure will be prepared.<br />\nIn the camp, players can prepare potions, cook food, build equipment, and trade with merchants in the camp. Different camps are composed of different merchants. For example, there may be merchants selling rare ores in mining camps, and camps around handicraft towns are likely to sell necklaces and other decorations. In addition to using various convenient rights in the camp, you control The squad also needs to assume the responsibility of protecting the camp. When the threat around a camp is too large, they may form a small military force to attack the camp. At this time, the defense force placed by the player at the camp can be useful. .<br />\nIn the adventure, the team will encounter a variety of different creatures, some can help the adventure, and some will hinder the adventure. After defeating them, the team may get the equipment they use, or the valuable parts of their limbs. After a certain adventure, players will accumulate a lot of unique equipment, skills, etc., so they can go to more difficult areas to help the camps in those places resist attacks. Equipment system There will be a lot of equipment in the game. In addition to specific types of equipment, all equipment can enhance a wearer&#39;s ability or a few abilities. Some of the equipment can also give the wearer unique skills. When not equipped, these skills become Not available; the combination of specific equipment will make the wearer&#39;s ability show a certain tendency, which may make the wearer very suitable for a certain situation, on the other hand, unreasonable equipment skills may also be greatly weakened The wearer&#39;s ability to adapt to a specific environment. Talent system Each character has its own unique talent system. The character&#39;s talent system consists of three groups each with the ability to enhance the route. Players can use a limited number of talent points to activate a part of the talent. They can focus on selecting one of the promotion routes to obtain the end of the route Huge advantages can also be freely allocated to each route to achieve a balanced ability to improve. There are many kinds of talents in the talent system, some of them are brand new skills, and some are the improvement of a certain ability. Skill system From the various creatures encountered in the adventure to the roles players can play, they all have skills. There is no limit to the number of skills that each character can have, but each character has only three active skill fields, so it is necessary to skillfully arrange which skills are critical to this adventure and which are less core. For the characters that players can control, they all have the skills they have mastered at the beginning. These skills often meet my assumptions about the role of the character, but if they are not matched with other talents or equipment, they may not be able to play a huge role in the adventure. ; There are two ways to get more skills, 1 talent system, select some talents will give the character additional skills, equipped with certain equipment can also give players additional skills, but please note that when choosing other talents or uninstall When equipped with skills, these skills will also be unavailable. Team cooperation In a three-person team, players can only play one role at a time, and the behavior logic of the other two characters that are not controlled by the player requires the player to specify when they start an adventure, such as a more aggressive attack strategy, more inclined To maintain the team \u2019s protection strategy, etc .; more specifically, players need to specify behavior logic for all three roles, because you can choose which role to control at any time during the battle. When you control a character, his behavior logic will be temporarily suppressed, and the control is completely given to the player. If the player leaves the control of the character, the character will be controlled by his own behavior logic.<br />\nIn addition to assigning behavior logic to characters, there is a way to have weaker control over a character without switching to it. This method is called team instruction; when controlling any character, players can control by issuing team instructions For the other two teammates, team instructions are often very simple and limited in number, such as gathering, dispersing, charging, etc .; team instructions have the highest priority, which means that no matter what actions these teammates are taking, they will immediately change their own team instructions behavior.
