{"id": 809696, "slug": "vaporwaves-snakewinter", "name": "VaporWaves (SnakeWinter)", "name_original": "VaporWaves (SnakeWinter)", "description": "<p>Story: You are a pirate ship captain whose crew has mutinied\u00a0you because you're a jerk and you won't shut up about Archibald Island's treasure. Luckily they let you keep your ship. They figured you couldn't handle it on your own, in essence leaving you for dead. Maybe you are dead--the Captain part at least. Instead, you face the beginning of your new life as an adventurer and explorer of unseen, uncharted worlds.\u00a0Now where's\u00a0that map to Archibald Island?<br/></p>\n<p>Controls: WASD/mouse: movement.</p>\n<p>Space: Jump</p>\n<p>E and F: Interactions</p>\n<p>This is a prototype, practicing how to do things, including a cutscene with multiple camera angles. At some point,\u00a0I might be interested in expanding this game into more of an open-world adventure game. This short demo shows the very basic mechanism that would be in place of finding a new map and traveling to a new island. If I did make a full game like this, it\u00a0would ideally have multiple islands, collectable gold, crew recruitment, and sea creatures. It also might use more than two colors.</p>\n<p>This game was worked on from June 24 - June 25, 2022.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made for the Black and White Game Jam #0.9:\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/black-and-white-jam-9</p>\n<p>The only two colors are vaporwave-inspired neon blue and pink. Sometimes you might see black, but that's from objects overlapping, not an intended part of the color palette. There is no sound in this game. There are a few text jokes hidden around.\u00a0I made this with CopperCube and used the \"Do Something Later\" Add-on.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T10:30:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/615/615ef42819cc6255d4d5d4e82ee0d587.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SnakeWinter"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
