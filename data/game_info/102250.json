The intent was to create an arcade game using 2 buttons.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe name comes from the Battletoads game for the NES; the Turbo Tunnel level inspired this game.<br/>\n</p>How do you play?<p>\r\n\tPress space to start the game.  Afterwards, move your bike past the blue barriers.  You can only move up and down with the up and down arrow keys respectively.  Hit a barrier and it's game over.\r\n</p>Afterthoughts on the Project<p>\r\n\tMy main goal was to see how fast I could take a game from idea to prototype using some library code. My thoughts on this are in the gitHub repository.</p><p>Otherwise, I'm happy with how the game turned out.  My only gripe is that I couldn't get a sound to repeat to mimic the revving of the engine since it would stop playing after some time.</p>And here is the source code:<p>\r\n\tgitHub\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62d/62d90888a2bb567610221058a2838990.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["olingallet"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
