It runs on both Windows and Linux.</p>\n<p>The object of this game is to fight through the mass of enemies in each level, defeat the level boss, and finally destroy the (well-armed) enemy space station far from Earth.</p>\n<p><strong>It has an interesting \"twist\" in which you can alter the flow of time.</strong></p>\n<p>Build up your time meter by playing the game in fast-forward. Playing in slow motion affords you some extra maneuvering room but depletes the meter.</p>\n<p>There are six levels in this game:</p>\n<ul><li>Near Earth\r\n</li><li>Nebula Region\r\n</li><li>Debris Area\r\n</li><li>Distant Worlds\r\n</li><li>Deep Space\r\n</li><li>Null Zone</li></ul>\n<p>If you achieve a high score, you can choose a color flag to represent your ship and have yourself recorded on the high score table.</p>\r\nDefault controls (keyboard)\r\n<p>arrow keys: move your ship\r\n<br/>space: fire\r\n<br/>left ctrl: \"fast forward\"\r\n<br/>left shift: \"slow motion\"\r\n<br/>enter: start game\r\n<br/>p: pause\r\n<br/>esc: exit to menu</p>\r\nDefault controls (joystick)\r\n<p>directions: move your ship\r\n<br/>Button 1: fire / Start\r\n<br/>Button 2: \"slow motion\"\r\n<br/>Button 3: \"fast forward\"\r\n<br/>Button 4: pause</p>\r\nChanges in version 1.3\r\n<ul><li>Numerous internal changes for performance and stability\r\n</li><li>Allow joystick button remapping in config.ini\r\n</li><li>Improved sound effect playback\r\n</li><li>Graphics changes for better visibility, difficulty tweaks\r\n</li><li>MSVC port and a build for Windows XP</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>All enemy and player artwork by me (made with Blender), as well as starry background and menu images. Space images are lifted from various space news sites, mostly NASA stock photographs.</p>\n<p>Music by chromag, subi, 4-mat, 2pac, and emax.
