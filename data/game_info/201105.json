Your journey leads to discoveries of mana rifts that can be directed to elder trees that act as mana reservoirs and distributes the mana throughout the land, returning life to the barren wastes. However, caution must be taken because you are not the only one drawn by the power of the mana rifts. Enemies patrol the wastelands, eager to find any source of mana to gorge themselves on. Use your magic and wits to direct the flow of mana from the rifts to the trees without attracting the attention of the vile creatures... lest they consume the elder trees as well!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/253/25364dd54ca12c41a9e916e8de21b706.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["revol"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
