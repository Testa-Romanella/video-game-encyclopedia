It's based on the golden age of 80s 8-bit games, and is designed to be super challenging. This is the first section of the first level, and is designed to be the training area to familiarise you with the mechanics, feel and controls. It will get harder. Much, much harder! It's full of blood and gore. Every mistake leaves your blood spraying. There's nice, splatting sound effects and atmospheric weather. I'm working on more levels and mechanics everyday.\u00a0I hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>Left and right arrow keys to move. Space to jump. X to restart.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/147/147fe5aba99f5db77e6b641bfd0a1d39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Murderpixelz"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
