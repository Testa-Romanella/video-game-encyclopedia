(PC only currently)<br/></p>\n<p>Our goal for this game is to create an engaging 2D top down retro bullet hell with rogue like elements for progression! We'd like to create many more interesting enemies, boss fights, and challenging room types built within a procedural set of levels to offer players challenge. As with rogue likes, death merely presents the player the option to spend their hard earned points on better and more benefits.\r\n  </p>\n<p>We would appreciate for anyone to try our game to get a feel and to also provide helpful feedback via our questionnaire below!\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://goo.gl/forms/9inx1tdpQneqN0Gz2\r\n  </p>\n<p>Thanks to everyone who shows their support!\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-22T03:33:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67d/67d98e7dab2a7e337da3ec4e6683e556.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BlackEngineGames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
