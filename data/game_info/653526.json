{"id": 653526, "slug": "movie-master-america", "name": "Movie Master - America", "name_original": "Movie Master - America", "description": "<p>This is a 4-player online board game that focuses on domain knowledge and tacit understanding among players.</p>\n<p>The fun part is that you should describe a card in such a way that one and only one\u00a0 player can guess what you are talking about.</p>\n<p>Should be quite fun for movie lovers.</p>\n<p>(The movies are selected from AFI's 100 American movie list)</p>\n<p><strong>Game rules:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Start the game with 4 players. Each player draws 5 cards from deck and add to hand. One player can only see his/her own hand cards. All players start with 0 point.</p>\n<p>The game proceeds by rounds. In each round one player is the host and others the guest. <br/>1. Host chooses a card from hand and place it face-down in the center. Then he/she needs to say something, anything.</p>\n<p>2. According to what the host has said, guests pick one card from their hand and place it face-down in the center.</p>\n<p>3. The host shuffles the 4 cards and show them to all. <br/>4. Guests will try to guess which card is placed by the host. Host will try to select one card that is the most misleading. Then everyone votes at the same time. <br/>5. Calculate the score according to voting result. <br/>(1) If all guests guessed it right or wrong, the host gains no point and all guests gain 2 points. <br/>(2) If some guests guessed it right while others wrong, the right player(s) and host gain 3 points. <br/>(3) If a card placed by guest got n votes, the owner gains n additional points.</p>\n<p>(4) If the most misleading card got n votes, the host gains n additional points.</p>\n<p>Then all players draw one card from deck and start the next round. Host moves to next player. The game ends when one player reaches 30 points or deck is empty.</p>\n\n<p>Acknowledgement:</p>\n\n<p>Game rule inspired by board game DiXit, which is designed by Jean-Louis Roubira.</p>\n<p>Background photo by Lukas from Pexels.</p>\n<p>All card textures are posters of old movies.
