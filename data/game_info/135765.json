You decide what you want to be measured against while playing. </p>\n<p><strong>How long can you survive? How high of a score can you get? How many lives can you stack?</strong></p>\n<p>Read the title screen instructions to understand the gameplay. Arrow keys move circle ship, mouse points in direction you want to shoot, hold down left click to fire continuously.</p>\n<p>This was a fun little game to make, as I learned a lot about how to make the zombie shapes follow you, and moving the the star field background.</p>\n<p>Everything you see and hear was made by me, except for when you lose lives, that is a classic scream ;) It was made in a couple of Saturdays in July of 2014, as my own kind of quick game jam, with Clickteam's Fusion!<br/><br/>This game is also on Newgrounds, Kongregate, and has been copied to numerous other game portals worldwide. <br/><br/>On itch.io, you can <strong>download the FREE Windows executable</strong>, with <strong>gamepad support </strong>for the left analog stick (tested on a generic PC USB gamepad, and Wii Classic Controller Pro connected to a Mayflash USB adapter for PC). Left analog stick controls movement, mouse controls 360 degrees of shooting. I haven't been able to get the right analog stick to work right on the PC version. Go to<strong> File &gt; Players </strong>to select a gamepad with analog sticks.<br/><br/>It is easier to play the PC version, and has a cooler background too!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcf/fcfc8359199918bc7177bb7fb2106111.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Hatcher Technomantics"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
