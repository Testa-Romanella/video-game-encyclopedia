Falling Fruit is based on collecting fruit and not to touch bombs coming from sky. Game consists of 2\u00a0 levels, if you play harder level you will see more bombs falling.\u00a0You will be controlling Chef Arthur and I would say that be careful because he would be very angry if he hits the bombs. I've a budget pc and I just wanted to earn some money to upgrade it a bit with this small project. It gets freezes for seconds and it makes\u00a0me angry while using Unity.\u00a0If you want to support me please donate. Take care...</p>\n<p>(I recommend 1024*768 resolution)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T06:50:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/537/537da5120f92c0dbd013e95a356c5825.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mchtsyn"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
