I made this in 2 weeks total, with plenty of inspiration from FNAF 1-UCN. The story is set in 2003, 10 years after the events in FNAF 1 took place. You are the security guard, making sure that everything is as it should be.</p>\n\n<p>That's all from me, now go and enjoy the game :D<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T15:36:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7a/b7a22242ba99ae0c90b67f6fde670bff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Ondrejoda"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
