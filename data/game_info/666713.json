Well ALONE is quite possibly your only chance! There is nothing else like this!</p>\n\n<p>Really though, you have been driven to the edge of insanity and so\u00a0 you have begun to see eyes everywhere. It is up to you to keep yourself sane, by avoiding fists and punching their eyes!</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>Mouse - Look around</p>\n<p>LMB - Punch</p>\n<p>RMB - Charge up punch</p>\n<p>LMB + RMB - Big Punch that launches you forward</p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n<p>Shift - Sprint (can theoretically wall-run, but not used a lot)</p>\n<p>C - Slide</p>\n<p>Tab - Menu</p>\n\n<p>If you are ever struggling to spin a full circle, press Tab and then click Resume. It's an issue with the mouse not locking in place, and I think I solved it, but just be wary.</p>\n<p>All Assets created by yours truly, with my cat Nim at my side. All code is custom, although the player controller is a very modified Parkour Script made by Dani.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Vimlark and Joshua for hosting this GameJam, this is the second game I have ever finished and it's awesome seeing the progress I've made (as well as make a fun boss fight).</p>\n\n<p>Has not been tested on Linux nor Mac, so if anyone tests that please let me know how it works out!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T03:49:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de7/de7db5c227416a1f94157806f2a2c682.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Nim&Kev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
