This experiment is broken down into 2 parts: measuring a\u00a0<br/>person's visual reaction time and then analyzing the data.<br/>Part1: Measuring a person\u2019s visual reaction time\u00a0<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The experiment here was to a test a person\u2019s visual reaction time by having a white 20mm\u00a0<br/>square appear on a black computer background at random times ranging roughly from 3-5 seconds. The\u00a0<br/>square can appears randomly on the left side or right side of the screen. The left side is approximately\u00a0<br/>25% of the screen width and the right side is 75% of the screen width.\u00a0 When the square appears 4\u00a0<br/>different sound conditions can happen.\u00a0 The conditions are: no sound is played, the directional sound is\u00a0<br/>in the same direction as the target, omnidirectional sound is played and lastly a distractor sound is\u00a0<br/>played that randomly picks a sound side and is played at a random time that is irrelevant to the target\u00a0<br/>display but must be played before the target is displayed.\u00a0 The sound clip that will be played is a 1 kHz\u00a0<br/>sinusoidal tone with duration of 200ms. The left sound side location is 1m away from the cube and 30\u00a0<br/>degrees of the horizontal to the left side and the right sound side is located 1m away from the cube and\u00a0<br/>30 degrees of the horizontal to the right side.\u00a0 If the tester takes longer than one second to react than\u00a0<br/>his reaction time for that square is assumed to be 1000 ms.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The software Unity was used to create an application able to test the experiment above.\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>Unity\u2019s audio spatializer was used in order to simulate the directional sound.\u00a0 Headphones must be used\u00a0<br/>in order to get the directional effect, Bose Around the Ear headphones were used during this\u00a0<br/>experiment. The sound conditions test inputs were ordered in a randomly generated Latin square\u00a0<br/>meaning each test set had 16 tests, 4 of each condition and that will all play at least once before they\u00a0<br/>can play again. Start times for the targets were exponentially distributed time, given from this formula:\u00a0<br/>T=LN(1-u)/(-alpha).\u00a0 The values of u ranged from 0.5 to 0.7 and alpha values ranged from 0.2 to 0.33.\u00a0<br/>The distractor start times are given by the target time minus the randomly generated exponentially\u00a0<br/>distributed time. The Unity application logs the experiment for a trial to a csv file. They can be viewed in\u00a0<br/>the Trials folder. The symbols used within the data: \u201cR\u201d is right side, \u201cL\u201d is left side, \u201cN\u201d is no side , \u201cO\u201d is\u00a0<br/>omnidirectional. All time used within the data\u00a0 is in milliseconds. The same monitor and mouse were\u00a0<br/>used in A1.\u00a0<br/>Part 2: analyzing the data<br/>System latency calculated in the last experiment was about 69 milliseconds and it will be subtracted\u00a0<br/>from the reaction time. The data is sorted by their sound condition, than averaged and placed within a\u00a0<br/>bar graph.\u00a0 The standard deviation is calculated and displayed on the graph as error bars.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28d/28dfad9f89dae0a38cb4e7382d6a8456.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zhired"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
