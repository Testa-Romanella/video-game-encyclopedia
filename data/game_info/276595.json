You just select single object (ring) to move, then all movable objects of the same type will be moved to that direction.</p>\n<p>Move is only possible if there are at least two movable objects (rings). To move, select object (ring)\u00a0 you want to move then select adjacent empty room or room having no another ring, that the object will be moved to. Only rings can move. You win if all objects (rings) are in the required locations matching by colours or numbers. More information and help are in guide eBook shipped with the game. See it on my blog.\u00a0 This\u00a0 game is released for Linux and Windows.\u00a0But if you have J2ME phone (240x320), you can get it from my blog:\u00a0http://bitl.y/tehelimu3\u00a0. Your feedback can help make improve the game.</p>\n<p>Background:<br/>The word mwendano (from Swahili language) means equivalence or matching). It can be shortened as MW. This is version with wider interface which is more\u00a0 recommended and it is written in c++. The older was written in Python for Windows only, it is with very small interface and it can be found on my\u00a0 \u00a0blog. So this wide version is usually shortened as MWD.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5a/e5a52c9f185ae077f2c9db66ec8fc836.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["yphsoft"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
