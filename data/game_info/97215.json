I really love to play around with VR technology and I really love to try different things with it, that's the reason for all my games.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They are all small little games, especially made for trying different stuff in VR. But that doesn't mean that they are just demos, I will try to roundup the game experience in each game completely, so that you (the gamer) will have a good game experience for a short time in a small but functional game.</p>\n<p>That's also the reason why the genres are so wide spreaded and not specific to one.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I also try to release the main game logic of each game as open source on my\u00a0github repo\u00a0if it does make sense.\u00a0That will not include the graphic assets if they are not free. All free assets will be included, the non-free ones I have to remove because of legal stuff.</p>\n\r\nDonations\r\n<p>If you want to support me then\u00a0please make any donation via PayPal.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/388/3889e6d38e92dcf53a2bf15512977d05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dev.play.repeat"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
