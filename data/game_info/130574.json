Ignoring the government's warning they went to the forest for a walk and didn't come back. Parents of the teens announced about their disappearance.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Record #1</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMy name is Hard.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tArticles of such kind are frequently published in a local rag. The Dark Forest is a damnation of our town. Nobody came back from this forest and nobody knows what happens with those who go there.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tI'm going to find it out! And you'll know the truth very soon, because I decided to write everything down to this diary. I'm going there at sunset!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Record #2</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe rucksack is on shoulders\u2026 the threshold of the Dark Forest, its first trees are several meters far from me\u2026 I feel positive, anticipating an exciting adventure!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tI'm bravely entering the forest, the trees are like a gloomy dome right over my head. It is rightly called the Dark Forest, as I can still see the sun light behind, but in front of me there is only darkness. But still it doesn't weaken my curiosity, I continue my trip to bosom of the Dark Forest!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Record #3</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tI have something to write down! Something extraordinary happened to me!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFirst of all, as soon as the exit from the forest disappeared behind my back, I began to feel some ominous presence around. Sometimes I could feel tender touches on my back and shoulders. Even once somebody tried to pull my rucksack off, but when I turned back harshly all I saw was only an old withered tree. And I know that I'm not alone between these crooked fearful snags! Also I do scratches on trees to find my way back for sure!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Record #4</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt's something unreal!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOk, maybe I have expected to find something unusual in this forest, but now everything around me seems to be alive!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSeveral hours passed after I entered the thicket. And I can't say the forest doesn't scare me!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tI tried my best to find the way out via the scratches that I had left on trees, but I failed! The trees get closer and closer! I can feel how they look at me! Their cold evil eye is following me!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tI made a fire and it calm down my tense nerves a little. But still this feeling of evil presence around doesn't leave me. I will soon run out of wood, but I don't dare to go for it into this darkness. Something tells me that if I went there I would never come back!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tObediently waiting for all coals to burn down! Fear consumes me bit by bit!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Record #5</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tI can't keep my diary anymore! I'm blindly using my pencil. I'm sure my writing is more than illegible but the fire is barely smoldering. And in the darkness I can see huge prickly branches reaching for me! This is not a forest! This is an abode for evil spirits locked up in the trees! All I can do is to flee! Running \u2013 is the only option!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/530/5308a63f54e75c6c1f95479d16a477a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Mikelarg"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
