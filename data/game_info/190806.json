{"id": 190806, "slug": "coffee-break-card-dungeon", "name": "Coffee Break Card Dungeon", "name_original": "Coffee Break Card Dungeon", "description": "<p>Coffee Break Card Dungeon is a single player collectible card game. Clear the dungeon by playing through a deck of cards. A single dungeon run takes about 2 to 5 minutes. Enjoy!</p>\n<p><strong>Getting Started</strong></p><p><strong>The Deck</strong></p>\n<p>The deck is made up of 54 semi-randomized dungeon cards, both harmful and helpful. In addition, you build a deck of 10 special cards that are added to the dungeon deck. Build up your collection of special cards to create unique and powerful decks! The result is a 64 card deck that forms the dungeon run.</p>\n<p><strong>Character Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>There are 3 main attributes to manage: Health, Attack, and Energy/Energy Gems</p>\n<p><em>Health\u00a0</em>is the most crucial resource. If your Health reaches 0, you lose.</p>\n<p><em>Attack\u00a0</em>is used to fight enemies. When playing enemy cards that have physical attacks, each of your Attack Points will defend against 1 enemy Attack Point, consuming it in the process. If the enemy outnumbers your Attack, you lose 1 Health. This means that if an enemy outnumbers your Attack by 5, you still only lose 1 Health instead of 5.</p>\n<p><em>Energy</em>\u00a0is spent to play cards that have an Energy cost associated with them. You can still play any card without enough Energy to pay its cost, but it will have no effect. Energy Gems define the maximum amount of Energy you can currently hold (starting with 3 and up to a max of 20). At the start of each deal, your Energy refills to your current number of Energy Gems. Playing cards that increase your Energy Gems will help you play more expensive cards, as well as play more cards in a given deal.</p>\n<p><strong>The Play</strong></p>\n<p>At the start of the game 4 cards are dealt to your hand. Note that your hand can never contain more than 4 cards. Cards can then be played in any order from your hand. Whenever there are 0 or 1 cards remaining in your hand, a new deal begins. Cards are dealt from the deck until your hand is full again, and then your Energy is refilled. If all cards are in the discard pile and you are alive, you beat the dungeon!</p>\n<p>In addition to playing a card from the hand, you may also pass, meaning the hand is shuffled back into the deck and a new hand is dealt. You may pass only if both of the following are true:</p>\n<p>a. There are 4 cards in your hand (the hand is full)</p>\n<p>b. The last action taken was not a pass (you cannot pass and then immediately pass again with your new hand)</p>\n\n<p>A game by Paul Henninger</p>\n<p>Note:\u00a0This is the web port of the\u00a0in-development mobile version.
