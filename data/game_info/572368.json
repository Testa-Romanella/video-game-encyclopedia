(step on the '=' symbol)</p>\n<p>- Use potions to get back some HP</p>\n<p>- Hide in long grass '\"' to loose enemies</p>\n<p>- You die when your HP reaches 0.</p>\n<p>You gain XP for every enemy killed which counts to your final score.</p>\n<p>You can pickup gold on each level which also counts to your final score.</p>\n\n<p>Game rules:</p>\n<p>There are a number of stats to keep in mind when playing:</p>\n<p>- accuracy\u00a0 (percentage chance to hit)</p>\n<p>- damage\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (damage caused by a weapon)</p>\n<p>- defense\u00a0\u00a0 (damage that can be absorbed before reducing hp)</p>\n<p>- evasion\u00a0\u00a0 (modify how hard you hare to hit)</p>\n<p>- crit\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (percentage change to cause a critical hit)</p>\n<p>The change to hit is the percentage formed by (your_accuracy - target_evasion).</p>\n<p>The damage given is (your_damage - target_defense).</p>\n<p>Its a fairly simple opposing stats kind of thing.</p>\n<p>A critical hit will bypass a targets defense and evasion.</p>\n\n<p>Inventory:</p>\n<p>Press 'i' during the game to open your inventory or close it.</p>\n<p>The player has 8 slots free in their inventory.</p>\n<p>Items can be selected in the inventory using the up/down cursor keys.</p>\n<p>A selected inventory item can be equiped by pressing the 'u' key.</p>\n<p>Equiping an item will move it to slot 1 in the inventory and move all other slots down.</p>\n<p>Items in slots 1 and 2 are equiped and will contribute to the players stats.</p>\n<p>Im sorry this system is clunky and weak, it was rushed for the deadline.</p>\n<p>Potions can be used at any time (with the 'u' key) to recover some HP.</p>\n<p>You can drop items from your inventory by selecting them and pressing 'd'.</p>\n\n<p>Enemies:</p>\n<p>- Goblins are weak creatures with weak attack.</p>\n<p>- Ogres are strong creature with weak attack but hightened senses.</p>\n<p>- Wraths will teleport to your location and attack you</p>\n<p>- Dwarves can smash walls to get to your location</p>\n<p>- Warlocks will spawn skeletons when your in their line of sight for too long</p>\n<p>- Skeletons are tough creature spawned by warlocks</p>\n<p>- Mimics...\u00a0 Does that item looks a bit weird to you?</p>\n<p>- Vampires will retreat when their health is low and recover hp over time</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T05:51:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5be/5be7e152e7c109ab35aeadb011894d19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bithack"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
