And not a year after the first game was brought to Newgrounds, I, midgetsausage, decided to overhaul the game...\u00a0<em>again.</em></p>\n<p>Featuring whole new cutscenes, whole new backgrounds, and some other cool changes while still retaining the same gameplay and, roughly, the same story. As always, we hope you enjoy the changes as much as we enjoyed making them!</p>\n<p>\u200e\u00a0\u200e\u00a0</p>\n\r\nNOTES?\r\n<p>Obviously, you know, you can't play this on mobile; and as mentioned\u00a0in the title and as you start the game,\u00a0<strong>THIS IS A DEMO!</strong>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>If you have any suggestions, complaints, bugs/glitches you found, yada yada, please let us know.
