Welcome to\u00a0 Michael Collects Tax Money!</p>\n<p>You play as Michael, You must collect Tax Money! but at the same time avoid Mr NoTax's Workers, who if they hit you 5 times you die, so be carful!</p>\n<p>Collect all the money and you win!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Right now the game is in VERY early development, so that's why there is only 1 level, 1 type of enemy, and only one thing to collect, Once I get Clickteam fusion 2.5 Full version, then there will be a full story, more items to collect, and more enemy's, even 3 endings! but that'll have to wait, because right now I don't have the full version, so uh- enjoy this prototype i guess?</p>\n<p>If you wish to contact me, then my email is\u00a0fdfhdgfgsf@gmail.com and yes, I'm aware it's basically keyboard spam, but i created the email when i was very young, anyway, go ahead and send me an email there if you have any suggestions, ideas, or really just anything!</p>\n<p>See you on the flipside!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T07:50:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71e/71e9ea5e87508ce018899455aaae4766.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mf32s"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
