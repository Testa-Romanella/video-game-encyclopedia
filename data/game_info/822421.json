I appreciate all comments/criticism. This was made for the GMTK Game Jam 2022 with the theme being 'roll of the die'.<br/><br/>Made by Gnarbro. <br/><br/>Controls: <br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Move with left and right arrows.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Jump with space bar. Hold down jump to jump higher. Press jump in the air to double jump.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Press the down arrow to fall faster.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Momentum carries through portals. <br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If you jump into the arrow boosters from below and hold down space bar they will boost you really high. You have to jump into these to get your double jump out of them. <br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Reach the smiling bean to beat the level!<br/></p>\n<p>Info:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This is my first game jam and I started developing at the start of summer. I am really happy to get anything out for this contest... even if its rough around the edges. If anyone would like to team up for this game jam next year, please reach out to me. I should be much better are game development by then. <br/></p>\n<p>The theme:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Since the theme of this game jam was roll of the dice, I wanted to play around with randomizing stuff as much as possible. The 1st level has nothing randomized. The 2nd level has portals randomize the levels gravity every time you go through them. The 3rd level has the saw blade movement randomized (these are not glitched, but they sure look like they are lol). The final level is randomly generated, sometimes this level is impossible - sorry. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T16:01:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/373/373ff550e3ddd140bc55b04d0353080d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Gnarbro"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
