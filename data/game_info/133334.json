I used a few of the graphics from the Yoyo games demonstration projects and made the rest. - The sounds are all me making goofy sounds or eating Oreos.</p>\n\n<p>Click the towers from top right and drop them in the sandy areas along the river.</p>\n<p>Once you click start, the Crunchy Pirates will move from the entry point to your base. If they reach your base, they will trade 1 of their health for 1 of yours until they die or until you die.</p>\n<p>Blue towers shoot bullets, red towers a jet of flames.</p>\n<p>No upgrades, etc., this was built in 21 hours for the 2017 Shenanijam. \u00a0</p>\n<p>I wanted to have tower upgrades, etc., but I need more experience with Game Maker before I try tackling that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Most everything is variable-driven already so updating those variables through upgrades should be easier.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>This was a lot of fun.
