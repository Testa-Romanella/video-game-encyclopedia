You play as Frank; an eccentric fellow who wakes up one day and decides to hug people in his birthday suit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0I built this game to familiarize myself a little bit with\u00a0coding (movement, and some simple ai and collisions), and to draw sprite assets and use them. This is also the first time I've ever drawn pixel art.</p>\n\n<p>The goal is to hug as many as possible, but I've never gotten to 100 without cheating.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cae/caec7d39d29ee79b9bab0a855e00db7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["King0fCasual"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
