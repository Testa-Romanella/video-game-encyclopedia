Also better graphics will come with time. There will also be a story where you are not just fighting these enemies but trying to figure out what happened in this crystal realm.</p>\n<p>Feel free to try it out and tell me what else you would love to see in this game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T10:49:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/675/675d686cc2a4eb6df0b5f70a38473243.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Atahan"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
