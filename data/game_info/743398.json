The goal of the project was to make advanced interactive characters using a combination of realistic joint physics, soft body physics, skin-accurate collisions, and advanced rendering techniques. The characters can come alive by capturing and storing motion capture from off-the-shelf VR equipment like the Vive or Oculus controllers and trackers. The characters will react to your movements or objects you control in a realistic manner.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-06T22:38:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/981/9810a17362d8e881786a63db9f7c75a7.jpg", "website": "https://hub.virtamate.com/whats-new/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
