Join your friends, stealth your way through Victorian-Era streets and Pickpocket your way to the top. Stay vigilant as other thieves will be out and about, ready to steal your rewards or as easy marks to increase your stash. Avoid the Bobbies, vanish from the light and disappear with your ill-gotten goods by daybreak.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2605 Multiplayer Battle Online<br/>\r\nHost a night of thievery with your friends or use their code to join a battle on their ground. Challenge them on a map including docks, taverns and a jail with masses of routes to test your stealth. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2605 Spot your Marks and Plan your route<br/>\r\nRace to hit a mark or draw out other thieves and swing the stick. Your cunning choices are up to you. Bait thieves into a trap or load up on loot and stash it away. Learning the map, and your opposition while building your strategies can reward the sneakiest to the most alert players.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2605 Visual and Audio Stealthing <br/>\r\nWhile you may be nearly invisible in the dark, the light and actions of stealing can give away your position. Beware! The more loot you have the more sound you will make! Attract the opposition and they may come to take your coin. Stashing your coins gives you a quieter step, but did anyone see where you dropped your stash?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-24T02:47:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df6/df6021070fbfa2850c8c9b7bd4544b21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Amythica", "Stout Heart Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Amythica"], "esrb_rating": null}
