In the first room you arrive in Egypt near the pyramids. You see a cat which is a clue for later.<br/>2. In the second room you walk closer to a pyramid and\u00a0learn the time from a turtle, 2250 B.C.\u00a0 There is a walkway that leads you into the pyramid.<br/>3. Immediately inside the pyramid is a room with torches which you can pick up, mummies, and a sarcophagus. One mummy tells you about the pyramids while another one tries to scare you.<br/>4. In the next room you can walk around and you learn some interesting information, then return to the last room before continuing along.\u00a0<br/>5. In the next room there are drawings on the wall and a couple of camels. They tell you more of the history of the time period when the pyramids were built.<br/>6. Lastly, you exit the pyramid and run into the cat from the beginning. It reveals that it can time travel and is the reason why you got here. You can climb on top of the pyramids and meet a talking tree before leaving and getting your last clue when you exit this room.</p><p>I used McCloud's concepts of abstraction when making the avatar and sprites that are supposed to look like mummies. McCloud says that when you see a shape, every one can be made into a face, which he does by adding eyes to squiggly shapes. (pg. 32). I agree with this and hope that other people can see that with the avatar and mummies, as well as everything else. But if you just imagine eyes on them then they become easier to identify.\u00a0 In room 5, I used McCloud's timeframe concept to convey that it was a long passageway. He says, \"The panel shape can actually make a difference in our perception of time, even though this long panel has the same basic 'meaning' as its shorter versions, still it has the feeling of greater length.\" (pg. 101). Under this he shows the difference between a long panel and a short panel and how the sense of time is different between the two. I specifically used this in room 5, the same long horizontal type panel. But you can also get this sense in other rooms as well.\u00a0</p><p>Lessons I took from the theme park videos and readings that helped me design are to look at the real thing but also use your imagination. I did this by looking at pictures of pyramids and camels before drawing them instead of just going off my memory. They also talked about creativity and referenced several Disney movies which helped my imagination. They mentioned and showed some environments that had lots of visual elements that really added to the experience, so I tried to all visual details to each room to make it more immersive. I actually wanted to add more background details but when I did that in room 3 it ended up feeling a little crowded so I did not end up doing it to every room. The theme park videos were super inspiring and really interesting! I tried to include as much as I\u00a0could but ultimately the execution of my game was not as interesting as I hoped it would be. But I do think I incorporated the lessons especially in most of the rooms.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T08:58:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2bc/2bc00018f20f900946826a3dc185714f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lilastudio"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
