Are you up to the challenge? <br/><br/><br/>'Pigeon: A Love Story' is a 'slow game' in which you take on the role of a pigeon searching for their pigeon-shaped soulmate in the city of London, home of over one million pigeons. To keep the game as accurate (and difficult) as possible, both the scale of the city itself - and the pigeon count within it - have been made as accurate as possible.<br/><br/><br/>This relaxing, meditative game with a loose objective is perfect for those looking for a moment of pigeon-based escapism. With soothing gameplay and a calming soundtrack, this is a game that's most definitely more about the journey.<br/><br/><br/>FEATURES:<br/><br/><br/>- Fly across a real-size map of London.<br/>- Save and load your session; no need to finish it in one sitting, thankfully.<br/>- Interact with over 1,000,000 NPC pigeons in the hope of finding the one you are looking for.<br/>- Features offline mode with procedurally generated city.<br/>- Using Google's Maps SDK for Unity, the map of London is to scale and fully explorable, featuring 3D models and place names of key landmarks.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T07:02:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76d/76d548ac389ab85244a241f3860cbd67_EYR1feq.jpg", "website": "https://www.wristwork.com/press/pigeon-a-love-story/index.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 251, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Alexander Taylor"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Alexander Taylor"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
