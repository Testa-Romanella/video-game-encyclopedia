But<br />\ndire challenges await even the most stalwart adventurers in Etrian<br />\nMystery Dungeon, a turn-based action RPG roguelike developed by ATLUS<br />\nand Spike Chunsoft.</p>\n<p>The Nintendo 3DS\u2122 exclusive mixes Etrian Odyssey\u2019s vast RPG party and<br />\nskill customization aspects, and Mystery Dungeon\u2019s infinitely random<br />\ndungeon adventures. The action/turn based combat means that battling<br />\nmonsters is not just about using the right skills, but becomes an<br />\nelegant Pas de Quatre of strategic positioning. Players form their<br />\nparties with familiar Etrian Odyssey classes, customize individuals<br />\nusing Etrian-style skill trees, and then take up to four members into<br />\nthe dungeons. Always randomized with various levels and paths, the<br />\ndungeons require plenty of exploration, not to mention the incredible<br />\nloot rewards -- just be wary of what waits among the deepest depths.</p>", "metacritic": 77, "released": "2015-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-12T19:49:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/403/4030ddfe15fa6a90199a62c1ec6e6223.jpg", "website": "http://www.atlus.com/etrianmd/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 3, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 9, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo 3DS"], "developers": ["Atlus"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Atlus"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
