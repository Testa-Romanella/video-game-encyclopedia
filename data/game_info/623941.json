By pushing and pulling them about within the dungeon, arrange five letters horizontally to form a word, while fighting off killer, blood-red, blood-thirsty, Ampersand zombies.

Possible side effects: vivid ASCII nightmares and/or loss of lunch.</p>\n<p>Use your standard keyboard arrow keys or directional\u00a0 buttons, L, U, D, R, to move your player character into available spaces and to push letters. Your player will shoot Ampersand zombies automatically when the appropriate direction keys/buttons are pressed/clicked/tapped. If you want to shoot in any direction from a fixed position, toggle shooting mode on and off with the escape key or S button.</p>\n<p>If, when pushing a letter, you get it stuck in a corner or against a wall, use the space bar, G button to grab it and move it in any available direction, When five letters are arranged horizontally to form a legitimate English word, you win.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T09:55:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b1/3b174ebfb420b8e723c17afc523e0376.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["horan"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
