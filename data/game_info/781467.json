British Columbia.\u00a0Out of matches in the near future.<br/>As a result of the explosion of the Yellowstone volcano, most of the globe was affected, which led to a huge extinction of human civilization. You are one of the few who survived the explosion. Your goal is to survive. Using the last match you found in your pocket, you start a fire in a furnace that powers a magnet you previously used as a hobby to find valuable resources.
