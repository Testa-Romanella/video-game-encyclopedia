We are not a grid based game like most other jigsaw puzzle games. The puzzle is free floating and you can connect any two neighboring pieces at any location on the screen. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe jigsaw puzzles will come in 16, 64, and 256 piece sizes. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou may select from small or large puzzle piece sizes. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs a promise from the developer - this game will never contain paid DLC or ads. If new puzzles are added then you will receive them. If new modes, features, or content is added then you will receive it for free.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d38/d3821d1e46171d04f13bf4ff24b5cc29.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 51, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Timothy Findling"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Timothy Findling"], "esrb_rating": null}
