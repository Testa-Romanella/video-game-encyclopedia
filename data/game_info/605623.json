Ellie was captured by the robots along with bunch of animals. However, they underestimated Ellies capabilities and now face a prison break.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn StreamSkate you traverse through neon lit facility by utilizing special gear assigned to you. These include magnetic rollerblades designed to be used for wall sliding and gauntlets that give an ability to grapple on to certain objects. With these tools you can access different areas where all animals have scattered. Sometimes it is not tech but instead agility that is required to move forward and a quick ground slide is all that is required. All interactable surfaces are recognizable by their green coloring. Once you have discovered all animals and escorted them to their next destination, you can escape together through the white hallway.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game was produced by a small student group from Ahlman Institute within 8 weeks. Development used students from both game technology and visual game design.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T03:22:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c97/c978d388bf7136c76f5fdc4a70fbc562.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pengu Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Ahlman Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
