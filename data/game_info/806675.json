If you crash you just get rescued.<br/><br/>It's a relaxing game. Very low stress.<br/><br/>Do little missions to help your friends out or just fly around and explore. Help terraform Mars. There are computer controlled pilots flying around too. Sometimes they break down and need rescuing. Don't worry about crashing into anything, you'll get rescued.<br/><br/>On harder modes you have limited fuel so you will need to find efficient ways to reach other planets (watching the computer controlled rockets will help).<br/><br/><br/><br/>Suitable for kids (my 6 year old plays), gameplay is completely free from violence., it is all about helping your friends.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T03:52:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e81/e815b91d299545612f2675a51f2168ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["last_one_in", "James Wilder"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["James Wilder"], "esrb_rating": null}
