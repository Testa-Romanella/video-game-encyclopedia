Explore the world, find hidden gems, solve puzzles and navigate deadly traps. Become the ultimate ninja gardener.</p>\n<p>This is a game designed to be completed in about half an hour, but is designed to be as much of a speed-runable game as I could make in a week. The whole point of the game is figuring out how to beat the game quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<p>It's designed to be a test of both a players platforming skill, puzzle solving skill, routing skill and sequence break finding skills. The game has a few quirks that can be exploited, and any exploits I found I left in. There are also deliberate hidden passages and rooms required for a 100% playthrough</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong> <strong>15/01/17</strong> <strong>12:00 GMT: </strong>Fixed a bug with 100% run, updated time text to H:M:S format.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/524/52442461b79eee6f265a33a7b6ce6585.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gee It Some Laldy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
