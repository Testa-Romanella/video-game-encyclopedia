{"id": 299182, "slug": "galactic-dream", "name": "Galactic Dream", "name_original": "Galactic Dream", "description": "<p>This game is for the BlackThornProd Game Jam! The second one, to be exact! The theme was \"Mini Planets,\" and so, after a surprisingly short period of thinking, I came up with the idea to make a \"Conquerer\" game where an entire galaxy is entirely randomly generated; creating 50 planets, 500 asteroids, 5 major trading posts, and ~3 suns! The objective of the game is to get all planets conquered, or having each planet have their entire population be on your side!\u00a0<em>Make sure to read down below to know how to play the game! I was unable-- due to time-- to create a How To Play, although I really wanted to.</em></p>\n<p>This is actually my first full game (Well, kinda. It's the first game I've published!) The game is made in the Blender Game Engine! Yep, that one game engine nobody knew was in Blender and is now completely dead, because as of 2.8, BGE will no longer be a part of Blender. Rest in peace, BGE.</p>\n<p>This game, while supposed to use 1 week to create, was created in about 42 hours, due to a whole bunch of stuff! It was a real challenge, and, unfortunately, some parts of the game might show that I didn't have much time to create this. But I'm still really proud of the end product!</p>\r\nHow to play:\r\n<p><strong>Controlling your ship:\u00a0</strong>To make your ship move, hold down Left Click!\u00a0If you want to really boost, holding Left Click and [Spacebar] will make the ship accelerate very quickly! Be wary though, as you have a limited amount of this boost, signified by the blue bar at the top of the screen. You cal also use the Right Mouse Button to fire small lasers; but there is a limited amount of ammo! You can get more by buying more or by getting drops from defeated enemies and destroyed asteroids! Also, using [Left Shift] will slow your ship down, like a braking system!</p>\n<p><strong>O2, Supplies, and stuff!\u00a0</strong>At the top left of your screen is a light blue bar which will slowly deplete. This is O2, and in order to refill the bar you need to hover your cursor over the tiny blue O2 icons that will appear around you. They will appear frequently. The next bar is your supplies; This can only be refilled by picking up the supply pickup (Small box with a red cross) or by buying a full restock at a trading point.\u00a0On the other side of the screen are your People, Ammo, and Money stats. At the bottom left is a notification center, which will tell you things such as \"An Alien has Spawned,\" or \"You Have Conquered a Planet!\"</p>\n<p><strong>Conquering planets:</strong> The main goal of the game is to conquer each and every planet in the galaxy. To do this, you need to take people from planets and relocate them to unconquered planets, where RNG will slowly decide whether or not a planet will be taken over. The more people you have on your side on a planet, the more likely it is to be conquered. However, leaving planets totally out in the open is not a good idea, as while you get more allies, invader ships will appear and attempt to invade your planets. The less people on a planet, the more likely it is to be taken over. So place your people wisely. Use the scroll wheel while hovering to add and subtract the amount of allies on a planet. You can add and subtract more at once by holding\u00a0 [Left Shift] as you scroll.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Aliens and hostile planets:\u00a0</strong>A planet in the galaxy has a chance to be spawned as a hostile planet, indicated by the red square when you hover over the planet. When hostile, a planet can spawn enemies that will shoot at you right away, so keep moving if you intend to conquer a hostile planet. As you get closer to galactic rule, the chance of aliens spawning will increase. Aliens are stronger versions of enemies that spawn from hostile planets that will spawn randomly anywhere in the galaxy and will hunt down the player. An invader ship can also spawn, which will target the nearest planet and invade it.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Beacons:\u00a0</strong>You can place a beacon by pressing [B]. A small blue arrow will always point to the beacon.\u00a0 You cannot remove a beacon once it is placed! When a planet is invaded a small green arrow will point to the invaded planet. A large red arrow will always point to the nearest unconquered planet.<br/></p>\r\nStuff to know...\r\n<p>Blender Game Engine is not very\u00a0optimized, meaning scene changes and minor stuff can cause a tiny bit of lag. One major con is when hovering over a trading post the game will lag a little bit, making it difficult to double click. This is the fault of poor optimization and-- should I decide to update this game-- will be fixed.</p>\n<p>If the program states that it is not responding, then just be patient. All programs do this when they have to think about a lot of stuff.</p>\n<p>Since very little time could be spent on this game and was solo developed, the game may feature some unintended bugs, low quality and some lackluster parts. If any bugs or errors occur, please leave a comment stating what happened and I will see what I can do!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-04T04:37:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f1/2f127cd4218c454c070f2bd27eeab4b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KolbyWithaK"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
