It's just a tutorial section, but what the game tells you to do, is not the only solution. You still do what you want to do.</p>\n<p>Took me about 2-3 days of fixing bugs and trying out new things. This is my first jam with\u00a0Unity.</p>\n<p>Controls are arrow keys and shift to jump :) Jump high to avoid arrows and there are secret paths.<br/><br/>In order to see different endings, you must find all gotcha's or find none of them.<br/><br/>Known Bugs:<br/>- Camera goes back and forth when staying in the middle of scenes. A bit intentional.<br/>- If you don't play on fullscreen, some text is out of screen. That's on my part, sorry.<br/>- An audio glitch in HTML5. I\u00a0don't know why that happens...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T05:50:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e5/5e5e7233d250c4aef79f9bbf033becb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tharky"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
