The design of the level is following the staircase principle where the levels become more challenging when they complete the levels.</p>\n<p>It took us 20 hours collectively to complete this project, this is our second game jam, but this is the first time we actually managed to complete and submit a game, we know there are a lot of areas to work on\u00a0even though we have only a little bit of experience in game developing, but we are proud with what we came up with. So please enjoy this game and provide us with some feedback on how we can improve ourselves, stay safe everyone and have fun.</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0Left and Right arrow keys</p>\n<p>Assets used:<br/></p>\n<p>Gear sound for turning right and left -\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0JLnzLDeZ8</p>\n\n<ul><li>Supendi\u00a0LinkedIn</li><li>Muhammad Anshari Ramadhan\u00a0LinkedIn</li><li>Farhan Almandho\u00a0LinkedIn</li><li>Muhammad Danial Wahab\u00a0LinkedIn</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T04:15:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e6/6e65e25d378c2bc8b2a338611b652f43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["supendi"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
