You can use 'up_arrow', 'W' or 'space' for jumping!</p>\n<p>In order to survive, you must get rid of the blocks in the bottle or you will suffocate otherwise!</p>\n<p>By selecting full lines of the same color blocks, you can free-up some space and earn some points!</p>\n<p>In order to select lines, left click using your mouse from each end of a line.
