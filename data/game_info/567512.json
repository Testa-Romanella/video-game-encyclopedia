I chose this as I wanted to drop the player into a world with multiple choices inside that change which of the endings the player will receive. It also encourages repeatability to explore which set of choices will lead to the better endings. I also wanted the choices to be more subtle, a player might not realize that an item has multiple uses unless they come across the situations first.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T09:50:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5cb/5cb5fed475f736eb69dc0b806c05ea7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["oconneb3"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
