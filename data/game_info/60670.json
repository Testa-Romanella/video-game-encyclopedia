The enemy has made only a single error: underestimating you.<br/><br/>You must steal as much technology as you can, and take enough territory to fortify your bases and launch your attacks.  But every conquest you make turns the attention of the AI ever more in your direction... so choose your targets with care.<br/><br/>It's \"a sequel to [Arcen's] enormo-space RTS AI War, which we called'one of this year's finest strategy games' back in 2009\" (Tom Sykes, PC Gamer)What's New?We still have a lot of work to do on the game, and we're undergoing some major work with our beta testers before heading to Early Access, but a lot is already awesome:<br/><br/><ul><li>The game is crazy moddable. <br/></li><li>It's multithreaded to take full use of modern computers. <br/></li><li>The new 3D graphics are working out great.<br/></li><li>The UI has already been dramatically improved by the introduction of a tabbed sidebar in the main view, and streamlining of several other mechanics that felt very difficult in the past.  More to come, there.<br/></li><li>We\u2019ve got art for over 130 distinct units (not counting different mark levels), and there's more to come.<br/></li><li>We\u2019ve got over 1500 lines of spoken dialogue from more than 25 actors, focusing primarily on the human side at the moment; we have a few hundred lines of AI-side taunts and chatter, some of which is recorded but just not processed yet. <br/></li><li>There are hundreds of high quality sound effects for a varied battlefield soundscape (with distance attenuation if you\u2019re far away, and positional 3D audio if you\u2019re down in the thick of it), all routed through a tuned mixer setup for optimal listening to all the various parts. <br/></li><li>We have a set of music from Classic that is over four and a half hours long, and the new music from Pablo is partly in, but mostly set to be mastered and integrated within the next week or two. <br/></li><li>There\u2019s also a ton of map types, many of them new, and with a lot of sub-options to make them even more varied. <br/></li><li>And a whole lot more.</li></ul><br/>Wishlist the game to be notified when it becomes available!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T09:46:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a34/a34bc816e30ce3036ae416bd66549fef.jpg", "website": "https://arcengames.com/aiwar2/", "rating": 2.17, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 45, "owned": 576, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 5}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 255, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Arcen Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Arcen Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
