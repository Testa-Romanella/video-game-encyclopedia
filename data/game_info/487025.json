Collect different gems to increase your HP or time left. If you find your time bar running low, blow up a barrel to maybe find a gem that will reset the bar and time, or to find another surprise.\u00a0Be careful of the aliens and the traps and watch for a button that will disable the traps for 10 seconds.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls are left, right and down arrow keys or WASD to move with down arrow or S to crouch. Spacebar to jump and left or right CTRL to shoot. ESC to pause and Q to quit but only when you reach the end. You can also get an extra jumping boost by crouching and then jumping.</p>\n<p>Blue Gems give you 1 extra second, orange gems reset your time(usually found in barrel), green gems give you 5 seconds where you can't die unless you fall off, pink looking gems give you 1 HP, and yellow gems give you 5 HP(usually dropped by alien).\u00a0</p><p>Additional sound effects from\u00a0https://www.zapsplat.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T03:31:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b6/6b6e5d3a75dba49e16e02687114e53b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Seven-Wide"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
