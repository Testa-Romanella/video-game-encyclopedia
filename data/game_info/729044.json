Any time you make an action, so do your adversaries! Navigate the board carefully, plan your steps accordingly, and reach the exit. Click on the cards to choose your action. Each action comes with another action that affects your enemies. You play as the lone dark-blue Pawn against the light-yellow Chess Pieces. Reach the glowing tile to finish the level.</em></p>\n\r\nHow to play\r\n\r\nSelect a card to move your Pawn on the grid\r\n\r\nEvery card moves your enemys, too. If an enemy steps on your tile, the game is over\r\n\r\nSome cards even let the enemys attack surrounding grid tiles\r\n\r\nThe goal is to reach the glowing tile\r\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p><strong>3D Models</strong>\u00a0- Pia<br/><strong>VFX, Animation\u00a0</strong>- Lukas (me)<br/><strong>Programming</strong>\u00a0- Franzi<br/><strong>Programming\u00a0</strong>- Tobi\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Music </strong>-\u00a0Daniel Harrison<br/><strong>Chess Font</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0<em>Chess Mark</em><br/><strong>UI Icons</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0<em>Wishforge</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Used SFX</em>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Opening the sarcophagus\r\n</li><li>cleaver.mp3\r\n</li><li>Bone Breaker 1\r\n</li><li>Swoosh.ogg\r\n</li><li>Sword Contact (with swipe)\r\n</li><li>Swoosh\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>We didn't manage to get everything in we've wanted or worked on, like multiple levels with increasing difficulty, more enemy types, polished end-game UI and so on.
