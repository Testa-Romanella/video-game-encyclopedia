Simply tilt your Wii Remote controller \n      to navigate a series of exciting and twisted mazes. Entering the maze \n      could not be easier, but finding your way out will require a keen eye \n      and a steady hand. Obstacles and traps are around every corner, so move \n      your ball around the maze without falling off the edge. But watch out, \n      there are lots of surprises in store. You can hunt for gems in a timed \n      challenge, or test your abilities in a race against the clock. The \n      Incredible Maze is also compatible with the Wii Balance Board, so you \n      can really put your weight into it. This is the way in, but you\u2019ll have \n      to find your own way out.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:38:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25e/25e6060f31b60ec9ae26a9a2a7a5ff82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Digital Leisure"], "esrb_rating": null}
