Mobile devices aren't supported well. The game might not work on mobile. This was made for the first ever game jam I participated in. The \"Weekly Game Jam 147\" on itch.io This was just an attempt to learn how game jams work. Nothing special. The theme is 'Invisible'. I don't expect to win anything but it was fun trying this out. Been a while since I used Sploder so I decided this would be a great chance to give it a go. You play as a Robot named Bobo. He needs to find all the coins but they're invisible. Can you help him find them all in a timely manner?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T02:21:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24e/24e49d4287e863c54c0c6b3d7ca9b5a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Johnny Shumway"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
