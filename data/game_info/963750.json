You have collected the seeds and are now patiently growing the garden.<br/>The mechanics of the game are simple - collect the grown fruits and discover new plants. A space bug will interfere with you in the process, but it's realistic to cope (although it has the ability to slow down time).<br/><br/><br/><br/>Features:<br/>- nice graphics;<br/>- simple controls;<br/>- interesting gameplay;", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-21T06:15:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95d/95da541497bbced1b37940035a71848f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Game Sunlight"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["STuNT"], "esrb_rating": null}
