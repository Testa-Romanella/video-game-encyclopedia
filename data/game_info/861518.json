I made the basic mechanics in an hour and polished the game for less then 2. This small project was fun to work on because I didn't code in a while and it was a nice refresher. This is basically a dumber version of Pong where you have to get the highest score possible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pong + pogger = Pongger</p>\n\n<p>I am going to add a couple QoL updates and maybe new feature or mode.
