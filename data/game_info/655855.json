The boss also mentioned something about rats living in the building. doing most of the chaos. Your job is to clean up the mess the previous janitor has left and eradicated all rats.<br/></p>\n<p>Or is it your job? The game contains two endings so try to get both!</p>\n\n<p><strong>We've managed to fix several annoying issues that were noticed by the community.</strong> Sadly, because of the nature of the jam, we can't upload a patch normally on itch.io. <strong>If you want to play more stable version</strong>, you have to download the game from this place.<br/></p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\n</p>\n<p>Just a few tips for new players:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>You steer by using buttons WASD and a mouse (only left click)\u00a0\r\n</li><li>You kill rats by throwing objects at them.\r\n</li><li>For every destroyed item you get a \"Mistakes\" point, for killing rats you lost \"Mistakes\" points\r\n</li><li>You also have to clean up dirt, stains and move boxes to the correct places. The game tells you everything, including where they are! You just have to look around you!\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Recommended PC specification:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Ram:\u00a0</strong>2-4 Gb, the game needs to allocate around 1 Gb of memory.\r\n</li><li><strong>OS:\u00a0</strong>Windows 10, 64 bits\r\n</li><li><strong>CPU:\u00a0</strong>Something that can handle windows 10 rather well.\r\n</li><li><strong>Space:\u00a0</strong>600 Mb of free space (plus around 220 Mb for the zip file) will be enough.\r\n</li><li><strong>GPU:\u00a0</strong>Not necessarily fast GPU, but something rather new (Let's say, something that was new back in 2015, like gtx 950). The graphics card should have at least 2 GB of VRAM (memory).\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T19:38:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/406/406cdc9db1510d18b1f54d9f73e2a295.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hrober"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
