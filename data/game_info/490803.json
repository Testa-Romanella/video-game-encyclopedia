It is a slow paced pure walking simulator; you only walk, slowly, in the wilderness away from civilization. A beautiful poem from Julius Cawein accompanies your short journey; and the original music score that is composed by P\u0131nar Karaba\u015f.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPS: The core aspect of this game is the atmosphere. It is recommended for those who mostly seek to experience the mood.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-08T20:26:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b6/7b6ebbf12678bf2daec14444c049ac9c.jpg", "website": "https://tongucbodur.myportfolio.com/pluviophile", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 5, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 350, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tongu\u00e7 Bodur"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Tongu\u00e7 Bodur"], "esrb_rating": null}
