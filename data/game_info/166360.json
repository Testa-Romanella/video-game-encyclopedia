Since there is no wire guidance, once you launch the torpedo it has a mind of its own, and then its up to the ship and torpedo AI to see who can outsmart the other.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD -Acceleration/turning</p>\n<p>Control/Spacebar - Elevation</p>\n<p>E - Torpedo</p>\n<p>R - Toggle active/passive sonar</p>\n<p>F - Toggle silent mode</p>\n<p>1,2,3- Toggle camera modes</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b60/b6049d6648750dcc07a90d1abba3915f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["ELord"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
