Each species will eat different food sources at different life stages, and predators will need prey to hunt. Remember to place animals of both sexes if you want them to reproduce. The island has fresh water ponds, which you should place animals near since they cannot drink from the ocean; large grown animals can go longer without drinking.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>A,S,W,D: move camera</p>\n<p>Middle Mouse: Rotate camera</p>\n<p>Mouse Scroll: Zoom camera<br/></p>\n<p>Left Mouse: Select/Place dino</p>\n<p>Right Mouse: Deselect dino<br/></p>\n<p>Space: pause game</p>\n<p>Esc: menu</p>\n<p>H: hide the UI.</p>\n\n<p>The animal limit can be controlled in game, and there is an FPS counter to help determine a good animal limit for your computer.<br/></p>\n<p>You can load custom music by placing a folder named \"Music\" under \"DinosariaAlpha1Win_Data\\StreamingAssets\" folder and then add music files of types .wav or .ogg.<br/></p>\n<p>Planned Dinosaurs:</p>\n<p>Ankylosaurus, Argentinosaurus, Baryonx, Brachiosaurus, Carnotaurus, Compsognathus, Deinynochus, Dilophosaurus, Gallimimus, Iguanodon ,Kentrosaurus, Ouranosuarus ,Oviraptor, Pachycephalosaurus, Parasaurolophus, Protoceratops, Spinosaurus, Stegosaurus, Styracosaurus, Triceratops, Troodon, Tyrannosaurus Rex</p>\n<p>The AI is currently simple enough for it to meet basic needs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The save system is not yet finished.</p>\n<p>The dinosaurs do not yet have sounds.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58d/58d89490557914833b95c679830bf2a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["McShooterz"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
