I don't want to say much about how this level is going to be integrated with the first part but I have it all planed out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My ultimatum of the project is to convert it in VR if it gets enough support till then i will be making tweaks here and there. Since, my current pc can barely build my project and closes after every command is given the development will be slow. I hope till then you like this project. :)</p>\n\n<p>You can contact me at aayushksingh97@gmail.com if you want. Thanks for viewing this, have a nice day.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb3/fb3fc0802ba666a1c7b5b958d83cae39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["aks97"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
