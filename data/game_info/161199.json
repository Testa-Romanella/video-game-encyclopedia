Hardcore action gamers are advised.\u00a0<br/><br/>This is our first completed Ludum Dare game, and I am pretty inexperienced in game making. If I make any mistakes, please tell me in constructive manner, thank you :)\u00a0<br/><br/>Why does this game suits the LD#28 theme?\u00a0<br/>You only get one shot... to save one life...\u00a0<br/><br/>Synopsis:\u00a0<br/>You were on your way to buy your last Christmas Gift to your daughter who is ill. Your daughter requires a surgery which is too expensive for you to afford. Suddenly, your desperate wife calls you stating that she had stolen diamonds from a gang group. You have only one shot in your gun to shoot down the man who is trying to assasinate your wife. Will you succeed or will fate play its part in this undermining situation?\u00a0<br/><br/>I am very sorry for not being able to port over to Mac OS/X as I do not have it myself and I have work on the day.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c27/c2775fba7ae7426b439fd6729d78b0bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NikorasuChan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
