{"id": 114113, "slug": "enkindle", "name": "Enkindle (itch)", "name_original": "Enkindle (itch)", "description": "<p><em>Enkindle </em>is a 3D, open map RPG in which the player takes on the role of a phoenix that blooms to life in a forest held in winter's icy grasp. The player can fly through the forest, melting the snow with every pass of their wings and transforming the wintery landscape. The player has a semblance of control over how the forest will bloom; with each touch, the colors change - a tree covered in barely-grown leaves will flower and bloom as the player flies through it, and another touch to the tree's branches may yield another change to the golds and reds of fall. Though the player has a set time limit before the phoenix falls to ash, there are no mistakes to make or enemies to fight. The heart of <em>Enkindle </em>lies in how the player chooses to transform the landscape to their liking. Whatever the player chooses, in the end the camera pans over the newly shaped forest, a testament to the accomplishments made during their brief life.<br/></p><p>Please note that this is not a final release of the game; this is, in effect, a very advanced prototype, and will be improved upon.</p><p>Requirements:</p><p>-PC (with a discrete graphics card, not tested on integrated graphics) or Mac, mouse and keyboard<br/>-Headphones recommended</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/745/745aab11ca499ba4ee171c4c01b8b725.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Student Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
