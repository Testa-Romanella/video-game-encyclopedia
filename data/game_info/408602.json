The theme was \"REPAIR\". While the world is in full sprint, many of us are dealing with heart break and fond memories. That deep feeling is where this game stems from. Following our hearts to find fulfillment through embracing challenge is a difficult task when we are breaking down, but it's important to know we can always build ourselves back up.<br/></p>\n<p>Cheers to everyone who participated in Global Game Jam 2020, game devs and players alike!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-03T03:02:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78b/78bd849de3a73dc9e29c806660633d68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["newworldcircuit"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
