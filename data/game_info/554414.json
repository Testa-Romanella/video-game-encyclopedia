The relic is located in an old Aztec temple buried deep in the Amazon rainforest.</p>\n<p>The local tribesmen aren't willing to give up the relic so easily, and to complete your mission you must sneak past them without getting detected.</p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY<br/>----------------------</p>\n<p>The game uses standard WASD controls. The stealth indicator on your left will go up if you get detected, and if it reaches 100 the enemies will start to chase you and attack you. If you stay out of site and out of range of the enemies, your stealth meter will go back down and the enemies will resume their patrols. To complete the game you have to go past the guards through the temple and into the main room at the end, where you can go up to the artifact and press \"F\" to complete the game.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T09:39:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/492/4926b7aa850b2986609475472c32e7b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RiceWater13"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
