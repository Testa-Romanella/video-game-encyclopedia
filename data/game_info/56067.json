In online mode, the player can assume the role of gamemaster and create an online game for up to thirty-five other players. It is one of only four titles for the GameCube designed for online play. It is unique among these games in a number of ways. It is the only one where the GameCube itself acts as the server, rather than the player using a central server. It is also the only online GameCube game that isn't a Phantasy Star Online title, and the only one not to get a release outside Japan.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2005-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:40:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef0/ef03c587f49cedfadfd1119896e811a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["GameCube"], "developers": ["Chunsoft"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Chunsoft"], "esrb_rating": null}
