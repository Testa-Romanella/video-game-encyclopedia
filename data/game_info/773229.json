The combat rewards smart positioning and using skills appropriate to the situation on the battlefield, but at the same time it\u2019s more dynamic and less complicated than in similar titles.\r\n</p>\n<p>Between battles, the party traverses a pastel, absurd world where plants, animals and even objects behave like humans and fight each other for precious Bubbles. On their way, the heroes may encounter characters who need their help, factions in conflict with each other, and allies who will help them in battles.<br/></p>\r\nTactical combat\r\n<p>The game is rules-light, you\u2019re not going to find long statblocks and hour-long battles here. You may just hop in for a few fights any time!\r\n</p>\r\nSimple mechanics\r\n<p>Bubbleland is not crunchy, but you still have to think before you act. Cautious positioning of the heroes and planning your actions is crucial!</p>\r\nEngaging exploration\r\n<p>The treasures are waiting for you to discover them!
