In this case, the task was to create something in which something happens when the mouse is clicked so from that I developed a one click space invaders game. This is the second version of the prototype, after receiving feedback on my initial work.</p><p>The goal of the game is to destroy all invading shapes by clicking to shoot. Shooting also changes the direction of the player ship which is in continuous motion. </p><p>Created in Clickteam Fusion 2.5<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/874/874bc8d40f53aec4f4f0f013876ea077.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daniel Stokoe"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
