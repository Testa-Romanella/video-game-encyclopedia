In the final game, these stages will come after each boss is defeated. In this bonus stage, your goal is to collect as much donuts as you can for extra points and extra lives and get to the exit before the timer runs out. Every 50 Donuts would give you more time. This particular Bonus stage is a maze of sorts to give it some challenge. In the final game there will be much more detail and such.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The final game itself is going to be a sorta run &amp; gun platformer where your goal is to destroy the Alien Creatures that invaded the world and get to the Mysterious 10th Planet to find the source of these Aliens and take them out. Most levels will be a bit linear but some will be maze like, the game will have some SHMUP style levels towards the end.\u00a0 I anticipate to have this game done by either the end of this year or early next year.\u00a0 I am pretty much working on it myself but I'm more artist than programmer so there might currently be glitches in movement which I currently need to sort out. I also composed the music you're hearing on this. Feedback and or advice is appreciated.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T18:09:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/933/9332fd9f066eddb79f479447ee9a5f7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JUSXTREME96"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
