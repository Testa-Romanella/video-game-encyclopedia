You play as Charlie, an exiled Chocolate Bar who once tried to dispose of the king. One day you receive an anonymous letter asking you to once again take up the mantle of king killer. You must journey through candy land, facing foes along the way, using your stash of weapons from a revolt long forgotten. Once you reach the castle you must defeat the king once and for all. As the lifeless body of the king lays beneath your feet, the sender of the letter reveals themselves to be from the cult of the normal sized baby. They start an age old ritual to summon the baby and now you must defeat them, before the baby destroys candy land.</p>\n\n<p>Created By:</p>\n<p>Ace Lowder - Music</p>\n<p>Brendan Green - Art</p>\n<p>Chris Jabs - Programmer/Producer</p>\n<p>Wiwin Wijaya - Programmer/Lore</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T04:27:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edc/edc638e8534c39d12429e54d557dbcf4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wepw"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
