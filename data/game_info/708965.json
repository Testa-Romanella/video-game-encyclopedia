I unfortunately had very limited time to work on the game so I was unable to finish it. The idea is that when you play, the game will randomise various aspects of the game to be opposite to what you expect (eg: controls, gravity, direction of movement, camera, etc.) <br/></p>\n<p>Everything is quite dodgily implemented and so things may not work too great. The jumping is awful and frustrating, for instance. <br/></p>\n<p>I'll probably expand it and fix it up a bit in future. <br/></p>\n<p>Play it if you want, you won't miss out on much, though. <br/></p>\n<p>The game was made in unity.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T15:37:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9e/d9e771ea5b2eccb8e7cbd64a9a049fb4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["namesnotsteve"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
