Real men have two favourite things: cars and guns. And no stinking zombie apocalypse is going to change that. <br/><br/>Take control of your car to see how far you can get and how many zombies you can kill \u2013 and if you can actually escape with your brains intact.  6 cars are available to get you to the final fort, each capable of holding progressively more loot. Ranging from the simple Redneck pick-up and the classy Hunter and to the tough Sledge and frankly-silly Harvester, you\u2019ll enjoy throwing these bodged-up jalopies at the lines of the undead. <br/><br/>Each is highly customisable, with 15 upgrades including spiked bumpers, improved tyres, buffed engines, and more ammo, fuel and nitros. With 5 locations to traverse, handsome 3D graphics and gory shambling bodies, Zombie Derby is a killer game. How far can you get before they get YOU?<br/><br/>Game Features:<br/>- 6 killer cars to drive<br/>- 5 vast levels to explore<br/>- Massively customisable vehicles<br/>- Gory 3D graphics<br/>- Addictive gameplay<br/>______________________________________ <br/>Thanks for choosing Zombie Derby!
