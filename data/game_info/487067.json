Compete against a friend in an arena populated by NPCs. If you don't stay close to people, you die of loneliness. Be the last one standing in this strange competition!</p>\n<p>Why : When we first heard the theme (\"You Can't Do It Alone\"), we immediately thought of a cooperative game style, because human relationships were our main focus in the theme. But after some reflection we decided to make something more fun and competitive.</p>\n<p>This is when we thought of Follow Guys, a game where you have to be physically near an NPC to stay alive. If you're alone for too long, you die. This way to win the game you literally can\u2019t do it alone.\u00a0 And the multiplier aspect of the game brings a touch of competition, challenge\u00a0 and risk. It encourages players to move around the arena to pick up brocoli that ejects NPCs in a radius, and donuts that attract them. Use the items and physics to your advantage and defeat your opponent!</p>\n<p>All the assets were made by ourselves except for the animations which were picked in Adobe Mixamo.</p>\n<p>Vincent Carpintero P\u00e9rez (Vincenten3d)</p>\n<p>Eric Cloyd (Herald)</p>\n<p>Gabriel Jorge (KubbyDev)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T03:40:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5aa/5aa6d05cb5ee3f85828cb4fa5b0e8d49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vincenten3D"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
