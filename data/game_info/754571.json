Aside from those differences, the concept is identical to the Tile Puzzle game: you must tidy up all the loose ends, by rotating the tiles in-place. Use the left and right mouse buttons to rotate the tiles clockwise and counter-clockwise respectively.<br/></p>\n<p>Open-source project (MIT license):\u00a0https://gitlab.com/rsethc/connexagons<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T16:28:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff6/ff6bb0ed8a756ce71d765532e6d72638.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Glass Blade Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
