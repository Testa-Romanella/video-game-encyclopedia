You steer a mechanical tower riding on a circular track and have to defend yourself against hordes of enemies. You also have a big grabbing-arm with which you can block projectiles and pick up enemies. As you defeat more waves you get up to three new weapons.</p>\n<p><strong>Enemies</strong><br/>There are four enemies you will encounter:</p>\n<p><strong>Acydr</strong><br/><br/>Moves towards the player until in sufficient range and proceeds to charge a projectile to shoot the player with.</p>\n\n<p>Acydr is a sensitive boi. He doesn\u2019t like being around people and prefers a muddy swamp bath in his natural home: the primeval moors.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Voxyl</strong><br/><br/>Moves towards the player and explodes.</p>\n<p>The Voxyl species have met a terrible fate for centuries. A genetic mutation transformed the once free-spirited starfish into merciless explosives. Their grief afflicts those who feel safe. May you withdraw from their hugs.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Niflatur</strong><br/><br/>Continuously spawns his minions to attack the player.</p>\n\n<p>Who are the Niflature? What is a niflatur? Nobody knows! Rumor has it that it crawled out of a dark crevice and created the infamous Nifala Castle there. The rule of the Niflature is unchallenged and their territory is surrounded by an impenetrable mist. A real mystery!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Nifla</strong><br/><br/>Niflaturs minions that walk towards the player and attack on contact.</p>\n\n<p>The henchmen of the Niflature are just as incomprehensible as their creators. These restless creatures do not make a halt until they have fulfilled the most secret desires of their creators.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/>A, D - Move around the track</p>\n<p>Mouse - Steer the grabbing-arm</p>\n<p>Hold LMB - Grab with the grabbing arm</p>\n<p><strong>!IMPORTANT!</strong> if the screen size is incorrect (e.g. you can't see the whole screen) adjust it with the + and - keys.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T10:17:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/153/1533eaa3b55bb3e8efaf40c83d3c281d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["GameWolves"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
