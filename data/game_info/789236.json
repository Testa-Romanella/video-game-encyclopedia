You start with 10 health and cannot gain any. The goal is to get through as many floors and get as many points as possible. 500 points for each floor cleared, and 100 points for killing an enemy.\u00a0</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>W, A, S, D - Movement within the game and menus. If standing next to an enemy, moving towards them will kill them.</li><li>SPACE, RETURN -\u00a0 Select an option in the menus, as well as open the pause menu during gameplay.\u00a0</li></ul>\r\nEnemies:\r\n<p>The square-shaped enemies deal 2 damage and can attack you when standing on a tile\u00a0next to you. The circle-shaped enemies deal only 1 damage but can attack from 2 tiles away in any of the cardinal directions.\u00a0More enemies spawn on later floors.</p>\r\nMore Stuff:\r\n<p>This is more of a working prototype or demo than a full game, however it is fully playable in it's current form. I'm planning on making a better version with proper artwork and audio, as well as a new type of generation, an in-game tutorial and a story mode, however this version won't be finished until some time in the summer.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T20:27:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca2/ca228491512a7d32bbc723e30ce5fece.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Donian"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
