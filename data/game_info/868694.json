This game was created so that I could learn how to use the RPGD Bakin Engine basics. I made this game start to finish in four days.\u00a0I hope that this game is fun, but I apologize in advance if it's not. Either way thanks for giving it a shot. <br/><br/>The object of the game is to have as much Money as possible when you run out of time.\u00a0The countdown starts at 15 minutes, but battles will reduce the timer by set amounts and provide you with experience and Money. <br/><br/>You can activate resource nodes to get passive income, and then activate them again to convert resources directly. Energy turns into Food, which turns into Wood, which turns into Ore, which turns into Metal which ultimately you can sell for Money.</p>\n<p>Good luck, have fun and let's see how much money you can end the game with.</p>\n<p>Feel free to\u00a0post your final scores if you want to flex on the noobs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T10:06:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9e/a9ea94e74dc3c8841582d7f6f5c6732c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Drifty"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
