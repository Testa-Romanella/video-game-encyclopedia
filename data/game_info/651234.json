Easy? No! <br/>Having different ways to score makes this game as long or short as you want it. Shortest time. Longest time. Most bounces. There are a billion playing fields, but you can spend all night on just one trying to get a better score in just one category.<br/>Post a video of your result and compare it to others\u2019 results. Show your work, or no one will believe you.<br/>Place and rotate the bouncers: <br/><br/>To bounce the ball:<br/><br/>To avoid the obstacles:<br/><br/>To eventually hit the target at the bottom after bouncing around a lot.<br/>Young kids just like to watch the ball bounce around. Older kids and adults go for best scores.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T19:03:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f4/7f40b2013d7c36ef7f212d6ccd87d539.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ball Bounce Partnership"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ball Bounce Partnership"], "esrb_rating": null}
