You play as the protagonist trying to discover the mystery of amulets that allow for moving between different dimensions where reality can be very different from our own.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game is heavily story driven with management and character development aspects to drive the story and unlock content. There are dozens of girls, multiple dimensions, hundreds of scenes, images, and stories, with weeks and months of game play, even for the most avid player. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs a manager of the Dimensions VIP brothel, you need to ensure that you train the girls in sexual activities, give them items and experience they need to advance their careers, while at the same time balancing the finances and development of your house of pleasure. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThen, you need to make sure you uncover the secrets to the dimension amulets before it is too late...<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCross into dimensions where Aztecs still rule and sacrifice girls on the altars of fertility (don't worry, they worship life, not death), explore a world where men have been all but wiped out and women are horny due to a biological war, fight off Nazis in a reality where the Germans prevailed in World War II, and that's just the first three dimensions.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61e/61e00434b09f5913c4c0a0ff98aadc8c.jpg", "website": "https://dimensions.vip/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 437, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["MOBSoft Funstuff"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["MOBSoft Funstuff"], "esrb_rating": null}
