{"id": 904970, "slug": "pastel-melancholy", "name": "Pastel Melancholy", "name_original": "Pastel Melancholy", "description": "<p>A small town recovering from years of war, Ravenrock is full of problems unsolvable by ordinary folk. You take on the roles of unusual characters with unusual professions such as town witches, monsters hunters, and nobility cursed to perform good deeds. Each has a stake in protecting their town from terrible beasts, mysterious afflictions, and nosy neighbors. Have fun exploring a pastoral town full of magic, whimsy, and danger!</p>\n<p>Unlike <em>Ironsworn</em>, Pastel Melancholy is a curated experience with pre-made characters and locations. There are still plenty of choices to be made about each, but the intent of this book is to provide a solid foundation and provide a steady direction to grow.</p>\n<p>This book assumes you have access to Ironsworn and only includes new rules, assets, and moves. (You can find the free rules for Ironsworn Here).</p>\n<p>For the first two weeks, the game will be free! If you obtain it freely please provide any feedback in the comments section, or find me on twitter!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T08:50:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3e/e3e0cd023576eb059a0ca19634e9c76f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 221, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["superrobotbear"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
