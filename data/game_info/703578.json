In Dungeon Crawlies, you'll have to lead your party of adventurers on a quest to exterminate the rats, flies and assorted pests in the dungeon.</p>\n<p><strong>Dungeon Crawlies is in active development - expect updates with bug fixes, balancing and new content!</strong><br/></p>\r\nTactical combat\r\n<p>Combat is turn-based with a strong focus on combining the different skills of your characters for maximum effectiveness. Enchant the Knight's weapon with lightning, mark a target for the rest of the party to attack, or weaken enemies to make easy pickings for the Thief's devastating attacks!<br/></p>\r\nUnique characters\r\n<p>Each character has its own unique set of skills to make them different from the rest of the party: the Knight can take damage for his allies or rally them to attack out of turn, while the Bard makes everyone stronger or decimates the enemy party with status effects. Changing what skills you pick or leave behind can completely change their role in battle from run to run!</p>\r\nResource management\r\n<p>You'll have to balance how much MP you spend, versus how much damage you're willing to take, versus how many battles you can do in a row without resting to maximise rewards! The dungeon is finite each run, so you'll have to be smart to reach the boss with enough firepower to take it down!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T09:57:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/133/1336bfdc4888b5afc41b54b3be712300.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["prsas"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
