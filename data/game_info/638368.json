{"id": 638368, "slug": "synth-speeder-demo-2", "name": "Synth Speeder Demo 2", "name_original": "Synth Speeder Demo 2", "description": "<p>Synth Speeder is an arcade-style game where the world around the player constantly changes. For the environment, I chose the synthwave visual style, as I always found 80's style images quite interesting. The game will have a one-machine multiplayer option (multiple keyboard controls and joysticks or possibly mouse) and an idle option (with no obstacles) too. 4 different worlds are planned for the demo, but I'm planning more for the full game.</p>\n<p>The game itself is basically a shoot'em up, the player has to either avoid or destroy the obstacles on the level.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game is not a racing game. It is based on one of my old games, (80's runner), which also included other types of levels, like spaceship, jet plane and dolphin as playable character. I presented the old game on a Demoscene event, but it wasn't as successful as I wanted, it didn't have any music, and the graphics weren't the best. I wanted to add some music (as for now, I'm creating it), much better graphics, and a better feeling of speed. The character depends on the levels aesthetics, e.g.: there can be a car on a road, but also a dolphin in the ocean, a plane in the sky, or a vector-graphic model in an abstract environment. Players (when playing multiplayer) can tell themselves from others based on their color.\r\n</p>\n<p>According to my current plans: What will be: - Shoot'em up - A collection of 80s-90s style \"infinite movement\" levels, that constantly change. - A possible idle game to play while listening to music\r\n</p>\n<p>What it won't (shouldn't) be: - A rhytm game (the level doesn't change according to the music) - A racer (cars won't be the only thing you can control )\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T06:57:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4a/c4a30fc89bc8c288dc37ff19a683e9f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Black Goby Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
