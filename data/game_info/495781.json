This was kind of a last-minute idea and I did most of it within two days. Thus, the game has sadly only three levels yet.</p>\n<p>Derived from the jam's theme, the game's theme is roughly\u00a0<strong>\"Draw yourself, draw the world\"</strong>. When starting each level, you can freely draw the shape of your character. The same applies to the level, where you are free to draw new objects to help you complete your goal.</p>\n<p>Use\u00a0<strong>W </strong>and\u00a0<strong>A</strong> to walk and\u00a0<strong>Space</strong> to jump. You can draw while holding down your\u00a0<strong>left mouse button</strong>.</p><p>I decided to publish the source code under the MIT license at\u00a0https://github.com/CaptainProton42/GodotWildJam25.</p><p>(Beware the terrible code quality;\u00a0most of this was done very\u00a0in a rush.)</p>\n<p>I used the following sounds from freesoung.org:</p>\n<p>turnPage.mp3 by partheeban (https://freesound.org/people/partheeban/sounds/457767/)</p>\n<p>basketball by vhschool2019 (https://freesound.org/people/vhschool2019/sounds/461118/)</p>\n<p>Drawing with a pen by\u00a0florianreichelt (https://freesound.org/people/florianreichelt/sounds/407405/)</p>\n<p>party horn 3/3 harsh by vewiu (https://freesound.org/people/vewiu/sounds/379615/)</p><p>I used the following font from Google Fonts:</p><p>Architects Daughter by Kimberly Geswein (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Architects+Daughter?query=arch</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-21T02:48:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c5/2c564c59ae9143ca987cfe6f59e1c507.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["CaptainProton42"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
