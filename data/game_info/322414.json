This is a real location, a real art-gallery based in Auckland New Zealand. The art-work has been encapsulated to a level of detail not demonstrated in any other traditional VR experience. This experience is a teaser of what is to come. A living, breathing art gallery with dynamically &amp; accurately represented real-world content. We plan to introduce variation of works too via additional artworks being bough in and out of exhibition.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe art collection is held by Sir James Wallace at the Wallace Homestead. His collection is extensive. Come jump in and enjoy some fine New Zealand art in stunning details.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is a simulation of a real world environment. If you are more interested in gaming, this simulation is not for you. It is simply the art of going to an art gallery for arts sake.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:45:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfc/cfc0f3a365c1bcff2f68ce40c26846eb.jpg", "website": "http://www.realityvirtual.co/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 307, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Simon Che de Boer", "Brennan Kinney", "Tim Shepherd", "Nick Taylor", "Dan Monaghan"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["realityvirtual.co"], "esrb_rating": null}
