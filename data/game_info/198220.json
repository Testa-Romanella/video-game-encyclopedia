{"id": 198220, "slug": "selfstorm", "name": "SELFSTORM", "name_original": "SELFSTORM", "description": "<p>'SELFSTORM' is a small-scale game based on the premise of discharging missiles from one's launcher and have them loop around the screen while their existence racks up points.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Relative to the number of missiles on the screen, is the number of points awarded by frame. More missiles equates to a more efficient point attribution, but also to an inherently more dangerous environment to be in due to possible death by contact. \u00a0Missile direction and evasive procedures make use of a person's ability to react and form a strategy with levels of risk being directly controlled by the player.<br/></p>\n<p>[This is a relatively-finished edition of a game I've started developing back in 2014, while this build was finished early 2016 when I picked it up again. I'm most certain of my return to the formula to deliver a full experience in the future!]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d26/d269fa1001e56859b0717d4d3c32c92d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Drakesden"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
