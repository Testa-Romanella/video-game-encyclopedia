Your boss is a stingy guy so if you don't make your quota, he wont pay you. If you waste flyers (giving extra or leaving them on the ground) he'll dock your pay.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Make it threw the three shifts of the day and leave with as much money as you can.</p>\n<p>Tip: Giving a flyer to a group of people will count each one for with only one flyer. But if one person in the group already has a flyer they will be unhappy. So be careful.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T05:27:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fd/5fdebc3c9002d34dbfe9c577f5fdc9eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Vimlark"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
