Or so he thought. Now Mayor Imperati is\u00a0dealing with the bizarre\u00a0aftereffects of his illness while running a town full of complicated characters. Can he manage the balance of work, home and transformation?\u00a0Most importantly, can he\u00a0\u00a0figure out who is trying to kill him before they succeed? <br/></p>\n<p>A game jam project made for Spooktoberfest!
