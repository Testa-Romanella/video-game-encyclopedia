This was my starting point so, I wanted an interactive experience that\u00a0\u00a0enabled people with different interest to be part of it and I thought that sports have a great ecosystem for that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, it possible couldn't be a teams sport because it has to run on the browser and it might marginalize people with not high end PCs if it gets resource demanding. So I picked a solo sport that I enjoy playing: <strong>Tennis</strong>.</p>\n<p>I remembered that when I started playing tennis the first thing that took me some time to get the hang of was actually hitting the ball, which requires <strong>timing</strong>, which is the reason why I added a <strong>Rhythm Game</strong> element to it.</p>\n<p>All this factors would enable a place where:</p>\n<ul><li>Academy directors can rise players that are NFTs and participate in PvP tournaments.</li><li>Designers can mint branded wear and upload it so academies can provide them to their players.</li><li>Brands can be sponsor players for tournaments.</li><li>Music composers can mint and earn royalties for their music</li><li>Map Designers can mint maps for songs for different purposes: training, fun, non PvP\u00a0tournaments, etc.</li></ul>\n<p>My vision was that the game should enable users to do all of the mentioned above, but this is a game jam, so I implemented the basic systems and focused on a training mode.</p><p>CREDITS:</p><p>G L !
