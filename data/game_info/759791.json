Based on a single value, I achieved some variety for 32 worlds. It's not ideal, but it was really difficult to squeeze it in less than 2 lines of code. I hope that it gives a good sense of variety while playing the game as I wanted to include shorter and longer pits. I also added into design the different length of platforms, so in most cases, the player cannot blindly jump from the beginning to the end but has to jump at the right moment.</p>\n<p>I also wanted to fit in the animation of the pits, as it just looks way more alive, especially together with the animation of the hero.</p>\n\r\nLine by line code overview\r\n<p>- Line 0:</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Initialisation of some variables including the main hero animation</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Setting screen and border colours</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Data for X$</p>\n<p>- Line 1:</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Increment the current number of the world in case hero has some lives, otherwise reset to the first world</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Reset number of lives to 7 in case it's game over or the first run</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Generate the world based on a value of G variable, counting from 0 to 9 is sufficient to fill the string that represents the current world with at least 40 characters</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Calculate the starting position of world's graphics (A variable) to be taken from W$ and X$ strings</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Data for S$, Y</p>\n<p>- Line 2:</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Calculate the length of world's graphics (B variable) to be cut from W$ and X$ strings</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Both strings N$ and $M$ will be created in order to give pits animation effect</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Loops to FOR in line 1 for 10 times</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Clear the screen</p>\n<p>- Line 3:</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Read the joystick in port 2</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Set L if the joystick is moved left, R if the joystick is moved right, F if fire button pressed</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Based on joystick values the next horizontal position of hero can be set in X</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Increase hero's animation step only when it moves (C variable)</p>\n<p>- Line 4:</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Hero's animation step kept in C variable (from 0 to 2)</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- In which direction hero's head should be directed kept in H variable</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Check if hero is requested to jump up that might only occur when he's on the floor (U variable)</p>\n<p>- Line 5:</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Calculate hero's jumping up position (P variable) until the max height is reached (Y = 0)</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Calculate hero's falling down position (D variable) until the floor is reached (Y = 3)</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- In case the world changed to 33, finish the game by jumping to line 9</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Otherwise, display the actual world number on the top of the screen and continue in line 6</p>\n<p>- Line 6:</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Display the actual number of lives</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Display the normal graphics of the world if N = 0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Display the inverted graphics of the world if N = 1</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Set the vertical and horizontal position where here will be displayed</p>\n<p>- Line 7:</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Display hero's head in the right direction based on H variable</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Display hero's upper body part and lower body part based on C variable</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Read the screen memory next to hero's foot and store in A variable in order to detect if hero steps on a pit</p>\n<p>- Line 8:</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Decrement one live if hero collides with the pit (when A = 102 or 230)</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Until hero didn't reach the right part of the screen (X is less than 36) and the number of lives is positive, continue the main game loop by jump to line 3</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Otherwise, prepare N$ and M$ to generate the new world and move hero to the left part of the screen followed by jump to line 1 where world generation occurs</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Data for Q$</p>\n<p>- Line 9:</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Program jumps here when hero wins the game</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0- Data for W$, H, S, C$(0...5)</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\r\nVariables overview\r\n<p>- X$ -
