The game uses Ken Silverman's VOXLAP engine to render voxels in software. The levels in the game are fully destructible - and by fully we mean fully.\r\n\r\nThe game world is built from tiny cubes called voxels. There are over 37 million in the first level. Rendering a world like this is slow (especially without hardware acceleration), but there is an advantage: voxels can be added, removed or otherwise altered very very quickly. This enables all kinds of cool stuff, including fully destructible worlds!\r\n\r\nFeatures \r\n-Weapons: knife, pistol, chaingun, grenades, C4\r\n-Enemies: guard, officer\r\n-Many treasures to collect\r\n-Fully destructible world: blow holes in walls, ceilings, enemies, anywhere!\r\n-Loads original sounds and music from Wolfenstein 3D", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02b/02bf893107cf9fe346fc84f4fef310c7.jpg", "website": "http://voxelstein3d.sourceforge.net", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 4, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 246, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Voxelstein Team"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
