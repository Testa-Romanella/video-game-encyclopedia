If you wallrun, you lose the double jump and can only walljump</p>\n<p>-You can wallrun on wooden walls by running up to them and jumping. You can perform a walljump with SPACE when wallrunning\r\n</p>\n<p>-Look around with the MOUSE\r\n</p>\n<p>-Press E to change between the baseball bat and the pistol\r\n</p>\n<p>-With the pistol equiped, press LEFT CLICK to shoot\r\n</p>\n<p>-With the baseball bat equiped, press LEFT CLICK to do a basic horizontal attack, Hold and release RIGHT CLICK to do a vertical attack. When the vertical attack hits an enemy, it will\u00a0propell you upwards. Very useful when doing wallrun sections.</p>\n<p>There are three types of enemies:</p>\n<p>-Dron: it will stand still in the air and shoot you.</p>\n<p>-Amongus: follows you and shoots you</p>\n<p>-Armored dron: stands still and is only vulnerable to the vertical attack of the bat</p>\n\n<p>My first ever full game project. I tried to do some kind of movement shooter.</p>\n<p>I know there are some bugs, I'm planning on redoing this game from the ground up\u00a0because I have lots of ideas for it.</p>\n<p><strong>The artist of the game Bel</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T18:33:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/671/671a23df9b89f7739573f63164c39e0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SpaceBoy Dev"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
