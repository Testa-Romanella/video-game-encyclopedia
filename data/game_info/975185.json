Maps are randomly generated, but YOU have the ability to choose your path and use any items found to enhance it. Chart your course and take on various action platforming challenges!<h3>Rogue-\"lite\" with a personal twist</h3><br/><br/><br/>Each adventure is not the same. This is due not only to a randomized map with randomized rewards, but one where you choose which rooms to challenge... and which to ignore. Are you a speed runner looking to optimize efficiency? Or a completionist seeking out new challenges? Maybe you even found a rare item to enhance your current route!<h3>Room types include:</h3><ul><li>Elite enemies<br/></li><li>Platforming challenges<br/></li><li>Mimic Treasure Rooms<br/></li><li>And more!</li></ul><br/><h3>Game Features</h3><ul><li>Randomized maps that allow complete control over paths.<br/></li><li>Action platforming gameplay with engaging mechanics to combine the best of both genres.<br/></li><li>Items and enhancements to help you through your run.<br/></li><li>Challenging enemies and bosses waiting for you if you choose to face them.<br/></li><li>Permanent upgrades to reward you for each and every run.</li></ul><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-15T04:51:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f0/8f0eb54b93692872ce6264a784bf2af1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 204, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Peep"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Peep"], "esrb_rating": null}
