Great, because this is your chance, only problem is that the tracks you were assigned to are a little...haunted. Try not to get discouaged by the sinister presences and complete your run to earn your fame into this haunted drift world!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAn arcade racing game with a horror heart: drive through the best japanese scenery and touge tracks and show what you are capable of, but be aware of the dangers that lure in the dark. You can go for the points by drifting your tires out, or go for speed and best time, driving as fast as you can. Be careful though: on the tracks, numerous evil entities are trying to slow you down and make you crash. Will you be able to avoid them all and cross the finish line? Every drift you make, every corner you cross, will make you closer to unlocking new tracks and new cars, with an ever growing chioce that will be kept updated and renewed even after launch. But behind every corner lies a possible danger that may completely wipe all your progress, randomly generated for your (un)pleasure.
