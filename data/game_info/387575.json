Crystal the Witch\u00a0is free to play, and forever will be. We sincerely hope you enjoy it! The game took a month in total to complete, and was originally aimed for a NaNoRenO/NaNoWriMo release.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>- Costs nothing</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Crystal the Witch was created by\u00a0Devikomi, an upcoming game studio. We wanted to create a practice visual novel in preparation for a bigger project we have our hearts set on. We needed to learn the ups and downs involved and we're really happy with what we achieved in the time frame!\u00a0<br/><br/>- Art, writing, programming and UI by Devikomi<br/>-\u00a0Additional planning,\u00a0scene direction and snippets of\u00a0writing by RK5\u00a0 and\u00a0Jared Barr</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you enjoyed Crystal the Witch, in any aspect, please consider supporting Devikomi on Ko-Fi!

There's a small portion of Crystal the Witch concept work already over there!\u00a0</p>\n<p>We're really excited to start work on 'Kensik' next, a medieval fantasy RPG, focused on a travelling warrior aiming to reach the fabled sky city.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T04:14:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b1/2b168f05e21a43dfd5cc5d2a96bc3486.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 209, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Devikomi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
