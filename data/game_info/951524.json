Players will try to push the opponent outside the arena. There is push on touch, dash and attack mechanics with wall jump, double jump and duck. It is a prototype inspired by Pummle Party and it wasn't the case but can't deny the resemblence between\u00a0Smash Brother as well. Aim of this prototype was to achieve the feeling of challenging your friends and have fun together. As I said earlier it is a prototype so it is highly likely that it has bugs. It would be appreciated to point out the bugs in the comments\u00a0and ignore them :). Have fun!</p><p>Every support is appreciated no matter how big or small.
