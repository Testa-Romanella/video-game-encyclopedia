You must decide what meerkat will keep lookout for predators, which will look for food, and which will rest to regain their energy.</p>\n\n<p>As the lookout, you must get rid of predators. If you lose sight of a predator or the predator touches you, you will be knocked out. Knocked out meerkats cannot be used for the rest of the game. As your energy goes down, you will see predators later, giving you less time to react.</p>\n\n<p>Don't let your food get too low as this will cause you to lose as will having all your meerkats knocked out.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button - Interact with buttons / get rid of predators</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T10:19:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ec/3ec1ea2088ad5936e9afc51208c30c5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tango Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
