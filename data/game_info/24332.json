Of course, revenge is a \n      dish best served cold...and over a drink at an expensive club. This is \n      where the game will take place, and where you can rebuild your fortune \n      and show your competitor who really is boss.\n    </p><p>\n      This is a witty card game with a few simple rules to test your \n      intelligence. Starting with a small amount of resources, money and \n      action cards, try to use action cards to cunningly step forward until \n      you have sold all of your resources to others. Set strategies in motion \n      to increase your resources in value as one of the ways to win. But don\u2019t \n      forget that your ultimate goal is to introduce your competitors to \n      bankruptcy.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T11:39:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab6/ab634838c9ef083a6033631868b8fd01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 246, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["CIRCLE Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
