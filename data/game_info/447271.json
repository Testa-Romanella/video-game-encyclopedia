You can move with \"a\" to the left or with \"d\" to the right, or use the left and right arrow keys.</strong></strong></p>\n<p>(TIP: if you need double speed to go to the left or the right use \"a\" and the left arrow key\u00a0or \"d\" and the right arrow key at the same time.</p>\n<p>you can also jump: just with space bar. The game is still in development so if you have any more ideas for the game please leave them in the comments :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-25T03:45:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebe/ebed9d1909a437d6f5c948de7900b620.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ssalmane0"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
