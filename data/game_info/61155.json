{"id": 61155, "slug": "uberflight", "name": "UberFlight", "name_original": "UberFlight", "description": "UberFlight is intense flying game where you score points by flying risky.<br/>The closer (and longer) you fly to the obstacles the more points you get.<br/><br/>Your movement costs energy, and bumping into things costs even more. Keep an eye on your energy-level, because 'out of energy' means 'GAME OVER'.<br/><br/>Levels are procedurally generated, so they're never exactly the same. Memorizing won't help (much), you need to learn to react to situation at hand and make best choice, really fast. A single mistake (probably) won't kill you, but two mistakes in the row will be fatal.<br/><br/>Game has 3 modes :<br/><ul><li>arcade \u2014 find all required rune-keys to unlock portal to the next world<br/></li><li>challenge \u2014 play single-world for highest score combo-chain, ranked on leaderboard<br/></li><li>zen \u2014 no scoring, no damage, just flight of fun and relaxation</li></ul><br/>Score for every flight earns you some XP, and each level-up gives one upgrade-point.<br/>Those upgrade-point can be spent for number of upgrades and unlockable moves (horizontal and vertical dodge, air-brakes etc).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/578/578a43692db3991e2957ed0dc3498d71.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 31, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 528, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FireVector"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["FireVector"], "esrb_rating": null}
