There was no goal when I went into coding this except that I would most likely be using it as a prototype for another program.  While not really a game, you can explore a bit and there is a hidden secret that allows you to... in a way... \"win\".  Though not exceedingly obvious, the secret can be found in a matter of seconds and there is no real replay value here.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIf you find the secret, private message me with the ending message displayed on your screen.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Controls:</strong> Left Mouse Button\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tProgrammer: Onette du Joyeux (@merryonette) </p><p>Publisher: Sounds Merry Software (@soundsmerry)</p><p>\r\n\tSuccessfully tested on Windows 10.
