In CHESSU, pieces arent limited at all! Throw pieces around and try to knock the king off the arena!</p>\r\nCLASSIC MODE\r\n<p>Chess is boring, but I still want to respect the rules! In CLASSIC MODE, players take turns to move! Strategize ricochets! Form positions! (or get wiped out by a single bishop who got lucky, that happens too!)</p>\r\nTURNLESS MODE\r\n<p>Who needs rules? This mode is the definition of chaos!\u00a0Move whenever you want! Do whatever you want! Throw your rook off the map! Create a stack of pawns!\u00a0Go rob a bank! (Don't actually do that)</p>\r\nCHESSU AI\r\n<p>Our DANGEROUSLY - ADMIRABLE - VERY - INTELLIGENT - SUPERCOMPUTER (DAVIS for short) will play chessu with you!
