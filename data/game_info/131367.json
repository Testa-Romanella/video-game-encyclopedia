It's my attempt to write a bit about a culture that isn't mine and expand my mind a little. I'm not sure how well it worked, but I'm glad I tried it anyway. I had a goal of releasing one Nano game each year set in a different country that was neither the overplayed nations of America or Japan, as some weird Sufjan of visual novels, but this is the only one I had the time for. I do hope if anyone from Honduras checks this out it inspires them to make something better.</p><p>Thanks to Moya, Itwasneveradream, LumenAstrum, and MojaveMusic for their help.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d32/d327e302f9b02d9d7a0ca3e4ce00eb6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["peppertsuki"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
