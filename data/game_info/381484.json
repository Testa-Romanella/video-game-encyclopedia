You can rig your own animations using the puppet pieces included or the Spriter file. There are also four premade animations for each of the colored divers. These animations come as large resolution spritesheets with each frame being almost over 1000 by 500 pixels in size. You may need to re export smaller sheets depending on your needs, but you should be able to do this in a second as the Spriter file is included.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T06:23:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c66/c66da9f4eb46ec7fc0f22d7345b7a415.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Robert Brooks"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
