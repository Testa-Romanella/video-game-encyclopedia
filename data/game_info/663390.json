In\u00a0Blockdown, our world famous blocks fall from the sky, and our unique vegetation and animals are sure to add a shock to your day. Of course, please don't stand under our blocks; a splatter is really bad for the ecosystem. Please don't attempt to feed or pet the animals either; studies have shown that they will fatally attack you if you try to. Also, the main danger isn't the weird spring plants or the birds; it's the water. As our blocks fall down, the water will fall up. There's also some weird spheres in the water; apparently some archeologists say that they're really rare pearls.\u00a0Also,\u00a0please don't drown. Well, that's all I have to say. Enjoy your stay at Blockdown National Park!</p>\r\nContains...\r\n<ul><li>Falling blocks that will squish you</li><li>Really bouncy plants</li><li>Birds</li><li>Funny guys that jump</li><li>Good amount of\u00a0rising water</li><li>Some pearls that can help you break blocks</li><li>A snail(that's you!)</li></ul>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>WASD/Arrow Keys:</strong> Move</p>\n<p><strong>Space Bar: </strong>Jump</p>\n<p><strong>Escape:</strong> Pause</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T07:33:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/368/36832a1b2c3c85ea14bf07660900ba76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["jlintgod"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
