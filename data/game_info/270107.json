But this story isn\u2019t about that, this is the story of a small little valley, near the cat\u2019s eye stream, bordering the no-lands of forgotten shadow, the small town of Quin-song, the place of peace. Far enough away from the borders of Men and near no military bases, this small village has enjoyed peace in these troubled times, and life continues there as it always has, with seldom visitors or people leaving, it is a place untouched by Man\u2019s greed or of Drakul\u2019s pride.</p>\n<p>Matski is a young Drakul about to be accepted by her village as a full blown adult. As part of her village\u2019s customs, she is volunteering with the master of whichever craft she decides for herself. Once she completes the volunteering and is accepted full-time by the master, she will be given her adult name and allowed to pursue a partner for herself. Eyeing the beautiful Shiori (much to the amusement and teasing of her younger sibling), the two are beginning to hit things off and slowly build their relationship up until her adulthood.</p>\n<p>Contains:</p>\n<p>-Fishing, mining, farming, crafting, forging, cooking, armor making, ect.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-1 childhood friend you can try to win over before the end of the game!</p>\n<p>-4 professions (cooking, fighting, armor making, and forging) to choose from at the end of the game, experience them all!</p>\n<p>-Carefully crafted story with extra details and lore for those who want to talk to the townspeople everyday!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/519/519a4c3a4a865cea124b0633d3bef929.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheLastYuriSamurai"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
