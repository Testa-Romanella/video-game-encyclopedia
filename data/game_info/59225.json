{"id": 59225, "slug": "rise-of-mana", "name": "Rise of Mana", "name_original": "Rise of Mana", "description": "<p>Rise of Mana, known in Japan as Seiken Densetsu: Rise of Mana, is a Japanese action role-playing video game developed by Square Enix and Goshow for iOS, Android and PlayStation Vita. It was published by Square Enix in 2014 for mobile devices and 2015 for the Vita. It is the eleventh game in the Mana series, featuring a new narrative unconnected to other games in the series. The gameplay uses a similar action-based battle system to earlier Mana titles while using a free-to-play model in common with mobile titles. The story focuses on two characters, an angel and a demon, who are cast down to the mortal world in the midst of a battle and are forced to share a body in order to survive.<br />\nFirst announced in February 2014, it was released the following month on iOS. The Android release followed several months later. The Vita port released the following year. By April 2015, the mobile version had over two million active players, and later the Vita version achieved 150,000 downloads by August 2015. It received generally positive opinions from critics: while many praised its graphics, story and gameplay, there were opinions that it was not a worthy part of the Mana series. The game was discontinued as a free-to-play title in March 2016, and Square Enix is seeking to release the game in a different form.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T14:03:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c69/c692014ef41d85f160b2e9104a65f44e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 407, "game_series_count": 13, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PS Vita", "iOS"], "developers": ["Square Enix"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Square Enix"], "esrb_rating": null}
