What is he doing? -- You ask yourself. You try to call his name but he doesn't reply. Looking down, you see a line connecting your friend and you. The line is in a bright white colour, looking strong. No matter what you do, it\u2019s still there, it\u2019s a connection between you and your friend, what will happen if the connection is broken? You suddenly realize you\u2019d better go and find him to escape this mysterious maze\u2026\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The main theme of this game is \u201cconnection\u201d. The line between \u201cfriend\u201d and player represents how strong their connection is, and becomes red when the player is too far away from \u201cfriend\u201d. We, the developers, try to create a game that indicates the toughness of maintaining a connection with others, especially in circumstances like now (as is displayed in one of the endings), when people have to become apart and seldom have a chance to share their experiences face to face. We hope that playing this game would remind players that they are always being supported and accompanied with friends. Go, communicate and connect with them to make sure the connection will never be \u201clost\u201d.\r\n</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>**How to Play it**</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Finish the Maze and Find your Friend.</li><li>This game uses a FPS controller, which is WASD to move around, SPACE to jump, and SHIFT to sprint.</li></ul>\n<p><em>During the main game play,\u00a0</em><em>the functionalities you can use are:</em><br/></p>\n\n<ul><li>M: open the map</li><li>E: open the Guide</li><li>ESC: show setting menu</li><li>Q: use torch</li><li>F: interact/use.</li></ul>\n<p><em>Left side of the game window displays your collected items.</em></p>\n<p>The game will save record after completing one adventure, which is, achieve one ending.
