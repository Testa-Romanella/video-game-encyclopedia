J.T. just wants to go home to Las Vegas with some Colorado love... But when J.T. runs into ski rush hour in the icy mountains of Colorado, putting on the brakes leads to Just Trouble!<br/><br/>How far can J.T. make it down the treacherous, never-ending windy roads of Eisenhower Pass without meeting a terrible end?<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>- Steer J.T.'s out of control semi-truck down the infamously dangerous Eisenhower Pass on Interstate 70 during a blizzard with no brakes!<br/>- Pass as many cars as you can, as you go faster and faster sliding down the hill.<br/>- Collect Funny Munny to unlock upgrades that will help you race past more cars.<br/>- You can crash the trailer into other cars, trucks, and obstacles to slow down and collect more Munny.<br/>- Don't crash J.T.'s cab or it will be a fiery death!<br/><br/>RUSH 'HOWER is brought to you by the fine folk at good luck, have fun, which is really just me, one guy.
