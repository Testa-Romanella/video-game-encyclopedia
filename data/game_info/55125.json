It was developed by Jez San under his company name Argonaut Software. The game is a fast-moving, first-person combat flight simulator, rendered with colourful wireframe vector graphics inspired by San's love of the 1983 Atari coin-op Star Wars.</p>\n<p>Starglider was originally developed for the 16-bit Commodore Amiga and Atari ST. Rainbird commissioned Realtime Games to produce 8-bit versions for the Amstrad CPC, Amstrad PCW, and ZX Spectrum (128K, with a cut-down 48K version without sampled speech or special missions), and also for the IBM-compatible PC running in CGA. Solid Images were commissioned to produce versions for the Commodore 64 and Apple IIGS. Most versions included then-novel sampled speech, from Rainbird employee Clare Edgeley.</p>\n<p>It was followed in 1988 by a sequel, Starglider 2, which uses filled-polygon graphics.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1986-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:51:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dce/dcee844c199ef7956b83cf63e304e15e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 6, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 357, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Atari ST", "Classic Macintosh", "Commodore / Amiga", "Apple II", "PC"], "developers": ["Argonaut Games", "Argonaut Software"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Telecomsoft", "Rainbird"], "esrb_rating": null}
