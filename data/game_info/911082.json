Purchases and support via Patreon go towards enhancing this project and also funding the creation of more tutorials and resources for everyone!</p>\n<p>Use this as a template or foundation for your own game's battle system, use it as a handy reference when following the upcoming tutorial series,\u00a0or simply learn from the techniques used in the sourcecode.</p>\n<p><strong>This is currently\u00a0the finished first draft of a project that is functionally complete, but is still being refined and refactored over time. You can expect further\u00a0updates especially after the release of the video tutorial series.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Q: Can I use this with your ARPG project?</p>\n<p>A: Yes! While it won't be quite as simple as smashing both projects together, it shouldn't be far off either. There's nothing I'm aware of that would make the two projects incompatible.\u00a0This is a battle system that is designed to be as agnostic as possible when it comes to the rest of your game.</p>\n<p>All\u00a0included code and game\u00a0assets* are free to use by anyone for commercial purposes, but the project\u00a0should not be redistributed \"as is\".</p>\n<p><em>*also contains fonts by Daniel Linssen, all other assets were created by me.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T15:22:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d0/5d0821acb3732da43fbcc2e02fbaa222.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ShaunJS"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
