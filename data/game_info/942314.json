With multiple trials, endless editing I could achieve this final version. I did struggle till end with resolving no overlap between two objects. Hopefully I'll get it in next one.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For coding, ChatGPT helped a lot!</p>\n<p>I did learn to add water shader! That was first time and a success. Next I wish to learn to create growing weeds kind of effect with shader graphs.</p>\n<p>I did learn to create a glowing ring as well. (I faked it with particle system along with a torus)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T15:12:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf7/bf736e6869876ca03bef2e9ee6738f6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Himadri"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
