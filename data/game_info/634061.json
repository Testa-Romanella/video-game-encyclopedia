This entry fully embraces the\u00a0 optional jam\u00a0theme of \"escaping fate\" and utilizes the properties of time reversal/slowing.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0( *\u00a0<em>\u00a0excluding fonts)</em></p>\n<p>This game is a <strong>prototype </strong>\u00a0and therefore only contains roughly 7 minutes of gameplay\u00a0 in a near perfect run (Two stages)\u00a0. Maybe up to 30 minutes if you are achievement hunting. Possible add-ons post-jam (depending on interest) may or may not include:</p>\n<ul><li>Additional levels\u00a0 with greater enemy diversity</li><li>Additional weapons or ship power-ups (drift time, weapon dmg, etc.)</li><li>Better background art<br/>\n</li><li>Boss Run Mode</li><li>Stat Tracking<br/>\n</li><li>More challenges/achievements</li><li>Narrative development</li></ul>\n<p>_______________________\r\n</p>\n<p>Additional developer comments:</p>\n<p>Hello! This is my second \"game\" so I hope everyone enjoys this short prototype as I had as much fun making it as I did learning how to make it. I had originally spent the first week thinking about and planning a game about manipulating the stock market with time and... went in a completely\u00a0 different direction for the last 7 days; RIP Time Stockers. \u00a0I would love to see a comment if you recognize what game I'm giving a slight homage to with this jam entry or any feedback.
