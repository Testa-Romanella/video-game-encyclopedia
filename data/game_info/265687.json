This is my first game I have completed using Unity3D.</p>\n<p>Basically you move around the screen trying to dodge squares as they move past. You have a shield that can be activated to generate a force field around your player. The only problem is that as you utilize the shield, you lose score based on how many objects you bounce off of the shield. As you progress through the levels, the score increases faster and the squares spawn faster. <br/></p>\n<p>I hope you all enjoy playing Dogeball!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d0/1d09851f96115f1dcb1c5b8d00a6c6d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TMcSquared"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
