See if you can get the high score!</p>\r\nhoW to PlAY\r\n<p>There is one main polygon at the center of the screen. As objects, representing beats of the song, come in from different directions, use the three arrow keys (left, up, and right) to light up a different part of the polygon. Once the beats pass the boundary of the polygon you must have the arrow in the direction of the beat and hit space when it has entered the cube to receive points. If you miss 5 beats, the level ends.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For example, if there is a beat coming in from the right hand side of the screen, you must hit the right arrow key and hit space when the beat enters the boundary of the cube.\u00a0</p>\r\nCRedits\r\n<p>Programming - Alex Robbins</p>\n<p>Sound Design - Cakeflaps</p>\n<p>Art - Eloise Unerman (inkandamaranth)</p>\n<p>FMOD Integration with Unity</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T06:56:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a2/2a2ee741acc7053b583fdfed485a527d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["InkAndAmaranth", "Alex Robbins"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
