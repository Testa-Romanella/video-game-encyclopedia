As your life in this new space unfolds, you find that your actions shape your reality and your relationships...</em></p><p>The Great Personality Games are designed to be a different kind of dating sim, where you can get to know the characters and find out a little bit more about why you're attracted to them. The game was built with the idea that attraction is deeper than good looks and a sense of humor. There are 32 diverse characters in the Great Personality game that inhabit the world -- where you can play as any gender, date any person, and explore what it's like to get to know (and fall in love) with people with a wide array of backgrounds, abilities, and personalities.\u00a0</p><p>Guardians is the first of four games in the series, featuring characters based on a segment of the Myers Briggs personality types that make up 40 - 45% of society. They're the hardworking, diligent individuals that make up the majority of the world we inhabit (inside and out of the game).</p><p>The project was created by Light Grey Art Lab, a collaborative arts space in Minneapolis, Minnesota -- with the help of 50 international artists - creating backgrounds, characters, and the behind the scenes easter eggs.
