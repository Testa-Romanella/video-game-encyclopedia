You hear a heart beating in the distance, what could it be? Only colors used: Black, Red, White (and possibly some gray). Colorblind people can play no problem! Sound is very important (you will get lost without it!). Headphones are preferable. If you don't hear sound, plug in your headphones (re-plug if they are already in), and restart the game.</p><p>Controls: WASD to move and turn</p>\n<p>This was a Global Game Jam entry made by</p>\n<ul><li>Dennis Foley</li><li>William Pacini</li><li>Ed Ramirez (FiniteZombie)</li></ul>\n<p>http://2013.globalgamejam.org/2013/dark-beat-0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d6/2d6c0ff188233365c46517506eaad8d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FiniteZombie"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
