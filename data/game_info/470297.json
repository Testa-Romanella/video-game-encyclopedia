Or you can just do nothing and see how the astronaut copes.</p>\n<p>All words you type enter into the astronaut's stream of consciousness, and like all thoughts, they may or may not act on them. Try to figure out how to best influence the astronaut to escape from his tiny world of reality tv and potatoes.</p>\n<p>With some minor exceptions, all work was created during the jam time.</p>\n<p>Leads Rion Brodie and Patrice Metcalf-Putnam</p>\n<ul><li>Most code by\u00a0Patrice Metcalf-Putnam:\u00a0https://twitter.com/applesauce2u</li><li>Concept and 3D art\u00a0by Rion Brodie:\u00a0http://instagram.com/rionbrodie</li><li>Music by:\u00a0https://itch.io/profile/chimeramusic</li><li>TV and animal\u00a0sound design by:\u00a0https://gorrgolem.itch.io/</li><li>Astronaut character design by:\u00a0https://dunkelgrau.itch.io/</li><li>Alien character design by:\u00a0https://pipoya.itch.io/\u00a0(only art not created during jam)</li><li>All other pixel art by Juan Rodriguez (including the most incredible alien bird that we were not able to incorporate at the last minute)\u00a0https://juanlrodriguesz.itch.io/</li><li>Special thanks to Amy Peters on story consultation and writing contributions!</li></ul>\n<p>Github: https://github.com/rionhunter/GMTKjam</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-20T02:37:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf6/bf65a1dba6ac5b887fb84067eddb9477.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["patricemp", "rionbrodie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
