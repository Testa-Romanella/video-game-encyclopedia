The idea was to create a handful of games that would show how to develop games for people with colorblindness. Three games were planned to show how universally safe colors, color blindness modes, and patterns could be used to make games more accessible. So far, two of the three games have been completed. The only other static part of the game is the controls settings, as customizable controls have not been fully implemented yet.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T08:17:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d5/7d5b0f6c732257d56e2d6d39926daf95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WhitexKappa"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
