Building a top-down shoot em' up was part of the unity course I was following and we saw this as an opportunity to see if we were able to design and build a game. Our intentions are to build two more levels before wrapping this up but we also want to share what we came up with until now. I hope you enjoy our work.</p>\n<p>Thanks and cheers.<br/></p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>-CONTROLS-<br/></p>\n<p>W,A,S,D to Move,<br/>SPACE to Shoot,<br/>P to Pause,<br/>Q to Skip the Intro and the Conversations.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T05:44:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/376/376cdca5b2cf9212d87341093d5f6637.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cnkrtn"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
