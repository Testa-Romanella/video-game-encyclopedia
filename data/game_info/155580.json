You do this by clicking on a white face to turn it into your color (blue or red) - you can do this 2 times a turn. You need to fully surround a group of white faces with faces of your own color or neutral faces (the edge of the board). The faces used to capture need to be touching either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. As long as there are none of your opponent's colored faces inside that area, you capture all those white faces, deleting them from the board and awarding you one point for each face captured. When neither player can make a move, each player gets points equal to the amount of their colored faces on the board, and the game ends.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e0/8e0cf9866d2042cd2f52ca2c9e8d1b10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["mnemiah"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
