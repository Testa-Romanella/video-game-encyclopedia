Your mouse will be the very thing keeping you alive, as you glide your dead-weight cursor through a slew of The Curser's zany obstacles, in hopes of encountering a glowing-green checkpoint. After watching your polygonal friend endure the slicing, dicing, and burning of this epic adventure, I guarantee you'll never look at mouse cursors the same again.</p>\r\nRead the title.\r\n<p>YOU DON'T STAND A CHANCE AGAINST THE CURSER!!!</p>\n<p>If by some miracle you DO manage to beat this game, then let me get your autograph because The Curser CANNOT be defeated...</p>\n<p>...Unless you're The Curser.</p>\n<p>The Curser is the only one who can defeat The Curser.</p>\r\nThe widower's revenge...\r\n<p>The Curser seems like an ordinary villain at first, until you uncover the true meaning behind his intentions. Is he really the big, bad, super villain he makes himself out to be?..\u00a0</p>\r\nSimple, yet hard to master.\r\n<p>The controls are familiar; move your mouse, and the cursor moves with it. Well, what happens when we turn on gravity? The simple task of navigating your mouse across the screen becomes a game of Flappy Cursor, where one false move could lead to a fiery descent.</p>\r\nSoundtrack by Noah\u00a0Eichler.\r\n<p>The music is the cherry on top of an already-personal experience. Jam to a variety of memorable tracks that are the foundations for each scene. The \"YWNBTGOST\" (that's a mouthful) is free when you purchase the game.</p>\r\nThis game is my child.\r\n<p>I spent several months giving birth to\u00a0a powerful message that I hope will resonate with those who play it. It's okay to make mistakes, as long as you learn from them, and move on.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a7/0a7c975b825658c46d67a4dd71f3a88d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Noah Eichler"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
