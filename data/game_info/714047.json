The level takes place on the outside of a cube shaped world, with only one side of the cube visible at a time. All gameplay is in 2D, but it is a 3D world. Special doors at the edge of the rooms transfer Scarbro to other sides of the cube to unlock new locations. This transfer can be to an adjacent or opposite face of the cube, making the level more complicated to solve. The player benefits from a good memory of the world layout in order to efficiently navigate through the maze. The final exit door cannot be unlocked until the player has saved all the trapped hostages. These hostages are dispersed throughout the world and are protected by dangerous cube world hazards.<br/></p>\n<p>Scarbro has the extraordinary ability to control the direction of gravity. This will be Scarbo\u2019s best bet at escaping the cube world. The player must utilize Scarbro\u2019s gravitational changing ability to dodge the dangers of the cube world and free the hostages to escape the world.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Other developers:\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Edgar Moreno,\u00a0Peter Revington,\u00a0Mitkumar Malavia</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T12:03:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93a/93ac2a25305a974355d7f6e416d379d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Himali Kothari"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
