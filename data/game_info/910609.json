{"id": 910609, "slug": "_actiongame", "name": "_actiongame", "name_original": "_actiongame", "description": "<p>Control the most powerful creature in the whole multiverse! Yes, you heard me right. In _actiongame, you get to control Slimey, the ultimate, final achievement of all human science, capable of infinite destruction and creation alike!.. However, fret not. You aren\u00b4t expected to control the entire creature\u00b4s above-infinite power set --\u00a0not yet, at least. Instead, for this first level, you shall only need to utilize his vast power to control the world around him to do one thing -\u00a0Jump.</p>\n<p>\u00a0To do this, we were able to develop and spread\u00a0Input Boxes around each testing facility of _actiongame, each one connecting you, the player, to a fraction of Slimey\u00b4s godly powers. And so, merely link one of these Input Boxes to whatever object, force or \"\"threat\"\"\u00a0is in Slimey\u00b4s way - and, boom, at your will, Slimey will have made whatever you ordered\u00a0to come true. If you order an entire galaxy to jump, then, no matter the what the so-called 'laws of physics' say, Slimey will laugh at that pretentiousness and\u00a0confer onto that galaxy the skill to jump. He will make whatever you ordered come true.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So far, we\u00b4ll allow you to have access to the first level, comprising two testing facilities. Enjoy.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T11:43:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be0/be0426cd0f2bd1ab23ce1ff38b4b44cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Doc Cyan"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
