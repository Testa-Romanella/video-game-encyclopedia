With no idea where she\u2019s headed next, Lil\u2019 Red takes another leap of faith.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>In the rest of her journey, Lil\u2019 Red traverses mountains and oceans, supported only by jumping across floating box platforms. She sees a lovely waterfall that she also jumps across. Yet, despite all the natural splendor, Lil\u2019 Red sure is missing grandma\u2019s cabin. She finds another portal and has an awesome adventure surfing the clouds during a starry night. After making it through another dangerous yet beautiful adventure, Lil\u2019 Red finds herself in oddly familiar territory.   </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>She traverses the platforms of this bright and colorful forest, knocking over trees that she uses as bridges.
