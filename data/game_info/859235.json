Kinda rushed so if you encounter bugs don't be surprised. Also if you have trouble understanding exactly when you encounter the 5 puzzles they are located at the mine entrance, volcano, mansion, oasis, and ice palace. Because the switch puzzle is kinda hard, I will give you the answer for it here. In order to check to see if you got it right, you need to walk up to the door and check if it has unlocked, also the correct colors of the switches that you must enable are red and green. Overall I had a pretty fun time developing this game, kinda wish I had more time to polish it up, but I honestly wanted to get this assignment done. Hope you have fun playing, and good luck!</p>\n<p>Note: some doors require the user to push enter in order to open them <br/></p>\n<p>Note: since the ice puzzle can be pretty close to impossible to solve, Ive included a video that you may use if you have trouble figuring it out <br/></p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T17:33:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/063/063acfd78642b4e85c9d61df60e78de0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Curbsidetick247"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
