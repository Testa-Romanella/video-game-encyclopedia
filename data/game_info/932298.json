The bank wall is full of traps, it won't be easy.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0Hold L click button for direction pointer, release to climb the wall. When you run out of stamina, you start falling, L click to grab the wall again. Avoid the traps and reach the top as fast as you can.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Warning!</strong></p>\n<p>For speedrunning and better experience in general, I recommend the downloadable version. The online leaderboard doesn't work on the HTML5 version :( So, if you want to submit your score, try the windows version instead.</p>\n\n<p>A game developed by Spyridon Glarakis (<strong>Opossum In A Jar</strong>)\u00a0for <strong>SpeedJam#1\u00a0</strong><strong>(THIEVERY)</strong> hosted by\u00a0 ScoreSpace.</p>\n\n<p>Code by Spyridon Glarakis</p>\n<p>Music &amp; Sound Design By Spyridon Glarakis\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Art by Maria Tranta &amp; Spyridon Glarakis</p>\n<p>Game Design By Spyridon Glarakis &amp; Maria Tranta</p>\n<p>Special Thanks: Maria Tranta &amp; Scorespace</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T16:11:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bb/0bb897122c20ae4c3285ca6ece627363.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Opossum In A Jar"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
