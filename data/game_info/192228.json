The light in each floor dies out over time and the enemies only get faster as you take longer.</p><p>As this was a hastily-made game jam submission, there are only three levels available, almost no features, and entirely no polish. However, if you do enjoy it anyway, I would love for you to stop by in the comments section. :D<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36b/36b2fff7d732ff352d71597bfa3cc3f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kinship"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
