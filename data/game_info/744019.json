(~12mb download)</p><p>Forgot to mention in the help text that you can use &lt; and &gt; to decrease and increase the size of components.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Some details</strong></p>\n<p>Don't get hopeful. This will probably not result in an actual game, I just want to share it because some people might think it's cool :)</p>\n<p>The core concept is scavenging, building a shoddy airship and eventually fighting other ships.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Currently, all that is implemented is the basic building mechanics and flight. You can walk around on the ship while it's flying and you can fall off if you're not careful.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Looking for ideas for the gameloop. I'm thinking something where you jump in and have a quick match, so either skirmish mode or roguelike (but not what most people think is roguelike, I mean the real rogue-ish type of random world gen and starts, not just cheap time consuming perma death).</p>\n<p>I'm thinking a wall of enemies you have to outrun and then fight other ships on the way could be good, though certainly lacking in creativity, it's a fairly ok gameloop.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I use two main systems to determine the quality of a game:</p>CAPR<p>Challenge, Accessibility, Progress and Replayability determine how long someone will likely play a game. All games that are worth playing have these components. Example of a certain game about a turtle and a plumber:<br/><strong>Challenge</strong>: enemies, traps, platforms<br/><strong>Accessibility</strong>: simple controls (left right up down action)<br/><strong>Progress</strong>: finishing levels and unlocking the next one<br/><strong>Replayability</strong>: ability to get better scores on a level by replaying it<br/></p>\r\nEAM\r\n<p>Emotion from Action through Mechanics determines how good a game is in terms of not it's playtime but how much people will enjoy that playtime. We determine an emotion or response that we want, figure out what the player should do so that they have that response, and then develop a mechanism by which that action can take place. E.g.<br/><strong>Emotion</strong>: overcoming obstacles<br/><strong>Action</strong>: fighting and defeating enemies in melee combat<br/><strong>Mechanic</strong>: weapons and armor, AI that can fight</p><p>If you've got concepts of what you'd enjoy doing in a world about putting together barely working parts and fighting airships, let me know, and use these systems as a way of figuring out if an idea will be viable!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T05:59:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32c/32c8467a7ec921bb92c3de139ff7598d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sumyjkl"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
