Combine this with the couch coop mechanics of our game and you\u2019ll be teleported back in time with your first console, sitting around the TV with your friends. Extreme Freeze Tag plays pretty much the same as freeze tag in real life but now you get to visit fantastical levels.</p>\n<p>\tIn Extreme Freeze Tag players can play as either a hunter or a runner. Hunters use abilities to chase after runners in order to catch them and freeze them. However runners have numbers on their side and the hunter can\u2019t win until all players have been frozen. Runners win if they manage to survive the timer unfrozen. Select from a choice of player types and uniquely themed maps and remember the good ol\u2019 days.</p>\n\n\n<p>Release Announcment: Extreme Freeze Tag: Student Production</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T08:37:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a4/7a4e1fa9aa307371ab61367f74e55f88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CAGD"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
