The theme for the third week was 'Scroll-wheel only'.\u00a0 Where the game idea was totally up to us, however the only control we could implement was the scroll wheel on the mouse. The aim of the game is to run as many people over as possible, without crashing and see what score you get! This is a short prototype and is unfinished, i will most likely not be continuing working on this game but just uploading it to have something to look back on.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Download the game and let me know what you think!</p>\n<p>Also check out my other games on my profile!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T04:18:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63a/63ada55a755342fbea91efaf39135a80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jacob Lister"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
