But hang on... these parties were not in 2022 at all... they were... that can't be right. The parties will have to wait. You are Sue Gray, and it is time to get to work. Not a work event, but real work, without the wine or cheese. There is evidence to gather, a report to write, and absolutely no time to be ambushed with cake.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Super Work Party explores the duality of truth and lies in British politics in 2022. Developed on the fly as the truth continued to shift under our feet, Super Work Party is developed in Pulp and will be coming to Playdate soon!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T11:08:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57b/57b70c3aea58f7b0b2d1a7f27b84a5ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RobinJSS"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
