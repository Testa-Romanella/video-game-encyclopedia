They were all taken from the Unity Store or freepik.com</p>\n<p>Song is\u00a0<strong>Divide by Magna</strong>, from the Hotline Miami 2 soundtrack</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-13T03:30:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efd/efdf47c8ae3232c97c27a450432ae5d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["mauriciojuliano"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
