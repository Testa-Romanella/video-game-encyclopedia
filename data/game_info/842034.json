A lot of basic mechanics (such as the ability to do chores and the ability to collect and use items) have not yet been implemented. Right now, you can read the initial story, explore the house, progress through the days, and experience a few spooky shenanigans.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T14:39:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/503/503fb48dbefdb6d18ed83dda006b541e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kai"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
