I chose a river to represent this oppression because it is unrelenting, uncaring, perceived as unstoppable and will push you backwards unless you continuing fight against it. To represent resistance, I choose to use beavers as their dams play an essential role in preventing disasters, filtering toxins and creating a habitat in which themselves and other species can flourish.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing my game!
