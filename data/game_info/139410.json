Often I would have to take medication that would make me feel more ill than the disease I had, to the point where I would actively hate taking my medication. Soon doctors and nurses would have to force it into me. This game is set to my early experiences, before I grew to understand that medication was a necessary evil to improve my health in the long run. The game was made in the effort to actively make the player uncomfortable when forced to take the medication.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/439/4394a37d910d9ae2ac84df4db67eb8b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Solobolt"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
