However, there was no evidence of fashion and textile brands using immersive technologies to convey provenance, craftsmanship or heritage, suggesting a missed opportunity in using Human-Computer Interactions to communicate culture, place and in re-humanizing the making of clothing products in the minds of contemporary consumers. <br/></p>\n<p>In summary, this research project proposes to use immersive technologies and Human-Computer Interactions to visualize tangible and intangible cultural heritage related to the production of traditional and artisan fashion and textile practices; weaving the past into the future; preserving history for future audiences and preserving practices for future artisans to develop into contemporary fashion and textile products that embody the growing slow fashion movement, encouraging a sustainable future for designers, makers, consumers and the world we live in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Augmented Fashion website\u00a0\r\n      </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T09:19:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96e/96e48d70f38b5b44712ca8b94eaaa654.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["John Walter"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
