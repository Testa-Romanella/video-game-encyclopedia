{"id": 967376, "slug": "dawnofcombat", "name": "DawnOfCombat", "name_original": "DawnOfCombat", "description": "Battle at Dawn\" is a game I developed independently in my spare time, created out of a passion for the hobby. The game is distributed for free, and I welcome interested peers to join in the exchange and learning. My BiliBili homepage is: https://space.bilibili.com/397217774<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game is still in the development stage, and the launched version only contains the core combat slice. I hope to gather everyone\u2019s ideas and opinions during the early experience stage to continuously refine and optimize this product.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn this game, players will find themselves in a vast universe full of unknowns and challenges. They will pilot a spaceship in this endless sea of stars, battling hordes of enemies in an intense competition for survival.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBefore each round of the game starts, players need to remodel their spaceship and choose weapons to prepare for the upcoming battles. They may have to remove some armor and shields to install more weapons, meaning they must take on greater risks but at the same time, the potential rewards could also be higher.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThroughout the game, players need to collect coins dropped by enemies upon their death. These coins can be used to purchase various upgrades in the store. These stores randomly appear during the player's game progress, and players need to fly their spaceship over the store to buy upgrades. Choosing and allocating these upgrades wisely is key to victory.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach new game represents a whole new set of challenges and possibilities. Players need to constantly adapt and evolve in the ever-changing battlefield in order to survive and win. Whether to risk choosing more powerful weapons, or finding the store at the right moment for upgrades, each decision could impact the final outcome of the game. \"DawnOfCombat\" is waiting for every player seeking excitement and challenge, as they navigate their way to glory and victory in this infinite cosmic adventure.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-06T04:56:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa4/fa429222d193f7b7bbdeb7085d8c0f63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KKGame Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["KKGame Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
