Strategize and plan your deck with the deck builder before you go into battle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game requires 2 players! So grab a friend and figure out how to play and what works for you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The idea is that each player take turns to play 1 card on one of the 3 heroes. Once each player skip their turn, the round will progress to the next stage where heroes act out the cards that were played. We had a small scope for the game, but we did have some big ideas for the game.</p>\n<p>Online functionality was created with Photon in Unity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T05:14:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a42/a42583a0db86963eb8ee55c084a457fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Flytnyllet"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
