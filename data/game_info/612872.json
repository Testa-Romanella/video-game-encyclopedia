I followed the Bolt - Platformer Tutorial which walked me through the\u00a0Visual Scripting interface and helped me to become familiar\u00a0with Visual Scripting concepts. I created a full Platformer experience consisting of 4 levels and a main menu.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The controls are simply:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li><strong>WASD to move</strong></li><li><strong>Space to jump</strong>\u00a0</li><li><strong>Left Click to shoot</strong>.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>After completing this project I am now able to use Visual Scripting to:</p>\n<ul><li>Create graph based machines and macros\r\n</li><li>Implement variables into graphs\r\n</li><li>Add units and connections\r\n</li><li>Reuse graphs by using super units\r\n</li><li>Interpret key Unity functionality into visual scripting such as input, math, animation, physics and raycasting</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Create events\u00a0</li><li>Trigger event from collisions<br/>\n</li><li>Reload the scene when the event is called</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Create a reusable SuperUnit for Collision</li><li>Use Saved Variables across my Scenes\u00a0</li><li>Combine variables, super units, and visual scripting logic to create a door and key system</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Create a Health State Machine\u00a0<br/>\n</li><li>Adding states for the player - such as invulnerability\r\n</li><li>Communicate variables across scenes by altering Hearts in your HUD Scene based on the Player\u2019s state\u00a0with visual scripting</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Create a simple, decision based AI system\u00a0<br/>\n</li><li>Set up Enemy states; such as Patrol, Alive, Chase, and Defeated\r\n</li><li>Understand the impact of Transitions on an object\u2019s State\r\n</li><li>Communicate across Objects and Graphs for chase and damage functionality</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Listen for input events from the player\u00a0</li><li>Use my Collision SuperUnits and the Enemy states to apply damage to enemies</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Create a state machine for the pause menu\u00a0<br/>\n</li><li>Modify Unity\u2019s time scale to pause and resume your game\u00a0</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Concatenate strings to create saved level variables<br/>\n</li><li>Employ saved variables to set up a level unlocking system\r\n</li><li>Create New Game and Quit functionality \r\n</li></ul>\n<p>I did begin to build out an Audio Manager but unfortunately I lost the Unity files for this project and was only left with this version of my game. It's a shame because its the last little bit that this game is missing.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T09:47:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/742/7428e5e322e957d6ff1260e9592f5331.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lewis Stephens"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
