You ask why....Well, the Moon is now occupied by new species: savage creatures that people on Earth started calling Zombliens. These creatures are able to live under the Moon's exosphere, the very thin Moon atmosphere and on Earth as well. They are breeding like crazy on the Moon and distributing their population between the Earth and Moon.<br/></p>\n<p>It is an Apocalypse. Humans started losing hope as the population of humans on Earth has severely decreased. Now only about 6178 humans exist. However, as is always the case, a hero will rise. He's a nobody actually, but he's humanity's only hope.</p>\r\nDeveloped By:\r\n<p>Ali K. Dashti (Programming / Godot)</p>\n<p>Habib K. Dashti (Pixel art / Aseprite) - @habibinho99</p>\n<p>Mohammad K.
