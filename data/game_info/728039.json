Hit the men, do not let the men hit you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While the two inputs\u00a0<em><strong>very roughly</strong></em> correspond to normal/ special attacks, different weapons offer unique combo paths between both inputs, including a not insignificant amount of \"tech\" to discover.<br/></p>\n\r\nCustomize\r\nIs the game\u00a0Just too playable?<br/>\n<p><strong>Fear not!</strong><br/>I have provided you with a number of optional visual effects that can make the game physically hard to look at. Beyond this, the colour of nearly every object in the entire game is up to your discretion.</p>\n<p>Tired of that pesky UI? Make it the same colour as the background!<br/>Too many colours? Compress the entire game to a terrible 6 bit pallette, just to suffer!<br/>Just done overall? Make the entire game bright orange!</p>\n\n\r\nContention?\r\n<p>Experiencing undue tribulations?<br/>Is the Glumbus male giving you trouble?<br/>Did a collection of disheveled\u00a0gangrene\u00a0distributors tell you to \"git gud\"?</p>\r\nTry some of these Tips to come out ahead:\r\n<ul><li><strong>Find some health upgrades</strong><ul><li>Every run at the pit is an opportunity to permanently increase your health. Listen for the severed human heart hidden within the walls.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Try out a different weapon</strong><ul><li>Each of the four unique weapons can be unlocked by finding and defeating a grumpy miniboss, listen for an ominous hum in the pit.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Focus on defense</strong><ul><li>You can't win if you're dead, abuse the heck out of the invulnerability provided by the dodge, then strike when the danger has passed.</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\r\nComing Next\r\n<p>As of release, I do not intend to develop this project further. Though I have\u00a0plans for where this project could go, others demand my attention. If this brief demo got you excited, please let me know in the comments or on my discord.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T06:36:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58c/58cc571916eb26d7c10c09a55f45d535.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Klungore"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
