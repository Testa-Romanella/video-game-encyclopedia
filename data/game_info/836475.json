Collect components as you rebuild each system, with the chance of additional components spawning during replays.<h3>Notable Features:</h3><ul><li> Randomly shuffled boards with statistics recorded for every variation.<br/></li><li> Bonus achievements for using every circuit on the board. Or just speed-run through if that's your preference. It's up to you.<br/></li><li> Original ambient soundtrack subtly evolves as Skeet moves from board to board. Put on some headphones and chill.<br/></li><li> Gather up the components you'll need to augment your own abilities or collect pieces of past guardians.</li></ul><br/>Skeeter's Grid fully supports gamepad (including Steam Deck) and keyboard (WASD).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T04:32:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9c/d9c71cbf25e3b6297685c9ea3a0635ed.jpg", "website": "https://www.strangeshuttle.com/games/skeeters-grid/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Strange Shuttle"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Strange Shuttle"], "esrb_rating": null}
