It was built using all original assets or Public Domain/CC0 assets often heavily remixed. The theme was growth which I took as to mean the growth of new mysterious life.</p>\n<p>The game was built in Pixel Game Maker MV, a fun if limiting tool but good for anyone who struggles with code like I do. Baz's awesome tutorials were a big help.</p>\r\nTHANKS\r\n<p>A big thanks to everyone in the Game Jam, the forum has been a good encouragement through making this game. Big thanks to user\u00a0mcniner\u00a0for coming up with the name for the game (the WIP name was 'Life in the Sea' which is pretty dull!).</p>\n<p>Thanks to everyone on the Chumbles Discord server (you all know who you are).</p>\n<p>As well as thanks to Kathryn for keeping me focused and offering many ideas for plot twists. Big thanks to Jacob and Nathan for looking through my writing to make sure it made sense. Oddy for making sure I actually did work.\u00a0Also big thanks to SirKingyo who is my Analogue Media Buddy (and I'm sure you can see why that's relevant) </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T07:45:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bca/bca0474c0d1ff0ed3776a36f099ddfd1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["timbojay"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
