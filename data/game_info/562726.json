Discard the lower cards of any cards in the same suit by clicking on them. Aces count highest and cannot be discarded.</p>\n<p>When a pile is empty, clicking a card that cannot be discarded on any other pile will move it into the space.</p>\n<p>If no more cards can be discarded, and there are no more spaces, click the deck again to deal four new cards into the play area.</p>\n<p>When the deck is exhausted and there are no more moves left, the game is over.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>There is currently no sound in the game, but will be updated soon</li><li>Holding the <strong>right</strong> mouse button on a card in a working pile will bring it to the front</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T12:01:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab6/ab66ca2d77560893d0f4d5705457aff7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["bixarrio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
