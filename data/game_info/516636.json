In case you don't know the rules, you only have to guide the snake to the <em>fruits </em>so that he can eat and get longer, but you can't <em>bite your own body</em> or you will lose ! The more fruits you eat, the more the game will be fast and hard.</p>\n\n<p>Use the <strong>arrows to move</strong>, <strong>X to play</strong> or replay, C to get back to menu.\u00a0You can also mute the game using Ctrl+M if needed !</p>\r\nHope you'll like it !", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T03:44:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1f/a1f6cecfa381eeb971346e38fb87e1ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Robin Six"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
