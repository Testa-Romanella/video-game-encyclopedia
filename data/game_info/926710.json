When I open the room where the landlord is located deep in the top floor, I see a complete set of surveillance equipment, as well as a large number of data documents and handwritten notes. Looking through these records, I realized that my relatives had been doing spiritual research on hypnosis and brainwashing for decades, and had used the tenants as experimental subjects to observe and record the results of brainwashing and spiritual transformation.
