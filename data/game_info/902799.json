There's an initial option to run through the story with a choice of ships: Geralt/Jaskier or Geralt/Jaskier/Yennefer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please be aware that the story contains implied violence and frequent strong language, so this content is for mature audiences only and is unsuitable for minors.<br/></p>\n<p>This is the first time I've ever tried\u00a0to create a project like this so it's fairly short, with a 10-20 minute runtime depending on reading speed.</p>\n<p>Please also note: I do not own the rights to the original IP and this visual novel is created\u00a0solely for the fan community without any monetary profit to myself or anyone else.
