The mechanics are very simple: you and your enemy can only move around the circle, shoot at each other, or create deadly force fields. In version 5.0 you can either play against AI or PVP locally with your friends.<br/><br/>This game was made for the One hour game jam. All the beautiful juiciness in it was added after the jam was over. The version 1.0 is the one i actually made within the timeframe of the jam.<br/></p>\n<p>The sounds effects are public domain sounds, and the music i just straight ripped from youtube, so i'm gonna give the due credits to the artist.<br/>https://soundcloud.com/equinox-eurobeat/something-to-prove</p>\n<p>I hope he does'nt mind\u00a0:D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38b/38bcb87ff2e879d6bf79c0b4af826fa0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Red Groovy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
