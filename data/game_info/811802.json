You are a cube and you are chased by evil spheres. Dodge and shoot them to survive.</p>\n<p>For the theme \"Pick-a-side\" I focused on a mechanic where you can shoot from one of your cube's sides. You can rotate which side is active. This is important because each side is associated with a color, and each color kills spheres of the matching colors. <br/></p>\n<p>Engine and Tutorials:</p>\n<p>So I wanted to work with Unreal Engine 5 for this project. The blueprints scripting language is very powerful in enabling a non coder to make games. I only have a little bit of experience with the engine though, so I relied heavily on a series of tutorials to help me through the many little moving parts that this game needed. <br/></p>\n<p>Credits for Music:</p>\n<p>I found all my music and sound effects on Pixabay.</p>\n<p>Background Music: <br/></p>\n<p>Chill Abstract(Intention) - Music by Coma-Media from Pixabay<br/></p>\n<p>Sound Effects:</p>\n<p>Bottle-pop - jackyyang09 - Music from Pixabay</p>\n<p>PlasmaBlaster - BigDino1995 - Music from Pixabay</p>\n<p>Wrong - TheBuilder15 - Music from Pixabay</p>\n\n<p>Final Thoughts:</p>\n<p>I am very proud of myself for creating and publishing my first game. It's not very impressive, and there is a lot of features that I wanted to add that I didn't have the time for. That being said, I learned a lot about the technical bits of game design and also about the process of planning and implementing design. I am looking forward to the next one.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T13:59:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93e/93e26bbca7c9a0b3185cae6d2f5f0384.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RedCode999"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
