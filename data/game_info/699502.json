You play as Dexter, a programmer and hacker who, after receiving sensitive information about an underground organisation, is set on a hitlist and hunted by followers of the Corporation. After barely escaping the assassination attempt with the help of an old friend, you decide to hunt down every single boss of the organisation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The hunt will lead you all around the world to lots of different places. From the jungles of South America, to the desert of Sahara, over the deep forests of eastern Europe, and through the dark bunkers of the old soviet union, up till the big cities of Asia. On the way to your targets you will need to handle all types of weapons and slaughter your way through the lines of their loyal followers.<br/><br/><strong>Show them no mercy!
