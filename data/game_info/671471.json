We at Spooky Club 123 wanted to play around with the theme of dreams and in the end, came up with this idea. Created in one week, we made three rooms to test our mechanics as well as the environment/ feel.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy our game and any feedback would be appreciated!</p>\n<p>and remember to... <strong>wake up.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(PS.\u00a0The game will close itself when you\u00a0finish it!!)</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T05:40:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/524/524e9b10b236acf1b2277d6e7f3e00c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spooky Club 123"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
