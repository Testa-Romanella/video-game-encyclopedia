You are in control of a ball that can be customized, in a series of levels to race and perform to reach the finish before the time runs out.</p>\n<p><strong>OBSTACLES:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You'll encounter several obstacles, such as bumpers, slides and even gravity-shifting areas that can pull or attract you out of the course.</p>\n<p>The best part? Every time you get out of the course, you start at the beginning of the level! No wonder why is it rage-inducing ;).</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In order to move the ball, you only need to use WASD or the arrows of the keyboard. You can also use a controller for the game. In order to select the options of a menu, you can also use the mouse to select what you want.</p>\n<p>There's no jumping mechanisms nor complex methods.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Music:</em></p>\n<p>- Andres Vilches Cortes.
