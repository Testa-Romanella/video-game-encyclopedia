I have also greatly progressed my art skills with every asset and animation being made by me in gimp. As well as this I also made the music for my game, making the very basic score after learning some of the very basics of music theory (it's not much, but I'm still proud of it).</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game it has been my biggest, longest and most ambitious project yet and I have worked very hard to make it enjoyable.</p><p>Known issues:</p><p>-for some reason, UI buttons don't work in any scenes but the first one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T06:03:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea2/ea2de13e9f53b6ffa33c902a9d87bb80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["leon stansfield"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
