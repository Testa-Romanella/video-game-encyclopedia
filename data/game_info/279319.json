Don't lose any of the balls - it gets really challenging as the speed of the game increases!<br/><br/>It's not as easy as it looks! Start with 100 marbles, tap to release them and catch them in the cups and keep going until you run out of cups or marbles.<br/><br/>Watch for the rainbow cups - any balls you drop in the rainbow cups will increase the number of marbles you have in play. If you drop in 5 balls, an additional 5 balls will be added to your total.<br/><br/>Colored cups are great, any balls that you catch in a colored cup will add extra points to your score!<br/><br/>Play the game in classic, reverse or mixed mode!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:31:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/595/5951227900e921ed250e451412740d32_5ugmAME.jpg", "website": "http://www.appcollation.com/marble-mayhem/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Lab41"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Lab41"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
