Together with the hero, you will pass through a dangerous path known as \"life\". In the game, you will receive answers to the hero's question on the meaning of life (and maybe even answer your own questions). Maybe you will know the truth of being, or maybe just have fun with the game, who knows?</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>:</p>\n<p>Move\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0A/D \u2190/\u2192</p>\n<p>Crouch\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0S/\u2193</p>\n<p>Jump\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0W/\u2191/Space</p>\n<p>Run\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Left\u00a0Shift</p>\n<p>Fire\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0X/Right Ctrl</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>:</p>\n<p>Programmer\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mikhail Eremin<br/></p>\n<p>Artist/Game designer\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sergey Ushakov</p>\n<p>Composer/Sound designer\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Polka Bedlam</p>\n<p>daScript/dasbox by Gaijin Entertainment<br/></p>\n<p>Font Leto Text Sans Defect - Copyright (c) 2015 by Glenjan</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T10:57:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a09/a09a46c7396e28e4a5866c678d918b8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Miwwa"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
