Ky wakes up to find that a mysterious author has been writing in his old diary, giving ominous messages about things the author has taken from him and what he must do to get those items back. To pursue the author, Ky must enter different puzzles set in the world of his past, as written in his diary, and either with or without the help of his friends create paths through these puzzles. How the player chooses to reach out, as Ky, to his friends affects how he remembers his past throughout the four days of the game.</p>\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Narrative Director:\t\t\tMira Pianta\r\n</p>\n<p>NPC Designer:\t\t\tMira Pianta\r\n</p>\n<p>Dialogue Sprite Artist:\t\tAnnie Chang\r\n</p>\n<p>Concept Artist:\t\t\tEly Hernandez\r\n</p>\n<p>Puzzle Environment Artist:\tEly Hernandez\r\n</p>\n<p>Sound Designer:\t\t\tTianjian Xu\r\n</p>\n<p>Character Sprite Artist:\t\tAmy Gill\r\n</p>\n<p>Campus Environment Artists: \tAmy Gill,\u00a0Wenfei Peng</p>\n<p>Lead Programmer:\t\t\tDennis Chen\r\n</p>\n<p>Assistant Programmer: \t\tJosh Hacklander\u00a0</p>\n<p>Level Designer:\t\t\tSebastian Martinez</p>\n<p>Made in RPI's Game Dev 2 Class, Spring 2021.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T07:11:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b1/4b1e8e6aa8b0a3d0856d47801b909a12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dennis Chen"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
