This proves to be a constant source of amusement for Shio's classmates and they make fun of him, joking that he will make a good wife someday! <br/>Because of Ririsu, Shio has never had the chance to find a girlfriend. <br/><br/>One day, Ririsu introduces Shio to her classmate Chisa Hakosaki. Chisa was once very quiet and shy, but now her personality has evolved, \"Will you dance with me at the school festival party?\" Chisa asks Shio. Shio is confused at being asked out on a date by Chisa. Ririsu stares at Chisa and Shio, a complex expression spreading across her face. <br/><br/>With the autumn breeze, their story begins...", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-16T05:17:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/226/2266b3ab2cf2f4425acd1ee2f64fa271.jpg", "website": "http://5pb.jp/games/smapho/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 244, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["MAGES"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["MAGES"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
