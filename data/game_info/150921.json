It's also an experiment on using the data in a song file to generate game content - the puzzle will always be different with each play. The audio is interactive as well - so be assured nothing's wrong with your ears when you hear muffled music at the beginning!</p>\n<p>I honestly have yet to test this out on mobile devices, so no promises there. \u00a0Also - sorry, no kitty cats...</p>\n<p>To make this I used an HTML5 Canvas library called Konva. js. I made the music from scratch using LMMS. Aside from the song, it's all code. Thank you for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a0/4a0d9adb7170ff770ac79a10b166f4f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["P4thog3n"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
