It makes good use of sound and is quite feature rich. There are few controls so it is easy to get started and a good choice for the Roguelike newbie but it will take a while to master. It is a &#39;semi-realtime&#39; game - pause and the game will continue without you. An interesting feature that takes a little getting used to is that monsters fight you in the same square on screen - it looks like they&#39;ve disappeared, but they&#39;re actually right on top of you.</p>\n<p>Don&#39;t wake the sleeping dragons!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1995-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-06T16:13:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ccc/cccff70bdc640e1a211e393969720ada.jpg", "website": "http://codedread.com/games.php#COX/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Little Devils"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Little Devils"], "esrb_rating": null}
