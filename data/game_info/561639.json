The game is based on the popular game Space Invaders but with the twist of you playing as the Invaders. The goal is to kill the spaceship that tries to stop your invading 10 times. Nothing happens if all your spaceships die so know that when you lost. The theme was Strong Together and that's why I made a storm of spaceships trying to invade together and relying on each other.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T07:10:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84a/84aa89d70ab9831c79589ab393a99a0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["huck yuval"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
