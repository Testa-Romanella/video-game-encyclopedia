From mountains, to ruins, to deep dark forests, the world is your oyster, except there's one catch. This world doesn't want you here and you can't escape it.\u00a0</p>\n<em>Survive Against Increasing Odds</em>\n<p>Mysterious forces have brought monsters to these lands and have given you the ability to never die.\u00a0Fight hordes of enemies and survive for as long as possible as those that oppose you increase in strength. Use your abilities and the quick wits you gain from every run to explore more of the world and survive longer than you did previously. While hope may seem lost against never ending enemies,\u00a0you're not powerless in this struggle.\u00a0</p>\n<em>How Will You Fight?\u00a0</em>\n<p>Every playthrough presents new opportunities to go farther as every run is unique. Choose how you want to beat your foes using your abilities to adjust your play style.\u00a0Random loot gained as you progress can make or break a run, creating an overpowered or weak and frail hero; do you have the skill to conquer this challenge?\u00a0\r\n</p>\n\n<em>Credits</em>\n<p><strong>3D</strong>\u00a0<strong>Model Designer:</strong></p>\n<p>Jasmine Wells</p>\n<p><strong>Artist:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Tiff Hodges</p>\n<p><strong>Animators:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Tiff Hodges\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jasmine Wells\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Audio:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Isaiah McLain\u00a0</p>\n<p>Idia Software -\u00a0Blades &amp; Bludgeoning Free Sample Pack | Audio Sound FX | Unity Asset Store</p>\n<p><strong>Developers:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Stephen Foster</p>\n<p>Michal Obara</p>\n<p>Andrew Beck\u00a0</p>\n<p>Isaiah McLain\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Level\u00a0Designer:</strong></p>\n<p>Jasmine Wells</p>\n<p><strong>Producer:</strong></p>\n<p>Isaiah McLain\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Special thanks to the UNR's CS 328 class for play testing our game as well as our professor Nathan Navarro Griffin and TA Nasif Zaman for all their hard work helping design this game.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T13:26:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/963/9635e6f6cd87bc9a718f57e7a9a316e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["IsaiahMcLain"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
