The goal of the game is not to complete every level, it's about having fun! The game is impossible after all, unless you can prove me wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEnjoy all 10 'Impossible' levels. You can choose these levels in the main menu!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is my first ever game. When I started this project I had no experience making games. I followed a bunch of tutorials and made Impossible Runner! This was a passion project, that's why I'm releasing everything for free. Please do not expect a AAA, flawless experience. Many things might be missing in the game and you'll maybe find a few bugs here and there. Just know that everything was made with love and passion and this won't be my last game!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:54:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/796/796b3bb0b661b0164c5db3522724eef9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 120, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kwebbelkop"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Kwebbelkop"], "esrb_rating": null}
