Now, a\u00a0poor\u00a0dog has to make an ultimate sacrifice for the world! It needs to pee, but there's a bomb that needs defusing. Can it control his bladder until he defuses the bomb?</p>\n<p>Made for GMTK 2020 Game Jam, for the theme \"out of control\". We wanted to make a ridiculous out of control situation where there's a lot of things happening and players are struggling to keep it together, just like the dog. We wanted the players to FEEL like the dog, we even included a doggo vision.</p><p><strong><em>Note: sadly the web version doesn't wanna cooperate, so please download and play!</em></strong></p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul><li>Play as the fearless dog</li><li>Hold in your pee</li><li>Defuse the bomb</li><li>Become a hero</li><li>Features a lot of pee</li></ul>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Use ASDF buttons and press them in time with the on screen prompts.</li><li>Press LMB to interact with items</li><li>Click and hold the mouse\u00a0to drag objects between screens</li></ul>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<p>- all credits to the font maker of chocoletta Peter Olexa</p>\n<p>- all credits to the person owning the bomb picture used</p>\n<p>If you need more credits please contact me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T17:14:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b3/5b3a7309de9d72f085615884b6742023.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TinyMoldGames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
