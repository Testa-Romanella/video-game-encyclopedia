It's in the title. You, in a room, four pale-green colored walls, stained carpet, and those funky ceiling tiles you definitely imagined punching out when you were a kid.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAre you looking for groundbreaking mechanics? There's one function in the game - you flick a switch.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMaybe award-winning graphics? Well, it is Unreal Engine 5. But let's be honest here, the engine is not in the slightest sense utilized to its highest ability in this game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHow about immersive story-driven gameplay? Nope. Not here. Unless you consider the story of you really reconciling with the fact you spent money to flick a virtual switch, when you and I both know you are most likely sitting in a room right now that has a few switches scattered around the walls. Have fun staring at your bank account later, wondering where it all went wrong as you dove helplessly into the immersive world of a 9x9x9 room with ONE SWITCH ON THE WALL FOR YOU TO INTERACT WITH.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAnyways, let's jump ahead to the key features:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are none.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDepending on how you judge the \"ending\" of a game, or how you would quantify your sense of sanity in terms of time spent playing a game where you do absolutely nothing but stand in a single room flicking a single switch as time around you ticks on; endlessly disregarding any sense of desperation for it to slow down so that you may bask in the sanctity of joy for even a brief moment, until hopefully the power cuts out, or someone comes to your aide to end this troubling sense of self infliction -- It should take you around 1 - 30 minutes to complete the game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBuy it, don't buy it. Totally your decision. This game will not keep you up at night, nor will it have you beckoning for more; but if for some reason it does butter your cups, douse your daisies in oil, or roll your drums, then I may consider you take some time away from gaming for a short period, or maybe the whole period.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI do not, in any sense of lacking the word, hope that you do not find, to any extent, any sense of enjoyment from this game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFinal note: The selected reviews above are totally not from ChatGPT.
