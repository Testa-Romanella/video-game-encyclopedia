Your instructor Pang, the chemistry cat, will help you through your first experiment: an acid/base titration. Simply click the \"Run Game\" button to get started. In simulation mode, you'll have full\u00a0access to all\u00a0of the\u00a0laboratory equipment and chemicals you'll need to perform titrations of strong/weak acid and bases. In game mode (currently under development), you'll earn more advanced equipment and fun add-ons by completing titration challenges.</p>\n<p>Whether you're studying for a\u00a0chemistry class, looking to brush up on your lab knowledge, or simply curious about acid/base chemistry, I hope virtual titration will prove to be a useful (and fun!) tool. If you want to ask questions, report a bug, or simply leave feedback, feel free to post in the comments below!</p>\n<p>Virtual Titration is the first of hopefully many Gaming Applications for Mastering and Enjoying Science (GAMES).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52c/52cfa8814062a59c453c6c79c87c9ff4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["scientistsarepeopletoo"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
