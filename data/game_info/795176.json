Play the full mode with 9 levels or the shorter mode with only 4. All levels created by me, not procedurally generated.<br/></p>\n<p>Make your way through the underworld to rescue Eurydice. Once you have gotten her, make your way back up but you cannot move right or up.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Can you make it out without turning around to look and see if Eurydice is following?</p>\n\n<p>Use WASD/arrow keys to move. Press \"P\" to pause if you need to restart the game after getting stuck. Use Spacebar or Left Mouse\u00a0Click to play your \"lyre\" at your enemies!</p>\n\n<p>Sound effects created using Bosca Ceoil.
