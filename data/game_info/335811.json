{"id": 335811, "slug": "shin-hayarigami", "name": "Shin Hayarigami", "name_original": "Shin Hayarigami", "description": "<p>The game takes place in a fictional, but unnamed prefecture (Known as Prefecture S) and village (Known as Village C) where players take on the role of Saki Hojo, a female police officer who has been with the force for a few months after graduating from the local police academy. Blind Man, a Serial Killer from urban myth, has been deemed a suspect for killing people in the prefecture by taking their eyes and tongues out. Due to this problem, the National Police Agency has brought in Sojiro Sekimoto, an ex-university occultist professor who was arrested in 2012 for being involved in the death of a university student under his watch. Thanks to a distant relative in the Public Prosecutor&#39;s Office note , he was placed in the custody of the S Prefectural Police. Sekimoto and Saki team up, relying on the former&#39;s expertise to determine if Blind Man is someone trying to take advantage of the urban myth or if the paranormal really is starting to get involved. But the Blind Man case isn&#39;t the only one Saki and the police need to investigate.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-01T08:02:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/912/9123d5140e3541f40d1816946ca3854a.jpg", "website": "https://hayarigami.com/shin_hayarigami/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 427, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PS Vita", "PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Nippon Ichi Software"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Nippon Ichi Software"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
