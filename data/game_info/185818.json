I have been working on it on and off for 2-3 years now and I am finally pleased to present the finished product.</p><p>YANITL is a masochistic, hardcore, 2d platformer in the same vein as Super Meat Boy. It's a hard game. Really hard. I'm not saying this for hyperbole. Rest assured that all of the levels are 100% possible, no matter how much you swear they aren't.</p><p>Thank you for playing and (hopefully) enjoying my game.
