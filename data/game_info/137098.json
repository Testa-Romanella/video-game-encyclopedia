When time has come to leave the safety of the leaf to hunt, some spiders play it safe and go out during the calm periods, while other more daring spiders venture out in the middle of a storm. During the storms the noms are easier to spot but the spiders risk getting their web torn right underneath their feet.</p><p>Movement - WASD / Arrow keys<br/>Menu - Esc<br/><br/>My first Ludum Dare! The theme was \"A Small World\". Submitted in the last minute, not very thoroughly tested and a lot of stuff still left on the todo list.
