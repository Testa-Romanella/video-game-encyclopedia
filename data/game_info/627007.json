We do not know much of them as of yet other than that they are relatively low of fuel and air. All they want Neon.</p>\n<p>The jolly news is that we do happen to have some here on Earth. Neon is also the fifth most abundant element in the universe! Neon is a chemical element with the symbol Ne and atomic number 10. It is a noble gas. Neon is a colourless, odourless, inert monatomic gas under standard conditions, with about two-thirds the density of air.</p>\n<p>Our problem is, it is present in the Earth's atmosphere at a concentration of just 18 parts per million. It is extracted by fractional distillation of liquid air. And these visitors want ALL of it!</p>\n<p>Luckily they have only sent out their scout drones. WE HAVE TO STOP THEM! Maybe in the future we can research their technologies. At the moment, we do not have the any great weaponry, apart from modified drones armed with guns. Use your bullets sparingly, that crap is heavy to cargo in to space!</p>\n<p>Good Luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T09:44:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e16/e166eb6020e5cfb9c8fc417a752a02f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NicolaasJKotze"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
