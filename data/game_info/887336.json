We were given the task of developing an easily accessible, asymmetrical multiplayer clicker game, inspired by the visual language of old dating shows.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Based on this romantic background, we created the storyline in which a cat owner is preparing their flat for a nice date. Their crush is only a few minutes away from the flat when the owner realises that their cat has a completely different plan. Driven by jealousy, the animal begins to vomit hairballs all over the flat. Time is running out and love is at stake.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Who will manage to redecorate the flat as they feel appropriate? <br/>In an entertaining game, Cat Owner and the cat act against each other, interrupted only by a shop full of helpful upgrades.</p>\n<p><strong><br/>The question remains: <br/>who acts more tactically and WHO CLICKS FASTER?</strong></p>\n\n\r\nControls:\r\n\n\r\nCredits:\r\nProducers:<br/>Celine Neubig &amp;<br/>Andreas Strahm<br/><br/>Programming:<br/>Luca Imesch (Lead)<br/> Dorias Sch\u00e4rer<br/><br/>Art:<br/>Dana Senn (Lead)<br/>Anja Irniger, Yoshi Zigerli,<br/>Charisse Ann de Leon<br/><br/>Sound &amp; Music:<br/>Clara Georgi (Lead)<br/>Dominik Stettler<br/><br/>Mechanics:<br/>Janosch B\u00fcchi (Lead)<br/>Thanh Le, Jan Hobi, Yevhen Kozlov", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T10:49:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00c/00c4d92b9db0d6aaad082f741bdc097b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["aoyuna", "milkimoone", "Luna-Elaine", "Margaritha", "Tondar", "Jan Hobi", "anchiyis", "doriasschaerer", "Yevhen", "deadhok", "Akandamador", "Enigma_Celine"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
