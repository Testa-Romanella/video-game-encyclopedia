You have to survive this darkened consumed world by lighting the three towers that are located somewhere in die world. Some of the plants have adapted to the darkness and can survive by using their life force to emit light, keeping the darkness at bay. Use these plants and other resources to your advantage, the path to victory will be shown.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Be warned, the darkness pulls the life out of anything it touches. As time goes by the darkness' powers grows stronger and the light that is being provided by the plants gets less and weaker with the overbearing darkness. It is your job to rid the world of the darkness before it consumes you too. Light those three towers before your time runs out.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\r\nW A S DFor movement\u00a0LEFT SHIFTSprintEHold 'E'pickup or interact with itemsLEFT MOUSE BUTTONPlace ItemTAB\u00a0\u00a0Open/Close BackpackSPACE\u00a0\u00a0JumpMOUSE WHEEL\u00a0Change Hotbar itemF1Help MenuF3Hide UI\r\n\n\n\n\n<p>Some Sourced Assets:</p>\n<ul><li>Immortal_Font from\u00a01001FreeFonts.com</li><li>GameJam_Platform_maker from SideFX</li><li>Terrain textures from Quixel</li><li>Some plants from Quixel</li><li>All sounds and music from WeLoveIndies.com</li></ul>\n<p>The complete list can be found here</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T01:45:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/071/071b7d47ff0b7c75fb23f1cbd054cef6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DefSteam08"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
