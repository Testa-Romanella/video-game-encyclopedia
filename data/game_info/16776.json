Developed by the Brazilian Critical Studio. Dungeonland is a multiplayer hack/slash game with an isometric camera and a bet on co-passing. The game is missing the plot, the only thing that connects the levels is a typical visual style, setting, and characters. The game is set in a theme park.</p>\n<p>You can play the game solo, and with friends. Competitive multiplayer is not here, but there is the opportunity to play the role of Dungeon Maestro and build obstacles for other players, creating obstacles from the vast exploding frogs and killer rabbits.</p>\n<p>The publisher of the game was the Swedish Paradox Interactive, which had plans to turn IP into a franchise. In April 2018, the developers announced on Steam, that the contract on the server hosting for the multiplayer matches would not be renewed. The game was also removed from the store, leaving the opportunity to play alone or using the capabilities of the LAN for all users that had already bought the game.</p>", "metacritic": 67, "released": "2013-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T12:15:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/604/604da4b50bbbcb569c1267c73d421dc2.jpg", "website": "http://www.dungeonlandgame.com/", "rating": 1.97, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 59, "owned": 1441, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 23}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 53, "ratings_count": 58, "suggestions_count": 539, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 58, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Critical Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Paradox Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
