You move the player to the left and to the right using the \"A\" &amp; \"D\" keys and that's all there is. With practice you will be able to use the gravity and other forces to your advantage to move your cube in the desired direction. Great mysteries await the master seekers who reach the top.\r\n\u2022The five Platonic Solids were thought to represent the five basic elements: earth, air, fire, water, and the universe. Plato envisioned Earth\u2019s building blocks as cubes, a shape rarely found in nature. Between 2 minutes and infinite hours of agonizing gameplay, experience the world between the sky and earth as a platonic cube\u00a0\r\n\u2022 Lose all your progress, over and over.\r\n\u2022 Feel new types of frustration you didn't know you were capable of.\r\n\u201cExcellence\" is not a gift, but a skill that takes practice. We do not act \"rightly\" because we are \"excellent\",in fact we achieve \"excellence\" by acting \"rightly\"\r\n<strong>- Plato</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T03:14:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d13/d13a6462cbb65b8220e2ef1339e27ef1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Saurabh Rajput"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
