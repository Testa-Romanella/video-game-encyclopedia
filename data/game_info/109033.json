{"id": 109033, "slug": "escape-the-ai-lab", "name": "Escape the AI Lab", "name_original": "Escape the AI Lab", "description": "<p>An asymmetric couch-game for 2-4 players (controllers recommended, and required for 4th player) in which one player takes on the role of the sinister electronic mastermind controlling a retro-futuristic lab filled with deadly puzzles (is this sounding familiar yet) and has to prevent up to three other players from reaching the exit by whatever means necessary.</p><p>Created for the Game Dev League September Jam, over a period of just 48 hours.</p><p>Unity sometimes has issues with controllers, therefore limited keyboard support is also available. Player 1 (the AI lab-mastermind) needs only four buttons (on a controller: A, B, X and Y, on a keyboard: 1, 2, 3 and 4). Player 2 is only controllable by the second controller plugged in. Players 3 is mapped to W, S, A and D, with Q to spawn, while player 4 is mapped to Up, Down, Left and Right, with Return to spawn. To quit the game, the universal Alt-F4 is the only supported way.</p><p>Art and Design by: Hannes Delbeke, Bruno Lebrun, Sarah Arthur</p><p>Code and production by: Nick Turner and Susanna Rowland</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eda/eda46b7c84d04b6199b935c2cfdd6fd4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nick Turner"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
