Which by the way is totally not going to happen (knock on wood.)  Us getting hit by a bus.  What probably is going to happen is we're going to keep adding new tracks and new game modes, and checking the forums to read how you guys like (or don't) the stuff we added, and going back and making changes,  and issuing more updates, until at some point we decide enough is enough, put a fork in it, and call it done. <br/><br/>Until that day, please enjoy the game and lay on us whatever constructive feedback you care to share in the forums.  We promise to at least consider it.<h3>What's this game about?</h3><br/>Beach Buggy Racing 2 is set in an action-packed, surprise-filled world of off-road kart racing mayhem.  Race against a field of rival drivers, each with a unique special ability.  Explore Egyptian pyramids, dragon-infested castles, pirate ship wrecks, and experimental alien bio-labs.  Attack other drivers with over 40 different Powerups like Dodgeball Fury, Donut Tires, Death Bat, and Chain Lightning.<h3>What's currently in the game?</h3><br/>We're updating the game regularly while it's in Early Access.
