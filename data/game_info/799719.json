Build anything out of rods, joints, wheels, wings, electric motors and rocket boosters.<br/>The only limit is your imagination and your CPU.<br/>Simulate your contraption. What can be assembled can be disassembled, so be careful, or don't!<br/><br/>There are two types of pre-built contraptions.</p>\n<p><strong>- Rocket Plane:</strong><br/><br/>Use Space to activate the boosters. Use S to pitch upward and W to pitch downward. Keep the camera pointing in the direction you want to steer. Use A and D to roll.<br/><br/><strong>- Car-t:</strong><br/><br/>Use W to accelerate forward and S to decelerate and accelerate backwards. Use A and D to steer.<br/><br/>Inputs can be assigned for every motor and rocket booster. Inputs can also be changed from the settings view.<br/><br/><strong>Known Issues:</strong></p>\n<p>- Rocket plume glitches.<br/>- Performace drops, \u00a0mostly on Windows.<br/>- Wheel friction is too low.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T08:09:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5c/b5c7b43c0cd1fba6ef9c515f171d5fb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Game Fabric"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
