A glimpse of freedom! Leap Of Faith is about a fish who escapes the fish bowl and makes a break for the ocean. Jump from pond to pond and through people's houses to reach our goal. Careful, the game is not easy, and you may want to give up :) Good luck!</p>\r\nInstructions:\r\n<p>- Drag backwards to bring up a power indicator, showing the direction and force in which your fish will fly<br/>- Move right until you reach the ocean, but be careful, it gets weird<br/>- Don't run out of oxygen, and stop in water (*any water*) to restart the O2 bar<br/>- Be free!</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>- Programming/Game Design: Cipherix<br/>- Art: JukeBoxTheGhosts<br/>- Music: Borkakke</p>\r\nThis game was made in 3 days for Ludum Dare 46", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T07:34:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6f/b6f14cee9c113fa3c56026a6cf7ffa35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Cipherix Studios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
