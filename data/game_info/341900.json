Bugs, too, if you happen to stumble upon. Put any of that in the comments, or contact me @ creeepling@gmail.com.</p>\n<p>Oh, and character sprites are currently placeholders, and no music/sound. :(</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy the demo!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b68/b688fa71bd8c8b91d3d1bb78a46de2d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Creeepling"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
