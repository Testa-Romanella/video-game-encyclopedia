Starting from a harmonious village, then there was a misunderstanding that became a disaster for us all. All of this has been a long time ago, but we are not finished here.</p>\n<p>There are several ways we can eradicate the evil skeleton enemy such as :</p>\n<p><strong>1. TOWERS</strong><br/>The tower is a very crucial thing when playing Skeleton Defender because the tower can fire bullets which will reduce the health of its enemies. There are several types of towers, such as</p>\n<p><em>- Gun Tower</em>: Tower that doesn't have any additional effects. The price is cheap but has pretty strong damage.</p>\n<p><em>- Fire Tower</em>: Tower that can cause area damage as well as continuous damage for a while to the enemy.</p>\n<p><em>- Ice Tower</em>: Tower which if it hits the enemy will cause a slow effect on the enemy and if the tower is at max level it will be a freeze effect.</p>\n<p><em>- Sniper Tower</em>: Tower that is very strong because it has high damage, very far range, and also has a critical effect that will increase with the tower level.</p>\n<p>Towers in Skeleton Defender have an upgrade feature that will add stats in the form of Damage, Fire rate, Radius, and Projectile Speed. Each upgrade has its own difference for the tower.</p>\n<p><strong>2. SKILLS</strong><br/>Skill is also one of the crucial things when playing Skeleton Defender. Skills can help players if they have difficulty facing enemies.<br/>There are several skills, namely:</p>\n<p><em>- Fireball</em><br/>A skill that inflicts a damaged area of 300damage. The cooldown of this skill is 30 seconds.</p>\n<p><em>- Stun</em><br/>This skill can stun the area of damage and also deals with 30 damage. The cooldown of this skill is 15 seconds.</p>\n<p>Skills in SkeletonDefender don't have MANA (MP) but are replaced by COOLDOWN (CD). And each skill has its own advantages and disadvantages.</p>\n<p><strong>3. GUARDIANS</strong><br/>Guardian is an additional feature that can help players to eradicate enemies. Guardian is the same as towers, but the difference is that the Guardian does not need gold in-game to build it because it is pre-built. But to upgrade Guardians, players can upgrade through the shop on the Main Menu.<br/>The shop will be coming soon.</p>\n<p>Some info about the developer of this game: This game was developed by Steward MelvinTang, A 14 years old Solo Indie Game Developer from Indonesia.
