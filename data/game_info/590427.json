Every round 3 picks are possible. The bigger the fruit, the higher the score.\u00a0 If the ninja is the award the player (is lucky) gets all the points from the fruits and then everything gets doubled. If there are still picks available new fruits will be in the game and one new ninja. After a round the score is fixed, if the score is higher than the highscore it's a win and if not it's a lose. The player can play a new round to beat his/her highscore.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Resources:</p>\n<p>https://www.fontspace.com/toona-font-f58622</p>\n<p>https://www.looperman.com/loops/detail/199909/real-ukulele-lofi-chords-ocean-20k...</p>\n\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T09:33:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c6/5c6ee7182c72efb6ca325e299a2725b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ismo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
