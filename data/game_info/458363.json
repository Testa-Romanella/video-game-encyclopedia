{"id": 458363, "slug": "elephant-game-demo", "name": "Elephant Game DEMO", "name_original": "Elephant Game DEMO", "description": "This is the first playable build of my current Elephant-based project. Feel free to let me know if there are any bugs/broken things that occur while you play! It's a very short demo (should only take a few minutes to complete) so give it a shot if you feel like it!\r\n\r\n\r\nControls: \r\n<p><strong>A &amp; D</strong> = Move &amp; Swim Left/Right</p>\n<p><strong>W &amp; S</strong> = Climb Up/Down Ladders &amp; Swim Up/Down</p>\n<p><strong>W + A &amp; D</strong> = Climb up adjacent 1-tile high blocks, assuming you're facing them and <br/>close enough, and you're not swimming/climbing a ladder/falling</p>\n<p><strong>S</strong> = Lift object when facing liftable objects (mostly Pots, Chests, and Statue Pieces here), when close enough, and when standing on solid ground</p>\n<p><strong>S + Carrying liftable object</strong> = Place carried object down, assuming there is space for it in front of you in the direction you're facing</p>\n<p>- Most liftable objects will despawn if moved from their starting locations, left behind in a room, or placed/dropped outside of a room. If you get stuck because you've placed blocks and trapped yourself, just wait for a minute! They should clear themselves out, and allow you to reset the room!</p>\n<p>- Chests can be difficult to unlock. Applying a great deal of force to them can sometimes pop them open though.</p>\n<p>- Some of our Elephant friend's current powers may be missing initially if/when I make a full game of this. However, they've decided that they can share a fraction of their true power for the sake of the demo.</p>\n<p>I hope you all enjoy! <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T04:34:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c09/c09bb39ed47ceb99dd236d92588b2f0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Linker"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
