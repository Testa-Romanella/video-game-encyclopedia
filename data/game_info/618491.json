All under the watchful eye of Mr Doge! :)</p><p>Game tips:<br/>- UP, DOWN keys to move the block to a different lane<br/>- LEFT key to speed up the block<br/>- ESC ends the current session<br/>- Goal is chain/join as many blocks as possible by matching the colour/shape<br/>- Matching chained blocks (turns green) will increase the Coin Price, non-matched blocks (turns red) will reduce the Coin Price.<br/>- Game is over when the Coin Price drops to $0!<br/>~ Watch out for Dumps, where the Coin Price drops faster than usual - you'll know it when this happens ;) Quickly chain matching blocks to recover.<br/></p><p>Thank you for dropping by, and trying out the game!
