For those lucky enough to claim it...</em>\"<br/><br/>A game of chance and strategy; The ultimate Roll Playing Game!\u00a0Get Rolland to the end of the dungeon and defeat 'Die Hard', but beware... The other dice don't take too kindly to dungeon delvers, and attack when Rolland gets too close. In battle, chose between Attacking, Charging and Parrying to tip the odds in your favour. Get a higher total on your pool of dice than your opponent to succeed in each bought. Deplete your opponents HP to 0 to win, but be careful of the same happening to yourself.<br/>Win the fight to gain part of their die and collect each set to add them to your own rolls. Only the truly powerful stand a chance to dice with 'Die Hard'!
