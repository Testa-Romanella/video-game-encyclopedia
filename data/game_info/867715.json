Thank you for looking at this page and thank you for even trying my game. It honestly means a lot to me and I hope you enjoy what you play. And if you don't please feel free to leave me feedback that I can apply to my next game!<br/></p>\n<p>Circus Royale is a very simple game that I'm incredibly proud of. I'm glad I stuck to the release date and delivered. Here is to releasing many more games in the future!</p>\r\nWhy release this game?\r\n<p>The short answer is simple: failure. I've been so afraid of being a failure or being called a fraud that I've never openly released a game. For the past 10 years of my life I've dreamt of opening a game studio and making unique and inspiring games. During those 10 years I'd tinker and open unity but never fully committed to making a game until now. Why the change of heart? Because I see the amazing things games can do, the myriad of emotions that videogames can make us feel. I want to be a part of that community, making creative, innovative, and ultimately fun experiences that anyone can enjoy.</p>\n<p>I'm excited for what's ahead and this game is just the first of many!</p>\n<p>Randy Wiafe<br/>Founder, Happy Distraction Studios</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Writing - Chuck Zodl</p>\n<p>Images - Midjourney</p>\n<p>Sound Effects - Pixabay\u00a0</p>\n<p>Music -\u00a0Krampus\u2019s Workshop and\u00a0Fluffing a Duck by Kevin MacLeod | https://incompetech.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T16:36:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d5/6d530e0d2f0179e0d9f5856fccc2c091.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["wiafe"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
