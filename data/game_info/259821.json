Your carrier, Zvezda is cut behind enemy lines and through ten missions, you and your team try to strike back at merciless enemy.<br/>Missions consist of defending your carrier, flying reconnaissance missions and destroying enemy capital ships.<br/><br/>Typical mission starts with briefing, where you will learn about mission. Than you will take off from carrier and will then navigate (hyper jump) from waypoint to waypoint. At each way point, you are expected to clear enemy presence and defend our capital ships. Typically, you will fly with a group of wingmen.<br/><br/>Games is best to be played with a joystick, since game is quite demanding, at least at high difficulty. Joystick adds much fun into gameplay.
