Move with the left and right arrow keys, jump with Z, and attack with X. <br/></p>\n<p>I chose this game because I wanted to give others the feeling I had when I played it. My goal was to have a brief teaser of everything <em>Castlevania III </em>has to offer: excellent music, satisfying control of the player character, secret easter eggs, and a rich gothic aesthetic. I only wish I had time to include the steep difficulty!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This is the closest thing I've made to a 2D platformer game, so it was challenging learning how it worked at first. I thought allowing the player to explore a little before seeing the name of the game would create a sense of mystery. Initially, I wanted to have a short level, but that turned out to be way too tough. The hardest part by far was getting the 2D gravity physics to work properly.</p>\n<p>Here was the order in which I tackled the project:</p>\n<p>1. 2D Physics</p>\n<p>3. Palette</p>\n<p>4. Spritework</p>\n<p>5. Background</p>\n<p>6. Interaction</p>\n<p>7. Sound<br/></p>\n<p>8. Wall Chicken</p>\n<p>Followed by bug fixes, mostly the hit detection and collision with the wall on the left. This project definitely taught me a lot of things I shouldn't do when programming a large-scale game with lots of objects and levels. I feel like a stronger programmer regardless.</p>\n<p><strong>Features of the poster (SPOILERS)</strong>:</p>\n<p>You can attack the gear in just the right spot to reveal the title of the game.</p>\n<p>Break the blocks on the left side for some tasty Wall Chicken.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T10:14:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d7/7d7a6da5edff8bb4971aa884f86507d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["malacursed"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
