Embark on an exciting escape through Antarctica. Playing as one of the seemingly helpless penguins. To jump from one ice floe to another, you will need to press one of the four keys in time, to the beat of the music.<br/><br/>For greater interest in the game, various costumes for penguins are implemented: from a penguin who for some reason put a saucepan on his head to an intellectual with a monocle. In addition to costumes for penguins, you can choose different animations for overcoming obstacles, such as jumping or sliding on your belly! <br/>Each time the game is procedurally generated a new world, which will extend the pleasant experience of the game.<br/><br/>Don't let your penguin make it, because you only have one try. Have a good trip to Antarctica!<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T06:26:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51f/51f33f11dd81a3181db72dcbc9a1189c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crooked Road"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Piece Of Voxel"], "esrb_rating": null}
