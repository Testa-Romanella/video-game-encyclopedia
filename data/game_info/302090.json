{"id": 302090, "slug": "down-with-it", "name": "Down With It!", "name_original": "Down With It!", "description": "<p>WARNING: THIS GAME CONTAINS MANY INTENSE FLASHING LIGHTS. PLEASE BE AWARE IF YOU HAVE EPILEPSY/RELATED ILLNESS.</p>\n<p>You're angry. At corporations, at your life...hell, even the entire world. You set out to expose these corporate scum for who they are. Fair bit of warning though, you may be met with a little opposition...</p>\n<p>This is a short experimental game where you cause destruction and mayhem in a workplace while an intense breakbeat song is played. And it's all caught on surveillance. <br/>It features random level generation, dynamic destructible environments and sprites, and a unique look that changes as the song plays. My goal was to create something that matched the song that I was inspired by, which is called \"Down With The Sh*T\" by Alec Empire. The entire song plays for the duration of the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For right now, I like to think of this\u00a0as a nice demo/proof of concept for a much larger game down the line. I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>Controls: WASD/Arrow keys to move, spacebar to switch weapons (you have a sword and a gun), left click to attack with the sword and shoot with the gun, right click to do a dash attack with the sword or put on a laser sight for the gun. <br/>Hints: The sword is more accurate that the gun, but uses stamina (stamina bar on the top left labelled \"Zoom\"), and the gun isn't as accurate as the sword, but doesn't use stamina. When you die you respawn with no penalties, and have a second of invulnerability. <br/>The game is meant to be played in a fast paced manner, where you may need to run away from enemies temporarily to regain some stamina.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d45/d45d1cda6e86d3aeaa1c503307310ee4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TimbreGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
