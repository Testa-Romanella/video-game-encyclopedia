It was a <strong>1v1 sport game</strong> with two player using <strong>magnetism </strong>to project a ball into the opponent's goal.</p>\n<p>We decided to focus on the <strong>magnetism mechanics</strong> for the gameplay and we reworked the theme of the base game wich was also \"<strong>robot apocalypse</strong>\".</p>\n<p>So we thought it was a great idea to instead of magnetism a ball arround the player, the player could be the ball himself.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The player have multiple opponents, each of them will hit you as soon as you slow down, forcing the player to maintain a certain speed.</p>\n<p>We strongly encourage the player to do long projection by putting checkpoints far from him and by making him invincible at high speed.</p>\n\r\nPOST MORTEM\r\n<p>Radius champions has two principal defaults :</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- The lack of a <strong>clear objective</strong> : the player doesn't know what he needs to do and usually just fly arround following the arrows.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- The lack of <strong>challenge </strong>: the opponents are always here but not enough aggressive and they rarely attack.</p>\n<p>Plus some minors default like\u00a0the game feel, which \u00a0is a little bit off sometimes, the pacing and the lack of change in the environment (several ambiances could have been cool). And if we had handled controls a bit better, we wouldn't have needed the slow motion to aim.</p>\n\n<p>The main qualities are :</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Good <strong>sense of speed</strong>, i think the camera and the sound are doing a great job improving the feeling of flying at high speed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- <strong>Hitting things</strong>, currently it is pretty hard to attack the opponents but it gives a good impact and is satisfying when we manage to hit them. This should have been more important in the global design of the game.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Only two input, since the game was design for mobile, we manage to make the game work using only two input.</p>\n\n\n<p>This game was made with :</p>\n<p>Styxou :\u00a0here</p>\n<p>Lumia : here<br/></p>\n<p>Uxross :\u00a0here</p>\n<p>SachaY :\u00a0here</p>\n<p>Adrien Franquet : here</p>\n\r\nUSE UP ARROW AND SPACE TO PLAY ON PC", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-17T03:13:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa7/fa73b1d1eeed462edc17587f4ca1b2b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SachaY", "Styxou", "LuLu_Lumia", "Adrien Franquet"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
