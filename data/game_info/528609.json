In the game, you play as different characters who are trying to survive home invasions. You must run, hide, and use objects in the house to survive. There are no save points, it is meant to be beaten in one run. There are different endings that depend on your actions in the game.</p>\n<p>For now only chapter one of the story mode is available but there is more to come!</p>\n<p>Personal Note: This is my first game, I've been working on it for 5 years and it has grown with me. I am the only developer on it and it taught me a lot about game development and it was really fun to work on. I want to thank everyone who plays and supports this game and everyone who contributed to the making of it, all of it really means a lot to me. Even though this is the 1.0 release of the game, there is still a lot of work to do. I\u00a0plan on creating more content for the game and fixing any issues that the game may have, I want to make this the best game it can be so I am open to feedback and actively looking for bugs and glitches. Also feel free to post any gameplay videos that you make in the comments section, I\u00a0will watch every single one! I hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T07:39:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/607/60781e7a142be2ce28b946ff0b8563aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Younggamer123"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
