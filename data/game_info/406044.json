It's more of a kinetic graphic novel\u00a0than a\u00a0game. It's fairly amateur, but I hope it's still enjoyable.</p>\n<p>NOTES:\u00a0</p>\n<p>As the game deals with such topics, there are non-graphic depictions of\u00a0transphobia and homophobia.</p>\n<p>There are three montages of full-screen images that dissolve into each other during the game. Unfortunately, if you click during a montage, you'll skip the whole thing. If you do click accidentally,\u00a0 just click the 'back' button to return to the beginning of the montage.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T02:05:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c11/c119a102d60e653a3baaeea2fa80f738.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EmSun"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
