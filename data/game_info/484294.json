I am really happy that I managed to finish a small game\u00a0in very short time. I am planning to later on, after I add a lot more thing release it as a full game (still on itch, and probably for free). Hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>And don't rage. It's hard.</p>\n<p>Controls: A and D to move (unfortunately for old-school gamers, you can't use arrow keys. I'll probably put it later on)</p>\n\n<p>Don't ask me why you have 7 lives. I just like that number (actually because I was debugging some code, and my highscore was too high for me to beat it with just 5 lives, so I made it be 7. And I forgot to bring it back to 5).</p>\n\n<p>If you like the\u00a0 game, maybe consider donating a bit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T07:17:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61d/61de80dbe94cb6c32654ee79af286102.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IKDev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
