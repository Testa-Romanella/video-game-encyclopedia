First the\u00a0<br/>landscape mesh was made using the landscape tools in Unreal Engine 4. Next, the\u00a0dig functionality was built which allowed the mesh to be altered in-game to simulate\u00a0digging terrain. The random spawner then had to be implemented to allow the treasure\u00a0to spawn dynamically within a defined space just below the surface of the ground.\u00a0With all of the basic functionality present, other elements, such as models and HUD\u00a0elements, were added. Finally, a timer and score system were created to give the\u00a0player a goal while playing the game. The refinement process involved improving the\u00a0map layout and adding background music to better immerse the player. A menu system\u00a0was also included to allow the player to view instructions and navigate between the\u00a0main menu and game level.</p>\n<p><strong>What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it?</strong></p>\n<p>The first version of Metal Detective was the first game I created with a clear\u00a0<br/>objective and a win/lose condition. I learned how take a game idea and implement\u00a0the code so that it functions as a playable game. To make it more appealing, I\u00a0developed three-dimensional models in Autodesk Maya to help build a believable world.\u00a0It was very basic and as I refined the piece I tried to build upon this foundation\u00a0and develop a game that incorporated some of the new skills I had picked up. I used\u00a03ds Max to create a metal detector model and added a dynamic material to allow the\u00a0indicator to flash in-game in conjunction with the sound cue.</p>\n<p><strong>What challenges did you face?</strong></p>\n<p>The main challenge I faced when refining this piece was having to revisit a project\u00a0and figure out how I had organized various aspects of the game. Now that I am more\u00a0comfortable with Unreal Engine development, I have learned some of the standards and\u00a0am able to better organize my work. Also, I was unable to get the character animations\u00a0to mix with the metal detector during the refinement phase. This was due to a lack of\u00a0experience and time constraints. To overcome this issue, the character is hidden in\u00a0the updated version.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you incorporate feedback as you made changes to the artifact?</strong></p>\n<p>The feedback received from the first version of Metal Detector mainly focused on the\u00a0structure of the game while the player is searching for treasure. There was no clear\u00a0goal or end condition, meaning that the game was very boring and could last for a long\u00a0time. This led to some changes that ensured the player knew exactly what their objective\u00a0was and set a clear limit to how long the game would last.</p>\n<p><strong>How was the artifact improved?</strong></p>\n<p>- Rebuilt the landscape mesh and assigned it to the beach component<br/>- Created a larger level and rearranged the environmental components<br/>- Created a model for the metal detector in 3ds Max and assigned a dynamic material to give visual feedback to the player<br/>- Adjusted the detector collision to compensate for the new model<br/>- Added a background track to the level<br/>- Created a main menu, pause menu, and game over menu with button graphics</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-18T02:23:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed1/ed193d8b9f3435193db6deadcbfb6b00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dillionaire"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
