{"id": 894594, "slug": "rance-vi-5d", "name": "Rance VI + 5D", "name_original": "Rance VI + 5D", "description": "Rance 5D -The Lonely Girl-\nContinuing from Rance 4.1 and 4.2, 5D takes place in the same universe as the rest of the series, but it tells a standalone story and can be played with no knowledge of the previous Rance games.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are stories of Rance not as a king, but as a simple swordsman going on adventures. There are playful stories and cool stories, but it's mostly playful stories with a few cool stories in between. Games like Rance 3 and 4, with ambitious scales, are the cooler type, and you could say that Rance 1, 2, 4.1, and 4.2 are the playful types. And this story is another of the playful ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nStory<br/>\nAfter fooling around too much and burning through all his funds, Rance reluctantly takes his slave, Sill, and his pet, Athena 2.0, with him on some adventuring work. But while fighting through a dungeon, they get lost in the caves and can't find any way out... After some trouble, they eventually arrive at a mysterious castle inhabited by youkai...<br/>\n \nRance VI - Collapse of Zeth\nSome time after Rance 5D, Rance has once again spent all his money and taken a job in the magical Kingdom of Zeth with his mage slave, Sill. In Zeth, however, mages are considered superior and non-mages are treated as 2nd class citizens, sparking events that lead to Rance's confinement. What appears to be a prosperous nation is, in reality, rife with poverty and oppression against all who can't use magic. Annoyed that such discrimination would target himself, Rance joins a resistance group and helps their efforts to lead Zeth to a revolution. And so, under the pretense of liberating the public, Rance's adventure full of punishing evil mages, making a harem from his female allies, and having tons of sex begins...<br/>\n<br/>\nGameplay<br/>\nRance VI is a first person 3D dungeon crawler RPG. There are over thirty distinct dungeons littered with different events. From a wide cast of characters, you form six person combat parties to explore and fight. Party members can be freely switched in and out, but each battle costs a member one SP, and when they run out of SP, they're unavailable until after you've left the dungeon. When not adventuring, most events are triggered from the Base Screen. Events cost orbs that can be acquired in dungeons and include everything from conversations with allies, to sex, to gaining new skills.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T06:47:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f6/4f6536dc8e18bbb3977a9df8ccee16df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 359, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alicesoft"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["MangaGamer"], "esrb_rating": null}
