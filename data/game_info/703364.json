This is a super early prototype and I hope entering it here will get some eyes on it because\u00a0https://twitter.com/ArtThrax\u00a0 worked really hard on the art.</p>\n<p>So far enemy AI and Player attacks work but neither a victory or a defeat state has been implemented yet.\u00a0There's also a couple of enemy animations missing.</p>\n<p>Both the shop and deck edit mode\u00a0are working if you want to play around in them.\u00a0To enter deck edit mode, press W/Triangle button in the HUB, and leave either scene with the D button. While in either shop or deck edit, you can press W/Triangle button to Sort the cards in your deck/inventory.</p>\n\n<p>RULES</p>\n<p>Move your character through your 3x3 grid with the arrow keys/d-pad to avoid enemy fire. Use your spell cards with the A/S/D keys to deal damage. Higher number means higher damage.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As you use spells, your clothes will vanish which will lower your defense. Try using the Q Key/Left shoulder button to charge up your MP.\u00a0You won't be able to move as you do it but it's a necessary risk to keep attacking. Good news is that the enemy follows the same rules and they will also need to recharge every once in a while.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If your cards are all flashing white, press the W key to use a combo attack, which will use most of your\u00a0MP.</p>\n\n\n<p>CONTROLS</p>\n<p>Arrows / D-Pad\u00a0= Move character, move cursor</p>\n<p>Enter/ Start Button\u00a0= Pause/Confirm/Proceed dialogue/Buy</p>\n<p>Keyboard\u00a0A /Square Button/X Button\u00a0= left card/Proceed dialogue/Buy</p>\n<p>Keyboard S /Triangle Button/Y \u00a0Button\u00a0= middle card/shuffle card</p>\n<p>Keyboard D/\u00a0Circle Button/\u00a0B Button = right card/cancel/return</p>\n<p>Keyboard Q/Left Shoulder Button = Charge up MP/regenerate clothes</p>\n<p>Keyboard W/ R1 Button/ Right Shoulder Button\u00a0= Activate combo when cards flash</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T09:00:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0d/b0d3b7a5fbf19ec0963dc1e6250f4db9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["joakkar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
