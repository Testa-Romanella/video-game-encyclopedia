Feedback is very welcome, especially about the character creator or any bugs. </p>\n<p>My plan is to start by creating a largely linear adaptation of the original novel, where choices have only minor effects. But once I have a playable game, I'm intending to keep adding extra features until I run out of steam. </p>\n<p>Planned initial features:</p>\n<ul><li>A setting/plot which largely matches the original novel, but with the overt sexism and homophobia sanded off to create room for non-m/f relationships and non-binary characters. </li><li>Minor branching, maybe some short bad ends etc.</li><li>Redrawn art: the current sprites are placeholders, and the backgrounds are from my other game, Northanger Abbey.</li><li>More intuitive user interface.</li></ul>\n<p>Possible extra features:</p>\n<ul><li>More significant branching, with multiple love interests (probably Caroline Bingley, Charlotte Lucas, and Captain Fitzwilliam), and at least one happy ending with no romance or marriage. \u00a0</li><li>Extra Setting: A more obviously anachronistic lack of sexism/homophobia, changing the genders of some characters to be non binary and/or in non-m/f relationships etc. </li><li>Extra setting: Roughly historically accurate levels of sexism/homophobia, with notable effects if you make different gender etc choices. </li></ul>\n<p>Known issues:</p>\n<ul><li>the colour choose screen wiggles sometimes</li><li>self-voicing/image descriptions have not been done at all, it'll be basically unplayable right now, sorry</li><li>the text size choice is weird in the preferences menu at the start of a new game</li><li>some of the procedurally generated eye and hair colours look off</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T15:28:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/576/5766725f17126d1f1fc5b5007694cc4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spiral Atlas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
