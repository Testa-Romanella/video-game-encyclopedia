Strongly inspired by Dwarf Fortress and Rimworld (with a hint of Space Station 13). Where the complexity of a simulation game blends with the friendly and satisfying nature of a Real-Time-Strategy game.<br/></p>\r\n\u00a0\r\n<p>Meeple are simple creatures. They're not human, nor are they incredibly intelligent. They're a race of space fairing creatures who enjoy industry, work, and exploration. But they need a lot of guidance, YOUR guidance, in fact.</p>\r\n\u00a0\r\n<p>They come in various shapes, sizes and colours. And each Meeple has their own role, so you'll need to recruit the ones best suited for the jobs you need. Miners, engineers, refiners, janitors, guards or lab workers, there are plenty of jobs to be done.</p>\r\n\u00a0\r\n<p>\u00a0Meeple are very fragile creatures, and if not taken care of properly, can be prone to any number of possible fatalities. If you're not careful, they could easily fall victim to starvation, suffocation, implosion, explosion, decapitation, electrification, incineration or just unlucky enough to get sucked out of an airlock or gobbled up by an alien.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0There is a wide range of paraphernalia for a space station. From simple furniture, like bedding and seating, to complex machinery, life support and power grids. You choose where and how to build it all, and your Meeple will have to adjust to your changes.</p>\r\n\u00a0\r\n<p>\u00a0You will also be responsible for rigging up the main power grid, making sure everything is plugged in, and that you are creating enough power to keep everything alive!</p>\r\n\u00a0\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0You don't control individual Meeple, your role is to give them orders and create designations. They will always do their best to follow through on the jobs you create, unless of course they're being pursued by a giant electric man-eating space squid... although they may still attempt it.</p>\r\n\u00a0\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Space is a dangerous place, putting aside natural disasters, solar flares and stray meteors, you also need to worry about pirates!</p>\n<p>\u00a0Meeple pirates are bent on destruction, they simply want nothing more than annihilation of everything non-pirate. That includes you and your Meeple!</p>\n<p>\u00a0If there are pirates near your station, they wont be able to resist the chance to create havoc. Defend yourself with trained Meeple, and combat turrets, otherwise your station will soon be a floating assortment of scrap, like these GIFS.</p>\n\n<p>A bustling station will bring in a lot of trade and commerce, traders will fly in from all over the quadrant to dock at your station. Which is fortunately very lucrative for you!</p>\r\n\u00a0\r\n<p>There are also plenty of resources just floating around. You can order your mining crew to get out there and salvage it. You can then refine the minerals you collect to construct and develop new components for your station.</p>\r\n\u00a0\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n\u00a0\r\n<p>The quadrant is enormous, and there are plenty of resources to be found and strange species to be discovered. Build a hangar bay, and see what mystery awaits!</p>\n<p>Undertake a campaign, building difficult stations and meet pressing deadlines. Or sit back, relax and run your own little station, at your own pace, moving around the quadrant, exploring nearby planets and being a centre for trade and commerce.</p>\n<p>Meeple Station was birthed from the love of two genres. Good ol' RTS games, like Age of Empires and Starcraft, and the complex simulation genre, like Dwarf Fortress and Rimworld.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:26:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/536/53611f43be72c84b69f900e1fefdbf23.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 233, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Vox Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
