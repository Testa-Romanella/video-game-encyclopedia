You have 10 life points that you will lose if you do not succeed in destroying the enemy ships before they leave your screen. Carriers deliver their goods each time they exit the screen, which raises the delivery bar. Once the bar is complete you have won, if you lose all your life before the bar is complete you have lost. Enemies will speed up every time you destroy them, and if you destroy an allied carrier, you will lose a life and the delivery bar will decrease. Enemy ships have different hit points, but allied ships only have one hit point.<br/></p>\n<p>Sound effects will be added soon !</p>\n<p>Controls :<br/>Left click : Fire<br/>Right click : Reload<br/>Escape : Pause</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T03:46:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75c/75cf87ec64c538a74abb92ebcaa80998.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Antstar609"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
