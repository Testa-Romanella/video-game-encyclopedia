The theme was \"From the outside looking in, it's hard to understand.\" I made the game solo.<br/></p>\n<p>I made a simple\u00a0 2d bullet hell type spaceship game,\u00a0but I\u00a0added a 3d\u00a0 cube with colour filters on them.. The result is that you can't see all the different bullets at the same time.. you can rotate the box around to change your limitation, but you will always have one.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0Bullets<br/></p>\n<p>Red bullets are bad they take life.</p>\n<p>Green bullets are good the give life.</p>\n<p>Blue bullets are good they give 20 points.</p>\n\n<p>There are 3 levels each has a required points needed:</p>\n<p>level 1 - 200 points</p>\n<p>level 2 - 500 points</p>\n<p>level 3 - 1200\u00a0 points</p>\n\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>The Cube is rotated clockwise and counterclockwise on its own axis with q/a, w/s, e/d keys.
