{"id": 627838, "slug": "time-never-stops", "name": "Time never stops", "name_original": "Time never stops", "description": "<p>In this fast-paced platformer, you'll move through three distinct 'Acts', completing each of the levels in, (hopefully), under ten seconds! These acts include: [Colorful Caverns, Cloudy Mountains, and Danger City]!<br/><br/>Currently, the game only features these three acts although I plan on adding more smaller 'challenge' levels, that have their own self-contained, yet equally fitting theme to them. When\u00a0I finish this I'll also add a proper level selection screen, separate from the act select screen seen in the current build!</p>\n<p><strong>Game by SplendidDog</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Music by\u00a0Russell Hodges</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Created using:</strong><br/></em></p>\n<p>The GODOT game engine - General game development</p>\n<p>Aseprite - Art<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T05:18:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8c/e8c71a2f212182258a49c2d280e2a24e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["SplendidDog"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
