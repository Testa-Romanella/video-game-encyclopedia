Check it out!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I suppose I'll leave this up for now in case anyone is interested. There's some ideas in this game that I'd love to come back to one day but I think the scope was a little too much.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Terminal Dominions </strong>is a single-player star system management sim and/or real-time strategy game currently undergoing a free public Alpha phase. Feedback and support are greatly appreciated at this stage.</p>\n<p>The game plays out on one solar system map at a time, getting a little more complex and difficult each time you migrate or escape to a new system.</p>\n<p>There is an in-game manual and tutorial to hopefully help new players, but be aware that the materials are not always up to date these days. </p>\n<p>Please ask any questions you have about strategies for 'winning'. I assure you there are ways to survive for a fairly long time and I hope that I haven't made it too hard to find them.</p>\n<p>Game is best experienced in Fullscreen (Toggle it in the Settings menu, not with Alt + Enter. Will fix this in the future.)</p>\n<p>That's the short of it...
