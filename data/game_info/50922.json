{"id": 50922, "slug": "void-link", "name": "void LINK", "name_original": "void LINK", "description": "void LINK brings the charm of early days RTS gameplay to high-end VR: Using both arms players direct ships through <strong>volumetric</strong> sectors of toy-box interstellar space, gathering resources, building their fleet and going to battle against rivals.<br/><br/>With its <strong>simple </strong>user interface and mechanics this game allows for <strong>instant casual play</strong>, where strategic complexity arises from your ingenuity, rather than from extensive rulesets or tech-trees. <br/><br/>void LINK is one of the first products to build on the unique strength of modern VR peripherals (HTC Vive, Oculus Rift) to make RTS interaction with \"deep maps\", truely <strong>3-dimensional battlegrounds</strong>, headache-free by letting you devise your strategies in 3D space simply by pointing them out with your hands.<br/><br/>For some optional depth, void LINK comes with a voxel-style editor for creating <strong>custom ships</strong> from basic building blocks (Laser, Propulsion, Sensors, ...). Players can introduce new unit types, even on-the-fly, to adjust their forces for meeting specific opposing fleet makeups, ... or just for the fun of it. <br/><br/><br/>\"Enlisted by an intergalactic mining consortium as one of their many 'Field Coordiators', the player runs resource extraction operations in far-out regions of space. Depending on their remote control interface, 'void LINK', Coordinators find themselves pitted against each other and engaged in series of battle encounters, where winners climb the 'universal' leader board.\"", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:12:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/426/426aa1082286c06500fae7fcddfbf3c7.jpg", "website": "http://www.zentrifuge-games.eu/?page_id=334", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 244, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zentrifuge"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Zentrifuge"], "esrb_rating": null}
