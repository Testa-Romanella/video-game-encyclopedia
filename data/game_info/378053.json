Thankfully, a \"benevolent\" spirit offers you a deal, if you can find all four of his friends scattered around the manor, then you can have your eyes back. This is no easy feat, as without yours eyes, you cannot see a thing, save for the spectres that call the mansion home. Using nothing but your magical glove of echo locating, traverse the dark manor, find some friends and get out of there.</p>\n\n<p>Hello, this is the first proper game that i have made, so be nice pls.</p>\n<p>You control your character\u00a0by commanding your arms to press buttons on your keyboard and move your mouse around. These actions will cause the character in the game to move and echo locate in correspondence with your own movements.</p>\n<p>There are three endings also, see if you can get them all.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-30T04:06:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a36/a3611a3707dd531018dca1fe04cf61b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cheriot"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
