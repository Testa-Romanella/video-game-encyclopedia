This roguelite action adventure game features monstrous toe-to-toe brawling. Like the comics, the game sends Hellboy on a series of vastly different and wholly unique adventures; and while those stories stand on their own, they are all tied to the mysterious legacy of The Butterfly House.</p>\n<p>Built in 1962 by occultist Pasquale Deneveaux, The Butterfly House is more than a mere residence; it\u2019s a gateway. Its perverse angles and non-Euclidean geometries were designed with a singular foul purpose in mind: to open doorways into a terrible and fascinating dimension called The Wyrd.</p>\n<p>Twenty years later, an agent of the B.P.R.D. is sent on a reconnaissance mission to the mansion and promptly goes missing. It\u2019s up to you - Hellboy - and your team of Bureau agents to find your missing colleague and uncover the secrets of The Butterfly House.</p>\n<p>During the investigation, you will explore wondrous and strange planes of existence contained within The Wyrd, each one home to powerful monsters, forgotten godforms, magnificent treasures, and powerful secrets. But be warned, because ancient evil stagnates within the furthest reaches of The Wyrd\u2026 evil that is eager to be let out.</p>\n<p>A graphical style that evokes the original art style of the comics and makes every moment of the game look - and feel - like it was ripped straight from the comic books.</p>\n<p>An unique roguelite Action Adventure with heavy-weight combat. Chain together hard-hitting melee and ranged attacks to fight a diverse array of increasingly nightmarish enemies.</p>\n<p>A narrative true to the spirit of the comics, tying together several independent stories into one unified Hellboy experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-18T13:33:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/0f2/0f2b65267089c1c5d4fc5f08934a8b06.jpg", "website": "http://hellboywebofwyrd.com/", "rating": 2.17, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 8, "owned": 14, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 18, "dropped": 10, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 20, "ratings_count": 11, "suggestions_count": 244, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 12, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox Series S/X", "PlayStation 5"], "developers": ["Upstream Arcade"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Good Shepherd Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
