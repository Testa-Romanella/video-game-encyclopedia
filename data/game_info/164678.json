The game was\u00a0made for a exhibition in the college on\u00a0based around Stanley Kubrick \"Space odyssey\u00a02001\". The intention of the game was to give a glimpse of Hal's life as an AI, controlling the ship and dealing with the demands of the crew.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Designed with a simplistic minimalist style inspired by Stanley Kubrick work. Will take influence for the game mechanics from games such as \"Faster Than Light\" and \"Gods Will be Watching\".
