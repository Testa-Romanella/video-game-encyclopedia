{"id": 383551, "slug": "future-snooker", "name": "Future Snooker", "name_original": "Future Snooker", "description": "Future Snooker is a futuristic and dynamic variation of snooker. Players take turns to fire a glassy cue-ball at a cluster of balls on a circular snooker table. Take turns to knock out red, colour, red, colour, just as in normal snooker, then pot the colours in the correct order to score the most points and win. A mix of tactics and skill, the bat is locked to the place where the cue-ball ends, allowing players to play safe, create snookers, and play tactically.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlay against a choice of computer opponents on a choice of table designs, or play against a friend on your PC. You can also compete in a 6-player tournament, and any player can be human or computer.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nControl the game using mouse or keyboard or an X-Box style game controller.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-18T02:32:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd5/cd5898987453c079a44a9eb01b8cef42.jpg", "website": "http://www.cornutopia.net", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cornutopia Software"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Cornutopia Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
