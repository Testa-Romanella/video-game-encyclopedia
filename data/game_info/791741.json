This drives him crazy and makes him paranoid by making him believe that he is being persecuted...<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sigmund is used to solving his patients' crises, but this time he will have to help himself dig deep inside himself and understand the real reason for his paranoia.<br/>Fortunately, or unfortunately, you came to his office right in the middle of his crisis. <br/>Thanks to you, Freud may be able to overcome it... <br/>Because of you, Freud may never get out of it.<br/><br/><br/>Psychoanalyse Freud's patients and explore their unconscious, to discover their hidden dreams, their obsessions, as well as the causes of their sexual disturbances.<br/>Thanks to your help they could finally heal\u2026 <br/>Because of your mistakes, they could collapse into a whirlwind of pain.<br/><br/><br/><br/>By helping Freud treat his patients, you will analyze their troubled minds.

The three agents are theoretical constructs that describe the activities and interactions of the mental life of a person.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Id</strong> (represents instinct) - the hungry minotaur:<br/>The Id is entirely unconscious, is the only component of personality that is present from birth. It is the source of all psychic energy and obtains pleasure unconditionally.<br/><br/><strong>Superego</strong> (represents morality) - the merciless general:<br/>The Superego assimilates social laws and, through them, a sense of guilt. Punishes the ego when it decides to transgress the rules which Id craves.<br/><br/><strong>Ego</strong> (represents reality) - a puppet that aspires to freedom:<br/>The ego is the center of consciousness. Constantly subjected to the demands of the Id and the pressing reproaches of the superego, while being forced to deal with reality.<br/><br/><br/>Fortuna \"Axel Fox\" Imperatore worked in a cleaning company while completing her studies in Psychology and Philosophy. <br/>Obsessed by her love of video games and psychoanalysis, she decided to put her mantra into practice: \"Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish\" and combine her greatest passions into a project, Freud's Bones which was born from a rickety old laptop and through a myriad of adventures.<br/>In 2020, the Kickstarter campaign tripled its goal, raising \u20ac15,500 from all over the world.
