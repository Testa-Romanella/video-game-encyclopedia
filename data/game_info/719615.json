Also, feel free to try out all the choices, after all, we didn't work for you to only see half of the game!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOur bossfights always have a unique element which you need to figure out, else they are quite hard to beat, though not impossible. Except for the first boss, that one's easier since we wanted to lull you all into a false sense of security. Wait...<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhile the game is sort of linear, the three areas of the game all have lots of characters who you can interact with. Especially the last one, that city's so big you'll probably get lost in it at first. Which is okay, since we stuffed it full of interesting stuff. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you have any suggestions or criticism, feel free to post in our Discussion Forum! Go easy on us though, this is our first proper game. Coming soon to Steam in English!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHungarian language update is coming in January 15th at the latest.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMinor balance changes and some extra finishing touches on the Hungarian language contents still coming in a couple days.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAlso, for suggestions, or if you just loved the game, feel free to check out our Discord server for the game! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nLink: https://discord.gg/9t6KpfKssx", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T03:02:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53d/53db1a73024fdcc76f2208b94c654f6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 326, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Valyutechnik"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Valyutechnik"], "esrb_rating": null}
